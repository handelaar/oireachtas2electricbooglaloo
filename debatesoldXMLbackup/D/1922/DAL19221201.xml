      <P>To ask the Minister for Finance whether, in the case of the boy, John O'Donovan, Blossom Grove, Knockraha, Cork, who lost his right hand in February, 1921, as a result of very severe injuries he received, having innocently handled some explosive substance which he picked up after the British Military had left the district only a short time, the Minister is prepared to make some suitable allowance out of Public Funds which would provide the boy with an artificial hand, and otherwise fit him out for some suitable work in life, his poor parents not being in a position to do so, having already lost all their scanty means during the boy's illness.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Agriculture what steps the Government are taking, or intend to take, to compel owners of cut-away woods to replant the areas cut away, particularly areas cleared since the outbreak of the World War; and further in view of the great asset timber is to the Nation, what action the Government propose taking if it is not intended to compel owners to plant.</P>

      <P>There is no provision in the existing law for compelling owners to replant land on which timber has been cut either since the outbreak of the European war in 1914 or previously.  Any legislation introduced to grant the Government powers to enforce replanting could not be made retrospective without injustice to owners who may have leased or sold the land on which the timber stood, or who may have devoted it to other purposes.  The Government are at present considering the issue of a Forestry Decree forbidding the felling of timber except under licence from the Forestry Branch, and it is proposed that such licences will not be granted unless the owner undertakes to replant within a reasonable time, except in those cases in which replanting is clearly unnecessary or is not conducive to the public interest.  I may say that, as far as their own properties are concerned, the Government are doing all that is possible to promote afforestation not only by actual planting, but also by the maintenance of nurseries for raising young plants for distribution throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I think there is nothing so well illustrates the abnormal condition in which this country is in at the present time than that we should be called upon to pass Estimates for Public Education which are not more than half that which is spent on the Army.  It is rather strange also, and it illustrates the peculiar position which education occupies in this country, that the provision for education in various forms is made under, I think, four separate Votes.  With regard to the administration generally, I quite recognise that, as the Minister for Agriculture said <Col N="2550" /> of his own Department a few days ago, all they could do up to the present, in any case since they took over from the British Authorities, was to carry on.  And I think it is only fair to say that they have carried on in the circumstances, in my opinion, extremely well.  They brought a new spirit into the administration.  I think the Ministry as a whole and its Chief Executive Officers are deserving of congratulation on that account.  Because they have recognised that successful administration depends very largely on the creation of a spirit of confidence and a spirit of co-operation between those who are carrying on the work and the administration; and, as I say, I am happy to be in a position to congratulate them that as far as it is possible to do it they are doing that.  Now it would take a very long time indeed to draw attention to the many things that one would wish to raise on this Vote.  I quite recognise that many of the points that might be raised would rather refer to what we would like to see done in the future by way of legislation.  I must confine myself, therefore, to what I might call a few of the most pressing and urgent matters that might, in my opinion at least, be dealt with by the present administration.  In the first place I would like to draw their special attention to the question which has been very much neglected&mdash;the proper maintenance and equipment of the schoolrooms and school buildings.  No provision, or practically little provision, has been made in the past, and very little, if any, has been made in the present Estimate in order to meet this very great necessity.  We know that very many school buildings through the country&mdash;I am speaking now especially of the rural parts of the country, because comparatively speaking the buildings in the towns and cities are very much better&mdash;but in the country we know that there are hundreds of these school buildings which are not at all suitable for the purpose of schoolrooms, and from their actual construction, their plans, and especially the sanitation, or rather the want of sanitation, they are in many cases sources of danger to the health of the children who attend them and who have to spend a very great portion of their daily lives there.  No proper provision has been <Col N="2551" /> made for the heating of those rooms.  It is left in many cases very largely to chance.  A certain amount is voted from the State.  It would average, on the whole, I think, something less than £3 per school all over Ireland.  That is a totally inadequate sum.  The school managers have to provide an equal sum before this amount is voted, or can be given to them.  The total sum is altogether inadequate to meet the purpose for which it is intended.  The result is that many of our schools are very badly heated during the winter months.  Now, as to the maintenance, we know that unless a school manager can provide through voluntary effort in his parish, subscriptions to meet the ordinary running repairs, and the ordinary wear and tear and upkeep of the schoolrooms, there are no repairs done.  I think it is an unfair burden to put on the school managers to expect that they will raise the sums necessary through voluntary effort.  I think it is admitted pretty generally that the system has broken down. Then, as to cleaning, the daily cleaning especially, there is a practice in very many parts of the country districts &mdash;and it ought to be stopped at the earliest possible moment&mdash;that is the practice of having the schoolrooms and the classrooms swept out in the evening by the children.  They are expected to remain in after school is over, when they are hungry and tired after their day, to sweep out the schoolrooms, and in hundreds of our schools this is the only provision that is made for the sweeping of the schools.  Now, that is a question I would like to see the Ministry take up at once, and they are, I believe, in a position to deal with it&mdash;not, perhaps, without legislation could they deal with it to the extent we would wish, but still they could remedy it to some extent. There is a matter which would be perhaps hardly pertinent in this Vote, but it is a pity that some attempt was not made to make a grant in this direction, a grant for the provision in necessitous areas for books for school children.  We know that in many areas on the western seaboard especially, the parents of the children are totally unable to provide the sums necessary for the purchase of school books, and they either have to go without them or they have to be supplied with them sometimes by the teacher and sometimes by the manager. <Col N="2552" /> Anyone who knows anything about school work knows that no successful work can be done under conditions of that kind.  There is another point; it will probably be new to many Deputies here to know&mdash;this was mentioned, I think, during an earlier discussion by Deputy Professor Magennis&mdash;that many teachers are dependent for their position on the average number who attend the school, and assistant teachers are very often thrown out of their position through circumstances over which they have no control whatsoever.  There may be a bad spell of weather; there may be circumstances such as we have at present in the country, or other various causes; there may be a movement or a shifting of the population of the district, and the result of it is that the average goes below a certain figure and the assistant has to go.  It does not matter how efficient that assistant teacher may be; it does not matter what his experience is or what his age may be.  He is thrown absolutely on the road, and has to seek another position in competition with people who have come into the service later, and people who are leaving the training colleges. I think that is a very great defect indeed, a very great grievance indeed, and I would strongly urge that some arrangement ought to be made whereby, if the attendance in a certain school goes below the figure which would warrant the continuance of the teacher, that teacher should be continued in the service and should have the first preference to a vacancy in another school or another district, just as is done in other branches of the public service.  I am sorry that another year has practically gone by and that the Ministry has not tackled the question, which has so often been put before them, of making provision for the better training of teachers.  We have repeatedly asked that teachers should have the benefit of University training. We have universities, excellent universities, in this country.  The people pay for these through rates, in some cases, and through the ordinary taxes, but the vast majority of the people do not derive any direct benefit, cannot derive any direct benefit, and the only way, the best way, that the ordinary person in the country can get the benefit of the universities is indirectly through the teachers. <Col N="2553" /> We think that every teacher ought to have the benefit of a University course of training, and, as I say, I regret that the question has not been tackled more seriously, and I hope that it will not be long until it is tackled. There is another matter which I would recommend for the consideration of the Ministry, and it is a matter, I think, that they have in their own hands very largely.  I believe it is a matter on which economy and efficiency can be secured, and that is the amalgamation of a very large number of the small schools, which are all through the country.  It is an exceedingly anomalous thing, to my mind, to see side by side, dotted all over the country, separate boys' schools and girls' schools run as separate institutions, and I could name several little towns of small population where there are two or three, or even four, little schools.  I think the Ministry ought to take their courage in their hands and go in for a wholesale scheme of amalgamation on sound lines.  These schools would be more efficient and would be worked more economically if they were amalgamated into central schools.  I said at the beginning that, generally speaking, the present administration was carrying on to the best of its ability, but there is just one matter I would like to draw their attention to, and that is the many complaints that have been made from time to time with regard to delays in sending out payments.  I know and I fully appreciate their very great difficulties owing to the dislocation of communications in the country and the postal dislocation in many places, but I think this is a difficulty which they have inherited, and it is only right to say that they are blamed with the sins or the neglect of their predecessors.  I understand, at least I was told, that some time ago, by the older regime, that they had found very great difficulty in getting the staff that they thought they should get from the Government.  I do not know whether that is the difficulty still, but if it is, then it certainly raises the point which I raised a few evenings ago when the Estimates for the Ministry of Finance were under consideration; and I think, if it is found that the want of sufficient staff is the cause of many complaints in this direction, that such a staff as the Minister thinks is necessary for the running of his office ought to be put at its disposal.</P>

      <P>These Estimates for National Education present what I may figuratively describe as a &ldquo;far flung battle line.&rdquo;  To engage them at every point would require not minutes but hours and days, and, consequently, I shall restrain my zeal and try to concentrate on what I regard as the central position, and that is the Training Colleges. I think we are all agreed the Ministry of Education on the one hand, and the Deputy who has just spoken on the other, that whatever reforms may be instituted or be attempted in regard to the construction of a great National system of popular education, we must create efficient Training Colleges, and give them all the facilities and all the favourable conditions that are required, that they should function properly.  Now, at the present time and for a great number of years a difficulty has been that the Training Colleges, with the exception of that managed by the National Board in Marlborough Street, are denominational colleges.  What I have just said might be interpreted as an expression of regret that they are denominational. What I mean is that because they were so they have the status of private enterprise. They are described here officially as under private management and licensed for students according to certain figures.  The late National Board&mdash;it is not late in all accuracy, as it still exists in a sort of suspended animation&mdash;but for all practical purposes of administration it is the late National Board, and its constant difficulty was that it had no authority whatever to order the heads of the Training Colleges to do anything.  It could only recommend.  An hour before it ceased to operate it had gone almost to the length of threatening these Training Colleges.  Now it is well that the members of the Dáil should understand what the position is, and they can be made aware of it through understanding the details set out at the bottom of page 6 of the official Estimate.  There is a temptation here to be egotistic, and I will resist the temptation yielding to it only to the extent to say that I am responsible&mdash;if not altogether, in a large measure&mdash;for the carrying on of the agitation and the completion of it, in so far that it is in any sense now completed&mdash; for the securing of larger grants in aid of the Training Colleges.  In earlier years there was a grant of £50 each year to the denominational Training Colleges for each <Col N="2555" /> man student in Training, and £35 for each woman student.  During the lean years of the war that miserable contribution was the maximum contribution from the State.  The natural consequence was that these institutions ran into debt, as the cost of living increased and the contribution remained stationary.  Repairs to the buildings were out of the question.  Bonuses to the professors and the teaching staff of the Training Colleges were not thought of by anyone, except now and then, perhaps, by the miserable professor who longed for it.  In one of the Training Colleges, on account of the fearful experience to which they were subject in these lean years, two members of the staff went mad.  It is no laughing matter when I tell you one of them died in the Lunatic Asylum, and one of them recovered for a period and then died.  There would be more sympathy, I know, if I were talking about the best way of raising mangold wurzels, but because I am talking about the best way to provide a proper scheme of education, which is the basis of the whole National life and its future prosperity, that is to be treated with derision.  The National Board was approached, it took the matter in hand and it succeeded in securing from the Treasury this larger additional grant.  It was held, and I have no hesitation in saying rightly held, that inasmuch as increased salaries were now being paid and a much higher rate of remuneration given to the National school teacher, it is only right that as the introduction to other professions has to be paid for by the aspirants to them that those who sought this fairly remunerative occupation of National school teacher should contribute in part towards the cost of their education and training, and consequently this arrangement set out on page 6 of the Estimates was arrived at, that in proportion to the amount paid by the teacher in training to the College, the State would advance a certain additional amount.  Now the primary purpose for which this additional grant was made was to enable the Training Colleges to give a better salary to the teaching staff, and at the moment that the Provisional Government suspended the operations of the National Board it was engaged in the reform of the Training Colleges upon these necessary lines of insisting upon a proper scale of salary and a proper recognition <Col N="2556" /> of the status of the members of the teaching staff engaged under it. It was not possible for the National Board to call upon the administration of the Training Colleges to pay according to these scales.  They could merely recommend, with the added threat, that if the Principals of the Colleges continued to refuse to apply sums of money in that direction, it would be the duty of the National Board to inform the Treasury that an honourable understanding entered into could not be carried out; or in other words, to give an intimidatory warning that the Board could not press the Treasury for these grants unless the Heads of the Colleges were willing to expend them in the proper way.  Now, the situation at the present moment is that in these Training Colleges, and more particularly in the Church of Ireland College, a great step has been taken in advance.  The teaching staff have received remuneration on something of a scale commensurate with their standing and the importance of their duties, though it falls short, and considerably short, of the scale recommended by the National Board.  But in the college to which I particularly refer a great reform has been made of putting it in vital contact with the University of Dublin, so that the teachers undergoing training in the Church of Ireland College in Kildare Place are, for every year they spend in training, advancing towards a degree of Dublin University.  That is a reform we have sought to bring about through the agency of the National University. I took the first step in regard to it nearly twelve years ago, and we are still taking the first step.  There has been practically very little advance until within the last month.  The National University set up a Committee to deal with this question, because the University is empowered by its Charter to deal with the training of teachers and the inspection of schools.  A deputation was received by that Committee from the distinguished and experienced body of which Deputy O'Connell is representative. The representations made by the Central Executive of the National School Teachers' Committee, the representations made by the Association of Professors of the Training Colleges, and the representations made by Convocation of the National University were all in agreement. There was practical unanimity as regards <Col N="2557" /> the reform required, and that was to secure intimate co-operation between the University centres of the National University&mdash;Dublin, Galway, and Cork&mdash; and the Training Colleges for the National School teachers.  These suggestions will be submitted at the next meeting of the Senate of the National University, and I have no doubt whatever that the Senate will confirm the wishes of the Board of Studies in this regard.  This is a very long story, and I am not, unfortunately, relieving it of any of its tediousness, but it is most important, at least in the conception of those of us interested in educational reform, who think that the situation is one that should be thoroughly understood. An estimate has to be made as to the number of teachers who may undergo training and who can be absorbed by the schools.  Otherwise we shall become merely trainers of teachers to be exported to other countries.  That has been the case to some extent for a long time past.  We train more teachers in the training colleges than we are able to provide places for in Ireland, and the best of our products have gone to better-paid places, fortunately for them, in Great Britain and in the Colonies.  Now, one of the tasks awaiting the Minister for Education is to make a more accurate estimate of the number of teachers to be trained, and, above all, to secure from the Minister for Finance the funds requisite to bear the enormous cost &mdash;for it is bound to be an enormous cost&mdash;of carrying through reform for these educational objects we are so anxious to promote.  The reform is that the teacher should go through two years of training in a Training College under its professors, and following the programme recognised by the University, so that at the end of the two years the teacher shall have satisfied the special Educational Authority as regards ability to teach the subjects in the primary schools, and has satisfied the University authorities as regards progress and efficiency in the cultural as distinct from vocational subjects&mdash;subjects that go to qualify for a Degree&mdash;so that on leaving the College the matriculated student could be regarded as through the first year's University examination, and would have then merely to attend for two years at the University College to take out his Degree. This keeps the teacher out of occupation <Col N="2558" /> for two years, and furthermore the fees and the other expenses must be met, and could not possibly in either case be met by the teacher himself, and so local Scholarships&mdash;either County Council Scholarships, or private Scholarships, along with Scholarships available at the University must go to the assistance of the students in passing to a Degree.  How much that will cost I could not suggest, but what I am anxious about is that the Irish public should realise that no matter what be the cost the expenditure will be right, and it will be one of the best National investments to which the taxes of the people could possibly be put.  There are other items in this which I will deal with later on as I understand I am allowed to speak on another occasion.</P>

      <P>I have listened with great pleasure to much of what has been said by the two Deputies who spoke previously, and I agree with nearly all the opinions to which they gave expression.  Personally I think Deputy Professor Magennis is absolutely correct when he said that it was in our treatment of the Training College lay the way of getting at the root of altering or improving our system of Primary Education in Ireland.  &ldquo;Rome was not built in a day,&rdquo; and, as he said, there are many things in connection with the system that might be raised in those Estimates for Primary Education, but I think the best way to begin is to make sure that in our Training Colleges the best possible measures are taken to provide for teachers, who in their work through the country will thus be able to carry on the methods we shall lay down.  I would like to modify one word of what Deputy Magennis said.  He referred to our creation of Training Colleges.  I would like to suggest rather that under the difficulties that had been faced our Training Colleges had in the past done exceedingly good work, but they were handicapped by the insufficiency of the grants they received.  Owing to the backing they got from the National Board the State Grants they received were very substantially increased, and increased in a good way, namely, the State Grants were accompanied by contributions from the individuals getting trained, and that, with the additional help those increased grants <Col N="2559" /> will provide them, we may confidently look to the work being still further improved in the future, but the point I want particularly to refer to is the connection with the Universities to which both speakers made reference.  I think it is impossible to over-estimate what the importance of that may be. It is bound at any rate to widen the outlook of the trained teacher, and when he comes into contact with the children through the country he has, as a result, a widened outlook.  I am happy that the University which I have the honour to represent has been the pioneer here in this movement.  The measure to which Deputy Magennis has referred is already in operation with, I am happy to say, every sign of its successful working. The great advantage is that whilst the teacher is in course of training he will be brought into the position of having nearly half completed his University course, and we hope that at the conclusion of those two years numbers of them will be able to complete their University course and obtain a University degree.  I do not want to trench on the subject of our next Vote, but I think we are in the happy position in this Vote of having advanced a good way towards putting the national teacher in a position in which he may be able to carry on his work without, at any rate, undue financial strain.  It is impossible for any teacher&mdash;I may go further and say for anyone&mdash;to carry on his work efficiently if he has to carry it on under the burden of keeping the wolf away from the door.  The National teacher had that burden for years. We are glad to observe that that difficulty for them has been largely got over. I mention that merely now as an introduction to what might be said at a later stage.  One other point I would like to refer to before I sit down.  It is somewhat connected in a secondary way with the last remark.  If the teacher cannot carry out his work under more or less relieved conditions, how can you expect the child to benefit?  In many of our poor districts it is impossible.  The local conditions should enable the children to be taught under conditions of comparative comfort.  How can we expect them to benefit by the education we offer if they have to obtain it when suffering from cold?  I should like strongly to support <Col N="2560" /> what Deputy O'Connell said in that connection. If we offer education, it is no use to offer it in such a way that the child cannot take advantage of it.  I am confident, at the same time when the Government are able to settle down to deal with those problems properly, that they will not be adverse to dealing with that really pressing condition in many parts of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor WILLIAM MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Another point about which I should like to speak is the provision of continuation schools.  The Dáil will realise that the <Col N="2561" /> only education which the children of the working men, as a rule, receive is whatever is provided to them for a very few years during a comparatively small part of their youth, and that has been of such a nature up to recent years that it has consisted largely, not in education, but in mere instruction.  They have learned, for example, interesting facts, such as the length of the Yang-tse-Kiang or the population of Hong Kong, or something about the lumber trade of Canada, but the development and the training of their capacity to think, the cultivation of their imagination, a training to assist them in the providing of a way of life later on that will be distinctively human&mdash;these things have been neglected, and that was largely because of the mechanical conception of education that prevailed amongst members of the Boards that were in charge of so-called education, and largely also because of the method of inspecting schools.  The grants from which the National school teacher was paid had to be parcelled out in quantities, and to enable that to be done easily and effectually you had payment by results.  To make the proper substitute for that you require to have an adequate system of inspection and the Inspectors for this purpose require to be no ordinary men&mdash;not merely men that had passed with high honours in the University Degree Examinations, but men who, by their temperament and by their training, and by all their personality, are enthusiasts for education, and who can enter sympathetically into the work of the teacher in out-of-the-way localities, in difficult situations, where the conditions are all adverse, and be able to give encouragement and advice. That is part of our ideal, but practice falls short of ideals, and no matter what we do, it would be impossible, even under more perfect day schools of the future, that during the short number of years in which the students are present they could lay anything like a proper foundation or get anything like real education.  It is necessary, therefore, that we should take measures to secure that even when they have become wage-earners something should be done to promote continuation of their education and to put them in the way of mental development.  We have often heard it quoted, &ldquo;Not by bread alone doth man live.&rdquo;  There is the ordinary view that the common man ought to <Col N="2562" /> be satisfied with his day's work, if he has steady employment, and with ordinary rate of remuneration, and that tobacco, and perhaps the &ldquo;pictures&rdquo; as they are called, will be sufficient recreation for him in his off hours.  We talk a great deal about the constructive work we are going to do &mdash;of re-creating the Gaelic state.  I look forward to such a betterment, such humanisation of city life especially, and of life of all labourers and workers, that they shall have opportunities, not for leisure to be passed in a common way, but something that will approach to a cultured leisure, that they shall lead distinctly human lives.  Again I would advocate that this is not an impossible or an unattainable ideal, that it can be approximated to if only we set our hearts upon its attainment.  It will call for expenditure of money.  Again I suggest that everything that makes a good citizen of a good State, that helps to promote happier and higher elevation of living, is money well invested.  Now, Deputy O'Connell spoke of another matter which is very dear to my heart, and I have spoken of it so often that I feel ashamed to recur to it again, and I spoke of it here before, and that is the provision of great central, well-equipped schools, instead of dotting the country with miserable little huts, where sanitation is non-existent in many cases, and where the seeds of disease and future disability are laid rather than the seeds of future personal development.  The late Dr. Starkie told me that in a certain district not very far away from Dublin, in a little village, there were no less than eleven National Schools, and the explanation for that was that denomination A, under a non-denominational system, so-called, demanded to have a school of its own, and there were schools for girls and schools for boys.  But denomination B required the same equality of treatment, with the result that there were actually eleven schools in one centre.  I need hardly tell you that the number of teachers in these schools was so small as to make the teaching, of necessity, inefficient; whereas, for the same outlay of public money it would have been quite possible to set up in that locality a school, or two schools at least, in which you could give them all that was desired. This is part of the denominational difficulty, and it is also a part of another difficulty which I need not go into for the <Col N="2563" /> moment.  There is another question, and that is the heightened cost of books for school children.  Everybody who is a book-buyer&mdash;and particularly those who, like myself, are interested in the production of books&mdash;is well aware of what the enormous cost has become since 1918.  A book which we could have produced for 8d., with a fair margin of profit, could not be produced at the present day for less than 2s. 6d. Hodder &amp; Stoughton declared recently that until the book-buying public became accustomed to paying 15s. for what they paid 6s. recently, it was impossible for publishers to take an author's work and produce it.  Now, many years ago the National Board of unhappy memory, that we were all taught to cast stones at and explosives metaphorically, had a provision by which it subsidised the production of school books.  It was possible in the old, bad days for teachers to write to the Board's offices and obtain pupils' school requisites at reduced cost.  The Board provided the subsidy, and the school children profited thereby.  But then came the Boer War, and the British Treasury required all the cutting down and economies that it could effect, and the school stores of the National Board were closed, and the public were encouraged to believe that a better system was introduced to provide free competition between publishing firms.  I can speak feelingly on this subject from inside, knowing very well that free competition between publishing firms has led to the payment of very respectable dividends.  I know one book publishing firm which had to send books to Scotland and re-ship them from Scotland to Sligo, with the object of reducing the cost of school requisites for children. Now this cost is a thing which has to be faced.  We in our own zeal for educational improvement prescribed the most beautiful programme in which the teacher and student or pupil are introduced to close acquaintance with the great masterpieces of the literature of the past.  The production of these books costs money.  Parents are not always able to buy books.  What is going to be done?  Shall we reduce the number of the schools, and by centralisation be able to provide school libraries?  Shall we come to the assistance of the poor in that way?  I think that is very desirable, and a subsidiary argument in favour of this scheme of reducing the <Col N="2564" /> number of unnecessary schools and expending the money more profitably for the nation on properly equipped and properly staffed schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest there be an impression that the interest in educational questions that comes from these benches may to some minds seem to be an interest mainly in the conditions of teachers, I want to point out that of course that is not so, and not even Deputy O'Connell, who can speak with so much authority on behalf of the teachers, has the teachers' outlook alone.  He has distinctly in his mind the civic needs as well as the teachers' interests.  I was glad to hear Deputy Professor Magennis make the plea for beautification and humanisation and I want to say here that I am not quite sure we are all of one mind on the ideal towards which we should tend with regard to education.  Without being very definite or dogmatic I think there is a tendency in modern times to overstress the necessity for large centralised schools.  On the score of economy it might be desirable, but I want to bear in mind myself, and I think we should try to generally spread the idea, that the school for the young ought to be something like the University for the adult.  That is to say, that it is not the building which makes the school but it is the group under the teacher or master. All that of course leads one to the necessity of encouraging the very best quality of manhood and womanhood to take up the teaching profession.  We might have the very best equipped schools; we might have the perfect material instrument but yet have very bad education and very bad schools.  I want to stress the need for thinking rather of the teacher and master at least primarily, or the teacher and master in his relation to the children, and only secondly in regard to the school and the equipment. But while it is only secondary it is of very great importance.  I would add the plea that we ought to encourage the qualities of beauty in the surroundings of the children, even though it means some deficiency in quantity. Take school books.  It is very necessary that a child should have a sufficiency of books.  I am not in favour of having that sufficiency of books if they are going to be badly printed, and badly turned out and ugly books. <Col N="2565" /> I would much rather see a fewer number of well-printed, well turned-out beautiful books so as to accustom the minds of the children to a desire for better things rather than to have a multitude of badly printed books encouraging them, as they do, to the purchase of the ½d. and the 1d. alleged comic papers. In that respect I think the plain school building might very well be made very much less plain with a very small expenditure, that is to say, a very small expenditure of money but a considerable expenditure of care and interest and thought.  Then there comes the question of the teacher and his relation to his children or her relation to her childen. If we have teachers with some ideas of beauty and culture and taste inculcating those same ideas in the minds of the children, and getting an opportunity in the school life to develop those ideas and apply them, then we can develop a taste and an interest in the more beautiful things.  I do not know how far it is possible within the present educational schemes to experiment in the plans that have been tried in other countries; of the little commune where elder scholars at any rate shall be given practical experimental tuition in civic management, where the children of the school are made responsible for the school republic, where they are made responsible for the inculcation of the practices of Government; where they appoint their own President and their own Executive and administer the law of the school, and generally get some ideas in a playful way, if you like, but taking very seriously as they do, some of the practice of responsible government.  In my reading, this experiment has been very successful indeed.  I hope if it has not already been tried in this country a way will be found for developing that idea in both the primary school and the continuation schools or secondary schools.  That, no doubt, is much more easily accomplished in the smaller schools than in the larger, provided you have the teaching staff in a position to apply those ideas, and, shall I say, if that teaching staff has an opportunity to develop or to be trained and to be enthused with some of those ideas. I think in that respect the training of teachers should not stop at the Training College.  Whether it should be part of the responsibilities of the Educational <Col N="2566" /> Authority or part of the responsibility of the Teachers' Organisation I am not going to say.  Perhaps a voluntary combination of both would be better than either of them.  I would suggest that there should be frequent opportunities given for teachers in counties or large districts for coming together for the purpose of undergoing a course of training in the practical application of these ideas&mdash;the summer school idea, for instance, applied to the development of education on the human side, apart from the more technical and practical. I think there is much room for continuing the training of teachers after they have left the Training College by such means as I suggest, and I would commend to the Minister for Education and to the Teachers' Organisation the establishment of week-end schools for the consideration occasionally during the summer period of educational ideas. They might not be afraid of inviting educationalists and humanists from all parts of the world to come and speak to them and enthuse and inspire them with these educational ideas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILSON</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very dangerous for an outsider to speak on the subject of education where there are so many experts listening.  I have noticed there is one aspect of the educational system that has not been touched upon.  We are an agricultural community, and while the facts that are instilled into children in those primary schools may be very interesting facts, the things which matter in their future life as agriculturists and labourers on the farm are absolutely neglected.  While you may have a boy who can tell the length of the Yang-Tse-Kiang, about which Professor Magennis has been speaking, if you put him into a grass field he cannot tell you the name of one blade of grass in the field.  Bring him along in the seed time, mix the seeds together and he could not tell you Italian rye grass from perennial or scutch or any other variety of grass which we have.  Yet we are supposed to be educating them for the work of this country.  Are not these experts losing sight of a very material point?  I look on this matter just as it strikes myself; there are hundreds of things which we grow in the field and there is not a boy in a school who knows the name of them.  I am not talking <Col N="2567" /> about botany now, but the actual weeds in the farm field.  Bring a boy and ask him what is the name of anything there and he does not know.  Ask a labouring man, and in one district you will get one name and in another district you will get another name.  Part of the education in the primary schools should be directed towards establishing an interest in these things which will mean a living for many of the children in future.  That is a point that has been neglected by these experts.  If we had a revenue of one hundred millions per annum instead of twenty millions&mdash;I hope the Minister for Finance will reduce it to ten millions, because this country cannot afford to pay twenty millions to run it, and bigger countries than this are being run on ten millions&mdash;for the schemes put forward by those learned professors, the amount would not be able to carry them into effect.  It is all very well to say a teacher should be given University education.  The position at the present moment is a good one in the primary schools.  The doctor has to pay for his University education, and the lawyer and the solicitor have to pay also. The teacher should contribute towards his own University education.  The position now is a very good one, and I am sure you will get sufficient eligible teachers&mdash;men and women fitted for the position&mdash;prepared to spend money on their education and so equip themselves with the necessary qualifications.  It should not be paid from the State.  We have not got the money.  We would like to do it if we had the money; but we have not the money.  The tendency in this place is to imagine that we have unlimited capital to float schemes for everything, but where is it to come from? We are a people of three millions, or a little more, and we are collecting a revenue of twenty-seven millions, and it must be reduced if we are to progress. That is another aspect of the question which ought also to be kept in mind. Now, if there is one thing in this country which has been over-developed, it is imagination.  Deputy Professor Magennis says it should be developed in the schools. We are all imagination.  The people of this country imagine themselves the best people in the world, the finest peasantry. Deputy Gorey told me we are all descended from kings.  Now, what more imagination do you want than that?  To <Col N="2568" /> get down to something practical, I really think there is too much imagination about.  We imagine that we are rich and can afford all these sort of things.  I do not want that feeling to go about, because we have no money, and must live within our income, and unless we do, and the Minister for Finance brings down that 27 millions to 10 millions, we cannot progress.</P>

      <P>The Deputy who has just spoken seems to be living in an insulated receiver of some sort out of all contact with the larger world.  If he were aware of what is happening in the larger world outside of him, he would know that there is not a country in the world, and more particularly a country in Europe, affected by the late war, that has not wakened up to the fact that its whole future depends on its expenditure upon education.  Those who think that to go on farming in the old, unenlightened way will make agriculture progress and enable this country to face competition with, say, the United States of America, or, say, with the cattle production of Canada, do they not know perfectly well that the first thing the primary schools were intended to do was to lay the foundations of education, and not to turn out a boy of 14 or 15 or 16 years of age an expert on seeds or an expert on particular grasses?  The subject of interesting a pupil in the things round about him, to give him the interest of a human being in his environment, is not neglected by educational bodies.  We have provision made for what is called nature study, and there is a large amount of attention devoted to that.  Surely, as regards farming, ability to calculate and to keep accounts is just as important an element, although I believe that some farmers do not keep accounts, but whether that is due to the income tax collector or not I am not prepared to say.  I notice that the Farmers' Union representatives have displayed from the very first a marked hostility to education from the first day.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2569" /> How they have arrived at that extraordinary decision it is hard to say; and the rest of the country will have to educate them up to this, that the whole future of the country depends on our facing the educational problem manfully, and not be dismayed by those cries about what it will cost.  There are other directions in which economies may be effected, but to starve the soul of the present and future generations is not an enlightened policy to advocate here, and that is what it amounts to&mdash;the starvation of the soul. Deputy Wilson is against the development of imagination.  What he calls imagination is not recognised as imagination by anyone else.  He thinks that a disease of the brain is an argument against the brain.  He is under the impression that imagination, unenlightened, uncultivated and uncontrolled by education, and allowed to run riot, is the only type of imagination that is possible in a human being.  It is simply because he has misconceived the nature of education that he is hostile to it.</P>

      <P>Well, I am not.  I was not here listening to the discussion, and consequently I am at a loss, but I want to say in regard to education that in an agricultural country like ours I think education ought to be directed to fit us for the position in life which we have to occupy.  Agricultural education is neglected, in fact it is an item that is not at all attended to in the schools. We have, practically speaking, no agricultural education, although we are an <Col N="2570" /> agricultural country, and the vast majority of the people are living in agricultural areas, and are dependent on agriculture but are not fitted by training for the positions they occupy, neither boys nor girls, workmen or farmers.  No matter what anyone may say, what these great Professors may say, I know that as an agricultural community we are not educated for the positions we are going to occupy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'CONNELL</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what we are contending.  There are just one or two other points I should like to bring your attention to.  I must say I cannot congratulate Deputy Wilson on his speech, but I may congratulate him on the fact that he does not suffer from the complaint he alleges we suffer from, that is too much imagination. There is too much talk about the length of the Yang-tse-Kiang.  I do not know where it is, and I certainly do not know the length of it.  I challenge anybody in this Dáil, except perhaps Deputy Professor Magennis, to tell us the length of it.  That is not what is taught in the schools, and people who talk about it do not know what is taught in the schools. I agree that agricultural education is necessary undoubtedly, but there is a proper place, a proper time and a proper age for agricultural education.  It is essentially necessary to a country like this that there should be a proper system of agricultural education, and this is one of the things which we are most anxious to press for, and we hope that in that connection we will have the assistance of the Farmers' Union and other Unions throughout the country. There is just one thing I would like to ask the Minister for Education to refer to when he is replying, and that is the question of bonuses.  It comes under the heading of (H) on Page 3 of the Estimates.  The improved schemes which Deputy Thrift referred to were introduced one or two years ago.  It was undoubtedly intended that a pensions scheme would be a corollary to that improved salaries scheme, and the pensions scheme was dependent on the salaries scheme.  The pensions scheme has not materialised yet, and while I fully appreciate the fact that the finances of the country may not, at the present time, be such that one could <Col N="2571" /> press for a full revision of the pensions scheme, there is a certain class of teacher who is particularly hard hit by the fact that he is retiring two or three years before the salaries scale comes into full operation.  I will not go into detail on this matter.  I know that the Minister is fully aware of its effect, and I am most anxious that he would give it attention to see if anything can be done to relieve the undoubted hardship of this particular class of teacher.  Just one other word.  Many matters have been raised on this Estimate and there are many other matters that could be raised but have not been.  There is no doubt that a scheme of reform must be inaugurated in the very near future through means of legislation.  I would like that the Minister would say whether he is taking any steps to prepare the legislation which is undoubtedly necessary and which we would all like to see introduced at the earliest possible moment.  I would suggest, in that connection, that it will not be necessary to set up, as has been done in several other cases, a Commission on anything like a large scale, because several Education Commissions have sat and taken evidence within the last few years, and their reports are all available.  It will only need a very small Committee to co-ordinate such evidence and such reports as are available, and suit them to the conditions which now exist in this country.</P>

      <P>There is only one aspect of this most important subject that I want to refer to, but I think it is perhaps the most vital aspect from which education can be viewed, and that is the civic character, the training of the child from the point of view of a citizen of the Irish Free State.  I hope that right away from the commencement, under the auspices of the new Government, the whole education of the future citizens of Ireland will be permeated with a thorough National feeling and sentiment and that the duty and responsibility of the growing child as a citizen of that Irish Free State will be inculcated from the earliest years when that child is open to the use of reason.  Many of the ills from which we suffer to-day, perhaps most, can be traced to the fact that the education of the children for generations past <Col N="2572" /> has never been on the right lines, nationally speaking.  We want to make the Irish population in the future an Irish speaking nation, a people who will have the sense of civic responsibility and civic duty, and every boy and girl will feel, and every man and woman will feel that the future of Ireland will be in their hands, and that it is for them to make and to increase the well-being and welfare of the people of the country and the nation as a whole.  I just leave that one suggestion to the Dáil and to the Minister and to those concerned with the shaping of the future courses of education in Ireland, and I hope that from the bottom to the top&mdash;I say from the bottom to the top because it is at the bottom we should make the right commencement&mdash;the whole education of Ireland will have that underlying principle upon which it will be based for the rearing up of the young generation&mdash;the rising generation of to-morrow and of the coming two years &mdash;so that the State may be strengthened when that generation comes to manhood and to womanhood.</P>

      <P>I understand that a deputation of teachers superannuated previous to 1917 waited on Deputy Lynch in Cork some time in the early part of this year, and certain promises were made by this gentleman that provision would be made to increase their allowances. I understand that the allowances which they receive are hardly up to a living standard, and that they have been very sorely hit during the last few years. I would like to know, when the Minister is replying, what exactly is the position of these men, whether provision will be made in the near future, or is being made.  I understand that their case is a very severe one, and that there are about 2,500 such at present in Ireland.  I also think that the allowances for manual and practical instruction in the schools are very small.  I think it is just as important to look after the practical training of the girls in the schools as it is to educate the boys.  We are turning out girls from our schools at the moment absolutely useless for the State, absolutely useless as mothers, and as wives, and I think the sooner we get some good sound system introduced into the schools the better for the State.</P>

      <P>I am not going to traverse the ground already covered by <Col N="2573" /> the previous speakers.  I associate myself with the principles that have been enunciated by Deputy O'Connell.  I am very glad that Deputy Johnson pointed out wherein the life of a school consists and what the equipment of a school should include.  Environment is included in the equipment, and environment in the schools is as educative as books and the words of the teacher, and scholars educate one another as much as teachers and books do.  That is one reason why I think we should not have so many of those very small rural schools.  I think we ought to aim at doing away with very small, insanitary, rural schools, and endeavour to gather the outlying pupils to larger and more central schools, perhaps by the aid of State assistance, in the new system.  However, principally I want to ask the Minister for Education for some more information.  These Estimates are most informative.  On page 5, under the heading &ldquo;Inspection Department,&rdquo; I notice that a new scheme of inspectorate has been adopted.  I heard of that some time ago, and I was afraid that the change might involve some hardship on our existing inspectors.  My fears are relieved by the footnote.  I see the Minister for Education is taking steps to see that these changes may not involve any particular hardship for the existing staff.  Perhaps he will give us some more information regarding Marlborough Street Training College, on page 7.  Some time ago I was informed that that Training College was done away with and the staff dismissed.  I see that there is provision made in grants and bonuses for 1923 of £20,000, and that it is estimated in 1922-23 that the number of students in Marlborough Street should be taken as 50 men and 210 women.  I would be glad to know what the intentions of the Minister for Education are with regard to this college.</P>

    <P>The criticism of Deputy O'Connell about the sub-division of these Votes is undoubtedly justifiable, but in our case it is hereditary, that is to say we have taken it over and it is impossible to change it in a day, and in the time that has elapsed since we took it over, and if the change were made it would be very difficult to set out the estimates so as to enable Deputies to compare the votes of the present year with those of the previous year.  We have, I think, six distinct heads under which Education comes before us.  There is what is called Public Education&mdash;that is the Vote we are now discussing&mdash;Technical Education, University, education in connection with Land Institutions, and finally one department of education which comes under the head of Crimes.  I do not know exactly the name of the vote but I think it is Industrial and Reformatory Schools.  There is no doubt there should be some considerable unification, and it will be most desirable in future that all these educational votes should come before the Dáil in some way that would enable it to realise exactly what is going on at the present time.  In Ireland we have education chopped up into several compartments, with gaps, and again over-lying and over-lapping, and mixed up.  My own opinions about these things are probably a bit peculiar, and I should not like to force them upon other people, but in my opinion this whole artificial system of dividing education into elementary, secondary and higher, is without any basis at all in relation to the interests of the children and the need of the people and of the community.  I cannot give any answer <Col N="2575" /> that would be worth giving with regard to the question as to the maintenance of school-buildings, heating, etc., for the simple reason that the only answer worth giving would be a considered answer, and that I am not prepared to give at the present moment.  The question of assistants being thrown out of their engagements through the lowering of averages has been before us for years and years.  As to the remedy suggested by Deputy O'Connell, to give these preference to vacancies, as far as I can see that could only be done by making some very much more elaborate arrangements than we have at present for absorbing into vacancies those disemployed in certain schools because, as you know, the system by which teachers are appointed to schools is not by public authority but by a system of local selection, and it would be impossible under the system which exists, and without a complete change, to say that assistants disemployed in one place must be employed in vacancies that occur in another place.  Now, with regard to the amalgamation of small schools, what has been said on both sides is very sound.  Altogether the discussion we have had this afternoon is one I think that has been taken part in with great satisfaction not only by those who have spoken, but it has also given great satisfaction to those who have listened to it.  It is pleasant to see in this young legislative body so much earnestness shown, particularly with regard to making further improvements, and I would remind Deputies that the making of improvements in the future will be a matter for them as a body more than for any Minister.  My own technical experience in dealing with this subject is, as you all know, very short, and if it was very much longer and I was able to speak with a great deal more authority and expert knowledge on all these points I would still feel I was far, far and very far from being wise enough to be sole legislator on any points of education.  The amalgamation of small schools is undoubtedly desirable in many cases I think the caution Deputy Johnson advanced in regard to that shows that we should not run away with the idea that large schools are necessarily better than small ones even if they lead to greater economy and meant that a superior teaching staff was employed. <Col N="2576" /> There may still be some disadvantages. With regard to the delays in sending out payments, I do not know that just at present there is delay of any kind.  There have been delays in sending out, and in receiving claims, and these delays, I presume, were due to the passing difficulties in which the country finds itself at the moment. Various things were advocated here, and, of course, it is well that they were advocated, but I do not know whether I am called upon to refer to them, and especially to such things as Continuation Schools.  There was one point not touched upon, but I was asked about it some time ago, and that is with a view to the securing of better attendance of pupils in schools.  A proposal came to me from a local Attendance Committee in County Dublin and they suggested a method of securing better attendance, which was to compel children who failed in their ordinary attendance to attend at a particular class of school &mdash;a certified day school&mdash;and to attend there temporarily, where they would have to put in a few more hours and which would have the effect of imposing a more severe discipline.  I mention that because the School Attendance Committee of Blackrock Township say they have evidence that such a system has worked successfully elsewhere.  As to what was said about training, well there again I do not feel competent to take the matter in hand, nor do I think the Ministry is the right instrument to take a question like that in hands in the first instance.  I think the movement has gone in the right direction when men from the Universities have taken it up It is really for them&mdash;people engaged in educational work&mdash;to shape educational projects, and when that has been established and thrashed out and taken form I think it is then the duty of the Government to take that up, and in my opinion the Government never yet existed that is wise enough to take charge of any educational project.  What is at the bottom of education, as everybody knows, is good teachers.  You have to obtain good teachers, and when you obtain them you have to sustain them; and if you have a good teacher, he will produce better educational results teaching under a hedge than a bad teacher would produce in the most palatial surroundings and <Col N="2577" /> with all the equipment and facilities with which he could be furnished.  I agree with Deputy Johnson that schools should aim at a certain amount of cultural education. You will all agree with me, I think, it is true of the country and the town that children, and, for the matter of that, middle-aged people, have very little respect and affection for the place to which they belong, in this sense, that they do not wish to see their beauty and cleanliness, and things of that kind, preserved and disfigurement avoided.  All experience of all of us in our youth shows that with regard to the places where we were brought up.  We are careless about these things.  We take no real pride in our country; and if we were proud of our country, we would be proud of the little bit of it to which we belong.  Now, with regard to agriculture, I do not think we do much for it in the primary schools, which are the subject of this particular Vote.  At the same time, I think that Deputy Wilson was right in his remarks in regard to this matter.  It is not right that children in the country should not know one tree from another or one field from another.  I do not think that their knowledge ought to be limited in any way merely to what would make a livelihood for them.  The reason they are so ignorant is because they have got it into their heads, and their parents have it in their heads, that nothing is worth knowing anything about except what will help towards their livelihood.  Now, with regard to manual instruction, the sum that appears in the Estimates does not at all represent the general expenditure on manual instruction.  A few years ago there was a great craze in regard to this, but which after a short experiment was wisely enough discontinued.</P>

    <P>Marlborough Training College appears in these Estimates not in full form, because these Estimates are of necessity got up a month or two earlier than the time they represent.

      <P>I think I dealt with that in answer to a question of Deputy O'Connell before, and I have no additional information at the moment with regard to it.  It was a question that interested me very keenly, but it is clearly a question of finance, and it is a bit thorny and full of difficulties.  The teachers who feel it most keenly are those who, if they would be allowed to remain longer, would qualify for a better pension.  Really the teachers to whom my sympathy goes out, are those who are cut out from all chance, and some of these teachers&mdash;both men and women&mdash; are on utterly inadequate and ridiculously small allowances.</P>

      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, the fact that a separate Vote has been moved for Intermediate Education illustrates the point I referred to, and which was referred to by the Minister for Education a moment ago&mdash;that the method by which these Votes are taken is water-tight, and often overlaps <Col N="2579" /> sections of our Education Scheme.  The fact with regard to this particular Vote is this&mdash;that it does not purport to make provision for an Intermediate system of education at all.  Up to six, seven or eight years ago, I understand that no provision for Intermediate Education appeared in the public Estimates.  There is a grant which is popularly called the &ldquo;whiskey money,&rdquo; because it is the proceeds of taxes on some whiskey, so I think the position is&mdash;the more whiskey that is drunk the more money there is available for that particular class of education. But these particular grants that are made here became necessary a few years ago owing to the position which a certain class of teachers in these schools occupied.  And it is really illustrative of the system or the methods of the British administration.  But when any particular demand or any particular body of people became sufficiently clamant, they threw them a sop to keep them quiet for the time being, which was really tinkering with the system.  Now, these teachers to whom I refer are the teachers engaged in the secondary schools or colleges throughout the country. I might say right off that no other body of public servants in this country are so inadequately paid or so scandalously treated as these teachers.  And they are a small body, and possibly it is the case that because they are a small body they are so badly treated. In 1914, I think, the first grant was given.  It was given on certain conditions, one of which was, I understand, that a certain proportion of lay teachers should be employed in the schools, and to arrive at the proportion the schools were divided into two groups, according to their religious denominations.  My information is, in any case, that the conditions provided that one lay teacher should be employed for every forty in one of the particular groups of schools &mdash;the Catholic schools.  That condition has not been observed or carried out. If it is a fact, I think it would be advisable that the authorities should look into the matter.  These men are men of the very highest qualifications.  Very many of them&mdash;practically all of them now&mdash;have to possess University degrees, and before they are registered they have to have three years' experience as teachers.  The average salary which is paid to them is not much more <Col N="2580" /> than what is now allowed as the initial salaries of teachers in the National Schools under the latest scheme.  If we are to have a proper linking up of the educational system, immediate attention must be given to the position of these lay secondary teachers.  They have grievances, not only in the matter of salaries, but in the matter of pensions. These men have no pensions whatsoever.  They have no salary scale. There is no such thing as a regularly established scale for these men&mdash;a minimum the same as is laid down in the case of the National teachers and which must be paid.  Further, experience, qualifications or length of service are not taken into account when fixing the scale.  As I say, no provision is made whatsoever for pensions, and, of course, they are not able themselves out of their meagre incomes to make any proper provision for their old age.  Then there is the question of security of tenure which should hardly be mentioned at all because they have no security of tenure. They are liable to dismissal on short notice irrespective of their qualifications or experience or the length of service in any particular school.  It depends largely on the conditions in a particular school.  On this question I think it will be in the minds of most of the Deputies here that these men two years ago were forced into a position that they had to go out on strike. I think when men of the type of those who are engaged in our secondary schools and colleges are forced to take up that position things must be in a very bad way indeed.  In this connection I would like to remind the Minister, as illustrating what I said a moment ago about the security of tenure, that I called attention to earlier in the Session to a case that happened in Limerick.  It is something like about two years ago since the strike took place, and since then twelve lay secondary teachers employed in the city of Limerick or in the precincts have been dismissed. The Minister promised to make inquiries into that particular case, and I would like to know if anything has come of these inquiries.  I certainly would urge that something should be done to prevent a thing like that happening in the future.  I would like especially to draw the attention of Deputies to the fact that this sum of £63,000 which appears <Col N="2581" /> in the Estimate has, I understand, already been expended.  It was paid on account of the educational year which ended last June, and I am anxious to know from the Minister for Education what is the intention with regard to the present school year, because, if I am correct in saying that this £63,000 was paid on account of the last education school year, then no provision appears in these Estimates in any case for any grant or any similar grant for this current school year, and we would like to know what the intentions of the Minister are&mdash;whether he is going to make any provision to meet the clamant needs of these badly-treated secondary teachers until such time as he can bring before the Dáil a scheme of education which will make suitable and proper permanent provision for them.</P>

      <P>I would like to say a few words in support of the case put forward on behalf of the secondary teachers. We all congratulated ourselves here several times on the fact that at long last the salaries of the teachers in the National schools have been raised to a decent level.  Every argument that applied to the teachers of the National schools applies with equal force to the teachers of secondary schools.  They are only weak in one point&mdash;that they are few in number, and not able to kick up the same row and to bring the same pressure; but I am sure they will not suffer owing to that weakness from the present Ministry.  We talk about an educational ladder&mdash;about climbing up from the National school to the secondary school and into the University&mdash;but if the middle rungs of the ladder are weak and bad the whole system is defective.  We upbraided a foreign Government, when we had it here, on the fact that they pursued a policy that was deliberately intended, according to our view, and as I believe, to neglect the education of the country and to starve it, and they paid a policeman more than they paid a teacher.  They gave the primary teacher of a National school at that time a pension that was, in some cases, to my knowledge equivalent to the outdoor relief rate paid to poor people.  Now at present these Secondary teachers, I understand, are getting less than is paid a sergeant of the Civic Guard.  It is a scandal, a terrible <Col N="2582" /> scandal, to be paying decent people who have to get a University education in certain subjects in order to qualify them to teach them in National schools.  You say to the teachers, in order to qualify to teach them, you must study a certain programme.  The pupils who go to the Secondary schools have a more advanced programme, and you must have a better class of teacher to teach them. What is the position?  You do not pay them as well as people who are less qualified.  If there was justice at all you would pay them better.  Now I would speak as strongly as I can in support of the case made for them.  On the question of tenure, I have heard stories from men who have given years of their lives to education who have been thrown out of employment with less consideration than a heartless employer would throw out a servant girl or a yardman.  It is a terrible scandal the way they are treated.  If a man goes to the Civic Guard, or if he goes to be a soldier, or to the Dublin Corporation, he must get a guarantee of tenure, but the poor Secondary teachers are like bullocks that are put out on the grazing system.  They only enjoy the eleven months' system.  Again Deputy O'Connell spoke of the necessity of providing University education for teachers in the National schools.  Well, it is little good for the teachers in the Secondary schools, in fact University education seems to be almost a reason for treating them in a very bad way. Then as to pensions, there is no possibility and no outlook and no hope for them in that respect.  Now that we are speaking lovely things about education, and if we have a real regard for education, we must have the system complete, and it cannot be complete until these Secondary teachers are done justice to.  I hope that in any time we have before the new system is devised some attempt will be made to give justice to the Secondary teachers and relieve them from the humiliating and disgraceful position in which they are at present.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the appeal made by Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Sears on behalf of the Secondary teachers.  I do not propose to go over the ground again, as I think it is universally known that their <Col N="2583" /> position has been a scandalous one, and that as a result a good many of what would be perhaps good, if not the best and the most capable, Secondary teachers have been driven out of the country and are now teaching as Primary teachers in England and Scotland. I do not want to labour the point as it was laboured quite enough.  I want to draw a little attention to a rather different aspect, and that is, that many of us&mdash;those with whom I am associated&mdash; desire that there shall be rather greater opportunities for boys and girls in the ordinary Primary schools, to get a Secondary school education.  I was very glad to find the Minister for Education, in his last reply, taking the view that education, and even education on a particular subject, is not necessarily intended to earn money for the boy or girl who is educated, because the view I hold of such miscalled education is that it would be profitable all right to certain people, because it might make in certain directions a more efficient wage earner whether on the farms, in the factories or in the workshops, but it would not make necessarily a better citizen, and it is better citizenship, more all-round citizenship that we want in Ireland. I have not had a great deal of experience of Intermediate Education, but I think it has been defective in the past, particularly in that element of citizenship which is so desirable. I hope, since I had the misfortune to go through the Intermediate, that the teaching of something like civics has found some place in the Intermediate system, but I would like that the Minister would consider&mdash;I do not expect he would turn down the proposal&mdash;something in the way of providing scholarships for Primary school pupils.  Now, boys, at all events, in the cities of Ireland, even ordinary workingmen's and artisans' boys, if the father is in anything like constant employment, have had certain opportunities through the Christian Brothers' schools of getting Secondary education, and while on many points the administration of the Christian Brothers' schools, from my point of view, may not be altogether desirable, I think a tribute should be paid to them for not alone the National line they have taken, but for the educational opportunities they put in the way of the ordinary run of boys.  I think it has not done the young men of the country <Col N="2584" /> very much harm; in fact, I think that more than a proportion of the young men of the last few years, who have given great and genuine service of one kind or another to Ireland, have not been only Secondary school teachers, but Secondary school boys, whether from the Christian Brothers' school or from the other private institutions.  I want to point out to those who are objecting to greater expenditure on technical education that this is a matter where a sense of proportion is desirable.  The teaching of agriculture has its place.  It is a matter of proportion, and a sense of proportion would save many of us from falling into the errors that we would otherwise make. Of course, the same criticism would apply to a great many other things as well as to education.  To me there is one great criterion of expenditure, whether of education or anything else, and that is, in the moral or material way, does it give value for the money spent?  It is a question of value to the State, to the Nation, to the people, as well as to those on whom it is spent.  When the ratepayers complain of rising rates the same thing applies. There is nothing vicious, wrong, bad, or objectionable about increased rates any more than there is about increased taxes. The whole question to me is whether the money raised is used profitably and to the best advantage.  I think that is a good criterion of the question of expense, so that it is a short view and a wrong view to take that the country must necessarily be run on ten millions instead of twenty or twenty-seven millions.  I do not mean that there should be excessive spending even on education, but there should be a considerable amount, and I should like a great deal more to be spent on Secondary education.  While it is true that the generality of boys and girls in Ireland will never get much more than a Primary school education unless that they get a technical training of some kind afterwards, yet the ordinary workingman's son and daughter are going to play a much bigger part in the near future than they did in the past. I do recognise that to a large extent the administration of Ireland will be falling into the hands of young men and young women who ought to be well educated, and that a good many of them need not necessarily have what is called a University education at all, though I should like they would.  I think it de- <Col N="2585" /> plorable that such a situation should be created as was created a few years ago and as was referred to by Deputy O'Connell this evening when Secondary teachers had to strike for a living wage.  I know that the whole question is complicated and that the Ministry may not be able to deal with it without entering into very controversial questions.  There are more factors than one to be taken into consideration. There is the position of the lay and clerical teachers and the opportunities that certain institutions have of employing or taking advantage of certain people who have not necessarily to get their livelihood out of teaching. And that above all puts the Secondary lay teacher in a very difficult position. I recognise that, but I recognise at the same time that some steps will have to be taken to deal with the proper claims of the Primary teachers.  But again I would stress the importance of the sense of proportion and the importance of looking at these things not as a single isolated estimate at all, but as part of the whole.  I am very glad that, in some respects at all events, the reply of the Minister for Education as given on Primary education has been on the whole very satisfactory.  If the view that he has expressed so far as Primary education is concerned is going to be the view, or anything like the view, of the Ministry on Intermediate or Secondary education, then I think there is going to be a chance for better citizenship and better trained citizenship in Ireland. In that connection perhaps I might be allowed to wind up with a little story illustrating something that I have been saying, that is to show that while those who like economising may be following one track they may be drawing a false analogy in some other direction.  The story is this:&mdash;There was a certain boy in an Intermediate school in a French class.  He came across a certain word of which he did not understand the meaning.  The teacher tried to get him to analyse it, and in that way to get at the meaning of the word. He asked him what did he think the roots of the word were.  The boy looked up the words and the first thing he got was, &ldquo;pater,&rdquo; a father.  He looked at the second part of the word and he found that it was another Latin word and he got the roots of it and stumbled a bit. Eventually the teacher gave him a little <Col N="2586" /> assistance, and he analysed the word fairly correctly by saying that patrimony meant some goods, or wealth, or something like that, that probably had come down from a man's father.  The teacher, who was a bit of a wit, then said, &ldquo;Now, what would be the meaning of matrimony,&rdquo; and the boy replied that it was goods or wealth or something like that that was handed down from the mother. That is an illustration of what some of our farmer friends are suffering from. They get on the wrong track.  They think the cutting down of expenditure here and there is advisable and that by that means they are going to get the correct definition of matrimony.  They are not; they are going to get the wrong one, like the boy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.B. WHELEHAN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just heard a Deputy in the Lobby state that the schoolmasters are having a field day. I am very glad they are having a field day in the Dáil, and I would remind him that schoolmasters had many a field day when there was more than talking to be done.  I would like if it were possible and if it were in order, to move that the vote for Secondary education in Ireland, or at least one section of it, should be increased four-fold.  That is under Section (B).  I think it will be agreed that the salaries paid to Secondary teachers in Ireland are altogether inadequate and altogether out of keeping with the profession. A casual glance at the Vote for primary education and the Vote for University education, and then a glance at the Vote for secondary education, will reveal, I am sure, the great want of parity there is between the Vote for Secondary education and the Votes for either of the other branches.  Now, to come down to some facts which members of this Dáil may be altogether unaware of with regard to Secondary teachers' salaries, I may say that for several of the years of the European War Secondary teachers in Ireland were paid salaries varying from £50 per annum to a maximum of £120 per annum.  It is well we should know that.  After repeated attempts the British Government gave an interim grant which gave the teachers a yearly bonus from £20 to £30 additional.  The teachers are not much better off to-day, and I think the average salary in the Secondary schools runs somewhere about £170 or £175.  I give that figure subject to correction. <Col N="2587" /> I would ask members of this Dáil to consider how any man in a Secondary school can support himself, not to speak of a wife and family, on such a salary.  There is no bonus, and no pension when he comes to be past his work, and he has not even any fixity of tenure.  He has no guarantee that he will continue to receive that £170.  What is the effect of all this upon Secondary education?  There is a constant loss, a constant drainage from Ireland, of the very best teachers from our Secondary schools to Secondary schools in Britain and America.  They are lost to the Nation.  Apart from that the Secondary teacher is eternally faced with anxiety about his means of livelihood.  That affects his work.  He carries that anxiety from his home to his class work.  Very often he has to have recourse to means extern to his profession, to supplement his income in order to live.  He is overworked and cannot give the time necessary to prepare for his class work.  Consequently in class he becomes irritable, and all these things must of necessity affect his work in school.  The effects then on the pupil are injurious.  There is inefficient work done and that is due largely to the anxiety that perpetually faces the Secondary teacher.  That inefficiency not only affects the work done in a Secondary school by the teachers in such a position but it affects the work done in the University, because if the pupil in the Secondary school does not receive efficient education he must naturally go to the University unfitted for University education.  I am sure, however, that in the present Minister for Education the Secondary teachers will find a good friend, for he will look at the question from the National point of view and he will look at it also from the humanitarian point of view.  I am sure he will realise that people who are eternally anxious about their means of livelihood cannot do efficient work for the Nation.  I would, therefore, ask the Minister to assure the Secondary teachers of the country that he will look to this matter of salary, of pensions, and of fixity of tenure personally, or otherwise that he will commit a further term of reference to the Commission on Secondary education which had been appointed by the Second Dáil and which I think has not yet completed its work. I understand the Commission will meet <Col N="2588" /> very soon.  Now I would urge the Minister to do either of these two things, to take the matter up himself, to get away from this Interim Grant, to draw up a salary scale for teachers in the Secondary schools, or else to entrust to the Commission set up by the Second Dáil a further term of reference dealing with the whole position of the teachers in the Secondary schools in Ireland.</P>

      <P>It has been the genuine and the one argument that I have heard in support of Intermediate education.  We have often read from time to time of the grievances of Intermediate teachers.  Well, I suppose we have got so case-hardened that it is only a mere pass-word.  We have heard a lot about the Royal College of Science being turned over to military control.  I know parties who left the Royal College of Science and have gone into Intermediate schools, and I know probably what their average salary was.  I know in one case after a man had taken out an Associateship of the College of Science he got a position in an Intermediate school at 30s. a week. He had to pay £1 5s. of that for his board and lodging, and he had the other 5s. for himself.  This continued for about 32 or 33 weeks of the year.  I cannot give all the particulars with regard to Intermediate education, but I will state a few broad facts.  In an Intermediate school boys have to be taught from the age of 14 years up to 19, and the subjects that have to be taught at that age require a greater amount of assiduity, and a greater amount of skill, and far more patience, than in the case of people who have not advanced to that age or men who go to a University from an Intermediate school. Now the average salary for an Intermediate teacher is about £160 per annum.  I do not see how any man who wanted to keep up the decency of his profession, and what the people expect of him, could exist on that salary, but I think that the whole system of Intermediate education should be remedied <Col N="2589" /> from stem to stern.  And not alone should we express a pious hope that it should be done in the future, but I think that immediate steps should be taken to remedy this crying evil.</P>

      <P>For more years than I care to count up I have been intimately connected with the working of a good many Secondary schools, and I think it is fitting that with that knowledge thus derived, I should bear tribute to the work that is being done by Secondary teachers.  With other speakers, I do not think really it is necessary to labour the point as to the present needs of Secondary teachers.  I could add other tales, harrowing ones, but I fancy that most members of this Dáil know the extreme circumstances under which Secondary teachers have been trying to do their work.  The fact is, as Deputy Whelehan said, we get no State aid for Intermediate education.  This Estimate is only touching the fringe of it.  The fact is, we rely on private institutions to do the work of Secondary education and we back them up with temporary grants such as are indicated on that paper. With pleasure I note that in that paper the difficulties of the teachers have been appreciated by the Government, in that they raise the interim grant from £38,000 to £50,000.  With pleasure I note that, but still the whole thing means that we are only tinkering with the system by these grants.  We rely on private Boards to look after our Secondary schools.  We rely on the work done by private gentlemen and others who have given up their time and energy to administer the schools, and while they find in the difficulties they are labouring under they are able to give no more than a sweating wage to their teachers, then the Government has come in with a little more&mdash;I am not referring to this Government&mdash;but the Government came in with little grants just to help them to carry on. Personally I am aware of the enormous difficulty these Boards have had, and the fact that they regretted the pitiable salaries they were able to give their teachers.  The point that I wish to make particularly is this, that anything these Boards can do in the way of increasing their own revenue lies in increasing the fees they charge to students for the privilege of the Secondary education.  Now that is going at <Col N="2590" /> the matter in the wrong way; for the good of the country we want to give the privileges of Secondary education as cheaply as we can.  We do not want to confine it to any particular class. We want to get the best brains of every class; we want to get the best brains in the Primary schools, and give them the privileges of Secondary education, and then we want to get at the best brains in the Secondary schools, and give them the privileges of University education.  That is the only way you can get at the people, and the only system for getting the best out of the people.  You have a system of dealing with Primary education, but you have no system of dealing with Secondary education, and are merely tinkering with it, and have only a similar way of dealing with University education. The Minister for Education has said that it is not for the Minister to develop the scheme.  That is quite true.  It is for this legislative body to develop a scheme that will deal with all branches and bring out a comprehensive system through which Primary, Secondary and University education may be made to work hand in hand, co-operating with one another, and give a Primary boy a chance to go up to the top of the tree.  I submit, however, that the Minister for Education should consider that a legislative Assembly like this cannot act unless it gets a lead, and there is a life-work lying before him or a succeeding Minister for Education to develop a system of that kind, and bring out a system of education for the country that will involve all classes, and not to make it only for one class, but to give the opportunity to every boy in the country. That is what I hope we are going to aim at.  I think the whole question of so much importance, that we cannot hope really to deal with it at the beginning of our career as a legislative assembly, but what I do want to urge is, that as soon as ever matters become practicable, some comprehensive scheme of that kind should be set going and that, meanwhile, every effort should be made with the resources at our disposal to put Secondary teachers in the way of being able to live decently, without undertaking such supplementary means as they have to undertake in order to live at all.  They have been paid this grant referred to on this paper from the funds of this financial year, paid last June, but they have no guarantee, and <Col N="2591" /> I dare say no such guarantee can be given, but that the grant probably will be given again.  They have no guarantee that the grant will be given similarly next year.  We do not ask for a guarantee, but it certainly would be some consolation for them to feel that in all probability such a grant will be continued, and that if at all possible it should be increased as a temporary grant; but surely it is our duty, as soon as possible, to try and get rid of these temporary grants in the way of doles, to try to put the whole thing on a permanent, proper, and satisfactory foundation.</P>

      <P>Here again I suffer from the disadvantage that there is so much detail that ought to be dealt with as to make it exceedingly difficult to select particular points upon which to concentrate.  I like to congratulate the Minister every time I get the slightest opportunity, but I think it is only right that we should congratulate the Minister on his courage in continuing these appropriations in aid of Secondary education on this very extensive scale.  But let us not forget that, just as in the case of National education, this Intermediate education is part of the <i>damnosa hereditas</i> which the Free State has been obliged to take over, and under which it is obliged for the time being to struggle.  An evening ago the report of the Intermediate Education Board was laid on the table of this Dáil, and I believe I am the only member of the Dáil who has taken the trouble to read it.  I see that Deputy Whelehan dissents from that and consequently I must conclude that there are others who have been digging into its depths for facts to employ in this debate.  As Deputy Whelehan has spoken largely with regard to the question of salaries I am afraid that he has found this an unremunerative quarry.  He must look for these facts in another direction.  I go to the report of the Intermediate Commissioners in order to speak a little in defence of a body that has shared a great deal of unpopularity with the National Board amongst those who occasionally interest themselves in educational affairs.  You will notice on page 9&mdash;Roman characters&mdash;a little synoptic history begins of the whole educational system called the Intermediate. &ldquo;The Intermediate Education <Col N="2592" /> Act of 1878 was intended to promote Secondary Secular Education in Ireland&rdquo; by a variety of expedients which I intend to read.  I will take the liberty of reading this because it reinforces the concluding remarks of Deputy Thrift.  &ldquo;It is to be noted that the Secondary Schools in existence at the passing of the Act were in no sense State Institutions&rdquo;; whereas you will observe that the schools with which the last Vote has been concerned were State Institutions.  &ldquo;Some were old foundations, their funds derived in the first instance from Royal grants or from private benefactions, some were private ventures, some belonged to Roman Catholic Religious Orders.  But in all, the management, whether vested in a Board of Governors or in a private individual or in the head of a religious Order, was independent of any control on the part of the State.  The new Act did not contemplate any change in this system.  That the State should interfere with the education of the upper and middle ranks of society was a doctrine which would have found few or no supporters in the Imperial Parliament of that period.&rdquo;  We have all become democrats since that time, and we are all anxious now to change the old order and to replace it with something, not new because it is new, but new because it is better.  Now the history of these funds is set out, beginning with page.  &ldquo;For the purposes of the Act the sum of one million pounds sterling, portion of the funds derived from the disendowment of the Irish Church, was placed at the disposal of the Board.  The income from this source was originally £32,500, but, in consequence of alteration in the rate of interest it fell to £27,500.  This was until 1911 a fluctuating amount, varying from £71,400 in 1900 to £16,998 in 1910, being the residue after the payment of a fixed sum for Primary education of the produce of certain taxes on spirits.&rdquo;  This became available as a further endowment.  Now, I am anxious that you should understand how these figures come to be under these three heads.  There is, first of all, the income derivable from the capital sum of £1,000,000; there is the income derivable as the residue from spirit taxes which Deputy O'Connell has referred to as &ldquo;whiskey money.&rdquo;  That sum, fortunately for this country's morality, declined, <Col N="2593" /> as you will see, from £71,400 in 1900 to £16,998 in 1910, so that later the sum had to be fixed, and it was fixed at £46,000.  Now, the two incomes are further supplemented at a later period, as you will see on p. 15.  &ldquo;In 1914 a further Act was passed dealing with Intermediate education in Ireland.  This Act provided for the setting up of a register of the Intermediate school teachers in Ireland, and for the payment to the Board in each year out of moneys provided by Parliament of a sum not exceeding £40,000 (referred to in the Act as the Teachers' Salaries Grant).&rdquo;  Now, that is the item referred to in Estimate B.  That is payable really in relief of teachers' salaries. And then again, &ldquo;In March, 1918, Parliament voted an additional grant of £50,000 for Intermediate education in Ireland.  This grant was intended to be Ireland's equivalent of the additional grant voted by Parliament for Secondary education in England and Wales.&rdquo;  These sums were recently divided according to a certain proportion between Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland, and the amount payable in consequence of that division, you will see on this Estimate, is very much smaller than the figure that I have read out.  If you will allow me later to speak I would like to explain what has been the policy in recent years of the Intermediate Board by way of an apology, because this is really its swan song.  Anybody who has noticed the language used in the new programme of Intermediate education will notice that the Intermediate Education Board is doomed to disappear.  For the moment, however, I will confine myself just to one item, and that is item <i>(b)</i>&mdash;the grant towards the salaries of teachers in Secondary schools.  The detail on page 2 of Estimate 20 says the Grant will be distributed in accordance with rules made under Sec. 2 of the Intermediate Education (Ireland) Act, 1914.  Now, I brought these rules&mdash;which are really in the nature of statutes because they lay upon the Table of the House of Commons in Westminster and took on a statutory character&mdash;and it is under these that the present Minister is obliged, pending any legislation that the Dáil may see its way to effect, to distribute these grants, and I am desirous of its being well understood by the public through an examination of these, that the miserable salaries that are paid to <Col N="2594" /> secondary teachers is a victimisation of educated men which must not be laid at the door, either of the Intermediate Board or, temporarily, of the present Minister for Education, so long as the allocation of the grants will continue under the rule referred to.  This is a very complicated matter, and I think only those who are vitally interested in it would take the trouble to understand why by the Act of 1914 the Lord Lieutenant of the day was empowered to draw up rules to govern the Intermediate Board in the distribution of the grant, and the third rule to which reference is made is, I regret to say, very long.  It is laid down that the Teachers' Salaries Grant is distributed for promoting employment upon reasonable terms of an adequate number of duly qualified lay teachers in Intermediate schools. In this Grant, which is popularly known as the Birrell Grant, it is expressly declared in these statutory rules to have been provided for this purpose, to secure reasonable terms of remuneration for an adequate number of duly qualified lay teachers.  Now, we come to the rules. In the case of Catholic schools&mdash;schools under Catholic management&mdash;they are called Group I., and all these schools are dealt with collectively as a unit.  In the case of each of these groups the total number of duly qualified lay teachers employed in the schools comprised in the group must not be less than 1/40th of the total number of Intermediate pupils attending these schools. There is a popular and erroneous impression that the requirements are that for every forty pupils in an Intermediate school under Catholic management there must be a lay-teacher.  That is a misconception. All the Catholic schools are grouped together as one and then the proportion of lay-teachers employed in the total group must be one for every forty pupils who accept the rule of the school for the purpose of the Intermediate Board requirements.  &ldquo;The total number of the duly qualified lay-teachers employed in the schools comprised under the group shall be computed on the basis of the average number of such teachers employed.  And the employment of a duly qualified lay-teacher shall not be taken into account for the purpose of this condition unless he is entitled,&rdquo; and I ask special attention <Col N="2595" /> to this: &ldquo;under his contract of employment to a salary not less than the appropriate minimum salary specified in the schedule to these rules.&rdquo;  And the appropriate minimum salary is for a male teacher £140 and for a woman teacher £90 per year, in cases where board and residence are not provided. One hundred and forty pounds and £90 per year! and there must be a legal contract between employer and employed with regard to such salary, otherwise the fact of the salary being paid is not operative for the purpose of this Act. And unless his contract of employment (except in case of dismissal for gross misconduct) is determinable only upon three months' notice in writing taking effect at the end of a school term.  And then there is a clause about the number of pupils and so on that I need not trouble the Dáil with.  Now how does that work out?  It is a matter which I do not envy the Minister for Education the necessity of dealing with.  What is a lay-teacher? The ordinary man in the street would answer readily &ldquo;anyone not in Holy Orders is a layman, and I suppose a lay-teacher is a teacher not in Holy Orders.&rdquo;  The intention of Mr. Birrell and his advisers was to define as a lay-teacher the ordinary lay-man as contrasted with a member of a Religious Order.  Now there are various Religious Orders which under their Regulations have not the priestly character.  Nuns for example are, strictly speaking, lay-teachers. The Presentation Brothers, the Christian Brothers, although wearing the frock of the monk and living under monastic rule are&mdash;in the strict legal interpretation&mdash;laymen, and when you compute the number of lay-teachers employed in a group of Catholic schools you are obliged, according to the legal effect of the rule I cited to count the members of these Religious Orders as among the lay-teachers for the purpose of this distribution.  It is one of the grievances, I understand, of the genuine lay-teacher that the provision in aid of his meagre income is not given to him fully because of the deficiency of the English language, and because of the inability, so to speak, of the draftsman, to make it clear.  Thus the sum intended for the ordinary lay teacher is made to depend upon the way in which you interpret the rule.  In the report of the Intermediate Education <Col N="2596" /> Board for Ireland with regard to this matter, it gives the sum of £35,445 as distributed to the schools in Southern Ireland, together with a certain amount for administrative expenses.  The total number of Intermediate pupils as defined in those rules I have read out is 18,746. Of the boys' 213 schools with 15,523 pupils are under Catholic management. In these the number of duly qualified lay-teachers, <i>i.e.,</i> non-Monastic Brothers, conforming to the conditions laid down, is 215.  In addition to those there are 204 nuns and 58 members of Brotherhoods who claim to be &ldquo;lay teachers&rdquo; and who are registered and fulfil the conditions laid down.  The decision as to whether these are or are not lay teachers now rests with the Minister. You see what is the consequence of that failing an authoritative decision upon this matter.  The situation is one, I may say, without exaggeration of pitiful difficulty and the situation already bad is still further complicated by the fact of the strike referred to by some of the Deputies earlier.  Headmasters declare the contracts that existed were broken by the strike and refuse to renew them.  The consequence amongst others is that there is one very distinguished college about which I know something in this city which is returned as having no contract with the lay teachers, and the consequence is that the lay teacher has not a three months contract terminable in writing under the provisions of this rule.  In this distinguished college I see the first teacher on the list&mdash;one of the most efficient teachers of his subject in Ireland&mdash; he was a teacher in the college when I was there, and I find that his income is £190 a year, plus £75&mdash;or £265 in all. It would be better for him if he had joined the police.  I turn to other colleges and I find salaries of £140 a year, £160 a year, £40 a year, £60 a year and so on.  I find that Miss Mary McSwiney, whose name caught my eye, is teaching in St. Ita's High School, Cork, and she has £247 a year.  Miss Annie MacSwiney has £185 with a house, fire and light, so those women in this respect are a little better off than men.  It is a miserable state of things that after all the talk and public discussion, after all the Board's inquiries, committee's reports and commissions that we are still talking about the same thing, the lack of co-ordination <Col N="2597" /> among primary, secondary and University education, and the failure of the public to appreciate the fact of priceless service rendered to the nation by men who devote themselves to education.  Unless a man is in the limelight nowadays no one imagines he is doing anything for his country.  No attention is paid unless you are throwing bombs.  I gave a typical case of a man who served his country long and faithfully as a devoted and efficient teacher. He has no pension rights, no contract, and if his employment was terminated to-morrow he would legally have no grievance and the country would not concern itself in the least as to his fate. And we expect to reconstruct this Nation and to repair the intellectual and moral damage done all through the country and to build up an Irish Ireland again, and we think we can draw upon an educated community for their services in schools to make of the coming generation, good citizens and good Irishmen, and we do not think that we cannot draw teachers into that profession when there are other walks of life which will remunerate them better and in which their activities will be much better appreciated by the public.  The public is notoriously ungrateful to those who serve it.  Here is a small class, limited in number, and its case could in some slight measure be met if we could only enlist the sympathy of the public.  There is no use setting up another Commission, the Moloney Commission has already investigated this salaries question; they took all the evidence that could be got together and it is available for our purpose.  I apologise to the Dáil for being so long and I thank you for your indulgence.</P>

      <P>I would like to stress one point on which a great deal of weight has been laid by previous speakers.  I do not want to dilate on the miseries of one of the most useful sections of the community and the most ill-rewarded.  We hope that in the near future a weighty and comprehensive scheme of legislation will be presented to the Dáil in which these grievances of the Secondary teachers will be removed. These Estimates to-day are a record of failures.  The very form in which they are presented tells the history of a failure over the whole page before <Col N="2598" /> that Act of legislation was presented. Before the new order has been adopted there is a period, and I think Deputy Whelehan saw this when he proposed that you should quadruple if possible the grant under (B), that is the Birrell Grant.  The grant under (C) is more or less a failure.  Money that should have gone to the teachers has been diverted at least to some extent to the manager, but there is no assurance that he will get all the increase that has been voted under the head of (C).  But I would like to ask the Minister of Education is it possible to make an emergency grant in this interval between the old and the new?  It is not sufficient to hold out once more hope to these teachers.  They cannot live on it and have very nutritious diet.  They cannot pay their bills. I hope the Minister for Education can see his way to bridge this financial gap.</P>

      <P>The Intermediate Board in this report which was laid upon the table of the Dáil point out what their policy has been and the policy they would recommend. Since 1906 the general trend of their policy has been towards combining, as far as their statutory powers permitted, an efficient system of inspection with the system of examination.  According to the report for the year 1916 they desire first the abolition of the restriction which makes the School Grant depend entirely on examinations.  (2) The adoption of a system whereby examination and inspection should have each a large share in determining their Grant. To attain these objects, they have long been in favour of abolishing the present examinations and substituting for them an examination for an &ldquo;Intermediate&rdquo; and also for a &ldquo;Leaving&rdquo; Certificate. The School Grant should be a Capitation Grant paid to schools which satisfy the required conditions on all pupils between certain prescribed ages who have been in regular attendance throughout the year.  The Capitation Grant should be greater for students between the ages of 16 and 19 than for those under 16 years of age, and then their closing aspiration is &ldquo;The Board are satisfied that whatever changes the future may bring to Irish education, progress can only be made along the lines pointed out by them in their Reports during a series of years, the provision of sufficient <Col N="2599" /> funds for Secondary education, proper salaries, increments and pensions for teachers, with due security of tenure, and the abolition of the payment of results fees dependent on the examination results of individual students. These reforms which they have unavailingly advocated in the past will, they trust, be brought into operation under the new Government.&rdquo;  The public who criticise the Intermediate Board with such asperity, knowing very little of its productive work would, I think, be surprised to know that the Intermediate Board was opposed to the Chinese system of examination and the paying of teachers on the results of a paper examination, and has advocated and advocated very strenuously the substitution of inspection, and on one occasion the Commissioners arranged to resign in a body unless their demand for a body of permanent inspectors was complied with by the British Treasury.  Now, I venture to suggest that the Intermediate Board's recommendations here are worth the consideration of this Dáil as indicating the lines upon which future progress might proceed, and I would recommend them more particularly to the notice of the Minister for Education.</P>

      <P>It is hardly necessary for me to delay much longer in making a reply to the statements that have been made, because I think those who have spoken so intelligently on the subject of Intermediate education know exactly how the question stands, and how I stand in the matter. I say this much that it would be not only a calamity but a very gross injustice if funds, that may be forthcoming in any shape or form, were not provided in continuing the provision of the late interim grant.  Deputy O'Connell raised the whole question of the position of Secondary teachers&mdash;and he was followed by other Deputies.  There are three points&mdash; salary, tenure of office and pensions, on which I do not think there is a single person alive who, speaking conscientiously, would deny that in these respects the position of Secondary teachers is gravely unsatisfactory.  I do not say it with regard to justice, with regard to the men and women concerned, but in regard to the public interested and the right education of their children.  At the same <Col N="2600" /> time I think it is recognised by all that there are very great difficulties in the case, difficulties in the way of settlement, and some of the difficulties are inherent in the case as it stands.  The fact that you have devoting themselves to this work of Secondary education two different classes of persons, those who come as individuals, and who may be married or unmarried or at all events keep house for themselves in the outside world, and those who join communities whether they are in Holy Orders or not is an essential fact in the case.  They join communities and live community life, and the circumstances between the two are totally different. Then there are those who form communities and who have a proprietoral interest in the schools, whereas others have only the relation of being connected on whatever the terms may be.  The whole of that will have to be faced, and it will have to be faced on a two-fold basis, justice to the persons concerned and educational efficiency. Deputy O'Connell asked me with regard to the cases of the twelve teachers dismissed in Limerick.  I am still acquiring information on that subject. Of course it is known that I can only acquire such information as people voluntarily supply me with.  I was asked a question by Deputy Cathal O'Shannon some time ago with regard to teachers dismissed in another school in Dundalk.  He asked me whether I would enquire into this matter.  Well, I have enquired into it, and I think in justice to the school concerned&mdash;St. Mary's College, Dundalk&mdash;as the question has been raised it is proper that I should state the result of the enquiry. The following reply was received by me from the President of the College on the 7th October:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Referring to your letter of the 22nd ult., I beg to state that as President of St. Mary's College, Dundalk, I parted with three lay teachers in June last, not four as stated in the question.  The services of one of these were no longer required and I gave him three clear months' notice.  The other two were dismissed without notice for alleged misconduct calculated seriously to prejudice the welfare of the College.  I hold in writing the charges made against them by competent authorities.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then he states he will supply me with <Col N="2601" /> the further evidence of the charge.  I asked for further evidence.  Fr. McVicar writes:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I beg to call your attention to the fact that the reply which I forwarded to you on the 7th October has not yet been made public.  In justice to the College I think said reply should get as much prominence as Deputy O'Shannon's question.  In case An Dáil cannot find an opportunity of giving my reply to the public I shall deem it a duty to the College to communicate my statement to the Press.  My action in this matter is rendered all the more imperative in view of very serious threats which have reached the College in the name of the I.R.A.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think the use of the name of the I.R.A. in this matter was bogus and it illustrates the sort of elements that are let loose by the present state of things in the country.  Fr. McVicar sends me a copy of the Notice, dated the 15th November, 1922.  I suppose I had better omit names:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Notice to Frs. McVicar and Byrne.</P>
    <P>Unless N and M are reinstated in St. Mary's before one month from above date we will blow College up and execute those responsible for the unjust dismissal of those men.  Fr. McVicar should remember what the I.R.A. can do. Spies and tyrants beware.  I.R.A.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are other difficulties in this system, too.  I can remember in my own experience knowing a large number of secondary teachers who remained secondary teachers for one, two or three years and who when they became secondary teachers never intended to remain permanently, but to use that occupation somehow or other as a stepping stone towards some other walk of life.  Of course in fairness to them that occupation should be sufficiently attractive not to be used as a stepping stone, and it is right to say that when used in that way it seriously interferes with those who do not so use it.  Deputy Professor Thrift said that the legislature should get the lead.  I agree and still I believe that the lead should not come from me.  I hope that the Universities will do what they have been doing with regard to the training of Primary teachers and that they also will take this question in hands, because in the matter of education <Col N="2602" /> everything grows down.  I am afraid there is the contrary notion in many people's minds that things grow up, but in education everything grows down.  It comes as the light comes from the sun.  And the test of education is that it is the source of other educations. I do not think at this hour there is anything further that I could properly add.  It is impossible for anyone to supply a satisfactory answer to all the points that have been raised, and I do not think it is expected by those who raise them that I could supply such an answer.  I think the main object has been to bring this subject in an emphatic way before the attention of the public through their representatives, and I trust that that intention will not be disappointed, and that all the Deputies belonging to this assembly will bear it in mind that one of the heavy responsibilities that will lie upon them in the future will be to make all the provision, financial and otherwise, that is necessary, and that in their judgment they can make to remedy this very faulty state of things.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;That the Dáil in Committee, having considered the Estimates for Intermediate Education in 1922-23, and having passed a Vote on Account of £70,000 for the period to the 6th December, 1922, recommend that the full Estimate of £132,759 for the financial year 1922-23 be adopted in due course by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I would like to remind the Dáil that at the beginning of this Session I drew the attention of members to a very serious matter concerning Local Government Administration.  I refer to the appalling state of affairs in some constituencies regarding the non-collection of rates, and the effect of that upon every section of the community.  In the area that I represent at the present time, Leix and Offaly, we have arrears to the extent of <Col N="2603" /> £41,000 outstanding, in the Leix Division, and £29,000 outstanding in the Division of Offaly.  One wonders and wants to find out what is the real cause of this appalling state of affairs.  It appears to me it is largely due to a lack of civic responsibility on the part of the people who have taken advantage of the unfortunate state of affairs of the country at the present time.  These people fail to appreciate the fact that the non-payment of rates, and failure to carry out their duties in this respect will have a very dangerous effect upon themselves later on.  In this particular area there is a disposition, although there was no such disposition during the period of the Black and Tan regime, to take the view that this native Government, so far as the Free State Government is concerned, will not function.  I think they will see later on that that is only a delusion, and that those who are waiting to take advantage of the time when this visionary and far-off Republic is going to come into operation are making a mistake. They are, as it were, marking time for the day that that Republic will function, and when under a Republic that would suit them it would make arrangements so that they would be deprived of carrying out their responsibilities in this particular direction.  Now, I would like to remind the Minister for Local Government that in my opinion, at any rate, the non-payment of these rates is due to some extent to the laxity on the part of the rate collectors themselves. I know cases where farmers offered the rates to the collector and where they were refused.  The rate collectors in these cases say that under the present circumstances, with armed robbers all around this area, it would not be safe for them to take the money.  On the other hand, there is a belief, at least I am convinced of this, that the rate collectors, not being in the position of being dependent entirely for their livelihood on the poundage or commission derived from these collections, are not very much worried on that account, and on that account also are not doing what I think they should have done in this direction.  It is well known in this area, and I think in other areas as well, that the collectors are either small or large farmers or shopkeepers, who have other means of earning a living besides the poundage or commission derived from <Col N="2604" /> the collection of the rates.  Now in the area of Leix where this very large sum is outstanding, up to the end of last year, on going through the list which I have seen in some cases amounts are due by people of £40 upwards, showing that it is the larger farmers and big landowners who are responsible for the non-payment of these rates.  We have in the Leix area at the present time, as a result of the non-payment of rates, to face the fact that 330 road workers were disemployed on the 18th of last month, and up to that date had been working for three weeks without any remuneration.  I understand that since that date, an arrangement or an agreement was come to whereby these workers are going back to their positions and waiting for the day, which I hope is not far away, when the County Council will be in a position to pay what they already owe and for the work the men are now doing.  I think that is a terrible state of affairs, and I hope the Minister will take steps to remedy the position as far as that particular area is concerned.  One might think of trying to remedy that state of affairs, and one particular thing occurs to me which might be done by the Minister or the Government.  The Government are aware that in this particular area the troops are practically free from attacks, so far as the Irregulars are concerned, and I can see no more useful or necessary work at the present time than that the troops should give some assistance or protection to the collectors to carry out this very important work.  They might by arrangement serve notices area by area that on certain days the troops or some other means of protection would be afforded to rate collectors, who would call on the people who owe this money to pay it to the Government.  I presume, at a later date, all defaulters or people who would not pay rates, under such circumstances as I have mentioned, if the Government agreed to carry out an arrangement of that kind, will be dealt with through the Courts that I believe and hope will function at a very early date.  I raise the matter, simply because I believe Local Government Administration is the very prop upon which the Administration of the National Government depends, and if you let local Government Administration in this and other areas collapse, then I believe we are wasting our time here in trying to <Col N="2605" /> carry on the National Government of this country.  We have also to face the fact that the non-payment of rates such as I have referred to in these cases, will, if it has not already had very serious effects on the suffering and sick poor catered for in the hospitals and lunatic asylums.  I hope that will be taken into consideration, too, and that people, particularly people who owe these rates and who expect that the roads and all these things will be kept going by the County Councils and the National Government will recognise things, and if they do not recognise the duties that fall upon them under any system of Government, that this Government will let them see, and I believe they can, that the Free State Government is going to function in this country.  I make the suggestion that the military should give some hand, especially in this area that is so free from Irregular activities, and I hope that the Government will adopt the suggestion, or adopt some other reasonable or effective means that will compel those people to realise and recognise their civic responsibilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>MINISTER for HOME AFFAIRS (Mr. Kevin O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Davin has done a service, not merely to his constituency and mine, but to the country in drawing attention to this matter.  He has put his finger upon a very vital factor in the present situation. Vested interests grow rapidly, and there are vested interests in disorder and vested interests in civil tumult.  Vested interests have grown up even round this horrible state of affairs that we have had in this country since last January.  There are people so shortsighted as to favour resistance to the present Government, not so much in any doctrinaire spirit, not so much resisting it because it is a particular form of Government rather than another form of Government, but simply in a spirit of resistance to the establishment of any Government whatsoever; because the establishment and consolidation of any form of Government would mean that they would have to pay what they owe, whether rates or rents or land annuities.  We are not at grips at the moment so much with any politicalism or any Republicanism, or anything like that, as with that kind of foolish, shortsighted anarchy that has a vested interest in disorder.  I remember on one occasion, <Col N="2606" /> before there was any native Government established or recognised here, appealing in my capacity as Assistant Minister of Local Government to the heads of the Labour Union for assistance in this matter of rate collection.  I asked them to circularise their branches, pointing out that the failure to pay rates was a direct blow at the community as a whole, but more particularly at the very poorest and most helpless elements in the community.  That appeal was well and generously met, and met in a spirit of recognition of the fact that what was stated was so.  The man who takes advantage of the disturbed political conditions to keep his rates in his pocket is a defaulter and is striking at the sick, at the poor and at the insane.  The first to feel the blow are the poor, just as in Leix the first pinch came on the unfortunate employees of the local authorities whose weekly wages could not be met.  A public service has been done by drawing attention to this matter. Deputy Davin is right when he says that the courts will shortly function in that area, and the magistrates and the Civic Guard will get their instructions to do everything possible to expedite and enforce the collection of rates.  But, in addition to that we must have the intelligent support of the general public in this matter.  A healthy, intelligent public spirit on this matter of the payment of rates would work more wonders than any courts or any police force. Certainly, as an auxiliary to the courts and to the police force, it will be invaluable. I am glad that such an earnest appeal was made here, as the appeal that has been made by my colleague. If people would only think and see the possible reaction of their conduct, they would scarcely persist in it. It is a fair test to apply to any man's conduct in a matter of this kind to ask what would be the effect if it were raised to a general standard of action?  What would the result be if all his neighbours did the same?  Let any man visualise the state of affairs that would be brought about in a county or in any area by the complete cessation of rate payment.  It means the closing of the hospitals, of the unions, the neglect of all sanitary regulations and roads going into disuse.  It means the decay of that community.  The man who says &ldquo;Let others pay, I won't,&rdquo; that man is picking <Col N="2607" /> his neighbour's pockets; he is trying to shoulder off on his neighbours the burden that he should properly share, and the burden of which he should share his just proportion. There is no excuse for that.  It is no use to say: &ldquo;I am Anti-Treaty; I will pay nothing.&rdquo;  Pro-Treaty or Anti-Treaty, let a man have whatever political creed he wishes, but he should bear his share of the public expenses that are vital to the decent life of the community. We are up against that vested interest in disorder, and that vested interest in disorder will have to be met and beaten by the courts, met and beaten by the agents of the Government, but, above all, met and beaten by a healthy independent public opinion.</P>

      <P>On looking over these Estimates I am very much concerned to find a considerable reduction in some of the activities that very properly could be called Public Health matters. I am quite sure the Minister will be able to explain as to these.  I have heard, first of all, a suggestion put forth that in the Estimates for 1921-1922 the Six Counties were included.  If that be so, of course the explanation is there afforded. The first item I find here is, as far as Child Welfare and schools for mothers are concerned the Estimate is cut down by £3,700.  I take it that this money is given to subsidise the voluntary institutions that are working in this very important direction&mdash;that is in looking after child welfare and cases of expectant mothers, and the training of mothers who already have families.  The second point is more important still.  Under the heading of the medical treatment, etc., of school children I find £40 is placed for this year's estimates, as against £7,500. If my explanation is correct&mdash;namely, that this is due to the fact that the Six Counties are not included, then I say that it is not to the credit of the Twentysix counties that the amount of money <Col N="2608" /> to be spent in this coming year is £40. In 1919 the English Act provided that the County Councils should or must undertake schemes for the medical treatment of school children.  This is one of the most important matters, to my mind, that can be undertaken&mdash;to look after the children, to look after their teeth, throats and eyes, and particularly to look after the chests of the children who may become tubercular.  These are extremely important matters.  I should like in this connection to ask the Minister for Local Government, when he mentioned that a Bill was being prepared at the present time&mdash;whether that Bill which is in preparation is merely a Bill to legalise what already was done by the last Dáil, or whether this Bill that is coming in now is really a comprehensive Bill to include the many suggested improvements that I touched upon yesterday evening. The third point is the treatment of tuberculosis.  I do not know whether my argument applies again or not.  I know that many years ago Lady Aberdeen told us that if we adopted the measures she was pursuing, tuberculosis would soon die out in Ireland.  Unfortunately tuberculosis is still with us and I should be sorry to think that this reduction means that the activities in connection with the treatment and prevention of tuberculosis were being lessened. I may say at once that I willingly accept reductions in Estimates when those reductions mean better administration, but I would deplore reductions very much if they were to lessen the activities of bodies or institutions or measures that are doing an immeasurable amount of good for the public health of the country.  I see that the specific Grant-in-aid to Peamount has been reduced from £6,000 to £2,300.  I should like to know the reason the Minister for Local Government has for reducing this amount.  There are several other matters I should like to refer to but the evening is getting late.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamSears" hpid="Mr. WM. SEARS Mr. WM. SEARS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WM. SEARS</NameTxt>
      <P>I think every Deputy will support any grant directed towards doing away with tuberculosis, but the ordinary layman has to complain that there is great diversity of opinion as to the proper methods of treating it.  Some doctors are opposed to the sanitorium system and favour other systems.  I for one would be <Col N="2609" /> opposed to a large expenditure in this direction until the Medical Authorities are more decided as to the advantages of the system.  There is another item in this Estimate that I wish to refer to. I see here that the Provisional Government proposes to import into this country in the coming year £1,876 worth of vaccine lymph.  Last year they imported £1,460 worth of it.  I think that would have been enough without increasing the amount by £416.  I am one of those who think this thing of vaccination is one of the jokes of a very serious and great profession.  There is a greater diversity of opinion amongst the doctors on this question than there is amongst the laymen.  In England they had to recognise this diversity of opinion, and there up to some years ago vaccination was compulsory.  Then an exemption clause was introduced, and now vaccination is not compulsory, and there are thousands and millions of children in England to-day unvaccinated.  Small-pox has appeared in London, and there are thirty or forty cases, and if these unvaccinated children were really in danger it would have spread like wildfire.  There are people in this country, as well as in England, who really believe vaccination is no more a protection against small-pox than a sheet of paper is a protection against a bullet.  The idea of persecuting the poor children by inflicting this injury upon them and by putting this impure lymph into them is simply ridiculous.  I cannot but admire my courage.  I have a doctor on each side of me and another behind me.  In speaking about this, however, I am armed with the highest medical opinion.  For instance, the Encyclopedia Britannica, in dealing with the subject of vaccination, engaged, I have no doubt, the best doctor in England to enquire into its scientific foundation.  He found it had no scientific foundation, and that it was a delusion.  As Sir Alfred Wallace has called it, &ldquo;it was the most grotesque delusion of modern times.&rdquo; There are people who hold strong opinions on this question.  When we want the doctors we are glad to get their pills or their bottles, but the idea of them coming and forcibly catching hold of you, scratching your arm, and putting some foul concoction that they call lymph into it, and making you sick, is an extraordinary thing altogether.  I believe this is really a joke on the part of the doctors, <Col N="2610" /> because theirs is such a serious profession they must have something on which to vent their sense of humour.  In the Co. Wexford they have such an opinion on this question that they resolved not to have their children vaccinated, and about a dozen of them went to jail in Waterford, before going to jail became the fashion, rather than have their children vaccinated.  I am at one with Sir James Craig in what he said here the other evening about doing away with disease, but anyone as old as I am, or those who are not will have heard it from their parents, will remember that 30 or 40 years ago all the fever hospitals in Ireland had a large population; there were two or three hundred in each. Owing to sanitation, owing to better housing, all these dirt diseases were removed, and the fever hospitals are practically empty now.  Vaccination is not credited in the slightest degree.  Good sanitation, good housing and better food drove away typhoid and measles and smallpox and other diseases, and vaccination had as little to do with it as the flowers that bloom in the spring, and the doctors know that very well.  I am surprised to see a very sensible man like Sir James Craig talking about vaccination. I am sure in his heart and soul he does not believe in it at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrVincentJWhite" hpid="Dr. WHITE Dr. WHITE">
      <NameTxt>Dr. WHITE</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at one with Deputy Sears that there should not be an undue amount of money spent on the management of sanitoria, but, at the same time, I for one hold that sanitoria should not be abolished.  We know that, strictly speaking, there is no absolute cure for pulmonary consumption, but, having watched the results of patients after being treated in sanitoria, I am satisfied these sanitoria should be retained.  The one solid fact, to my mind, that Deputy Sears mentioned when he was speaking about sanitoria and tuberculosis, was that the best thing we could do for our people in the matter of overcoming tuberculosis was the building of houses. I hold that Public Health generally can be improved principally by good housing for our people.  Down in Waterford, owing to the goodness of the Government, we have gone on rapidly with our housing scheme. We have forty houses under construction at present and twenty of them are nearing completion.  We hope to get on with a further Scheme.  I for one believe <Col N="2611" /> that until we get houses for our people, and houses in abundance, money spent on public health, unless a large amount of it goes to the building of houses, is so much money thrown away. Now I was sorry to hear the learned Deputy Sears speaking in a rather frivolous manner about vaccination.  I for one am satisfied that vaccination is a preventive against small-pox&mdash;absolutely. I visited our National Lymph Institute in Sandymount about a fortnight ago, and I can assure the Deputy, An Ceann Comhairle, and the Dáil generally, that the vaccine there is produced under the most aseptic conditions, and it is tested by one of the greatest physiologists in the country at present.  There is no question about the purity of vaccine in Ireland.  As I say it is tested by bacteriologists before any of the lymph is supplied to practitioners throughout the country.  Now I do not wish to create a scare, but we must recollect that small-pox is prevalent in England at present, and that it is a virulent type of small-pox.  I think the number of deaths is nearly 50 per cent.  Now as I said before, I for one have no hesitation in saying that vaccination is a preventive against small-pox. Should a person who has been vaccinated be so unfortunate as to get small-pox I am satisfied the disease would be in a greatly modified form.  The only thing is I do not believe in forcing anything on anybody, but I certainly believe that everyone should be vaccinated, and there is not the slightest chance of any loathsome disease being communicated to children or adults by using Irish vaccine.  I have consulted some of the oldest and most skilled of our profession in Dublin, and they to a man have told me that they are satisfied that lymph vaccine is practically a specific against small-pox.  I for one am absolutely satisfied that it is; in fact I intend getting myself re-vaccinated some of these days.  I was vaccinated when I was a child, and again when there was an outbreak in 1901, and as vaccine and its effects only holds good against disease for about seven years, that is one of the reasons I think it is essential and very important that extra watchfulness and care should be exercised by the Port Sanitary Authorities and by the public authorities in Ireland generally that have to do with any of the <Col N="2612" /> ports where vessels come from the other side.  As I say, I do not want to create a scare, but at the same time we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that on the other side they have small-pox.  I do not treat this matter in a spirit of levity. I look upon it as a very important matter. I do not know if my friend Deputy Sears was vaccinated when a child, but if he was not I think it would be a very wise thing to get vaccinated now.</P>

      <P>I wish to dwell for a few moments on some of the items in this Estimate.  First, I would like the Minister for Local Government to answer a question with regard to Child Welfare.  I see in 1922 the sum for this was £10,700, and for 1922-1923, £7,000, a decrease of £3,700.  Now I think it is the duty of this Government to see that the children of the soldiers who died for the freedom of their country since 1916 should be included in this.  Their mothers should be helped to educate them, and should get some help from the Government for their maintenance. I know a case in my own constituency where a woman lost two sons during the time that the British Government tried to force their rule on the Irish people by the sword and revolver. This particular woman has received nothing from the Government, although one of her sons was shot in Ballykinlar, and another was shot outside Athlone.  I hope the Minister for Local Government will see that such cases are looked after.  Another woman, newly married, suffered somewhat similarly, as her husband was also shot in Ballykinlar, the one bullet killing the two.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. LYONS</NameTxt>
      <P>All right, but I think I am entitled on the question of child welfare and schools for mothers to go into this matter to try and see if something can possibly be done for the widows and orphans of those men who laid down their lives for the freedom of the country.  With regard to the medical treatment for school children I see a decrease under that head of £7,460. Now I wonder do the Government intend to put that decrease as an increase on the rates on the local bodies where <Col N="2613" /> the schools are situated.  Do they expect that the County Councils and the District Councils are going to supply an additional rate in order to make up the amount of the deficit in this Estimate? With reference to the treatment of tuberculosis I have heard some of the learned doctors speaking here on the subject, but as a workingman I think that there is a great deal more spent in curing tuberculosis than is spent in preventing the spread of the disease.  One of the proper methods of endeavouring to prevent it would be to get the County Councils to adopt the Diseases of Animals Act that was in being in Ireland up to 1920.  A majority of the County Councils have not this Act working, and the milk from tubercular cows is distributed to workers' children in the towns.  In that way tuberculosis is spread.  With regard to the item &ldquo;County Council Administration Grants,&rdquo; these grants supplied to County Councils will, I hope, be taken into account by the Minister for Local Government.  I want to deal with this particular item in order to get a sufficient guarantee from this Government on behalf of the Council that I have the honour to be member for, that is Westmeath County Council, and to see, if possible, that it shall be applied for the relief of the unemployed in that county for the coming year. Heretofore grants were paid for steam-rolling to each County Council by way of 50 per cent. of the expenditure by the County Council for steam-rolling.  Furthermore, all the taxes collected on motor cars were repayable to the County Councils from the Ministry of Transport for the maintenance of the roads.  I hope that the present Ministry of Local Government will also follow the same tactics in having the money collected in each county in motor taxes refunded to the county in which it is collected, in order to give employment by way of road work.  There is another item that I wish to mention to the Minister for Local Government, and that is the capitation grant to the mental hospitals.  About thirty-three years ago these were about 4s. per head, which meant about 50 per cent. of the cost of maintenance.  At the present time the cost of the maintenance of patients in the district hospital of Mullingar is about 24s. 6d.  The ratepayers <Col N="2614" /> of the three counties which are contributing in the rates for the maintenance of these patients, which number something about 1,313, have to bear the full cost of the maintenance, which means something like £50,000 in the present year.  I think it is only right that, as everything else has been increased, that these capitation grants should also be increased, in order to relieve the ratepayers of these counties who are contributing for the maintenance of these patients, because I can assure you that they have quite enough to pay&mdash;more than the majority are able to.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I could save time by doing that.  In the case of the first, <i>(l)</i>&ldquo;Child Welfare and Schools for Mothers, etc.,&rdquo; the state of affairs is that the Ministry refunds to certain local authorities and to certain voluntary agencies, of which there is a very large number, half their total expenditure. Now, owing to the state of the country, the amount expended and the work done by various local authorities and by the voluntary agencies have been very much decreased. Consequently, the amount estimated for by us was decreased.  The same thing applies to item <i>(n)</i>&ldquo;Grants for the Provision of Meals for School Children.&rdquo; This Act has been taken up by only a very small number of local authorities in the country&mdash;Dungarvan, Enniscorthy, Fermoy, Dublin, Listowel, Wexford, Kilkenny, Dun Laoghaire, and, in fact, I do not know whether it is in operation in all of those. The Ministry pays half of the expenditure again, so that we do not really control the amount that is being expended on these heads.  The degree of expenditure is determined to a large extent <Col N="2615" /> by the local authorities taking up the scheme, and the extent to which they carry it out.  At present there is a difficulty in regard to that particular matter.  Owing to some slip in the drafting of the Act, grants are only paid in regard to National schools, and cannot be paid as regards other Primary schools, as, for instance, Christian Brothers' schools.  I think that that was not intended.  Coming to item <i>(o)</i>&ldquo;Medical Treatment of School Children.&rdquo; In the previous year the sum of £7,500 was voted, but I do not think that any was expended.  In the year before that a sum of £8,000, had been voted for, and none was expended.  In the year before £1,000 had been voted, and none was expended, for whatever reason, and it is a thing to be looked into.  This Act is practically not worked at all.  In one area it is being taken up.  There are a few small voluntary dental clinics which get small grants.  They are at Malahide, Milltown, Rathgar and Crumlin, all in the neighbourhood of Dublin.  It may be that the regulations are at fault, but, in any case so far the scheme of medical treatment of school children is practically not operated.  In regard to the treatment of tuberculosis, again the amount to be estimated for is determined by the local authorities, and by the Insurance Committees, to some extent.  The Ministry pays half of the amount expended. Some counties, I think, have dropped their tuberculosis scheme, but they may take them up again as we arrive at more normal conditions.  In regard to the grants for Peamount Sanatorium, there was a special grant for repairs to the sanatorium which had fallen into serious disrepair.  The unexpended balance of last year's Vote is being asked for again. There was a total Vote last year of £6,000, of which £3,700 was expended, and the balance £2,300, is being re-voted. These, I think, are the principal items in which a decrease appears in the Estimate.</P>

      <P>It is very seldom that anyone hears me asking for more money for a department, but I think that the burden of the local rates in the country is not put on the right shoulders, and that the incidence of taxation should not fall so heavily and with such tremendous weight as it is doing upon the shoulder of the farmer.  For that reason I would like this vote to be greater, and that the expenses placed upon County Councils should be treated more as part of the expenditure by the State.  For instance, if you take the two counties, that are the doorsteps of Dublin, that is Wicklow and Kildare, you will find that the roads there are maintained by the County Councils, but the traffic comes from Wexford on the one side and from Galway on the other.  Motor cars are flying along and we, the farmers, are looking at them from the green fields and noting the amount of dust they create.  Where is the justice in taxing people like us for the upkeep of roads used by people outside in that matter? I would suggest to the Minister for Local Government the necessity for having all main roads made a public charge and to differentiate between them and local taxation.  Similarly I do not see why because a man owns a farm and a house, he should be obliged to pay for the upkeep of human derelicts of society and to the upkeep of hospitals here and there.  These are all really matters for the State and not matters for local taxation.  We have come to the position that unless there is some relief from this burden of taxation the farming industry will be driven to bankruptcy.  It is on the general question of the incidence of local taxation that I am now speaking, and I hope the Minister will take these matters into account and especially the matters of the roads.</P>

      <P>I desire to call attention to Item A under the special sub-head for salaries.  I do not know what the higher grades are paid in these offices, but I have heard complaints <Col N="2617" /> made of the smallness of the allowances made to the under-grades, and that they are not paid a living wage in any of the offices run by the Government.  I wish to refer particularly to the rate paid to shorthand-typists, who only receive something like £2, £2 2s., or £2 5s. per week.  Most of these ladies are very highly educated; many of them come up from the country and have to take lodgings in hotels or other buildings, and I do not think that £2 per week, or £2 2s. 4d., is sufficient to carry them through, and I would like that this £11,000 of increase be applied to the relief of this class of worker.  Another item to which I wish to call attention is that of the salaries of auditors and their travelling expenses.  It is a fairly substantial sum&mdash;£20,000.  I have some experience of local government, and, as far as my recollection serves me, I think I am right in saying that the local bodies pay for the auditing of their accounts. There is a taxed bill sent in to the different local bodies, and they have to pay for the auditing of their accounts, and I would like to know how this item of £20,000 arises.</P>

The Minister for Agriculture will remember he had communication from a number of persons in Meath with regard to the Trimblestown estate there, and there was considerable delay.

      <P>I would like to get some information with regard to the housing of the working classes.  We heard statements from members of the medical profession as to their opinion about sanatorium treatment.  As a layman, I am not in a position to give an opinion upon that; but whether sanatorium treatment is good or bad, if you take a patient from a slum, send him to a sanitorium, and, after treatment, send him back to live in a bad, insanitary house, the money you are spending on sanatorium treatment is absolutely wasted.  The Ministry should concentrate upon seeing the people in the various cities and towns are housed under proper sanitary conditions.  Sanatorium treatment is absolutely useless, unless people are provided with proper houses to live in.  I take it, that the amount mentioned in the estimates is the sum that will be spent at the end of the financial year out of the one million grant made by the Provisional Government.  I congratulate the Ministry on the step they took during this financial year in coming to the aid of the municipal authorities in providing this money.  I hope they will be as generous in the coming year.  I know we are living in very difficult times, and that it is difficult to look ahead, but the Ministry are well aware of the serious state of affairs in the towns and in the cities, and I hope they will concentrate upon the housing question.  Since the beginning of 1914, owing to the cost of materials, and to the expense of building houses, the housing question was neglected. Things were bad in 1914 before the war started, but everybody will agree they are infinitely worse to-day, and I hope the Minister will pay special attention to the subject raised by Deputy Morrissey, in regard to the amalgamation of unions. I agree with the principle of amalgamation. It has been worked in Wexford, but some parts of the county are not in favour of it.  I advocated it right through, but I think the time has arrived when a commission ought to be set up to ascertain what exactly it is that the country wants in this direction.  It is quite true that various pet schemes are being put forward. <Col N="2619" /> People form a kind of village pump idea, and raise questions as to where the village hospitals and the county home should be situated.  A commission should be appointed to find out the best possible centres, so that the whole matter should receive the attention it deserves.  While some people resent the interference of the Ministry, I think it is absolutely necessary that the Ministry should interfere in matters of this kind.  There is another item dealing with the grant of the provision of meals for children.  Personally, I am sorry to see a decrease under that head, considering the economic conditions in the country to-day, and the great amount of unemployment.  The personnel of the Boards for the past two or three years is not the same as it was when the Necessitous Children Act was first placed before them, and they did not take advantage of it at that time, but if the matter was placed before them again, it would enable the Boards to do something for the unfortunate poor children whose parents are unemployed.</P>

In connection with that I have sent in recommendations to the Minister who, I hope, is dealing with them.  With regard to the reinstatement of a nurse, a reinstatement has been ordered by the Minister some time ago&mdash;in last June or July&mdash; and which, according to my information, has not been carried out.

      <P>The question that Deputy Day touched upon is one of considerable interest, and would deserve a reasoned statement from the Minister. I do not refer specially to the case which he mentioned, because I know nothing about it, but I do ask for information as to the experience of the Ministry with regard to this very important experiment of the substitution of the Guardians' authority by the appointment of Vice-Guardians in the case of Cork, and Super-Guardians in other cases.  It is to me quite a possibility that the experiment may have proved perfectly successful&mdash; that this very large administrative body for such an institution as a Board <Col N="2620" /> of Guardians is not satisfactory.  I do not know, and I am not coming down on any particular side, but it is of very great importance to know what the Ministry thinks of the general principle, and of the application of that principle, as in Cork and Dublin.  It is of very great importance to the future of local government to know whether the experiment of practically abolishing the local authority, and putting in the place of that local authority certain Commissioners with almost autocratic powers, has resulted in better administration, not merely a saving of the rates, but greater economy in the true sense.  I think the Dáil and the country would appreciate a full statement from the Minister on that particular item.  Questions that were raised by Deputy Sir James Craig have been answered in a way I expected, but I would hope and urge upon the Ministry that they should carry out the suggestion that at least for the coming year, and perhaps for the concluding part of the present financial year, the Ministry should stimulate the local authorities to put into operation those particular Acts which apparently they have neglected. After all, the local authorities are apt very often to be negligent of their opportunities when there is a risk, as there is at the present time, of increasing the rates or failure to reduce them. But here there is a positive need for action, and that action ought to be stimulated by a central authority.  A good deal has been said about tuberculosis and the value of sanatoria treatment, and also on the need for good homes.  I just want to put in one word which too often is forgotten, and I am somewhat of a heretic on this question. I want to say that the primary need in the great majority of cases is good food and plenty of it.  And perhaps Deputy Wilson will appreciate the point when I say that if there were three times the quantity of new milk consumed by the children of Ireland as is and has been, there would be very much less tuberculosis, and my treatment of tuberculosis in its early stages, and even in its middle stages, is plenty of milk, plenty of eggs, and plenty of beef steak.</P>

      <P>A Chinn Chomhairle, there is a point in what Deputy <Col N="2621" /> Wilson said in reference to the roads.  Of course there are grants for road expenditure, and that question is one that must come under consideration in connection with the general reforms of local government&mdash;the scheme which must come up before this Dáil within a year or less.  Amalgamation schemes have been carried out in all counties but three, and the Ministry is very satisfied that the principle of amalgamation has justified itself.  It will be necessary to work towards a standard scheme, and, as soon as possible, that work will be taken in hand.  The Bill which is in preparation at the present time for presentation to the Dáil is merely a Bill to legalise what has already been done and to permit of certain smaller consequential changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cork amalgamation scheme has not gone very far, and I agree with Deputy Day that it has failed in several respects.  So far as Nurse Dean is concerned, I have nothing further to add to what I said recently in reply to the Deputy.  As regards the system of appointing Vice-Guardians or Commissioners, that has been given no fair trial under normal conditions.  Under the conditions under which it was tried it was very successful indeed.  Large economies were effected and increased efficiency was secured.  Whether when the abuses which had grown up for a period of years under the ordinary system of administration had been swept away, it would be found that Commissioners or Vice-Guardians could do good work, is a matter which certainly remains to be seen.  The various Vice-Guardians who entered into power did so at the time when institutions had not been too well conducted, and there was a great deal of work for them to do, and work which they were very well able to do and did exceedingly well.  They were appointed, of course, to do work of officials that already existed, and, as a matter of fact, we have a Commissioner and Vice-Guardians along with the old officials.  We have two sets of people actually doing, or supposed to be doing, the same work, and if we were to appoint a small number of officials or a single official in a particular workhouse, charged with the entire supervision and given full powers in the way that these Vice-Guardians were given, we would have to go into the matter <Col N="2622" /> with a view to devising a suitable scheme for carrying on that experiment under somewhat normal conditions, because, of course, what were people to do when these experiments were starting? They could not very well be done at the present time, especially when the big growth of laxity, and perhaps abuse, which they found in the beginning had already been swept away.  Deputy Lyons spoke about the proceeds of the motor tax.  The unfortunate fact is that up to quite recently no collections practically had taken place.  It is now going on, and we hope it will improve.  Deputy F. McGuinness referred to the increase in Item A&mdash;&ldquo;Salaries, Wages and Allowances.&rdquo;  Now that increase is due to the amalgamation of the old Local Government staff and the Dáil Local Government staff.  Previously they appeared on separate Estimates, presented to separate houses.  It does not mean that the actual number of people engaged in the work of the Local Government Department has increased. In point of fact it has actually decreased, because a large number of the people whose salaries appeared in this Estimate are at present on loan to other Departments.  For instance, about 40 have been lent out since the 1st April to various other Departments, including Home Affairs and Board of Works, one or two to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and 10 to the Army, who are engaged in dealing with dependants' allowances; another 35 are on loan doing work in connection with the Soldiers and Sailors Act.  Of course their salaries will be refunded by the British Government, so that there are actually about 75 of the Staff of the Department on loan with other Departments, and if this were a nett amount there would actually be a decrease in the amount of salaries, wages and allowances.  An increase of salaries of auditors arises in the same way.  There were a set of auditors under the Dáil Department and a set of auditors under the old Board. Some of the men who were auditors under the old Board have been transferred to other work.  One or two of them have been sent out as auditors again, and there are one or two whom I expect will go.  A few of the officials of the old Board have gone, and I think perhaps others will have to go, as they <Col N="2623" /> cannot very well be made use of under the existing conditions.  But it is extremely undesirable to discharge Civil Servants, especially if they get 17 added years and a very considerable pension for doing nothing.  Unless a Civil Servant cannot have an analogous position, or cannot be used in the work of his Department, I think it is most undesirable to burden the taxpayers with a swollen pension list.</P>

As regards the housing, as Deputies may have seen, under the Consequential Provisions Bill, which is going through the British House of Commons, a Corporation has to be created under the title, &ldquo;Soldiers and Sailors' Trust,&rdquo; and it will be given a grant of one million pounds by the British Government.  It will do the best it can for them, but, of course, there will be no responsibility on our part.</P>

      <P>I have no information. The Minister for Agriculture will deal with it.  I do not think it is necessary to emphasise what was said by Deputy Davin and the Minister for Home Affairs with regard to rate collection. Undoubtedly the failure to pay rates is a very serious matter, and is very much against the interests of the State, and the interest of the whole community, and the people who deliberately take advantage of the present conditions to withhold their rates, to upset the administration of local affairs, to in some cases prevent the adequate relief of destitution, and who cause the unemployment that must be caused by the failure of the funds of the local bodies are <Col N="2624" /> undoubtedly acting criminally.  We have taken steps to put pressure to bear on the most notable defaulters in the various areas.  Up to the present the situation was not such that the Army could be asked to assist, but we are now arriving at a time, especially with the establishment of the courts and the sending out of the Civic Guard, when we will be able to proceed and have the protection that is necessary.  I will certainly apply where necessary to the Minister for Defence for military protection for the collection of rates in all areas.  There are certain districts in the country where the behaviour of some of the ratepayers has been scandalous.  I know of counties where in the poorer districts the rates have been well paid up, and in the rich parts the rates have not been paid at all.  Now, in these cases we certainly are going to use the powers we have to see that the rates are paid.  The matter even goes farther than failure to pay rates.  In one county at least it has been impossible for a very long period to get together a meeting of the County Council or any of its committees, and I feel after the Constitution comes into operation, it will be necessary for me to ask powers from the Dáil to appoint a Commissioner, or a body of Commissioners, to carry on the work of the County Council.  At the present time the money is being paid out, and it has to be paid to enable the County Home to carry on, and also for wages. That is being done by the Treasurer on the instructions of the Ministry of Local Government, without being passed by anyone on the part of the County Council. That indicates that in that case there is a serious lack of any feeling of any civic responsibility, and that lack of civic responsibility and that shirking of one's ordinary duty is another manifestation of the struggle that is going on, to get something for nothing, or to hold on to something that should not be held on to, and it must ultimately be dealt with in the way that any manifestation of irregularism would be dealt with. As far as I am concerned, and as far as the Government generally is concerned, the people who should pay their rates, and who do not want to pay, will be made pay, and they will not escape in any way whatever, but will only suffer themselves if they drive us to go to greater extremes in the matter than we would otherwise go to.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned the great saving that had been made by the Vice-Guardians by their administration. I maintain that saving has been made at the expense of the poor, who are under their care, and in connection with that, I may point out that one of the nuns, a nursing sister in the hospital complained that she could not even get coal in one instance to boil a kettle for some patients in the hospital or milk for patients in the fever hospital.  That nun got a coal supply from money that she got from the doctors to preserve the lives of the patients.  And for doing that and refusal to tell these Vice-Guardians where she had got the money she was sent back to the Matron.  I sent the Minister for Local Government a copy of the correspondence sent to the Vice-Guardians in that case.  Another thing, since these Vice-Guardians took up control the work of looking after the buildings has not been attended to, and they are being allowed to deteriorate, with the result that where there is an apparent saving the Guardians will be faced later on with the duty of replenishing stores and repairing buildings. Another matter I would like the Minister to take note of is that the dietary scale has been lowered for the inmates both in the hospitals and workhouses generally, and in a good many cases where the inmates were getting Irish pigs' heads they have been supplied with Danish pigs' heads, with the result that the amount of meat they are getting is less in quality and less in quantity.  They have gone to the extent of importing foreign matches to effect a saving! Another thing I wrote to the Minister about was that the Vice-Guardians had a subsidiary account with the Bank, of which the Guardians knew nothing.  In one case at a meeting of Cork Chamber of Commerce the proposer of a resolution to carry on the Vice-Guardians in their position is a partner in a firm who supplied ten tons of butter to the Workhouse at a cost of over £2,000.  This was done without advertisement or competition. The Vice-Guardians tried to conceal it from the Board of Guardians by making the payment from a private account as that account would not appear in the monthly list.  At a meeting <Col N="2626" /> of the Board of Guardians last week, as a cutting from the Press will show, the firm offered to refund £200.</P>

      <P>On a point of order I think the Deputy is wandering very far indeed from the Local Government vote.  I mean, we can discuss Cork Vice-Guardians at very considerable length, but I do think it is out of order to discuss it in the way he is doing it.</P>

      <P>The Minister has shown that there has been a great saving effected by the Vice-Guardians and I am trying to show the Dáil how that saving was effected.  Now I say the saving was effected at the expense of the poor and that these Vice-Guardians put in with plenary powers should never have got the powers that they did get. It proves from the case I put the type of men they are.  I say men of that type should not be put into such a position without having, at all events, some sort of a Finance Committee or other party over them to check them, and I am sure the Minister will see that men of this type are not again put in, and that the poor, who cannot protect themselves, will be protected from this class of men.</P>

      <P>I do not want to discuss the thing very much.  I know nothing about the Vice-Guardians beyond what is reported.  I do not want to say that everything they did was perfect, or that they did not go wrong in some cases. Nor I do not in fact want to take up that controversy at all with Deputy Day. I have said what I have said in regard to that.  I can say, however, that the position of the Vice-Guardians in Cork is one which could not have been sanctioned in normal times.  They are not Vice-Guardians in the legal sense, and one of them is in fact a member of the Board of Guardians and also a paid official.  The whole thing arose in the strenuous, difficult times that we passed through a year or two ago.  The appointment could not have been made in normal times.  It is not one that could be continued for any great length of time.  If there are to be such officials with such powers they would have to be appointed in some regular way and their status will have to be defined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I did intend originally to deal at some length with this Department and its administration, but in view of the pressure of time to deal with other matters that perhaps may be considered more important I only wish to make a few observations.  Now, personally I feel that the Dáil should not be called upon to justify, or to pass a Vote so large as this, which, in my opinion, cannot be justified by any service that has been rendered to the public.  This Department was set up originally as a result of the British administration of Irish railways.  These railways having been de-controlled in August, 1921, I cannot see why the Government should continue to keep such a large staff at such a large expenditure. It is quite possible, of course, that things may happen in the near future whereby there will be a re-organisation of a Department of this kind, and it must be re-organised from what I can see of it.  It can and will perhaps in the future do more than it has done in the past.  In answer to a question which I raised the other day, Mr. Hogan on behalf of Mr. McGrath, who I regret is absent, stated that the officer at the head of this Department is responsible for the administration of work arising out of the legislation relating to tramways, <Col N="2628" /> canals, harbours, docks and piers.  I do not know what &ldquo;legislation&rdquo; means, so far as the railways are concerned, especially since they have been decontrolled. I saw some correspondence in connection with the work arising out of this Department, and, as far as I could see from the documents that I have seen from that Department, the principal portion of the work is confined to defining the Acts of Parliament or reading the Blue Books, which will have to be turned and covered with green in the near future.  I see in these Estimates an item for £16,000 for the Carrigan Award, or arising out of the Carrigan Award.  I hope that that is the last that we have heard of this Carrigan Award.  This Carrigan Tribunal was set up as a result of an agreement between two right hon. gentlemen, one a member of the Privy Council under the British House of Commons and the other a right hon. member of the Privy Council under the old regime which has disappeared.  Although they may be considered right hon. gentlemen, I think it has been proved in the course of time that they were not right nor justified in what they have done, and especially nobody was justified in doing what the Right Hon. J.H. Thomas did in agreeing to the setting up of a farcical tribunal such as this without the consent of the accredited representatives of the railwaymen in this country to deal with matters that had arisen, and as a result of this the Irish people are called upon to pay £16,000.  I hope it is the last that we have heard of this famous farcical Carrigan Award.  Then I notice a sum of £15,400 (under <i>(e)</i> Great Southern and Western Railway Company Guarantee) is asked for here.  I can speak, from ten or fifteen years' experience through acting on conferences on behalf of railwaymen, and, generally speaking, the relations between the railwaymen's unions and between the different managers representing the railway lines was very good, especially for the last two or three years; but there are one or two exceptions. The Company for which the Dáil is now called to give a vote of £15,400 is one and the principal exception.  As a general rule, this Company has only come to agreements with the leaders of the railwaymen who represented their staffs after a threat to strike or during a period of strike, and after having come to these <Col N="2629" /> agreements they have always quibbled and endeavoured to break the agreements or misinterpret what is ordinary common English language, understandable by anybody.  I hope, therefore, that when this Dáil is called upon to vote a sum of money away to a railway company in circumstances such as we are now confronted with, they will see that the company to whom the money is voted out of the public purse will honour the agreements they have already made, on behalf of the company, with the employees' representative, with whom they have made them.  I was talking to one of the higher officials of this company quite recently in connection with a case of victimisation, which is quite a common thing on this line, and his idea of the unrest on this particular company's line is that it is due to political unrest.  I do not think that is the position.  It is an entire misrepresentation of the position, and it is entirely due, as can be proved by documents, to the tyrannical and autocratic attitude of some of the high directors of this particular line.  I do not want to go very much more into this matter, in view of what has been said. Generally speaking on the Vote for this department, it has been the experience of the railwaymen's leaders, especially since the de-control of the railways, that the Transport department has not, when it has been called upon, acted impartially as between one side and the other.  A department such as this with a head who draws from the public purse £1,463 per annum, should be prepared at all times to keep the ring between contending parties.  I say positively, and with the authority of the two principal unions, that has not been the case, and I hope the Minister responsible for asking us to pass a Vote of this kind will have a friendly conversation with the individual at the head of that particular department and endeavour to persuade him that as a public servant his duty is to keep the ring and not be partial to one side or the other.</P>

      <P>I thought this would be one of the Estimates that would be non-controversial, because I think we all know exactly where we are with regard to these figures.  Certainly the Deputies on the Labour benches know pretty well what the various items cover.  Deputy Davin made a point that it is a very <Col N="2630" /> large Estimate for the amount of work that is being done.  I would point out to him that the amount under sub-head &ldquo;A&rdquo; is for salaries&mdash;£11,900.  The total Estimate is £50,355, that leaves £38,455, and this is expended as follows:&mdash;Travelling and incidental expenses, £555; payment in respect of acquisition of land for colliery railways &mdash; Wolfhill Railway, £4,500, and Castlecomer Railway, £4,000. I take it that everyone agrees that must be paid.</P>

      <P>I move the adjournment of the Dáil until 3 o'clock on Monday.  We can then finish the few outstanding Estimates.  Possibly the view might be held that to rush in a few minutes such Estimates as the Land <Col N="2631" /> Commission would be a lack of a sense of proportion.  Besides, it may be considered advisable, when we see what the position is, to call an early meeting for Tuesday for the purpose of formally inaugurating the new State, and holding, perhaps, elections to the Seanad.</P>
