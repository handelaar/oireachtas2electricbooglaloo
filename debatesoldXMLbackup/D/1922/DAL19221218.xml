      <P>I beg to ask leave of the Dáil for permission to introduce this Bill, namely &ldquo;Local Elections Postponement Bill.&rdquo;  The scope of the Bill is not a very wide one. It simply postpones to a date to be determined by order the elections of a number of borough councils, urban councils, and town commissioners, due to take place in the month of January next.  It provides also for power to postpone county council and rural council and other elections if it should be necessary.  One of the principal reasons for postponement is the state of the register.  Now, I have every hope that the register all over the country will be ready in June.  In parts of the country it will be ready by the 15th April, but in certain counties like the county of Kerry, owing to the state of affairs there, no progress has been made with the compilation of the register.  It is consequently probable that in certain parts it may not be possible to have the elections for the county councils and rural councils in June.  Consequently, power is taken in this Bill to postpone those elections also, the idea being that it should not be necessary to come to the Dáil again for another Act.  If they have to be postponed I do not think it will be necessary to postpone them for more than a month or so.  The Bill I propose will not interfere with the election of Lord Mayors, Mayors or Chairmen of County Councils.  The Mayors or Chairmen who may be elected in January next will sit only until the first meeting of the Council after the prescribed date.  So, say if the prescribed date were the 15th June, the Mayors or Chairmen elected next month would hold office until the first <Col N="342" /> meeting of the Council after the 15th June.  It is undesirable that the election of Mayors in January should be prevented.  On the other hand, it would be undesirable to prevent any Council electing their new Chairman. There is practically nothing else in the Act than that and I beg leave of the Dáil to introduce it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ask leave to introduce the Electoral Bill.  This Bill is a fairly bulky measure and with the Schedule it runs to 60 or 62 pages.  It deals with three principal branches of electoral law.  It deals with the franchise, the registration of electors, and the conduct of elections.  Matters such as personation, corrupt practices and bribery at elections are not dealt with here and will be the subject of a second Bill.  It was felt that this was a Bill sufficiently unwieldy in itself, and that there was a natural division between the rights and wrongs of election law, and for that purpose a separate Bill has been introduced, stating what the franchise is, how elections are to be carried out and conducted.  Then corrupt practices will be dealt with in the separate Bill which will be introduced as soon as possible. This particular Bill does not deal with Local Government elections at all; it scarcely deals with Local Government <Col N="343" /> franchise, except to the extent of specifying that the Local Government register is made up along with the other register.  It does not propose as it stands&mdash;there might be a small amendment&mdash;any change in the Local Government franchise.  It is a Bill primarily to carry out changes rendered necessary by the adoption of the Constitution. The Bill also provides for the holding of Senatorial Elections, although there will be no such elections for some considerable time.  It provides also for the Government to carry out the Referendum, and it provides for the issue of writs for the elections.  The writs will be issued by the Clerk of the Dáil following the direction of the Chairman of the Dáil on a Vote passed by the Dáil.  It embodies the points with regard to disqualification of persons being members of the Seanad and Dáil, passed here some time ago.  In order to enable members of the Dáil to read over the measure before the Dáil meets again after Christmas, I have had sufficient numbers of copies of the draft printed to be in the hands of Deputies.  Copies handed to Deputies to-day are not entirely complete because one Schedule has been got ready to-day in its final form and it is not in the printed copies.  However, it will be ready before the Second Reading comes on.  It is the Schedule dealing with the regulation for the registration of University Elections.  It is quite a simple Schedule and, as a matter of fact, contains practically no point of principle. I do not propose to move for a Second Reading of this Bill to-day.  I simply ask leave of the Dáil to introduce the Bill so that it may in its full form be circulated before it comes on for Second Reading in the New Year.</P>

      <P>I beg to ask leave to introduce a Bill called the &ldquo;Expiring Laws Continuance Bill.&rdquo;  It provides for the continuance of certain Acts which would, in the normal course, expire at the end of this year, or in the course of next year.  The Acts which it is proposed to continue, or part of which it is <Col N="344" /> proposed to continue, are set out in the Schedule, and I would simply ask members to take my assurance that there is nothing controversial in these Acts. They are Acts which for the most part were renewed from year to year as a matter of course and, in the unprovided lapse, would cause a certain amount of dislocation. Some few of them I might mention. There is the Corrupt Practices Act, the Locomotives Act, the Parliamentary Elections Act, the Labourers Act, the Licensing Act of 1902, which was an Act renewed from year to year, the Motor Car Act.  And I would draw special attention to the Act in the First Schedule &mdash;the Aliens Restriction Act&mdash;and it will be noted that only Section I of that Act is sought to be continued.  Section I is that giving certain discretionary powers to the Home Secretary or his Department to impose restrictions in the case of conditions of war within the country, and the vindictive restrictions that that Act does entail, passed as it was in the English Parliament at the outbreak of the late European War, are not continued; merely Section I is continued.  It is not perhaps in order to go into details of the Acts of the Schedule at this stage, but I can give an assurance that these are very largely routine measures that it was usual to pass in the past from year to year as a matter of course.  We have not sought to insert in the Schedule any Act that would be controversial or that there would be likely to be difference of opinion about.</P>

      <P>As the Local Elections Postponement Bill is in the hands of Deputies is it agreed <Col N="345" /> that Standing Orders be suspended to take the second reading of that Bill?</P>

      <P>In moving the second reading of this Bill I need hardly say anything in addition to what I have said on the first reading.  The Representation of the People Act provides that the register should be compiled in three months, but in point of fact, so far as this country is concerned, it was not possible to compile it in that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first register on that Act took five months; the second, four months; and the third, five months; and last year, although it was hardly revised at all, it was actually five and a half months after the end of the qualifying period before the register was complete.  Now, in the present circumstances, the delay is likely to be even greater.  In a few counties excellent progress has been made, and the register in some of these counties will, I believe, be ready before the 15th of April, or certainly by the 30th April. In other counties, such as Kerry, it is extremely doubtful whether it can be ready by June; consequently it may be necessary to postpone even the County Council elections.  There is another reason that might operate in favour of the postponement of the election of the Rural Councils.  There are proposals that in view of the Amalgamation Scheme the Rural Councils might with advantage be abolished.  Whether that will be found practicable or will commend itself to the Dáil remains to be seen, but in case legislation were to be introduced, say, in May, providing for the abolition of Rural Councils, and that the legislation had not passed the Dáil or was only in course when the date of the elections arrived, it might be very desirable to have powers to postpone the elections in order to see whether it would be necessary to hold them at all or not. For these reasons it has been decided to ask the Dáil for power to postpone the Co. Council and Rural Council elections, as well as the elections due to be held next month.  As I said before there will be an election of Mayors and Chairman immediately after the elections are held in June, or whatever the time may be, but the Mayors or Chairmen elected will only hold office until the following June, unless it should be decided to have summer elections always instead of in <Col N="346" /> January.  There is no doubt at all that the holding of elections during short days, with people rushing into badly-lighted Polling Booths facilitates the practice of personation, which is a matter to be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. THOS. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of this Bill in this manner warrants one in raising the question about the method of the compilation of the register, and, I think, it would be helpful to the Minister and the Department, if he would think it worth his while to direct that the compilation of the register and that the officers in charge of it should follow a uniform course throughout the country.  I am led to believe that it is very much in the option of the officer responsible for the compilation of the register in the first instance as to how he does it.  In some places it is being done by guess-work, in some cases by handing round forms to be filled in by inhabitants of houses, and in some places by rate-collectors going round and making enquiries. Sometimes it is being done with the assistance of local responsible people and sometimes in opposition to the will of local responsible people.  I gather there is a good deal of irregularity, I mean irregularity because it is not regular.  It is being done in one manner in one part of the country and in another manner in another part of the country, and I gather from information that has come to me that whatever acceleration might arise from the compilation of the register in a man's office in the first stage will be lost on the second stage, that is to say when you come to the revision, because there will be an enormous number of applications, claims, and perhaps an enormous number of objections; whereas if some regular course were followed probably that delay on the revision would not arise. I am told, for instance, that in some areas the rate collector or the officer responsible for the compilation is, say, a farmer or a labourer, as the case may be, and is not at all anxious to put on the register people who he thinks ought to be off the register when the date of the poll comes, and such a person is trusting to the negligence of the elector when we come to the revision. It is undesirable, and if some uniformity could be decided upon by the Minister <Col N="347" /> or his Department and an instruction of some kind sent out it would probably add to the ease with which the register in its final stages could be completed. I have nothing to say on the Bill itself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. E. BLYTHE Mr. E. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Johnson that a greater uniformity of practice would be desirable.  We have attempted to get it as far as possible and have directed the rate collectors to make individual visits to all houses in their areas.  It is very difficult at the present time to get these things satisfactorily carried out.  The suggestion has been made that under new circumstances, perhaps a good deal of the work that is now being done by rate collectors and by specially appointed investigators, might very well be done by postmen&mdash;I mean rural postmen&mdash; and done much more satisfactorily. That is a matter that would really arise for discussion perhaps later on when we come to deal with the Electoral Bill, because, of course, it is the Electoral Bill that provides for the compilation of the register, and will provide for any changes that will be made in the compilation of the register with the idea of securing a greater degree of uniformity and something more satisfactory than in the present stage.  The rate collector was more useful in the past when the suffrage was not so wide as it is at present and when he was personally acquainted with a much larger proportion of the people who were entitled to have their names upon the register than is the case now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor WM. MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just hurriedly read this Bill, and it occurs to me that there is one slight oversight in it which can, of course, be corrected in Committee.  In the provisions of other statutes certain members, for example, of County Councils, are required to be elected as representatives from other bodies, and no power is taken in this Bill to deal with the contingency of existing representatives on County Councils going out of office.  Take, for example, the governing body of the three constituent Colleges of the National University&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the doubt Deputy Magennis has is perhaps without foundation.  If he will look at Section 4, Sub-section 5, he will observe that it <Col N="348" /> states:&mdash;&ldquo;Nothing contained in this Act or any order made under this Act shall be deemed to postpone or otherwise affect the holding of an annual meeting or a quarterly meeting (as the case may be) of any Council, Commissioners or other local body the statutory elections to which are postponed by or under this Act or to abridge or otherwise affect the business required by any statute, order or regulation to be transacted by such annual meeting or quarterly meeting (as the case may be)&rdquo;; so that if part of the business were to elect these representatives the election would still go on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. GOREY</NameTxt>
      <P>What provision is made to have the list correct where the rate collectors have not done their duty properly?  Form A has not been sent out to more than two per cent. of the people in certain districts, and the rate collector goes into a district, sits down in some house, and takes a list of the townlands from there, but he makes no other enquiries.  These are things I am speaking of from my own knowledge. The list cannot be complete under these circumstances and I want to know what provision will be made so that the list will be a proper one and give the people an opportunity of being on the register.  Things are not done right in the country.  While some rate collectors are doing their duty others are not and this is a general thing all over the country. I have reports from different parts of the country&mdash;from Cork and everywhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact it does not arise here, but penalties are provided and we can also take the step of refusing or withholding remuneration from people who do not do their duty properly; that is, the rate collectors.  Then, if any names are not <Col N="349" /> put on the first list through negligence, the ratepayers can go on by making a claim&mdash;I mean, they are not precluded from becoming entitled to vote.  It may be that they will get additional trouble in the work of the actual revision of the register, as it will be enlarged, but no negligence on the part of a rate collector will of itself debar a person rightly entitled to vote from being put on the register.  It will give them additional trouble, but, as a matter of fact, in certain respects the rate collectors and other people are failing to do their duty. As we know, the rate collectors will not even collect the rates.</P>

The Bill is of such a nature as to provide for the postponement of elections until a date that shall be determined hereafter.  That date to be determined hereafter is not determined yet.  When it is determined, by whom will it be determined and by what method will it be determined hereafter?

      <P>May I point out that it would assist us a good deal if the Minister would tell us whether or not this Bill is substantially the same as the Bill, or series of Bills, to which Deputy O'Brien referred by which local elections were suspended during the war.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">
      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>
      <P>It is substantially the same.  I have not compared it and I do not know in what respects it differs, but it differs only slightly.  I move Clause 1 (Section 1):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Be it therefore enacted by the Oireachtas of Saorstát Eireann as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Every statutory election of councillors of boroughs, councillors of urban districts and commissioners of towns which but for this Act would be held within twelve months after the passing of this Act shall be postponed until such date not being later than the 1st day of January 1924 as the Minister shall by order prescribe.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The reason why they are not postponed to any particular date is, if a certain degree of uncertainty prevails as to the date on which they could be held it is not desirable that they should be postponed longer than necessary; on the other hand, it would be undesirable that we should postpone them, say, until the 15th May, and then be compelled to have a short Act postponing them to a further date.  Therefore the matter is one to be determined most properly by an order.</P>

I suggest that that Order, before it is actually put into execution, should be communicated to this Dáil, say one fortnight before it <Col N="352" /> is to take effect.  Provided that there be no difficulty raised, the order should become of automatic effect.</P>

      <P>That simply provides that in case the delay brought about by the first order proves to be too short, and that a new date is fixed too early, a subsequent order could be issued postponing the elections, say, a month further.  My idea is at the moment to fix the holding of the new elections on about June 15th. It would not, I think, be possible to hold them in every part of the county very much before that date.  The register will probably be ready a little before it, at least I hope so; but a week or two should elapse from the completion of the register until the holding of the elections.

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just a point in this.  The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; suggests that it is imperative upon the remaining members of the Council to fill those vacancies by co-option.  If that law is going to be enforced I think you will find that in fact many of the new Councils will be new Councils to the extent of three-quarters of their membership for the ensuing six months.  We know as a matter of fact that large numbers of the present existing Councils are disqualified by virtue of non-attendance, and if any individual takes the initiative in the matter there is compulsion under this Clause to fill those vacancies by co-option. I do not know whether that is the intention, but I suggest it is worth while for the Ministers to think over the effect of it before the final stages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. BLYTHE Mr. BLYTHE">

      <P>Seeing that Proportional Representation obtains in the country, when these vacancies occur I think it is right that the same class of people who were represented before should be represented by people of the same way of thinking again.  For instance, if there were three Councillors who were anti-Treaty and two who were pro-Treaty, and if one of the three died, it would not be fair that the seat should be handed to a person from the opposite side. That would not be carrying out the principles of Proportional Representation. Where vacancies occur, say, in the case where a man dies or is disqualified, the people should be represented by the new man being selected from the side represented by his predecessor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. BLYTHE</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Professor MAGENNIS</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest to the Minister that the conflicting demands of the two ideals of Deputy Johnson and myself could easily be met in this clause.  It is necessary that by no device&mdash;I was going to say trickery &mdash;should a body of Commissioners be frustrated from carrying out their functions by being allowed to have so few members as to be incapable of having a quorum.  It is also desirable that the idea presented by Deputy Johnson should be taken account of.  It would be easy to use a formula to provide that the filling up of the vacancy is imperative&mdash;I mean that the vacancy should be filled up so that it shall not involve lapse of functioning.  It could be allowed to be optional in all other cases.  It is only in such cases as the non-filling of the vacancies would create the effect of the Council or body not functioning that it should be mandatory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. JOHNSON Mr. JOHNSON">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps in such a case the use of a centralised power might be advisable and perhaps the Minister should have authority over the Local Authority in such a case.  I take it he is made aware if there is any inability to form a quorum on any particular council.  In such a case possibly a reservation in this temporary Act, so as to enable the Minister to give a direction, would be advisable.</P>

      <P>As the Deputies are aware, at present various penalties exist&mdash;two guineas in certain cases, and other sums in connection with other bodies&mdash;if a man desires to resign before his term of office is completed.  As the term of office is extended beyond what a member of a Council originally bargained for it is only right that the penalty should be dropped.</P>

      <P>Does not that seem a more satisfactory form than the form applied in the preceding Sub-section? It is to this, in my opinion, the explanation given by the Minister <Col N="360" /> more appropriately applies.  Suppose A. B. would incur a penalty if he resigned before the expiration of the term for which he had been elected; he is now made aware of the postponement of the new elections and he declines to hold office for a prolonged period.  Of course it is only reasonable in that case that he should be permitted to resign without penalty; but to permit him to resign before the expiration of his first period would really be to repeal the enactment that prescribed the penalty.

      <P>My amendment, which reads as follows, explains itself.  To move a new Clause 10:&mdash;&ldquo;Every order made by the Minister shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas forthwith, and unless and until a Resolution annulling such order is passed by either House of the Oireachtas within the next ensuing twenty-one days <Col N="363" /> on which that House has sat after such order is laid before it, such order shall have effect as if enacted in this Act.&rdquo; I think that would be better, because there may be some matters which may occur to some member of the Dáil which he would like to bring to the Minister's attention, and the wording is the ordinary form applicable to such circumstances.</P>

      <P>I think that in the particular circumstances I cannot accept the amendment.  It is very necessary that bodies should know at once whether elections are to be postponed or are not to be postponed.  For instance, there certainly should be no such period as 21 days elapsing between the passing of this Act and the date when the elections in January would normally occur, and I think it would produce an awkward situation if elections are not held on the statutory date, and then the Order that caused them not to be held were to be nullified afterwards by either House of the Oireachtas.  I think such a provision could not apply to the order postponing the elections to be held in January.  I think also this particular provision would not be particularly desirable.  The ordinary elections of Co. Councils and Rural District Councils are to be held in June, if it is possible to hold them in June, and if it is desirable that they should be held.  Whether they will be held or not will depend on the register being ready. It may not be possible to know until nearly the last moment whether they can be held or whether they are to be postponed.  It would again be necessary that the order as soon as issued should take effect.  It would be very undesirable to have it take effect and then to have it nullified by a vote of either House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that this is not one of those things where it is necessary or <Col N="364" /> desirable that the order should be laid upon the table of the Dáil.  Once the principle of postponing elections is accepted, the actual day fixed is a very minor matter of detail; whether it is the 15th June or the 25th seems to me to be a matter of very little consequence and one that might be very well decided without being laid before this Dáil.  As to anything being done in the matter that would be contrary to the general wishes of the Dáil, I think there is no likelihood whatever of that. Ordinarily there would be no objection to the provisions of this proposed amendment at all, but when it is a matter of postponing elections, and that that must be decided one way or another and when difficulty arises, as Deputy O'Brien pointed out, by people insisting on going on until they see the law actually amended, it is not desirable we should have a situation in which there might be doubt about the matter as to whether it will be actually coming into effect or not, and there would certainly be some awkward situations created if, at the last moment, a couple of days before the election was to be held, it could not be properly held.  Therefore, in the particular circumstances of the case, I think it would not, on the whole, be an advantage to have this provision.</P>

      <P>I do not press this, and certain of the arguments used by the Minister have made it perfectly clear that it is rather wider than I intended, and I think my first instinct to have kept it for Article No. 1 would have met the case much better. Would the Minister be prepared to accept it there?  I do not press it because, as I say, I do not think it is a matter of very great importance except in one respect only.  I think it would be clearly unworkable if any order postponing elections were to be laid in that way. I was referring more specifically to the order prescribing the date, where I think it would be both to the advantage of the Dáil and Minister that there should be some knowledge between the two.  Would it meet his case if the wording was put in this way: &ldquo;Every order made by the Minister shall prescribe the new date for the elections which have been postponed,&rdquo; not therefore requiring any agreement in regard to postponing but requiring agreements and general knowledge and consultation <Col N="365" /> with regard to the appointment of the new date?</P>

      <P>Surely this is only adding to the complication and difficulties of administration.  If the decision as to postponement is left at the discretion of the Minister, it will be because of special information that he has received that a further postponement will be ordered, and it is scarcely necessary that this Dáil should be called upon to discuss the fixation of a later date.  It is all part of the administration of the ministerial office.</P>

      <P>There is just the difficulty in the second suggestion of Deputy Figgis also, and that is I do not know exactly how the Seanad will be sitting, but to get 21 sitting days may involve a considerable length of time; it may run to the most of two months.  We do not really know.  If the election was further postponed it might be impossible with certainty to prescribe the second postponed date upon which it would be held. I would not like to agree to it in the form suggested by Deputy Figgis, even in the second instance, without thinking it over further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KEVIN O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading now.  This Bill provides for the continuance of twenty-six stattutes. They are set out in the four Schedules.  The Acts named in the First Schedule expire on the 31st of this month.  The Act mentioned in the Second Schedule expires, some of it, on the 18th February next year, and the rest of it on the 31st August.  The Act mentioned in the Third Schedule expires on the 15th February next, and the Acts mentioned in the Fourth Schedule did, in fact, expire on the 31st August of this year. None of them are of a very exciting or controversial nature.  Some of them are humanitarian and provide for the protection of such animals as the sand grouse and the grey seal.  Others are of a routine nature and were in the past passed automatically from year to year. We, at any rate, are of opinion that nothing is contained in the Bill that would be of a controversial nature.  It will be understood that these Acts have either to be allowed to expire or to be passed as a whole or passed in part. There are just the three alternatives. Some of them we are asking the Dáil to renew as a whole, others are only being partially renewed, and if members are particularly interested in special Acts named in the schedule I can arrange with the Law Department to have brought down for examination the Statutes referred to, but it will be understood <Col N="368" /> that 26 Statutes would not be light literature for members and would be rather bulky, but if there is a request for information with regard to any particular Statute mentioned here, or any particular section of such Statute, it can very easily be arranged to furnish such information.  As to the text of the legislative portion of the Bill itself the first recital simply sets out that some of these Acts mentioned in the Schedule expired on the 31st December, others in February next year, part of one in August next year and some two Acts expired on the 31st August of this year.  It goes on to say, &ldquo;And whereas it is expedient to provide for the continuance in this Act mentioned of the Acts mentioned in the Schedules to this Act and of the enactments amending or affecting the same and that as respects the said Acts mentioned in the said Fourth Schedule of this Act such continuance should be retrospective to the date on which such Acts expired as aforesaid.&rdquo;  It asks that it be enacted that the Acts mentioned in the First, Second, and Third Schedules shall to the extent specified in column three be continued until the 31st December, 1923, and shall then expire unless further continued.  You are not therefore legislating indefinitely.  You are simply giving a further year's life to this block of Acts, and they will expire automatically in a year's time if they are not further renewed, so there will be an opportunity of considering them. &ldquo;The Acts mentioned in the Fourth Schedule of this Act shall to the extent mentioned in column three of that Schedule be continued until the 31st day of September 1923 and shall then expire unless further continued and the continuance affected by this Sub-section shall be retrospective to the date on which such Acts expired so as to validate all Acts and things purposed to be done under such Acts respectively since that date but not so as to make illegal any Act done between the date on which the said Acts expired and the date of the passing of this Act which would not have been legal if this Sub-section were not retrospective.&rdquo; We are not manufacturing any illegalities. The retrospective portion would not have the effect of making any Act illegal which would otherwise be illegal; but it has the effect of validating certain <Col N="369" /> Acts which were in pursuance of these Acts which expire on the 31st August.  &ldquo;Any un-repealed enactments amending or affecting the enactments continued by this Act shall in so far as they are temporary in their duration be continued in like manner whether they are mentioned in the Schedule of this Act or not.&rdquo;  That is, of course, merely consequential.  It is not a good precedent to come with this kind of block legislation, but this is a matter where 26 Acts are due to disappear and their disappearance would cause dislocation and in some cases actual hardship, and there seems no alternative but to come to the Dáil and invite members to rush to the rescue of these 26 expiring statutes.  If any particular statute mentioned in the Schedule catches any particular Deputy's eye and he wishes further information, then I can supply it, but he would have to give notice and I would arrange to have it to-morrow.</P>

But there are one or two which in fact are continued only as regards a few sections, and I would suggest we ought to have information on these.  They happen to be quite a small number.  For example, there is the National Insurance Act&mdash;only Section 42, and certain portions are to be continued. There is only one section of the Housing (Ireland) Act, 1919.  I take it the Alien Act is all right, for just as he is protecting grey seals the Minister is protecting us from aliens.  The Local Government (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1916&mdash;only Section 5.  It might be possible without inconvenience to provide facilities for making ourselves acquainted with these sections.</P>

I have little doubt it is all right, but I think it is desirable that these should be available in case any question arises and the Minister should be in a position to tell us what actual dead laws he is seeking to revive.</P>

      <P>That point is one I wish to raise, more particularly that of the Local Government Allotments and Land Cultivation Act.  The whole Act is to be revised.  That is to say, it is to be re-enacted, and, I think, possibly it would be worth the Ministry's while to make known and blow their trumpets and tell the people who have been working under the beneficent effects of this Act that they intend to re-enact and take full advantage of its provisions. If I am not mistaken it will be received with some favour by a good many people who have been working allotments, and I hope full advantage of the Act will be availed of by the Ministry.  Unless I am entirely astray, I think this refers to the town allotments.  There has been a good deal of fretting as to the expiry of the tenancy of the plots, and, I think, it is under these Acts that these plots are being cultivated.  If there is anything to be said worth trumpeting forth I hope the Ministry will do so to-morrow.</P>

      <P>This Motor Car Act that Deputy Wilson refers to is not a taxing Act and does not deal with the taxation he mentions as being unpopular.  So far as I know at the moment it is an Act providing that people shall have licences to drive, and so on.  Now, there will be nothing to prevent <Col N="371" /> the repeal or amendment or further consideration of these Acts.  It is sought to renew them now simply to prevent the evil consequences that might follow from the unexpected lapse, or for a lapse that no provision would be made to meet.  If there are in these Schedules Acts which Deputies might not whole-heartedly approve of, it would of course be open to them to have them reconsidered or amended at a later stage.  I will see that Deputy Magennis sees these particular Acts he referred to, where certain sections are only sought to be renewed and the rest of the Acts allowed to lapse. If any other Deputy wishes for information with regard to any of the Acts mentioned in the Bill I would be glad if he would let me have a note.  I will try to have here also for distribution to certain of the members the text of the two Acts that lapsed in August that we find it necessary to renew.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Minister whether he has considered any proposal in connection with the Jurors' Act?  There has been great difficulty in the Courts for a number of years in getting the citizens of Dublin to take their fair share of responsibility in answering jury calls.  A number of small business men&mdash;the one-man-business men&mdash;have very often been called on juries, and to my own knowledge these small shopkeepers have had to close their businesses altogether to go on a jury summons.  I think that is very unfair, and that something should be done to compensate people who attend jury calls and who do justice to the calls they get. A number of big business men are able to evade their responsibility by paying the fine, as a fine of £5 is not much to them.  In numerous cases I have seen <Col N="372" /> the one old set of jurymen answering the summons, both in the Recorder's Court and in the High Court.  The only way to get out of the difficulty would be to consider a proposal, which I am informed, after great agitation, is being considered in another place&mdash;payment of jurors.  I believe if you do that there would be no difficulty in getting people to close their business for the day or for two or three days, when they would not be at any loss.  I would like to ask the Minister if he has considered the point. The same thing applies to the Coroners' Courts.  There you see the same old set of faces week after week, where people often lose two or three hours daily.</P>

      <P>I would like to know whether there is a definite feeling against the taking of the Third Stage of this Bill now, or whether members would prefer to wait and discuss it, or attempt to discuss in detail the Acts set out in the Schedule.  There are three alternatives, to let an Act lapse, to pass it in whole, or in part.  The question of dealing with such side issues as Deputy Byrne has mentioned, the grievances of jurors, scarcely arises at this stage, and I think it would be impossible to attempt to take these 26 Acts and mould them nearer to the heart's desire between this and the adjournment for Christmas, but it is very necessary to provide for their renewal.  There would be an opportunity at any time later to consider embellishments or improvements. My own view is that there is very little to be gained by postponing the Committee Stage until to-morrow, but I am in the hands of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>As far as we are concerned we are prepared to facilitate the passing of this Bill on the next stage.  We understand that it will have to go through the process of First, Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth Reading in the Seanad, and that they require to adjourn by the middle of the week at any rate.  Our view, I think, is that it is better to run the risk of the continuation of a law which we do not like for a month or two, and which need not be enforced, rather than have no Act in operation.  I think the various Acts <Col N="373" /> that have been spoken of have been admitted to have been beneficial, and we ought to continue them until some specific reason is adduced for annulling them, and I support the suggestion of the Minister that we should proceed to the next stage of this Bill.</P>

The point there about the retrospective thing is what I went into before.  It validates certain things that we had done since these Acts expired.  It has not the effect of making anything illegal which would not otherwise have been illegal, and it revives the two Acts in question until the 31st December, 1923.</P>

      <P>The extracts that are mentioned in the Fourth Schedule, the request for the continuance and revival, came from the Local Government Department, and the Minister for Local Government will have available for the Dáil some particulars as to their provisions.  It was evidently considered essential for the routine administration of the Department that they should be revived in this, perhaps, not regular manner.  The Allotments Act, of course, is a thing that we are all familiar with.  I cannot furnish the Dáil at the moment with particulars as to the first Act, that is, the Local Government (Emergency Provisions) Act.  I think that perhaps before we are through this stage the Minister will have the particulars.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'HIGGINS Mr. O'HIGGINS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>On that matter, these are two Acts which certainly would have been continued but for the situation that existed; I mean the British Administration would in the ordinary way have revived these Acts.  Their noncontinuance is entirely due to the existing conditions in this country, and I do not think that we ought to take the view that it is so much the revival of some Act that had, in fact, elapsed.  I think we should treat it much on all fours with other Acts.  If we found we were in the position, if the Constitution were passed, and so on, at that time, we would have stepped in to prevent the lapsing of these Acts.  Now, if by your title you cannot stereotype the fact that this thing was done and set it down in your titles of Acts, I think it would have a bad effect and a bad implication. It might be that hereafter that Act which had lapsed in an ordinary way was revived by the Dáil in this manner.  These are simply two administration Acts&mdash;one, at least, the Allotments Act, of very considerable importance&mdash;that lapsed only because of the entirely peculiar <Col N="376" /> situation that existed and because of the transition from one administration to another.  Unless there is a very strong feeling about it, I suggest that the title, Expiring Laws, be not altered.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that we may legally continue an Act which has ceased to exist? It appears a purely formal and pedantic point, yet most questions, or many of them that are brought before the Court for decision, are precisely of that type. It is quite possible that if we purport to continue an Act, merely using these words, the judge may decide that as the Act had previously lapsed and as we had not taken measures to revive it, that it is not revived.  I suggest even though <Col N="377" /> it is a formality that we introduce the word &ldquo;revivor.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>With regard to these Acts mentioned in the Fourth Schedule, and which it is sought to renew, the first, entitled &ldquo;The Local Government (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1916,&rdquo; gives a lot of additional powers to local authorities.  One of them deals with the question of notifying disease in barracks.  It arose out of the war conditions at the time diseases which were not previously notifiable were made notifiable by that Act.  Some members might hold that that was particularly necessary at the moment.  The renewal of this Act will, of course, provide for it.  I have the text of the Act here.</P>
      <P>The other Act provided that buildings be acquired for the accommodation of wounded soldiers, and so on.</P>

      <Col N="378" /> The first Act mentioned in the Schedule&mdash;&ldquo;The Local Government (Allotments and Land Cultivation) (Ireland) Act, 1917&rdquo;&mdash;as the title suggests, bears on the whole allotment scheme that is in action at the moment. Local authorities would have no power, unless the Act is renewed, to acquire land and let it out in the way of allotments.
