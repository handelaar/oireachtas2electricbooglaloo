      <P>To ask the Minister for Local Government whether he has received a claim for overtime from the clerical staff engaged counting the votes in Cork City at the recent elections; whether the Minister is aware that those Clerks had to remain at work almost continually day and night while the count was taking place; that they were a most efficient and courteous staff, and if the Minister will now state if it is the intention of the Government to suitably remunerate those Clerks for the work they so ably performed.</P>

      <P>It is presumed that the Deputy refers to the constituencies in the County of Cork.  The Ministry are aware of the circumstances under which these counts were carried out, and while claims for overtime cannot be admitted, inasmuch as the fees allowed by the scales are intended to cover the complete count, representations have been made to the Ministry of Finance that in view of the very exceptional circumstances attending the count an increase of the scale fee allowed to the counties should be made in this case.</P>

      <P>The amount of the Estimate connected with the Inland Revenue is £190,000.  As I explained before, this is a Service which we have taken over, but we have not taken over the staff to administer it.  Those staffs are still officials of the British Government. This is our proportion of the actual cost of these staffs.  I move the adoption of the Estimate.</P>
      <P>Motion made and question put: &ldquo;That the Dáil in Committee, having considered the Estimates for Inland Revenue in 1922-23, and having passed a Vote on Account of £130,000 for the period to the 6th December, 1922, recommend that the full Estimate of £190,000 for the financial year 1922-23 be adopted in due course by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Criminal Investigation Department is responsible to the Ministry for Home Affairs.  It consists at present of about 100 men.  This gives really no proper conception of the effective force for their proper duties, because in the existing conditions a very strong house guard has to be kept, and there are really only about thirty or forty men available for the duties proper to the institution.  The scale of salaries is as follows:&mdash;It starts with the Director, who is allowed a sum of £250 per annum, unpensionable, because that officer is merely seconded from a position in the Postal Service, and it is the Postal Department that is responsible for his substantive salary.  In addition to that salary he receives, while acting as Director of the C.I.D., a sum of £250 per annum, which is not assessable for pension.  The Chief Superintendent is paid at the rate of £400 per annum.  Superintendents receive £5 15s. per week.  The Inspector of Transport receives £5 5s. per week, the Station Inspector £5 5s., ordinary Inspectors £5, Assistant Inspectors £4 15s., and the ordinary rank and file of detective officers £4 10s.  The rates are in excess of those for the D.M.P. and Civic Guard, but each of these forces is provided with uniform free and a boot allowance, which is not provided for members of the C.I.D. In addition, of course, there is the difference that from the very nature of their work the risks taken by members of the C.I.D. are somewhat greater than the risks which the D.M.P. or the Civic Guard are subjected to.  The allowances include a rental allowance of £30 per annum for each married man who is not accommodated in the official quarters. The actual travelling expenses and subsistence rates similar to those granted to the D.M.P. and the Civic Guard, are allowed.  Then there are fuel and light expenses for their headquarters at Oriel House, and certain incidental expenses, for newspapers and postal and telegraph <Col N="2466" /> expenses.  They do not range all over the country, though there is nothing definitely embodied in the objects of the institution that would prevent that.  But as a fact they operate in the Metropolitan area, and only on very rare occasions are they sent out to the Co. Dublin.  It is not usual, and it has not been done, to send them out generally through the country.  The question of the necessity of branches through the country has not yet been seriously considered.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister to inform the Dáil whether his attention has been drawn to the case that was reported in the newspapers the other day, showing the conduct of the Director of this Department towards the Police Magistrate, Mr. Lupton.  It showed a distinct want of understanding of his position as Head of the Criminal Investigation Department.  He committed the grossest contempt of Court, which was by no means a good example to the members of this force.  I think it is desirable that we should know that the Minister has taken due notice of the conduct of Captain Moynihan in the Court, and let him understand that the position of police officer, whether of this particular department or any other, is one to give assistance in the administration of justice; and that the magistrate or judge, whoever might be in charge of the court, ought to have at least an amount of respect and accordance with the rules of evidence and the direction of the court from him as from any other member of the public.  I think it is necessary for the reassurance of the public that we should know that the Minister frowned upon the conduct of the Head of this department in that instance, and that there should be no encouragement given to police officers, whether of the Criminal Investigation Department or other force, that they can flout magistrates.</P>

      <P>Although the Minister has thrown a little light on those offices and officers he has not, I think, thrown enough.  I do not want to seem in any way to be making anything like a personal attack on this particular officer mentioned, but I think the part of the complaint which Deputy Johnson has been very justly making arises out of the fact that there are a number of military officers <Col N="2467" /> who have been used rather through the military side of the Force connected with this Department than through the civil side.  The Department was set up as a military establishment at first, but there have been reforms and very effective reforms since then.  I know too that there is a scarcity of a certain class of man, both in the Army and Police Force, but I think it is a bad practice, a very bad practice indeed, that a Staff Officer&mdash;I understand Captain Moynihan is a Staff Captain&mdash; should be subject, to military discipline on the one side, and as Director of the Criminal Investigation Department in some measure to the control of the Ministry for Home Affairs.  He is also occupying the position, I may be mistaken, which I think is ordinarily a civil officer's position, and he directs the ordinary investigation. No doubt it is a detective institution, but it is a civil detective section of the Post Office.  The Minister has explained that his salary comes from that.  I think it is a very bad practice in the first place that military officers should be put on these jobs.  It may be that this Officer has particular qualifications for the occupancy of the three posts.  There may be a connection, but I do not exactly see the connection, between the military and the Post Office and ordinary detective or police duties. On another aspect of it I would like some kind of assurance, and that is that we are not going to have in the C.I.D. a kind of Irish parallel of Scotland Yard.  The Minister has said that ordinarily the job of these men does not range over the whole country, although in some cases they have carried out activities in various parts of the country; that at present they are a Metropolitan force, and that other branches may be established in other parts of the country.  I want the Minister to tell us whether this is going to be a separate establishment.  I do not mean whether it is going to be under another Ministry, but whether it is going to be a separate establishment, and not simply part of an ordinary national or local police force, because I think there is very grave danger that it is simply going to be a kind of detective caste, and that there is very grave danger of it developing in a way that will not tend to the promotion of the better relations that ought to exist between an ordinary police force <Col N="2468" /> whether as a detective division or not, and the general body of the people.  I would like him to throw a good deal more light on the activities of these officers, and particularly to tell use exactly what is the relationship, or what is the measure of control which he, as the Minister for Home Affairs, exercises, not only over this particular military officer, but over other military officers who I think are also on the job.</P>

      <P>Looking over this list I think it is very meagre to devote only £19,000, for such, an important department as the Criminal Investigation Department at a time when the country is reeking with crime.  I was surprised to hear the Minister for Home Affairs stating that the Government had not seriously considered yet the question of extending this department to other parts of the country.  I think the Government should have considered it very seriously long ago, considering the numerous thefts that are taking place all over the country, and the amount of property that has been looted all over the country, and which it will take the Government all its time to gather in.  In County Cork, for instance, £2,000,000 of public money would not replace the amount of property looted. How do you hope to get that in except through such an agency as the Criminal Investigation Department?  We cannot possibly raise a huge Army at once, and equip it and make it the thorough machine we would like to see it.  We cannot possibly protect the homes of every individual, and while the people realise their responsibilities, and while they are anxious to assist this Government, and the Government's machinery to function, at the same time they must be pretty wary while men are going around with guns threatening their lives if they give information to the enemy forces, as they are called.  Surely, we must realise that the Criminal Investigation Department is absolutely necessary. I hold it is necessary, and I hold it is money well spent in the interests of the State.  Every State has a Criminal Investigation Department even under normal conditions.  Here we are with a paltry £19,000, while millions' worth of public property is being plundered and looted.</P>

      <P>As the Minister has stated the future of this Department <Col N="2469" /> is not yet defined.  Might I ask him if he has given any consideration to the proposals that we made some time ago, that all these police departments should be under one head, <i>i.e.</i>, the D.M.P. and the old R.I.C. should be assimilated. Would he not consider the question of assimilating the D.M.P. and the Civic Guards and the Criminal Investigation Department, so as to have them all under one head, and have no overlapping?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. DARRELL FIGGIS</NameTxt>
      <P>In that connection I notice that the Minister stated, what seemed to me a very curious fact, that whereas there were about 100 men at Oriel House in connection with the C.I.D., only about 30 of them were available for actual work, because the other 70 were guarding the headquarters of the C.I.D.  It seems to me a rather disproportionate allowance in an organisation of the kind that there should be 70 per cent. guarding the headquarters and only 30 per cent. actually engaged in active criminal investigation.  I think that may very easily be prevented by such a gathering in as Deputy William O'Brien has referred to, and I do urge, not that there should be a diminution of the staff, but that there should be an extension of the work of this Department, and that Deputy Hennessy's point was very well made out.  I think that they might be otherwise housed.  There are other quarters in Dublin that have to be protected and are being protected, where the whole C.I.D. might be housed, so that the whole body might be available for the work in which they should be chiefly engaged, instead of 7-10ths of them guarding the house while 3-10ths are doing the work.  I desire also quite briefly to stress the point which Deputy Johnson has brought before this Dáil.  It has been brought before me by a number of constituents, who have felt very strongly about the attitude adopted by this detective officer in the Police Courts. For what purpose are the C.I.D. employed, except to bring to book the people in this country whose course of action is a continual contempt of the Courts of Law of this country, and it ill behoves a police officer engaged in such work to give an example of contempt such as was undoubtedly given by this Captain in Mr. Lupton's Court the other day.</P>

      <P>Nothing has been said, either by Deputy Johnson <Col N="2470" /> or by Deputy Figgis, with regard to that particular incident with which I am not in agreement.  It was inexcusable contempt of a person whose official position should put him beyond the reach of such contempt, more particularly beyond the reach of such contempt from a police officer of the State.  A suitable reprimand and admonition were delivered on that occassion.  Now, the Director of the Criminal Investigation Department is not a military man.  His rank and his title of captain I have never inquired into.  I take it that it is an honorary title, perhaps because of his connection in the past with, or his services to, the Intelligence Branch of the Army. He has no dual responsibility; he is responsible only to the Home Affairs Department, and no other department is in a position to give any instructions to him.  Deputy Hennessy suggested that we should long since have established a group of Oriel Houses through the country.  I do not agree with that and when he spoke of Cork it seemed to me that the proposition there was essentially a military proposition, and that to a large extent the crime there arose from a military situation, and was part and parcel of the armed sabotage that is taking place in the country, which the Army must deal with.  When the Army has dealt with it I am satisfied that there will be a very considerable decrease, if not a complete disappearance, of that kind of crime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KEVIN O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to a question some months ago, I informed the Deputy that any information as to the whereabouts of stolen property, if sent to the Army authorities, would be dealt with, and that the Army authorities were prepared to recover looted property in any case where information was placed at their disposal.  But if you try to visualise Oriel House establishments or Oriel House branches through the country, you would find that these men would simply be, from the very nature of the case, made part and parcel of the Army, and part and parcel of the military situation.  If you establish them in a building the building must be put in a state of siege.  Certainly, in Cork, and, no doubt, in many other counties, these buildings <Col N="2471" /> would be liable to be attacked, and the men who would be sent out through the country on that particular kind of work of recovering or seeking to recover plundered goods or looted property would go out just in the position of a member of the National Army and would have no more freedom of movement, but probably a good deal less, because of their isolation, and because of the smallness of their organisation, than members of the National Army.  I am not at all convinced that it would have been in any way wise or desirable to attempt to establish branches of that particular institution through the country up to the present, and there would have been, of course, a factor and a very serious factor in the situation, the difficulty of control and the lack of contact.  Could we answer for the acts of men whom we would send out through the country as our armed servants?  Could we answer for them in Cork County, or in Waterford or anywhere else?  It seems to me that the armed men we use ought to be in an organisation like the National Army that would be subject to control, and subject to discipline and the Dáil knows and the people know that even in that state of affairs it is difficult to establish all the control and all the discipline that would be desirable. But to send a dozen or twenty men and simply to fling them out through the country and set them in a building and to call that a branch of Oriel House and then to ask us here to answer for all their acts is obviously impossible. Later on, when we see just what kind of situation emerges from all this welter, it may be time enough to consider whether it would be necessary to have here and there through the country, in the larger towns, branches of that institution. No one wants to develop a detective caste, but if we have in this country organised crime, and if crime continues to arm itself to an alarming extent to the life and peace of the community, and the country at large, then it is obvious that this kind of organised armed crime cannot be dealt with simply by an unarmed police who will be performing the ordinary duties of peace officers.  It is simply a question that will have to be faced in the future, but, as I say, we are waiting to see to what extent the seed sown in the last year flourished or to what extent they die.  We all know that a <Col N="2472" /> lot of very evil seed has been sown since last December; it may not all perish with the military defeat of the people who sowed it, and we will have to face and deal with whatever situation emerges after the immediate military proposition has passed.</P>

      <P>I would like to know from the Minister for Finance does he include in this Estimate, Registrars of the Irish Courts which sat from 1917 up to the time of the Truce?  Is it his intention to give them superannuation or something by way of gratuity the same as it is the intention of the Government to give to Petty Sessions Clerks?  I see here in the Estimate that magistrates' salaries <Col N="2473" /> amount to £24,000, allowances £1,700, and travelling expenses £500.  I wish to know whether any allowance is made for the magistrates who acted as Justices of the Peace in the Parish and Districts Courts from 1917, or is he only making allowance for magistrates who acted in the enemy courts all the time?  I think it is the duty of the Government to recompense especially those Registrars of the Courts who have acted all over the country, and who for the greater portion of that period of over three years carried their lives in their hands.  It was absolutely essential at the time to have these men, and I am sure that 95 per cent. of them never received one penny in salary or wages or for travelling expenses.  A great many of these men, the Justices of the Peace as well as the Registrars, were a lot of money out-of-pocket, and I hope the Government will recognise this and will do something either by way of superannuation or allowance or gratuity to recompense them for the time and money they lost in the services of the country.</P>

      <P>I would like an assurance from the Minister that the ex-British Justices will not be allowed to supersede the Justices appointed and who are to be responsible for the administration of justice in this country. There is a very strong feeling in the country on this matter.  I believe some of the new Justices are considering whether the old Justices are eligible to sign summonses.  The Justices appointed in the last two or three years by the people have the confidence of the people, and they made sacrifices for the country, and they ought not now to be thrust aside by the old garrison, and I hope that the Minister for Home Affairs will give instructions accordingly.  The people will not allow the powers of administration to slip back into the hands of the old Tory Justices.  I think we ought to keep the administration of the law in the hands of the people and not allow it to slip back to where it was heretofore.</P>

      <P>The old magistrates who received Commissions of the peace from the British will not be continued in office, and are not expected at the moment to perform any function pertaining to their office.  There are certain legal technical difficulties in the way of actually at the moment depriving <Col N="2474" /> them of their commissions, and if here and there certain people holding these commissions functioned or attempted to function it was not in accordance with the spirit or intention or wishes of the present administration.  Is that clear? Now steps will be taken to make that even legally and technically impossible. With regard to those who receive the commission to act as Parish Justices and who went in and acted under the Dáil the same thing applies.  They have not at the moment authority to function. The particular Courts with which they were associated have been disbanded. There is no such thing at the moment as an Honorary Magistrate.  There have been salaried District Justices appointed and sent out from the Government to administer the ordinary summary jurisdiction which was exercised in the past by Justices of the Peace.  They have no greater jurisdiction.  The question as to what jurisdiction they will have in the future is one which the Judicial Committee will consider.  I do not want to say anything now which will prejudice or forecast the report of that Committee. For the moment they will carry on under the jurisdiction that magistrates exercised in the past which is embodied in an interesting volume of light literature known as &ldquo;O'Connor's Justice of the Peace.&rdquo;  About the Registrars of the old Dáil Courts, the claims of those men to be incorporated in the new system, and to be used as Registrars of particular Courts, have been very sympathetically considered, and so far as was consistent with efficiency and with providing the public with an efficient and smooth-working service, these men have been engaged.  The Registrars who have been appointed up to the present are drawn largely from two classes&mdash;either from the Registrars of the old courts or from the existing Petty Sessions Clerks.  Now there were about 305 Petty Sessions Clerks in existence.  Granted a great deal of those were ex-R.I.C. men, ex-Sergeants, ex-Constables or anything else which made them unacceptable to the great majority of the people, there were still a great many about whom you could not say that there was anything wrong which would make them objectionable to the people.  Where that was so, economy pointed to the employment of those men.  Any man not used is <Col N="2475" /> entitled to a pension under Article 10 of the Treaty.  The British Government did not clear out without trying to make some sort of bargain for those who had served them for their time here, and there is an Article in the Treaty which definitely provides that if we do not use those officials, they are entitled to a certain pension.  Any existing Petty Sessions Clerk that we do not propose to incorporate will be entitled to his pension, and that is a fact that we are bound to consider.  Certain Registrars who have been appointed will be from that class. Certain of them will be from the Registrars of the District Courts and possibly even from the Parish Courts, but I would point out that these particular positions were not given with any terms attaching to them of pensions or any security of tenure, and the people who got those positions in the past understood that very well.  There is an equitable claim, if you wish, for favourable and sympathetic consideration, but they have received such favourable and sympathetic consideration in the past, and they will receive it in the future.</P>

      <P>In answer to that statement of the Minister for Home Affairs, I may say there were a great many Registrars who have acted as Registrars in the Irish Courts, but who have not the qualifications to act as Registrars now.  As this Dáil is well aware, during 1917, 1918, 1919 and 1920 it was not qualifications we required, but pluck. Well, at the present time a great many of these men who acted as Registrars have not sufficient qualifications. Well, they had quite sufficient moral courage to carry on the work of the nation, and surely the Dáil will agree with me when I say that under Article 10 of the Treaty if the Clerks of the Petty Sessions Courts are entitled to get superannuation or pensions, surely the same thing ought to apply to the Registrars of our own Courts whom we are not able to find positions for.</P>

      <P>Yes, I think it would only be right.  I do not use the word &ldquo;yes&rdquo; with the intention of the men <Col N="2476" /> getting a pension, but I use it in the sense that they should get something by way of gratuity, especially in certain cases of Registrars who have acted in the 26 counties and who were penalised and victimised for so acting.  I think those men should be seen to.  At least it should be the duty of the Government to see that they should not suffer or be penalised for having acted as Registrars.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask when is it intended to get rid of the old County Judges now officiating and who officiated for the British Government in the days of the Terror?  I would also like to draw attention to recent advertisements by publicans seeking licences in which the applications were signed by some of those old Justices who held their J.P.-ships from the British Government.  In many of the local papers you will see their names appearing even at the present time, at least they appeared a few weeks ago.  I have not very much more to say except that personally I believe the removal of the Arbitration Courts was a mistake.  However we can only hope that these things will be remedied in time.  I would like at any rate that that matter would be seen to&mdash;the question of J.P.'s affixing their names to applications for licences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. KEVIN O'HIGGINS</NameTxt>
      <P>I had already dealt with the question of the Justices. With regard to the County Court Judges, they will continue to function until the Judicial Committee reports to the Government and until we are able to place a decent substitute at the disposal of the people.  To suggest that we should come in and play the part of the young bull in the china shop, and smash all round us without having any substitute machinery to place there is to suggest that we should have served the people very badly indeed.  It was not a time for such smashing; it was a time to hold on to any bit of solid machinery you had at your disposal. The Judicial Committee is being set up. It will hold a very thorough and comprehensive enquiry into the whole system of administration of justice in the country. It will report to the Government. Its report will be considered and a new system of Courts will no doubt be set up in the country, a system more in conformity with the needs of the people and a system more in conformity with <Col N="2477" /> the genius of the people, than the present one, and less cumbrous, and I hope less expensive.  But until we have such a system ready to try and ready to substitute the existing machinery must be allowed, and will be allowed, to continue to function.</P>

      <P>There are one or two questions I should like to ask the Minister.  With my colleague, Deputy Johnson, I think there should be, in the moving of these Estimates, some explanation, because, after all, this Dáil is a young Parliament, and a good many Deputies do not know what all these things are.  What, for instance, is meant by item D, &ldquo;Grants to students in Ireland&rdquo;? What kind of students, what kind of grants, and for what purpose?  I am not objecting at all to the grants to the students.  I would like to see ten, fifteen, or one hundred thousand pounds, and much more, but I want to know exactly what kind of students and what kind of grants.  There is another item, F, &ldquo;Refund of candidate's deposit forfeited.&rdquo; I do not know what £150, I <Col N="2478" /> do not know what candidate got the deposit, and why the forfeit, why the refund, and all that sort of thing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The PRESIDENT The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly does not mean any more there than it does anywhere else it is put down. I should explain with regard to this estimate that it is one of the departments of the Ministry of Finance that I have not yet been able to overtake.  There are several others, and I would want to live very much longer to be able to overtake them.  If there is any particular question the Deputy would like me to answer with regard to it, and if he gives me a line, I will get the answer.  With regard to the deposit two or three such cases came before me.  I could not say now whether this is the return of a deposit of a person who had been up for election and died, but in one case that came before me in which it was established to our satisfaction that a nomination had been put in and was withdrawn, some dispute arose as to the exact minute at which it was withdrawn, and on representations being made I was satisfied that a <i>bona fide</i> case of withdrawal had occurred, and I believed I ordered the return of the deposit in that case.  It was no loss to this extent that the fact that the candidate had not withdrawn did not occasion any expenditure on our part.  For example, if there were three vacancies and four candidates, and that this was one of the four, and that was the case in dispute, then we would have lost money. But it was not such a case as that.  It was a case where there were thirteen or fourteen candidates for eight seats, and I was satisfied on the evidence put before me, or at least the officers were satisfied, that it was a case in which the return of the money should be ordered.  I cannot say at the moment if that was the precise deposit or a case in which some person who died, but who was elected in 1918 and his deposit returned.  If any particular question is put down I will have it answered.</P>

The Office of Public Works dealt with loans for local authorities and to farmers, and this deals with the institution known as the Board of Works.

      <P>I would like to know if it is a fact that certain articles of furniture and other things for barracks and other places are procured outside Ireland which could be procured in this country?  It has been stated throughout the country that such is the case. And if that is so I think the amount of unemployment that we have at present in the country could be reduced if the Minister would instruct whoever is responsible in this Board of Works to see that whatever is required in the way of furniture and equipment should be procured in Ireland, and of Irish manufacture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The PRESIDENT The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard a good many complaints of that sort, and it is quite possible that the Provisional Government may be somewhat to blame in that connection.  When the Provisional Government was established we had to set up an office immediately.  Some furniture had to be acquired in one day. We could have got on if we had got the loan of any furniture from somebody, but that was out of the question. Later on when the Provisional Government Buildings had to be fixed up with furniture I am perfectly satisfied that some of it was not made in Ireland. But we are taking steps now to get stores of such articles as will be required in the public service made in Ireland and stored so that it would be available at short notice.  It is quite possible that where articles are required for delivery at short notice it would be necessary to get them of non-Irish manufacture, such as was explained yesterday by the Minister for Defence.  But that as well as contracts and other things has been gradually overhauled.  We have set up a Committee to deal with contracts and other things like that.  A statement was made 12 or 18 months ago by the Local Government Department and it is spreading out, so that some attention will be given to industrial concerns which at particular times of the year <Col N="2482" /> would not have sufficient work to keep on their staffs, and during those periods it would be possible to put up goods that would be required by the Government. We will certainly give every facility to allow that to be done.</P>

I understand now that there is only one engineer amongst the Commissioners of Works, and I think it is a Board on which men such as those who were on it some time ago should be.  If there are future appointments I think some eminent engineers should be put on it instead of having some legal men or clerical workers in such a position.  I hope that when an engineer is being appointed he will be a man who will give more satisfaction than the present Commissioners.</P>

      <P>There are two questions I would like to draw attention to. I see an item on Page 6, Ministry of Health, 1921-22, £460, and there is nothing for 1922-23.  I am curious to know to which Department, if any, the work of that Ministry has been transferred. And whether there has been any consideration given to the importance of establishing a separate Ministry of Health.  On Page 7 we read an item on the lower part of that page: (G) Maintenance Repairs of Military and Civic Guard Barracks and of Ex-Coastguard Stations, £250,000 for 1922-23, and for 1921-22 it is nil.  I would like an explanation as to the omission of any charge of that kind for 1921-22.  It is <Col N="2483" /> obvious that there must have been considerable expenditure under that head and presumably it must appear somewhere. I am just asking how you explain it.  Is the £250,000 on this Vote entirely new work on barracks that have been erected, or new accommodation for military forces since the Provisional Government came into power?  Or, if not, where is the item against this head for the previous period here?</P>

      <P>I should like to add one or two questions to those asked by Deputy Johnson.  I see an item down for £600,000 for rebuilding the G.P.O.  I daresay the Postmaster-General when we come to his estimates may have something to say on that.  I just want to ask if it is proposed to do anything in that direction this year.  I mean within the current financial year. There are one or two others that I am interested in.  There is the Civil Service Commission, £355.  I raise it on this because it is, I think, the only place on the Estimate so far on which it could be raised.  What exactly is the position of the Civil Service Commission?  I had occasion, on account of some questions of transfers from the North-east to be interviewed by some people up there, and they tell me that there has been a great deal of difficulty and a certain uncertainty about the position of a good many people who used to come under the Civil Service Commissioners for the whole country.  I would like to know what the present position of the Civil Service Commission is.  Another is the Chief Secretary's office and the branches, and I presume that relates to the Chief Secretary's office.  But how exactly does it come in now?  Because the building may be there all right, but for what purpose is the building being used?  If it is not being used for the purpose of what was the Chief Secretary's office, why should it appear here as the Chief Secretary's office?  I do not know whether it was due to the fact that these Estimates perhaps were made out very early, but I notice that the High Court of Justice and the Four Courts are included on a lesser estimate than last year&mdash;not so very much less when one would have considered that there are no Four Courts there now at all.  There is another item which I am sorry to see is not a great deal bigger.  It deals with the preservation of ancient monuments, <Col N="2484" /> and the amount mentioned for last year and this year is £928.  Possibly the Minister will immediately tell me it is much more important to preserve the State at the moment than to look after ancient monuments, although the State itself may be a bit of an ancient monument. I would ask if there is likely to be any extension of that grant?  There are one or two Deputies in the Dáil who ought to be even more interested in this matter than I am.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister to impress upon the Public Works and Local Government Departments the necessity for encouraging the tile-making industry in Ireland.  It is not quite enough to say that Irish material will get the preference.  That is only a kind of pious wish.  It reminds one of the Poor Law Guardians when they required doctors some time ago. They inserted advertisements pointing out, amongst other things, that knowledge of Irish would be necessary.  The appointment of the doctors came along, and all that the knowledge of Irish consisted of was the ability to be able to say, &ldquo;Cunas tá tu,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Tur dom pog.&rdquo;</P>

Is this unnecessary export of labour or money to be continued for ever, or is there to be any encouragement given to Irish labour and Irish industry?  The 10 per cent. extra mentioned ought to be quite sufficient to cover any excessive charges the capitalists or the Labour party may require in Ireland.  A little Ministerial attention to this matter would in a very material way help at the present moment both in regard to employees <Col N="2485" /> and employers.  It would be well to have the tile-making industry encouraged even in a very small way.</P>

      <P>While on this particular Estimate I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that in some districts there are disused coastguard stations that are being wantonly destroyed and looted every day, timber being taken away, all for want of a caretaker. Another way out would be if the houses in some localities were let at rents prevailing in these localities.  The buildings would be thus preserved; whereas if they are allowed to remain in the condition they are in now, without any caretaker, you will have no house whatever in the course of a year or two.  The Minister should draw the attention of the Board of Works to this matter and let them appoint caretakers, or else let the houses to people who are badly in need of housing accommodation.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister for Finance might answer what I would like to put now as a definite question.  There are set out here items of £4,620 for the High Court of Justice, £2,920 for maintenance and supplies, and £1,000 for fittings, furniture, and utensils. I do not imagine they would require such a huge amount for fittings, furniture, and utensils, considering the condition in which the Four Courts are.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The PRESIDENT The PRESIDENT">
      <NameTxt>The PRESIDENT</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the barracks, as far as I understand these sums would have been included by the British under Army Estimates, and they are put down now under the Board of Works.  It was rather a surprise to me to learn that was the system that was being adopted first.  They are called on to do that work, and they simply do it. A good many barracks have been destroyed, some have been injured, and a good deal of repair work has been done. I do not know exactly to what extent is the proportion already expended out of that £250,000.  With regard to the ancient monuments, one monument has been brought under my notice, and it would be very advisable for the Board of Works to take it up.  I believe, however, it would be very expensive.  The main question, when we are making up the Estimates, is whether any money will be <Col N="2486" /> available for such work in the future. The monument I refer to is the finest specimen of its kind almost in any country. It would be desirable to restore it, but, in view of the enormous expense we are at and the high amount we have to meet in damage and so on, I do not know that it will be possible to extend that Vote, although it is the very small sum of £930.  With regard to the High Court of Justice, Four Courts, I cannot say whether that sum is to deal with the clearing away of the Four Courts or with the necessary fittings that had to be put up in the King's Inns or in the Castle in order to allow the Courts to go on.  I take it it was work of that sort.</P>

      <P>Oh, no.  With regard to the G.P.O., a sum is mentioned of £600,000, but it is not intended to rebuild.  I was informed early in the year of the views of Labour members, or of those who represent organised labour, and they were against building any public institutions until, at least, some fair contribution was made towards housing the working classes.  I believe the Corporation of Dublin is, at present, in a position to employ all the skilled labourers there are in the city at that work.  There are members of the Corporation here and they can bear me out in that.  That was my information the last time I was considering the matter with the Corporation and the Local Government Department.  I think it would be a mistake to attempt to restore these great public buildings while the people are housed as badly as they are.  With regard to this other establishment&mdash;the late Chief Secretary's Office&mdash;it would mean the usual upkeep of the office which came over to us.  Every single institution in the country&mdash;practically all the civil institutions&mdash;are under the control of the Board of Works, even though the particular services in question were not transferred.  The Board of Works itself has to estimate, and that is the Estimate for it.</P>

I hope, at any rate, that some authority will take into consideration, before the next financial year begins, the wisdom of just overlooking these items to see if they serve any useful function or purpose, and, if not, to cut them out; if so, to give them a better name.  I notice that there has been, as compared with last year, a reduction of two offices, at any rate, in the Lord Chief Justice's office.  There is still £200 for train bearers, and similarly in the other courts.  I only just draw attention to that, because I think we ought, if possible, to get away from these offices and posts, which are useless.  I do not mind keeping in being offices that are of a ceremonial kind, provided they are serving some useful purpose, and even if they retained the old name I am not much concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HENNESSY</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know what exactly the Coast Watching Service is.  Is it a service for watching poachers on the fisheries, which I understand are by the hundred destroying our fisheries&mdash;trawlers from France and other countries&mdash;or is it for contraband of war, or for things that may be imported into this country to the detriment of the country, and which have been imported to the detriment of the country for the past five or six months?  It is pretty widely known that for some months back contraband of war is being imported; and I think, like the good policeman who, when he sees a man about to commit a crime, there and then catches hold of him and prevents him committing the crime rather than letting him do so and then arresting him, it would be a very good policy for the Government to create some service for the searching of vessels in order to prevent the import of articles or contraband of war.  We might not have so much trouble if these irresponsible people did not get hold of such articles so easily.  I understand that the Minister is engaged in building up a Marine Investigation Service.  We have at the moment use of the Customs Department, a very useful Department, in which we may place much confidence in the way of searching and all that, but their work, I understand, is confined principally to shore work.  What we want, to my mind, at the moment is some patrol boats.  We may have them, but I simply want the information.  Along the Western coasts we want some patrol boats, in which these men now being enrolled will be placed, and approach vessels as they come along and search them for contraband and for articles which we would not like to see coming in.  Those houses to which Deputy Doyle referred as being destroyed, the coastguard stations, <Col N="2491" /> might be used for the purpose of these watchers and members of the Marine Investigation Department.  They could be housed there, and have their boats there quite convenient, and if they were they would be able to protect our coasts not only from poachers on the fisheries, but also from those others who are importing articles to the detriment of the State.</P>

      <P>I am quite in agreement with what Deputy Hennessy says so far as the Coast Service is concerned. I presume that this Marine Service will really be the Coastguard Service of the future.  It rather astonishes me to find that out of the whole total of £10,000 about £8,000 goes in salaries and incidental expenses.  Again, there is a most extraordinary item&mdash;an extortionate item as far as I can see&mdash;and that is &ldquo;Fees for Survey, £1,700,&rdquo; and the services in connection with wrecks and salvage from which these fees were presumably paid only amounts to £50.  Then there is preservation of life from shipwreck, £550.  Most of that is done by the fishermen, and I do not know how this £550 can possibly be expended for the relief of the distressed seamen.  The Coast Watching Service I presume means the laymen who were appointed round about the coast during the war in order to look out for German submarines; but of all the items on the list this one of &ldquo;Fees on account of services&rdquo; is one of the most extortionate.  I would like some enlightenment on the whole Marine Service.  There is no enlightenment at all in this leaf that has been given and the Deputies have only to guess the whole thing.</P>

      <P>I think it would be only right that the Minister in his reply to the criticisms that have been levelled at this should tell us what particular functions this Department is carrying out.  Everybody who has risen seems to be in the dark as to what the object of the Department really is.  I certainly agree with Mr. Hennessy, who raised the question of coast watching, that it is an urgent necessity that boats be got to patrol the coasts at the present time, but I disagree with him when he says that it should be for the purpose of searching vessels for contraband.  I think that this Department ought to be concerned with looking after the fisheries and preventing poachers and steam-trawlers <Col N="2492" /> from the other side from coming into our waters.  As I said before, I think the President should give the Dáil some idea of what function this particular Department is carrying out, as everybody seems to be in the dark about it.</P>

It will be observed that it comes into credit. &ldquo;Coast-watching Service, £3,000,&rdquo; that service is an estimate to provide for an alternative to the Coast-guards.  I understand that a Committee is sitting on this matter, and will probably submit a report before the end of the year.  If they do not we will most probably save the £3,000, and if they do I expect that we will get some information before they actually decide to set up the new service.</P>

      <P>I think whatever the Postmaster-General may have to say subsequently about this Vote he is certainly to be congratulated in having furnished the Dáil with more ample and complete documents in explanation of the Estimates and of this sum for the Post Office than we got before in connection with any of those Votes.  I think that is a practice that might with advantage be adopted by a good many other departments, and that we should have the full and complete information that we have here in this instance in respect of them, and, I <Col N="2493" /> think, the matter is one that should form a precedent which is capable of a considerable amount of extension.  Turning to the document to which I refer, I notice that the Postmaster-General makes reference in this statement to a loss of £1,250,000 to the Irish taxpayer on the whole of his services.  Recently in the public press we saw the Secretary of the Post Office referring to this branch of the National Service as being one that ought to pay its way.  I think this is a statement with which the majority of the members of this Dáil will very heartily agree.  But in order that any enterprise should pay its way a right policy is necessary to be adopted.  And the first condition of a right policy is to discover exactly what the contributory causes of the loss are.  I notice that the Postmaster-General here has set out in the third paragraph of his statement what he supposes to be these contributory causes, and I venture to say he has left out of his statement what is possibly one of the most important of them all.  It is a recent experience in England that when they dropped the letter postage from 2d. to 1½d., the total receipts were actually greater, and it is the opinion in England at the present moment that if there should be a drop of from 1½d. to 1d. that the receipts would be greater still. I think one of the Ministers here says that that is not a fact.  I am not stating it as a fact.  I am stating it as a matter of opinion that exists across the water. And I believe that if this postage of 2d. here in this country were dropped to 1½d. the actual receipts would be greater than they are with the postage at 2d.  And, therefore, when stating here the contributory causes for this burden on the public purse, the Postmaster-General has omitted what I judge to be the most important of them all, and that is the foolish policy of making communication expensive instead of making communication cheap.  I do recommend to the Postmaster General's attention that it should not be said in this country at the present moment that the postage is costing more than it costs in England, and that it should continue to do so.  And while it may be true&mdash;I do not know, but other members will deal with it&mdash;as alleged that a great deal of the cause of the loss is high wages&mdash; that may or may not be the case, but I do say, and I am perfectly convinced, and a number of people are perfectly <Col N="2494" /> convinced who are capable judges of running an enterprise as a business concern, that a far more important cause than high wages for the loss is the high expense of the present postage system.  I want to touch on one item set out in his statement which is to be found on page 5, where he deals with a subject which he says has aroused a great deal of interest in many places, namely, the subject of broadcasting.  He says that they are also experimenting on this subject in England and that we have taken pains to despatch an expert to study the system in foreign countries, but that he is not satisfied that the time has yet come to take any definite steps towards broadcasting in Ireland.  And he goes on to say that he believes that early in the New Year it will be possible to introduce a scheme that will meet with general approval.  Now, I am not as a rule reluctant to undertake adventure or to hang back because others are hanging back.  But I believe it is true that the experts who went to foreign countries were not impressed with what our neighbours were going to do.  I do think that the Irish Free State, at the present moment, should try and profit from any mistakes the other nations may make rather than that they should profit from any mistakes we make.  There are other forms of broadcasting than the form referred to by the Postmaster-General, and there I do agree that we should do all we can, but I do not believe we should venture into the other until we get more settled conditions, because in any case it will not give more employment. There is one more question touched upon for the rebuilding of the Post Office to which I should like to refer here.  I earnestly hope, in spite of what the Minister for Finance has said about his natural reluctance to undertake the rebuilding of public buildings while the poor are so badly housed, that this matter will be gone into very carefully.  It is not a satisfactory thing, and it would be true to say that it has given rise to a great deal of public discontent, and general unrest in the minds of the public, that these great public buildings should be standing in the streets dismantled.  It was frequently said amongst those who had to share His Majesty's entertainment in 1916, when we came back at the end of that year, that if the then British Government <Col N="2495" /> had been wise they would have rebuilt the Post Office and not have left it there as a sad sight to the citizens of what occurred owing to their policy, and I think that was a very sound observation, and it was made by the late President Griffith, and it is one from which we might learn.  It certainly would be a great public service if these buildings were rebuilt at the earliest possible moment, and when they are rebuilt I hope they will be rebuilt in consonance with carefully thought out plans.</P>

      <P>There are one or two questions that the Postmaster-General will answer when making his reply.  One of them refers to the question of transfers of Irish people in the Post Office service across the water, or under the North-Eastern Government, to the Irish Service.  There are a considerable number who are anxious to return to Ireland and take service under the Post Office here, and I should like to know what exactly is the position in connection with them now.  There is also the question of temporary writers. I would like to know what exactly their position is at the moment and whether anybody except ordinary transfers has been brought into the Post Office Service from across the water, that is, anybody who would not be ordinarily transferred. I expect that the Postmaster-General will be able to give a fuller explanation than he has already given in his circular as to why the Post Office Service is not paying, that is, why it is not balancing so well as it might.  I cannot believe it is due to high wages, or very largely due to them, and I think it is not at all fair when he attributes rather an undue proportion of that to Irregular activities against Post Office Services.  Undoubtedly some of it may be due to that.  But there was a certain amount of interference during the earlier regime before the Irregular activity began at all.  I do not expect him to say he is going to bring down the price of the ordinary 2d. postage at all, though it is rather remarkable that in the Six Counties of the North East and in England the ordinary letter service is cheaper to the public than here.  And there seems to be some prospect that in England it will go back nearer the old figure than it is now.</P>

I think we may take it as axiomatic that if one were to have successful organisation it is necessary to have as near as humanly possible contentment and harmony amongst the staffs generally; <Col N="2497" /> and when the present Postmaster-General took over office in last February or March, I remember that he issued, in the first number of the Official Circular, a statement saying that it was his intention to make the staff the most contented staff in Europe.  That was a very laudable ambition on his part, but I am afraid he has not been over-successful up to the present.  Now, we had a strike some time ago, and I do not want for a moment to discuss the merits or the demerits of that particular strike.  I will dismiss it by saying that I think personally that if a little more tact had been shown&mdash;and possibly this might apply to both sides&mdash; that strike would not have happened. But the strike did happen, and while I have a certain amount of sympathy for those engaged in a fight, while the fight is on, in fighting as hard as they can, I believe when a fight is over it should be over, and it is a point in this connection I am anxious to raise now.  I happened to be associated to some slight extent with the settling of the strike, and it certainly was understood, if not pretty clearly expressed, that when the strike was settled there would be no victimisation. Now, you may say that victimisation to one person means one thing, and to another another thing.  To some people, perhaps, victimisation may mean dismissal, and dismissal only; but there are other forms of victimisation, or what may be called victimisation, and I think some of the things that have happened since are such as to increase to a very great extent the discontent that existed in the Post Office staff with regard to administration.  Now, I certainly regard as victimisation and as a breach of an honourable agreement that those persons who did not go on strike, or who, in common ordinary language, scabbed during the strike, should be specially rewarded and specially promoted because of their services during that time. We are told&mdash;and it should be the case in all services&mdash;that promotion is made on merit, coupled, of course, with seniority, but, I am afraid, that, in the mind of the Postmaster-General, at least, merit does not mean what it is intended to mean.  I do not want to go into details with regard to this, except to say that the details have, I understand, been put before the Postmaster-General, and he has taken no steps to meet the complaints which have been <Col N="2498" /> made on the part of the staff.  I certainly think that when you find a man promoted by three steps, when you find an ordinary sorting clerk and telegraphist promoted over the heads of 92 or 96 who are senior to him in his own grade&mdash; promoted over the heads of 44 overseers &mdash;promoted over the heads of 14 assistant superintendents, and made a superintendent, that the Postmaster-General must have made use of the opportunity during the fortnight or three weeks' strike of observing the particular merit of this particular individual who worked in the sorting office during the strike.  I do not want to make any particular capital out of this, except to say that I do not think it was wise&mdash;I do not think it was tactful&mdash;I do not think it was right that a man should be promoted in this way.  It does not make for contentment. It does not make for harmonious working.  These things are resented&mdash;and strongly and rightly resented, and I think it was not worthy of any man occupying the position of the Postmaster-General. As I say, when the fight was over it should have been over.  I was pained and surprised to learn of these details which, in my opinion, in any case, amount to victimisation.  I would be glad to hear what the Postmaster-General has to say on that matter, and whether or not it is yet too late to have a matter like that righted.</P>

      <P>What concerns me most in these Estimates is that £1,194,937 should be lost this year, and I would like to ask the Postmaster-General how he is going in the near future to obviate that loss. During the postal strike an observation was made here that there would be a loss of £1,250,000 in the working of the Post Office, and I began to think where this loss was taking place.  I believe it occurs because there are too many postmen engaged in rural areas delivering letters.  I do not object to receiving my letters every morning, but when it is going to cost the country £1,250,000 for delivering letters in every boreen and every road in the country, it is a different matter.  In many places you will see postmen going out with perhaps one letter a week for one house, and yet he has to go the round daily.  I think now that we are working on our own we could very well go back a step, and let us go to the Post Office and get our letters. <Col N="2499" /> Perhaps the Postmaster-General could give these postmen something else to do in addition to delivering letters. Perhaps that might be a favourable proposition. I think we are paying too much for our deliveries&mdash;especially when we are at the loss of £1,250,000, and when we only spend £400,000 a year on agriculture. With regard to the cost of postage, I believe before Sir Roland Hill introduced the penny postage, the rates in England were sixpence, and it was not a paying proposition, but it became a paying proposition when the rates were reduced to a penny. If the Postmaster-General reduced the cost to a penny now it might bring in more revenue.  If I could get a stamp at a penny I would not mind writing letters to my constituents.  I have heard a man say at an auction, &ldquo;Take your cheque or I will have to spend twopence to send it to you.&rdquo;  If it had been a penny he would not have said that.  I think Deputy Figgis is right in recommending the Postmaster-General to seriously consider the question of reducing the postal rate.  With regard to the Post Office, I believe neither the Postmaster-General nor any one else, can make this an efficient service if he has not a proper place for conducting the business.  There is no such place to-day, and I believe the Government are wrong in not getting this building on hands.  If the British Government blew it down, I do not see why they should not give us money to put it up again.  I do not know whether that will come into the agreement between England and Ireland or not.  I believe it will be money well spent if you provide suitable accommodation for the Post Office, instead of having the work conducted in a backyard or around corners where it cannot be done efficiently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. WILLIAM DAVIN</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Postmaster-General to explain the cause of the loss in the working of the Telegraph Department.  There is a loss according to the Estimates proposed here, of £131,481.  It is quite possible, as far as I can see, that this is part of the backwash that has been handed over to the Postmaster-General as a result of the British administration.  I believe it was part of the British policy to encourage, by giving facilities through the Post Office, the Propaganda Department of the British Government when they were in control of this country to do their <Col N="2500" /> political work.  I wonder whether there is any necessity to continue those special facilities for the Press people, which are not afforded to the ordinary people, to send telegrams.  I would like to know whether, in his opinion, business people should pay more proportionately per word for their messages than people such as I have referred to.  I am in absolute agreement with Deputy O'Connell&mdash;and I would utter a friendly warning to the Postmaster-General&mdash;that actions such as have been referred to by Deputy O'Connell in giving preferential treatment to those supermen who have worked during the Post Office strike is going to recoil upon himself later on.  It may not be creditable for me to say&mdash; especially to the Postmaster-General&mdash; that I have taken part in strikes in a service where the number of men employed was greater than those employed under his supervision in the twenty-six counties, so far as the Post Office is concerned.  It has always been the experience&mdash;and I am sure it will be proved by bigger men than the Postmaster-General&mdash;men who have controlled bigger staffs and who have tried this question of victimisation&mdash;that in the long run that policy does not pay.  I believe that if he intends to pursue that policy&mdash;and I would warn him against it&mdash;it will recoil on him.  I have been told to-day of a case where a young girl who was employed in the Post Office for some time in a temporary manner who went out on strike in the recent trouble.  This particular young girl was awaiting a permanent appointment in the Post Office and was promised it.  I am not saying now that the Postmaster-General himself is responsible, but as a result of going on strike this girl's permanent appointment has been held up, and that is the reason that has been given for it. I trust that is not part of the policy of the Postmaster-General, at least if it is there is trouble brewing for him in cases of that kind.  I think it will be found that a policy of that kind is a bad one and I cannot see for the life of me how the Postmaster-General as the head of a Department under a now native Irish Government, hopes to have an efficient service in the Post Office if he intends to pursue tactics of that kind.  I hope he will review some of the things that have taken place as a result of the recent strike, and as a result of such re- <Col N="2501" /> consideration that there will be a more friendly and a better spirit of co-operation between the Postmaster-General and the people who work in the Post Office in the interests of the community as a whole.</P>

      <P>A few remarks have been made by Deputy Wilson about postmen.  He said there should be less postmen in the towns in order that we might be able to make the Post Office pay, and also suggests that the Postmaster-General should find some other class of work for the postmen when not already employed.  I would like to explain to the Dáil that postmen in the country have to go out at 6 o'clock in the morning, and probably cycle six or eight miles delivering letters, and then wait in a town or district, seven miles from their office, before returning at 5.30 in the evening with letters which they have collected.  I fail to see how the Postmaster-General will expect these men to do extra work in addition to what they are already doing for the authorities. I agree with the Deputy when he said that it would be a better paying system for the Government to reduce the price of the postage stamp. From a Labour point of view I think it would benefit Labour as well as the Post Office if they did so.  Take large firms that employ 400 or 500 persons and all the communications they send out to answer orders.  Postcards are also sent and they cost 1½d. each.  If postcards were 1d. or 1/2d. that firm would probably save six or seven hundred pounds, which would enable them to pay their employees a decent wage and prevent strikes, which mean a loss of time and money to the nation. Further, I agree that if the price of the postage stamp was reduced the Government would be able to make a good deal more money, because it is a well known fact that a person who has a huge amount of correspondence will not answer 20 per cent. of the letters when they cost 2d., where he would probably answer 95 per cent. at 1d. I have nothing further to add but only to endorse the remarks made by Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Davin with regard to victimisation.  I think victimisation is one of the worst tactics that any Government or body could adopt, especially after strikes, because as the <Col N="2502" /> other Deputies have pointed out it will recoil.  In other words &ldquo;He that loveth the danger shall perish in it,&rdquo; so shall the Postmaster-General.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask if anything can be done with regard to the restoration of sub-post-offices.  A few years ago many of these sub-offices were shut up for the time being, and it was thought they would have been reopened after the European war.  They are not being restored and it is causing a great deal of inconvenience in many districts.  I would also like to know when it is proposed to renew Sunday deliveries?  I do not agree at all with the remarks made by Deputy Wilson. I agree with him as to the price of stamps.  I believe it would add much more to the revenue of the Post Office, if the price of postal stamps was reduced, and also a reduction in the cost of telegrams.  As regards victimisation, a case was mentioned to me of a youth from the North who was in the Post Office down here in Dublin and who was dismissed or rather was told he was not wanted.  That was owing to the fact that he went out on strike.  I cannot say if there is any truth in that, but I would like to know.  Another matter is regarding suspensions or dismissals that took place.  I mentioned one case, that of Mr. O'Kane, of Carlow, and I have a question down about it.</P>

      <P>I suppose a supplementary question will be the best way of dealing with this gentleman, Moynihan. If anything can be done for the restoration of the sub-office it should be done and done immediately, and also for reducing the price of stamps and telegrams. At the present time there are in many cases big delays in the delivery of telegrams.  I could mention cases that have occurred, and I intend to draw attention to it, if it occurs again.  It happened in cases I was concerned in myself.  The delay in the despatch of telegrams was said to be due to the want of bicycles, but in many cases where people live in the town I do not see why a bicycle would be needed to go up a street or two to deliver telegrams.  They could be delivered much quicker than a couple of hours after arriving in the office.</P>

Has the Postmaster-General any plans for improving the telephone service in the way of extension, or is there any hope in the near future that telephone charges will be reduced and the service made more generally efficient?

      <P>To my mind there are three reasons why the Post Office is not paying.  One must be that it is over-staffed; the other is that it is overpaid, or the delivery of letters in the rural districts is too expensive considering the amount of revenue that is received.  It is quite a common thing in the West and rural districts in other parts of Ireland that a postman would not deliver more than one letter in the whole week.  The rural districts of Ireland are not inhabited by letter-writing people.  Still you must have postmen under the present system, and in some districts it might cost 50s. to deliver a letter.  That is not an unusual thing.  I think you could curtail or economise by having a different system in the rural districts.  It is only in the populous districts where you have a letter-writing people that the Post Office pays.  In England it always pays, because it is a thickly populated country, but in the rural districts of Ireland we have not a letter-writing people.  The average Irishman is not a letter-writing man, and the cost of delivery is tremendous. Mr. O'Connell knows his own district in Galway, where perhaps a postman would not have one letter to deliver in a week.  There are postmen delivering nothing, only walking about the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHNSON</NameTxt>
      <P>There was reference made to victimisation, and I want to draw attention to the case to which attention has already been drawn privately. I think it demands further consideration. It is the case of a man who was in the service in Belfast, and for reasons that were satisfactory to himself and to his superiors he was transferred to Dublin&mdash; loaned to Dublin.  He was working in a particular department which was not involved in the strike.  He was invited or <Col N="2504" /> directed, I do not know which, to transfer his services from the clerical department, where he was engaged, to the sorting department.  And being a man who had been for a long time engaged in the organisation of the staff in the North, he declined to do a disloyal thing, to do a mean thing, to endeavour to break a strike by transferring his services in the manner directed or invited.  The strike was settled, and he was directed to resume work in Belfast.  I am not going to say anything about the reasons why he did not think it wise to go to Belfast and resume his services there.  The man himself challenges any inquiry into his record.  But it would not be in his interests to state the particulars publicly here.  I would urge that this case, at any rate, should receive the consideration of the Postmaster-General personally, or even to go beyond the Postmaster-General himself in this matter.  Certain suggestions have been made that the man denies the truth of.  His career and future depend upon his word as against the word of a superior.  That man is willing to go before any person independent of the controversy to have his case examined, and he is prepared to abide by the result.  I want to say a word which has not been said, and that is in commendation of the promise contained in the statement of the Postmaster-General in regard to insurance and the Savings Bank Department. I am very glad to see that it is the intention of the present administration to extend the work of these two departments&mdash;perhaps one might almost say to start and put on a proper footing an Insurance Department and to extend and popularise the Savings Bank.  I agree entirely with the suggestion that is contained in this report that these two departments are capable of very great development to the common good.  And I hope that as soon as possible the promise contained in this report will be put in hands.  A good deal has been said about the various defects of the Post Office Service, and the suggestions in regard to the future.  We are promised not yet by the Postmaster-General because he, following the example of his colleagues, has not deigned to give us any outline, except this printed one, of policy which his chief official has told us publicly is the policy of the administration&mdash; to run the Post Office as a business concern. <Col N="2505" /> That, of course, will delight the hearts of many members.  They are going to run it as a business concern, as a profit-making concern, if possible.  The efforts presumably, if it is to be a business concern, will be directed to the production at the end of the year of a surplus. Well, I warn members who are asking for rural services that they are not going to get them, if the Post Office Service is going to be run as a business concern. You are not going to get cheap postage, you are not going to get cheap telegrams, you may, possibly, get cheap telephones, but if you are going to run this as a business concern all these hopes will be dashed to the ground. The population of the Twenty-Six counties is too sparse to make the Post Office Service a profitable one except in the larger centres, and the constituents of our friends from the country are not going to be served as well as they are being served to-day, if the promise of the Secretary to the Post Office is going to be adhered to.  I do not believe he intends it shall be adhered to.  If this is to be run as a business concern, it is only the profitable parts of it that attention will be paid to.  A very informative paragraph appeared in the newspapers, officially supplied by the Post Office. This paragraph appeared on the same day as the statement of the Secretary to the Post Office, and it was to the effect that instructions had been given, very rightly, as I think, that all stores shall be purchased of Irish manufacture provided the cost does not exceed by 20 per cent. the cost of the same materials if bought across the water. There you have the first flat contradiction of the demand of the Post Office that it should be run as a business concern, because business concerns that are aiming at profit do not make a condition of that kind.  I believe it is a very wise proposition for a public service. It is not going to be done by the business man who is out for making profit.  So we have got to mark off as of no account that particular promise of the Postmaster-General's Secretary. I contend that having due regard to economy and efficiency and getting the best value out of organization, you have got to think of this as a public service and not as a business, as business is understood.  If you are going to try to run it as a business, let it out <Col N="2506" /> to contract, frankly and openly, and run all the risks.  But you cannot do that and give the service.  I warn members that in this country you will find the result will not be even as efficient a service as we have to-day.  The question of wages and the payment of staffs for services rendered immediately arises, and I lay down this proposition: as a Government Service&mdash;and it ought to apply to private services, but we cannot insist upon that at the moment&mdash;the first condition should not be, as the Post Office authorities seem to desire, the competitive price of labour in the market.  It should be a reasonable payment for service, based upon the human needs of your servants in modern society.  We are told that it shall be run as a business concern and that the wages paid for service shall be based upon the competitive price of labour of a similar kind in the market.  That is a reversion to the early 19th century economics.  I hope it is not going to be the basis of the policy of the Post Office or any other public service in this country.  The competitive price of labour in the market means the dehumanising in Ireland, as it has been in England and other countries&mdash;the dehumanising of men and women&mdash;and if we are going to revert to that position then we have the whole strife, trouble and disgrace of the 19th century to go through in this country, and we shall arrive at the end of the strife, stress and disgrace to find eventually that it shall be the human need in civilised society that will have to be the basis of the payment for services, and not competitive prices in a labour market.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has misinterpreted my remarks.  I said <Col N="2507" /> that in my opinion there are too many postmen engaged in the rural services. I have no inside information on the matter, but I believe there are something like 5,000 postmen employed daily delivering letters, and unless you give them something else to do it is too costly a system and some other means will have to be adopted.  Perhaps motor cycles could be provided, and so reduce the number of men, or perhaps they could be given something else to do. Many postmen have so little to do that they engage in rabbit buying and egg buying.  A postman in that case would be having a subsidy from the State for delivering nothing, and he receives also a subsidy from his own enterprise in buying these things, which he is able to do by going around at the State expense. I am not against the delivering of letters if it could be done economically. The Postmaster-General is well aware that a system could be devised by which letters could be delivered more cheaply than they are under the present system.  If he finds he cannot deliver them I am quite satisfied for one to go to the nearest Post Office for my letters as I did when I was a boy, and many of the members here did, too, when they were boys.</P>

      <P>As the Deputies will understand, the system with which we are dealing is one that has been handed over to us, and naturally it will take us a very considerable time to alter that system to suit Irish needs and requirements. We have already set up a few very capable Committees with that object in view.  The question has been put by more than one Deputy as to the cause for this heavy loss in the Post Office.  Well, I have dealt with the main causes of that loss in my memorandum, which you have received, but there is one cause which I think requires special treatment, and that is the employment of a force of about 5,000 <Col N="2508" /> rural postmen, who are engaged in covering very extensive territory, with a very small and poorly paying volume of work.  It has been suggested in the course of the discussion that perhaps some change could be brought about in this method of delivery.  I know very well that to abolish the rural post would not be a popular step.  As a matter of fact I think it would be rather strongly resisted, and perhaps because of the anticipation of that resistance we have examined other means or other substitutes. We have, for instance, come to the conclusion that it may be possible to get rural letters delivered on the main road to people living off these roads, and pretty extensive districts distributed by means of motor bicycles.  Now, that is only one of the proposals which we are considering, but to introduce motor cycles at this stage would mean the disemployment of three or four thousand men.  I think you will agree that this is not the time to disemploy men.  At any time it would not be popular.  It will be unfortunate, but if we cannot find any better substitute, I am afraid that eventually we will have to reduce the rural post and introduce the methods I have suggested.  Before any such change is brought about the Dáil will have an opportunity of discussing it. Deputy Figgis is under the impression that a reduction of the postal rates would mean an increase of revenue.  I felt inclined to take the same view some months ago, but as a result of investigations on the other side, in England, I have discovered that, as a matter of fact, the English anticipations of an increase of revenue, or even a substantial decrease, have not materialised.  Their anticipations have worked out in the other direction, and the increase which they did anticipate has not materialised. Well, if it does not materialise in a commercial community like England, I think we would hardly be justified in taking the view that we could follow that line here. We have, on the other hand, reduced the penny letter rate to one halfpenny, because we feel that the former rate weighed very heavily on manufacturers and business people, and I understand that the business community feel that this reduction has somewhat brought about an expansion of their business already.  Now, on the question of the 1¼ million loss, it is an item which, I <Col N="2509" /> think, this Dáil cannot afford to brush aside lightly.  It is a very big item.  If a similar item were applied, say, to several other Departments of State, well, the taxpayer would show his teeth rather quickly.  For instance, supposing this Government were to try further experiments in commercial control, and that these further experiments resulted as the Post Office has resulted, I wonder what would become of the revenue of the country. How long would the country tolerate it?  I do not think for very long.  We feel that the country will not continue to tolerate this heavy drain in the running of the Post Office.  I personally believe that the country would be well advised not to tolerate it too long, or at any rate that the country would be justified in demanding from those in control of the Post Office an explanation as to the possibility of reducing that deficit with a view ultimately to wiping it away altogether. Now, in view of that feeling, which undoubtedly does exist, we have taken the precaution of setting up a very capable Finance Sub-Committee, and I am sure that within the next six months or so we will have thoroughly probed the whole edifice as handed over to us, and we will be able to give judgment as to how that can be made right.  Deputy Figgis commends us for our judgment in not introducing the system of broadcasting. The public have been rather impatient at our apparent slowness in this matter. The Americans rushed in without consideration. They permitted several systems of broadcasting to be introduced, and now we find that each and all of these systems have to be scrapped, and the Government intends, I believe, to take broadcasting under its own direction. We cannot afford to try an experiment of this kind which stronger and longer established countries, and countries in a better position to spend money in experiments, have not taken up.  The burning of the old Post Office in 1916, and the burning of O'Connell Street, which was the headquarters of our Executive Department, and the subsequent burning of the Rink, have all combined to make administration in the Post Office very difficult.  I expect that those who perpetrated the latter burning had that in view.  One will readily understand that after the destruction of these buildings specially devised for the headquarters work of so big a Department, that a <Col N="2510" /> good deal of dislocation must necessarily follow, and a good deal of dislocation has followed, and at the moment we are getting it hard from the commercial community, particularly in Dublin, because of our failure to meet their requirements with expedition.  Well, the fault is not ours, and I would impress on this Dáil, seeing that the Dáil as a whole will be responsible for the administration of the Post Office in the future, that it should not lose sight of the imperative necessity of immediately getting to work in setting up a proper headquarters for the Post Office administration.  As long as the business of this Post Office, which employs in Dublin some 4,000 or 5,000 people, is diverted to back lanes and alleys and stores and railway carriages, you cannot do the public business properly, and the public must suffer and the public are suffering.  I intend in the immediate future to make a proposal to the Cabinet which would involve, if accepted, the rebuilding of the old Post Office.  I am rather disappointed that Labour agrees that an urgent matter of this kind should be deferred.  I do not think that they knew the circumstances when they nodded approval to the President's proposal to-day, but I wish to make it clear that it cannot be deferred and it must be dealt with; otherwise you will find that the commercial community and the working community, too, will suffer very seriously.  I may say, in connection with the old Post Office, that a claim for a million pounds has been lodged with the British Government, and though that claim has not or may not be considered by the Shaw Commission, it is not definitely ruled out, and neither should it be.  Deputy O'Shannon refers to the transferees from England.  As a matter of fact we have brought very few officials from the other side.  On the other hand we have sent quite a number across.  A great number of Englishmen were employed here, and a good many have gone and a good many more are going, but we have had to accept our quota from the other side to balance that number and we are accepting them, and I may say in every case the men coming to this side are Irishmen, or men of Irish descent, and the most capable men in the Department.  At any rate, in a few departments, particularly in the Engineering, materials from the English Service were indispensable.  When discussing the transfer of staff from England, <Col N="2511" /> of course, the North-east is included, because the North-east is under British administration.  Deputy Davin points to the loss on telegrams, and incidentally mentions that that loss is rather due to the preferential treatment of Press telegrams.  Well, I should say that it is.  Preferential treatment is given to Press telegrams, and this subject was discussed in the English House of Commons a few years ago, and very warmly debated, but possibly because of the influence of the Press the preference continued, and there it is.</P>

      <P>On the other hand, it might not be quite necessary to make a departure in the charges for Press telegrams, because we are introducing what is known as the Baudot System of telegraphy, and in this way the manipulation practically entirely disappears; it resolves itself into a mechanical operation altogether.  This Baudot System is particularly suitable for Press purposes, and then the only charge with which we are concerned would be the cross-channel wires and their maintenance.  A number of sub-offices, as Deputy Gaffney has rightly stated, have been swept off during the last 4 or 5 years, I think rightly so, in a good many cases.  The British Government through one form of pressure or another were rather extravagant in their attentions in this matter, which seems a strange thing to say, but it is a position which did exist, nevertheless, and sub-offices were opened in districts which did not justify or did not actually need them.  Offices have been shut down or are being and will be shut down, and I may say that quite recently a Deputy suggested to me that a certain sub-office should be opened&mdash;well, sub-offices cost money and the nation is going to pay this money.  I made enquiries as to the output of this particular institution and I found that its receipts amounted to <Col N="2512" /> the gross total of 17s. 6d. in the last week of its operation.  I do not suppose that 17s. 6d. would justify us in reopening it and we have no intention of opening some of these defunct offices.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Postmaster-General if he is aware in some cases why these sub-offices were closed.  It was because the British could not get men in that particular area to go out to fight in the European war, and that, in at least one or two cases, they gave such a reason for the closing of sub-Post Offices.</P>

      <P>Well, if there is any such feeling in the mind of the Deputy or any other Deputy that such action was taken, naturally we will immediately have the circumstances investigated. We do not mind how many communications are sent to us in respect of grievances. We are only too pleased to handle them.  It is only by rubbing in the grievances and by making them clear that the service can progress and that we can make it anything like perfect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. GAFFNEY</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Postmaster-General's statements as to the small sum taken in one Post Office, perhaps I may know that particular office and, if so, it was because the people who had it became rather unpopular, for the same reason as it advanced in the case of men who could not be got in that area to go to fight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. WALSH Mr. WALSH">
      <NameTxt>Mr. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, perhaps Deputy Gaffney would let me have the name of the Post Office and I would enquire into it.  He is right in saying that there has been a certain laxity in the delivery of telegrams, and that laxity is a rather serious thing for the public.  Only last night, for instance, I met a man here who had come all the way from Mayo, and his journey could have been avoided if a telegram had been delivered to him in the normal way, but the people in the particular office concerned simply regarded it as an object that might be attended to when circumstances were convenient and failed to treat it as a telegram, with the result that this business man was very seriously inconvenienced. It is a very serious thing for the business of the country to find laxity, particularly in the Telegraphic Service, and also, to some extent, <Col N="2513" /> in the Telephonic Service.  We realise that fact.  This laxity is due to indiscipline, to lack of discipline, which cropped up in the service during the last four or five years through the practical breakdown of English administration, and this indiscipline, we feel justified in the interests of the Irish people, we must eradicate.  We are eradicating it and coping with it in every possible case, and punishing officials who fail to do their duty with a reasonable amount of satisfaction. Deputy Alton referred to the introduction of the automatic exchange system.  We realise very fully the advantage of the automatic service and also the disadvantage of the existing one, but you require a highly qualified engineering staff, for one thing, to engage in its introduction; and, further, you require a very considerable Vote from the Treasury &mdash;a Vote which we have not, but which we have a hope to get in the future.  Undoubtedly automatic service is the better one for a progressive country, and all progressive countries have come to that conclusion, judging by its extension.  We also intend, and have a scheme in course of formation to develop the rapid extension of the telephone service to the rural districts, and in this connection we intend, if there is no serious objection from the owners, to utilise trees instead of poles, and to utilise the single wire instead of the return; and, in addition, to adopt what is called the &ldquo;multiplex&rdquo; system, whereby a number of houses are switched on to one wire, and, by introducing this, we believe we can introduce cheap telephony everywhere.  It will possibly take a few years to get going.  We have to make good the wreckage of the past six months, but it should be the policy of the Post Office to extend the use of telephones, and cheap ones at that, and Deputy Johnson was right when he calculated that we had that in mind.  A few of the Labour Deputies referred to what they considered victimisation.  Now, I think there have been very few strikes on record which have carried less victimisation, probably, than the Post Office strike, as a matter of fact, notwithstanding very grave breaches of the law which, if taken to their usual conclusion would have meant more serious punishment than dismissal.  Many of these have been investigated and are known to us, but not a single official has even been dismissed because of it.  Not a single <Col N="2514" /> official, I wish to repeat, has been dismissed because of participation in this business.  But we have got a large number of casual workers.  These casual workers, as the Labour Deputies know pretty well, clearly understand that their employment is from day to day.  We are not in any way bound to continue their services a day longer than we require them, and just now we find we do not require many of them; and because of that fact, these casual labourers attribute the dispensing of their services to the fact that they had some connection with the strike. In other words, because they were on strike we must retain their services for fear it would be said they were dispensed with because of participation in the strike.  That will not work.  In the ordinary way their services would be dispensed with at this time of the year or early in the new year, when the work does not justify their employment, and that will happen now no matter what cause it is attributed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken on temporary hands that came to the rescue of the service during the strike, and I intend to retain them.  Now, it is true that there was one promotion in the service of a very unusual character.  That was the promotion of Mr. Hogan.  It was Mr. Hogan who took charge of the Rink during the period of the strike, and certainly acquitted himself with the utmost satisfaction.  Not only did he do herculean work during that time in the distribution and division and direction of the mail services, but he controlled a staff of 70 men.  He was the senior man.  There was no other Supervisor on the floor, and in view of that, I was justified in appointing Mr. Hogan in the capacity of Assistant Superintendent, and I have no apology to make for that.  I think Mr. Hogan deserved promotion from the Government which he stood by, and I may say, apart from that consideration, he is a thoroughly capable and efficient officer.  It is not true that Mr. Hogan passed over the heads of 94 men.  He did actually pass over them, but it is also true that these 94 men had already been frequently passed over in the past.  There is only one other point, and that relates <Col N="2515" /> to Mr. Art McGann, taken on in May or June&mdash;I am not sure which&mdash;in the capacity of Clerical Officer in the Engineering Department.  Mr. McGann, with four or five other sorting clerks and telegraphists in the Belfast Post Office came here to Dublin and approached me with a story that, because of the pogroms in Belfast they had to clear out, as their lives were unsafe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. WALSH</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, had I known that Deputy Johnson's desire was that the matter should be dealt with otherwise than in public I would have respected his views, and if he wishes to be placed in possession of all the evidence bearing on this case I would be pleased to place the material at his disposal. There is only just one other matter; the Secretary of the Post Office has promulgated no new idea in giving evidence before the Commission when he states that it is the business of the Post Office to run the Post Office as a business concern. I do, however, rather hold aloof from sharing the view that the Post Office should be run as a profit-making concern. Let it be clearly understood that I believe that the Post Office should clear its way, but I do not feel that I would be justified in advancing the idea that the Post Office should be run as a profit-making institution.  At the same time both the Secretary of the Post Office and myself feel, and plenty will agree that we were bound to be frank in our views regarding the running of this department.  Our conduct in this matter will be taken, I venture to say, as a criterion as to the attitude of the Government generally in any commercial enterprises in which it should engage. And we feel, being responsible for the only enterprise of the kind under the control of the Government at the moment that we are bound to set forth those ideas of management which we consider just and proper in the interests of the community.  I feel myself, and I think I am correctly speaking for the <Col N="2516" /> Secretary, that I would not be justified in paying one single penny extra wages to an employee of the Post Office that I myself would not pay were I the owner of the Post Office as a private enterprise. Nor would I be prepared, without feeling that I was doing injustice to the community being called upon to deal with their money, generally speaking, to give concessions to employees under the Government that I would not give were I the owner of the institution.  That is a fair position.  I feel I should not exploit to the extent of one penny the public money in anything in which I would not be prepared to risk my own.  I know that is contrary to the views of the Labour Party, but I know that I am perfectly justified in stating that view point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJamesCraig" hpid="Sir JAMES CRAIG Sir JAMES CRAIG">
      <NameTxt>Sir JAMES CRAIG</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter seems to me to be too important to raise either during the discussion on the Financial Statement, or merely by question and answer in the Dáil.  I make a very mild statement now that the Public Health conditions in the country are not all that they ought to be.  Prevention is a great deal better than cure, and no money that is spent in the prevention of disease will be badly spent.  In my opinion, it is the most important way in <Col N="2518" /> which any money of the State can be spent.  Improved sanitation has already done wonders for us.  Within my experience of the last 30 years it is simply amazing what has been done.  We have practically no cases of typhus fever any longer; occasionally we have little outbreaks of it in the West of Ireland, but, as far as the city here is concerned it is a most unusual thing to have a case of typhus fever.  Owing to the very marked improvement in sanitation and sewerage typhoid fever is getting extremely rare. In my early days I had a ward filled with enteric patients always during the autumn.  At the present time I have not a single case of a patient in hospital suffering from enteric fever.  Diphtheria in my early days, too, used to carry off perhaps six or seven members of a family at a time, and although diphtheria is still with us it is rid of its worst terrors by the introduction of anti-toxin, which, if given early, is attended with the most splendid results.  For the moment we are perhaps going to have an invasion of smallpox. I want to congratulate the Local Government Board&mdash;their Medical Department &mdash;on the efforts they have already made to secure in the sea-boards that vaccination shall be done.  I am not going here to raise the question as to the usefulness or otherwise of vaccination.  I know that there are many men, and many women, too, who think that vaccination is absurd, and that if proper sanitation and cleanliness are carried on vaccination should never be required.  I am going to put the proposition in a way that I think should satisfy the Deputies present here to-night.  If I were called upon to treat a case of smallpox I should consider myself to be a criminal if I either attempted to treat that patient without myself being re-vaccinated, or if I allowed nurses to go in to care such a case without their being re-vaccinated.  There have been already in London, from the last statistics I saw, some 66 or 67 cases, and of these 22 cases died.  That is to say, one-third of the cases that have occurred in London have been fatal, and in all those cases re-vaccination had not been done.  In other words, in no case in which death occurred had the patients been re-vaccinated since their infancy. For many years I was connected with colleges and institutions that took an interest in the advance of public health, and for a time I might say that my sole <Col N="2519" /> leather was worn out on deputations to the Local Government Board and to the Chief Secretary of Ireland.  I have nothing to say against the Medical Commissioners who received us in the Local Government Board, because they always treated us kindly and sent us away with high hopes and promises actually made on paper that within a short time a Bill would be brought in embodying the conditions that we were anxious to obtain. When that matter came before the Chief Secretary, that was the end of it.  As a matter of fact, Sir, I had great faith in humanity; I had great faith in the truthfulness of people; and I think the first sad jar I got in life was when I came up against Chief Secretaries of Ireland and people who were under them in the Local Government Board.  When I found that one could not accept any statement they made as being likely to be carried out, it was a sad jar to my young innocence. Well, sir, nothing was done for very many years.  In 1919 the Ministry of Health Act was passed in England, and under that Ministry of Health Act an Irish Board, or Irish Council, was formed here, with power to take as much evidence as they liked from people who were interested in public health, and to attempt to unify and draw together the different systems that were working the public health in Ireland.  They were not asked to formulate a Bill, but they were asked to bring forward evidence that might be formulated in a Bill.  This Committee or Public Health Council was an exceptionally representative one.  It represented practically all sections of the public who were interested in public health, from the ratepayers and medical men, including representatives even from the Six Counties.  This Committee were met at once with some difficulties.  They found that, as far as the Central Administration was concerned, that there were five or six bodies dealing with matters that related to public health, and their first recommendation, therefore, was that there should be some attempt made to coordinate and prevent the overlapping that was taking place.  The medical part of the Local Government Board dealt with one section, the Insurance Commissioners dealt with another section, the Registrar-General's Office dealt with another section, the inspectors of Lunacy dealt with another section, and there were several <Col N="2520" /> small sections that were dealt with in the Chief Secretary's Office.  I think if the central administration was poor, the local administration was worse. It was quite obvious, first of all, that Boards of Guardians controlled the Medical Officer who had charge of the Dispensary District.  They controlled the Fever Hospital and the Medical Department of the Workhouse.  This same Dispensary Doctor was Medical Officer of Health, working under the Sanitary Authorities, who were the District Councils, and was paid by them a small salary.  It is obvious that in most cases these District Councillors were patients, probably, of the Medical Officer of Health, and that it would be a very hard thing for him to carry out in a severe form, at all events, any reforms. There were then, as I say, Boards of Guardians in charge of one Department; District Councils in charge of another Department of Public Health; and the County Councils in charge to a large extent, at all events, of the County Infirmaries, and they were lately entrusted with a very important enactment&mdash;one of the few enactments that were made mandatory&mdash;for the inspection of school children.  The District Councils were to look after child welfare, and the inspection of school children was placed upon the County Council and was made mandatory.  That has never been adopted at all by these Co. Councils.  That brings me then to say what the Irish Health Council recommended. They recommended, first of all, that there should be centralization, and that this centralization should take place in the form of a Ministry of Health.  Now, I am not going to press that point at the moment, because from the financial position of the country, I think it is not advisable that we should multiply Ministries.  I am quite content at all events, for the present, that this centralization of the public health work should come under one Minister, and I have no objection at all to the Local Government Minister taking this in charge, and for him to be the head of the whole of this service, so that they should be all included under him.  I understand there would be a difficulty for some time in bringing the Insurance portion under his jurisdiction.  The case that they recommended is the unification of the existing local systems.  They <Col N="2521" /> suggested that the county should be made, that is the County Council, the local unit, and should be made responsible for all the sanitary work in connection with the Council.  Now, one of the things that we are pressing for a very long time is the necessity for the appointment of a Superintendent Medical Officer of Health for a county or group of counties.  We have our Superintendent Medical Officer of Health in the City Borough of Dublin, and in one or two other places, but what we have been advancing for years was the necessity for a Superintendent Medical Officer of Health for every county, or perhaps for several counties; that this Superintendent Medical Officer of Health should be absolutely independent of private practice, and that under him there should be certain assistants who would do minor work in the way of inspection of tuberculosis work, and look after the inspection of school children, and after prospective mothers, and taking charge generally of a good many of the things that have come into force of late years.  This scheme then would include the formation in each county, or in a group of counties, of a Superintendent Medical Officer of Health who would look after the work of the entire county or group of counties.  Another of the recommendations that this council makes is of very great importance.  It is to link up one scheme, the present Dispensary Doctors who are working under the Boards of Guardians, and their work should be entirely taken away, as I think it was by the last Dáil, entirely removed from the Workhouse system; that it should be a medical service, and the dream we had in those days when we were trying to induce the Local Government Board and the Chief Secretary to do something was that there should be a District Hospital or Home in each district worked by a man like the present Dispensary Doctor, and that there should be a District Nurse associated in that work.  The nurse would be of tremendous assistance, both in tuberculosis work and also in Child Welfare, and also perhaps to some little extent in school inspection work which must come to the fore.  Then it was thought that there should be a County Hospital and that that Hospital should be manned by a first-class surgeon, who should be able to do the greater amount of modern surgical work.  But this would necessitate coming to the next point made in this <Col N="2522" /> recommendation, and it is one of very great importance, that there should be established an Irish Medical Service, the entrance to which would be gained by open competition.  We have too long suffered from the effect of local boards being allowed to elect men who were not perhaps the very best men that could be obtained and what would happen&mdash;this I consider to be a very important thing, because competitive examinations would be for the best men at all events at the examinations, that the best men would obtain the post. Our young men at the present time are taught bacteriology and subjects of that class which would be of the most tremendous importance in the interests of the community, because they would be able to do the examination and diagnosis of diphtheria and examination of tuberculosis, and these things which at the present time are sent up to institutions, perhaps in the city, for examination. The point I am endeavouring to make then is that this Medical Service which is suggested by the Council should be entered by competitive examination. It would be necessary, having this service, in order to encourage the best type of man to go to it, that they should not only be paid a decent salary, but that there should be a chance of promotion from a poorer district to a better district, and perhaps on up from a District Hospital or Home to the County Hospital or Home.  Under this scheme this Medical Officer of Health would be appointed as well as the ordinary medical attendants, and not only should the doctor attend the poor people, but there should be efforts made to secure proper attendance for the insured people.  The insured people up to the present have not got the attention as far as medical care is concerned which they deserve, and therefore there should be a link with the Medical Officers' duties, not only the attention to the poor, but there should be a possibility of these people getting into the District Hospitals, and be attended there, and there should be a possibility of the insured people either getting attention at their own homes or medical attention at the hospitals.  I am afraid I am tiring the Dáil with details, but I want to say a word with regard to nursing.  This is a point we always put forward very strongly in connection with this nursing and I should like to say that I hope in any future <Col N="2523" /> legislation, or even without legislation, the Local Government Department will continue to encourage the appointment of local Ladies' Committees who will employ and take an interest in the nurse in the district, and will get a subsidy from the funds of the Government to keep the work going.  I maintain the work of the nurse will be done much more efficiently, and that she will take greater interest in doing that work under a committee of local ladies who interest themselves in her and in the work she is doing.  In many cases in fairly prosperous districts, there is no doubt a committee of ladies could raise enough money to pay for the nurse's salary and maintenance, and, in the poorer districts in the West in particular, the subsidy obtained from the Government would be required for the entire expense occurred for the nurse's upkeep. What I want, then, and what I hope the Local Government Minister will tell me is that wherever a local nursing society exists that the Local Government would subsidise it, or make it as useful as possible. I hope, too, that they will make use in the future of the institutions that at present exist for the special training of nurses for districts.  There are two of these to my knowledge in existence at the moment, and they give a very special training and a very special course of lectures in all these subjects pertaining to child welfare and tuberculosis, in addition to a course of special district training to enable them to appreciate the difference between district nursing and the nursing they have learned within the walls of the hospital.  They get three years' training in the hospital and then they go out and this additional training makes them fit for this work.  I have said practically all I wanted to say in regard to this particular matter, and I come now to the question that I would like to put to the Minister or to the Local Government Department.  I want to know, in the first place, whether this Council is going to be continued or not. Because one of the recommendations of the Irish Public Health Council was that under the Ministry of Health there should be an advisory or consultative Council to give them advice from time to time, and to keep them, as it were, in touch with the requirements as they advance in public health science.  I should like to know, therefore, whether the Minister has in view either the <Col N="2524" /> keeping in being of the existing Council, or whether he intends that the Council should be formed on the same lines as the Council that drew up this report.  Is it functioning, as a matter of fact, at the present time, or has it been dissolved?  Secondly, I ask will an Advisory Health Council be provided for in any future legislation?  I have heard that a Bill is at present being prepared, and I should like to ask whether that is the case or not&mdash;whether the Bill is being outlined or formed on the lines of the recommendation of the Council?  And I should like to ask the Minister whether it would not have been better to take a line out of what has been done in most of the other Departments&mdash; namely, to form a Committee or Commission to bring this report up-to-date before he begins to legislate?  I think, perhaps, it would have been a good thing if he had appointed a Commission to give him advice as to the proper legislation that was required.  I should like to know then, finally, if this Bill is in process of preparation; and when it is being prepared I should like to know whether the Minister will give the people who are interested in public health an opportunity of discussing this Bill before it comes before the Dáil for discussion.  These are the points I wanted to make, and I apologise for occupying the time of the Dáil at such length.</P>

      <P>I just rise to draw special attention to a matter which has been referred to very briefly by Sir James Craig, and that is the question of the medical inspection of school children.  I think it is generally recognised, or rather I should say that it is not sufficiently recognised, by the people of this country that this is a matter which this country is alone in neglecting; and I think medical men will agree with me when I say that the foundations of many diseases which have to be dealt with in later life are laid during the school age. These are especially diseases of the throat and lungs, and the terrible dread disease of tuberculosis.  I would like to ask the Minister for Local Government, when he is replying, to say what became of the Act which was passed, and to which Sir James Craig referred&mdash;that is, the Act passed in 1920, I think it was&mdash;and what especially became of the elaborate rules that were drawn up at the time making <Col N="2525" /> regulations for medical inspection of school children?  I know these rules were drawn up, because I saw them. They were submitted to those who could speak on behalf of the schools.  I would like to know what has become of them, and what are the intentions of the Local Government Department with regard to them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sir James Craig has referred to the question of sanitation, and told us all that has been done in the past.  Whilst I agree with him to a great extent, I think everybody will agree that more requires to be done in connection with sanitation.  He also mentioned that we might have a visitation from smallpox during the next three or four months.  We all hope that we will not have any such visitation.  At the same time I think it is right to say that there are barracks at present in some of the towns of Ireland into which a sanitary officer would not be permitted to go.  Barracks are places where smallpox disease would arise very quickly, and I would like to know if he is aware that the sanitary officers are not allowed into the barracks in the small towns.  I know that the Sanitary Officer of the Wexford Corporation was refused admission to the military barracks there.  I think that is a matter of importance, and where the local sanitary officer is not allowed in I think the Government should send down somebody to view these places and a report should be sent to the local body for that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. HUGHES</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to Sir James Craig's remarks, and one or two things I took from his discourse was that he was making a great case for extending medical service all over the country.  That was one of the great points he made.  To that I have nothing to say as far as it goes.  I think at the same time that before anything like that is done we should hasten very slowly because the tendency in a great many cases at the present time is that professional men may be foisted into every position in the land, irrespective of whether they are wanted or not. I suppose that is trade unionism, and I suppose Sir James Craig will adopt trade unionism as well as anybody else when it suits him.  Now, he seemed to think that the public bodies in the <Col N="2526" /> country, from the Co. Councils down, pay no attention whatever to the merits of the candidates who come before them.  I chance, of my own knowledge, to know from the bodies with whom I am connected, that every attention has been paid to the qualifications of the candidates.  I know, of course, that some people say, and with truth in some cases, that the son or nephew of some member of a Council gets a job under the Council whether capable or not. Now, that is not so in a great many cases of which I know.  It may happen, of course, in some cases, but I would not like it to go from this Dáil that public bodies do not take into consideration the merits of the candidates.  As regards the rules that Deputy O'Connell spoke about, and which were made some years ago for the County Councils to carry out, I think there were rules&mdash;and I know I heard them discussed&mdash;and the people were then absolutely against the harshness and the fact that they were taking away from the parents the control of the child, apart from a great many of the services they were supposed to give them.  I do not remember the rules at the moment, but I do know, as far as I can remember about them, these were some of the things that we thought about them at the time.  These were the reasons, and the true reasons, why a great many Councils did not adopt them.  And if they were put up again in the same way a great many Councils would not adopt them now either.</P>

Lay men are not the best judges of the qualifications, say of a medical candidate, and I hesitate even to suggest that there should be examinations for them.

      <P>I think Deputy Hughes struck the nail on the head when he talked about trade unionism.  We know enough about medical trade unionism, and it is the oldest of the lot.  All representatives of public boards will know how difficult it was to get over the terms of the medical trade union, and you <Col N="2527" /> will find the doctors opposed us in every way.  If there is any inefficiency in the medical profession, or if the people in any part of the country are badly served, it is not the fault of the people who made the appointments.  It is the fault of the Medical Board who sent the men out.  Why not raise the standard if anything is wrong?  Why do they send men out with diplomas through the country when they are not fit to go out?  Let the Medical Board do its own work right and I say the people of the country who are going to be served by a medical man must and will have something to say to his appointment.  This Dáil or any other legislative body will be trying a bit of an experiment in which they will find themselves very much up against it if they try anything like that. The people who are going to be served will insist on having something to say to the appointment, and if anything is wrong it is the Medical Board in sending out men not fit to go out.</P>

      <P>I am sorry it was on account of the misbehaviour of the old Local Government Board that Sir James Craig lost his faith in human nature.  I do not know whether we will be able to restore it or not.  In any case a beginning has been made to do some of the things he wants done.  For instance, from the point of view of centralization at headquarters, something has been done.  Of the four main offices which were concerned directly or indirectly with Public Health, three are now included in the Ministry of Local Government. Those are the Inspectors of Lunatics, the Registrar-General's Office and the Medical Section of the Local Government Board.  The matter of the Insurance Commissioners and their health functions being brought under Local Government, must wait for some little time.  In the matter of local administration some centralization has also taken place. The Boards of Guardians which were amongst the authorities dealing with Public Health have disappeared. Whether or not the District Councils will follow them is a matter to be decided. There are difficulties in the abolition of the Rural District Councils, and there is a good deal to be said for them.  If they were to be abolished the entire administration of Public Health would then fall to the County Councils and to Committees <Col N="2528" /> appointed by the County Councils. In any case, that is under consideration, and the whole matter will be before the Dáil some time next year.  The abolition of the Workhouses has already separated the Dispensary system from the Workhouses.  Whether anything in the nature of a State Medical Service should be introduced is a matter that will also have to be further considered.  We are in this matter up against a difficulty somewhat like that of the Post Office. Systems that suit a thickly populated country do not necessarily suit the country which is mainly rural.  Certainly the extension of the medical benefits to Ireland is not a matter that could be very lightly decided upon.  The Public Health Council is in a state of suspended animation. It is intended to have an advisory body of that nature.  Whether the Public Health Council itself will be continued with some re-organisation, or whether a somewhat similar body will be set up, is not quite decided yet, but it will be within a very short time.  The Bill which is at present being prepared is a Bill to legalise formally the work of amalgamation and Poor Law Reform which was carried during the past couple of years. The bodies which were set up as a result of the various County schemes are at the moment extra legal bodies, and what is necessary immediately is temporary legislation to legalise the position of those bodies and legalise the changes and transfers of functions which have been carried out under the various schemes.  When that legislation, which it will be necessary to bring before the Dáil at the very earliest possible date, is passed, we will then go on to consider the permanent legislation necessary for the reform and the improvement of local administration generally, including other services as well as Public Health.  In the preparation of that permanent legislation every opportunity will be taken advantage of to consult people concerned, and to consult those who have views and to give them an opportunity of expressing their views. I suppose the failure to do anything in relation to the medical inspection of school children was due to the failure of the local authorities to take it up, and that in turn was due to the abnormal times.  I hope that immediately it will be possible to get it going, because we are getting many things put back to normal.  If it is necessary to <Col N="2529" /> revise the rules they will be revised. The matter is at present under consideration. With regard to the inspection of barracks, of course that is a matter for the Minister for Defence.  I must say if I were in his position I would not allow the local Sanitary Officer to go near them.  It is not a matter for me, but I take it the Army has its own doctors and I take it they are just as conscientious and capable, and have as much regard for the health of the community and the Army as any doctor of a local authority would have.  Referring not specially to the barracks, but to the prisons, there is a tendency to forget that there is a National Government here responsible to the people, and that the sort of demands which were perfectly logical and proper when there was a Government controlled from outside the country in being here are pointless and in a degree absurd when advanced at a time when the responsibility for these institutions rests with a native Government responsible to the Dáil and through the Dáil to the Irish people.</P>

      <P>I feel it very difficult to deal with this question of executions again, but it is a duty that we must raise a question like this, because we believe it is the need of this community that this method of carrying out punishment ought not to be persisted in. We read in the evening papers that three persons&mdash;presumably men&mdash;have been executed this morning.  The particulars are slightly fuller than in the case of the four men executed last week, but only slightly.  I say men&mdash;I do not know whether they were men, as the age is not given.  I am not going to deal with the crime for which they have been executed, but I am going to deal with the method of trial, the method of the sentences, and the method of the announcement to the public of the trial and sentences.  We have been told pretty frequently during the last few weeks that it is the intention of the Ministry to re-establish the reign of law, and we were told yesterday, as we have been told frequently, that unless this kind of thing is done anarchy will prevail. I want to make the charge that this kind of trial, this kind of sentence, is, in fact, anarchy.  It is not law.  It is anarchy&mdash;lynch law once removed.  Men <Col N="2530" /> are found with bombs and revolvers in the streets.  They are arrested by the military authority, they are taken prisoners by the military authority, they remain in possession of the military authority, they are tried by the military authority, and they are executed by the military authority, and the announcement of their executions is made by the military authority in a form and manner designed by the military authority, and no public person outside that military authority knows anything about it.  The people against whom the offence is primarily committed, the people who make the arrests, the people who make the trial, and the people who carry out the sentences are the same people.  That is but lynch law without the violence&mdash;at least, without the mob violence&mdash;but with the judgment, without trial so far as we know, by the people against whom this offence is committed. There have been now eight men executed in Dublin.  We are assured that it is not out of vengeance that these men have been executed, but as a deterrent and as an example to the remainder.  It is due to us to know on what principle the selection is being made.  We were assured last night no difference was made between officers and men.  Is there any difference being made as between officer and officer? Is there any difference being made as between man and man?  Is there any difference being made as between locality and locality?  How does it happen, if these executions are as deterrents, that all those which have taken place so far have taken place in Dublin only?  Is the method of selection choice or chance? Is it by lot?  Is it by the enormity of the crime?  Is it by the circumstances surrounding the crime?  Is it by the past record of the prisoners, or is it the chance composition of the Court?  Are we to assume that every person who has been arrested charged with the same crime since the date the first prisoners were taken, is to be meted out the same sentence?  Has the locality, has the composition of the Court, anything to do with the selection of the men that are doomed to execution? We read the reports supplied by the Army Headquarters of these sentences on three men, and the offence&mdash; the crime&mdash;is stated in the fact that they had been charged and found guilty and sentenced to death.  Except that this is done under the authority of a better organised <Col N="2531" /> and larger authority, having, as I maintain&mdash;I give you the admission&mdash;not the admission, but the claim&mdash;of having the authority of the people behind it, what is the difference essentially between that kind of announcement and the announcement pinned to the body of a man found in the gutter&mdash;&ldquo;Executed as a spy, by the order of the I.R.A.&rdquo;? We know as much in the one case of the course of justice as we know in the other.  I am pleading in the interests of justice, in the interests of good Government, in the interests of the future of this country, that trials for this offence, for the capital offence, for any capital offence, for any offence whatever, but particularly trials for the capital offence, must not be in secret, and the facts of the case, the circumstances surrounding the case, must be made public.  We are asked to hand over absolute trust in a Military Court.  In no country anywhere at any time dare the public of that country hand over to any military authority absolute trust to do justice.  I expressed the fear, when these Courts were being authorised, that sentences might be carried out by the people against whom the crime was being committed and that the trials might take place when men were in hot blood.  I am happy to say that there is no evidence before us of anything of that kind having happened.  There is not evidence before us, but the secrecy which is exemplified in this kind of thing may suggest that there is secrecy elsewhere. And the demand for publicity is a demand that every civilian in the country who has any regard for the rule of law ought to insist upon.  Everyone of these cases may have been proved right to the hilt; we have only to take the word of the officers of the Court that they were proved.  Some weeks ago a certain Trades Union official was arrested for being in possession of a revolver; he had been searched in the street and a revolver was found upon him. He was arrested and the fact of his arrest was made known to his friends, to those who knew his case, knew the circumstances, and representations were made to the authorities in regard to his case and he was released.  He had had responsibility for an unexpectedly large sum of money to pay in strike pay and he had guarded himself against robbery by carrying a revolver.  These were the <Col N="2532" /> circumstances, and it was made clear to the authorities that these were the conditions under which he carried the revolver.  But supposing he had had no friends, supposing he had not had anybody to be able to plead, and supposing the circumstances had been such that he was in the neighbourhood of an ambush, the opportunity for that man to prove his case would have been very much minimised, and in these circumstances he would have run grave risk of his life, and nobody would have known anything about it if he had been as obstinate as other men have been in regard to undertaking his defence.  He might have been a man who would refuse to recognise the Court, as so many bright examples have been given before, and he might have refused to undertake his defence.  Publicity would save such a man's life, but when we have no publicity there is the danger that such a case would lead to the injustice of that man's execution.  I am confining my complaint and my appeal to the need for publicity.  It is not my desire to wallow in morbid details, it is the desire to have some public check upon Courts which have not even the experience of Courts of Law, but even though they had that, public check is necessary.  The plea of military necessity does not avail; civil necessity is just as great, and it is on civil necessity that men are being tried for their lives.  Their fellow-citizens should know the grounds of their trial, their fellow-citizens should know the evidence on which they are being convicted; their fellow citizens should know the defence that is being made on their behalf.  Presumably they are innocent until they are found guilty&mdash;and it is our duty to defend the liberty of these subjects or the liberty of these citizens, as I prefer to call them.  The rule of law which is desired in this country must depend upon the backing of the public mind, the public conscience, and that must be an intelligent public conscience. You cannot have an intelligent public conscience unless you have an informed public conscience, and you cannot have an informed public conscience while you have this secrecy.  I appeal with all the energy and effort that I am capable of to ask the Ministry to change their decision in regard to this secrecy.  Here are men guilty of preparing to take the lives of citizens&mdash;to take the lives of soldiers, <Col N="2533" /> and incidentally to take the lives of citizens. Surely that is a case that ought to be tried in public.  Surely if you have any confidence that the public is with you that is a case that ought to be tried in public.  Secrecy suggests fear, and fear leads to brutality and barbarity.</P>

      <P>I have been desirous for some time to mention the matter that the question brought before us now brings to the front.  Yesterday in this Dáil the Minister for Home Affairs, referring to the earlier executions, said, and said more than once, because he repeated it several times by way of emphasis, that it was the intention of the Ministry to shock the public mind.  The day before the President in this Dáil made a speech in which he used these words, he was referring to the speech made by Deputy Gavan Duffy.  He said: &ldquo;In my view it would be simple to tear away and expose to the public everything that transpires at these Military Courts.  It is not for the purpose of giving pain to these people that these Courts are secret; it is for the purpose of preventing pain.  It is to relieve the public mind of the shock which results from having these things public.&rdquo;  Now it is not my intention to refer to these matters in which two Ministers appear to be in conflict that I raise this matter now.  The matter is much too serious for any verbal points in debate.  I do clearly recognise that they are two different things that the two Ministers have referred to, and I think the Minister for Home Affairs agrees with me.  There is a kind of shock that the public mind could get that would be a very healthful and necessary shock.  There is another kind of shock the public mind could get that would be a very undesirable and an unhealthy shock.  And I think the procedure that the Ministry have adopted in the Courts of Justice that have led to these executions will have created and have already created a very unhealthy shock that will do very grievous harm, not merely to the justice of these Courts, but&mdash;and that is a matter to which I desire to refer very particularly&mdash;to the whole stability of the State.  I venture to say that at this present moment the majority of the citizens of this city are reading their papers and are saying to one another, &ldquo;I see they have shot three <Col N="2534" /> more men.&rdquo;  I remember, when Mr. Erskine Childers was shot, walking down one of the streets of this city, and I heard people say to one another, &ldquo;They have shot Erskine Childers.&rdquo;  Now that is a deplorable thing to be said in a country, because the right thing for the citizens of the country to say would be, &ldquo;We have found it necessary to do these things.&rdquo;  And until people can be brought to that pitch that they feel it is not something, someone, exterior to them that has undertaken these executions, but that they themselves by virtue of their duties have carried them out, that the right shock will come about that will bring the public to the sense of their responsibilities, and that the entire people will be brought to the full knowledge and full responsibility of what these things mean.  To-day the County Councils in Ireland are protesting, and as one reads these things one realises that perhaps they have been to some extent engineered. That may be true, or it may not be true, one does not know, but one does know that the public mind is not agreeing with the executions simply because they do not fully recognise from the things they have read what I described yesterday, and what I describe to-day as a bitter, bitter necessity.  Either the executions are, or they are not the people's act. If they are not the people's act there is no right for undertaking them.  The Minister for Home Affairs yesterday spoke contemptuously, and that contempt I shared with him to the very full, when he referred to the words of a late leader of the people to the effect that the people have not a right to do wrong.  The people have a right to do wrong, and if it be wrong not to undertake these executions the people have that right, too.  I believe, however, it would be possible to secure the full consent of the people to all the acts that the Government has done, but it cannot be done and will never be done while there is furtiveness in these acts, and a certain amount of secrecy which a number of people will attribute to furtiveness. The President the other day, in what I am quite sure he did not intend to be quite so humorous an interview as it appeared, said to an English interviewer that the Ministerial Bench did not exhaust the possibilities of all the intelligence of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I would like to say that the Ministry have not, on the other hand, exhausted the possibility of all the courage in the country. They are not the only people in this country who are willing to go to the bitter necessity of taking life if it be required for the purpose of saving the country's life.  I believe the people are willing to take that measure, but their co-operation should be sought, and their co-operation can only be sought in the full measure of enabling them to see exactly the causes that are leading to the necessity for these executions.  There is one other reason why I believe that the fullest possible measure of publicity should be given, and it is partly cognate to the reason I have already mentioned. Deputy Johnson referred to it, and I agree with him when he said that the position necessitates that there should be in this country a reign of law, and law is nothing if it does not carry the consent of the people.  And what I cannot but think a most unfortunate quotation was made recently by the Master of the Rolls.  In giving judgment, he said that there was no remedy in law for certain questions coming before him, but that the appeal was to force against force, and he quoted, or rather misquoted, the ancient Latin legend, &ldquo;Silent leges inter arma.&rdquo;  I would like to think it were rather &ldquo;Vocant leges inter arma.&rdquo;  I feel in this matter what a number of people are feeling.  I feel these matters to be a bitter necessity, but a large number of people are groping in the dark about it simply because they are not given the information necessary to equip them for the participation in what must be their act and the people's act, and that you should have some change made, some explanation, so that when the people read of any future executions, if future executions become necessary, they may read it in the daily Press, and, having done so, they will realise their full share of the responsibility in all that has been done, and they will then be able to say, not &ldquo;They have shot them,&rdquo; but &ldquo;Unfortunately we have found it necessary to shoot them.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I think it is the bounden duty of every Deputy in this <Col N="2536" /> Dáil to take every possible opportunity, such as is afforded on occasions like this, to tell the Government who are carrying out this execution policy that they are not acting in accordance with the will of the people, and that they are living in a fool's paradise if they think they are. There never has been a phrase so prostituted so much as this phrase of the will of the people in the last six months.  The Government say they are acting on the will of the people.  How did they prepare to carry out the will of the people before the last elections?  They began by entering into a pact with another party not now represented by the attendance of their members in this Dáil.  The whole object of this was to prevent the expression of the will of the people.  (Deputies &mdash;&ldquo;No, no.&rdquo;) If the panel candidates were elected as a result of that pact that was made, there would have been no real election in Ireland, and there would have been no real election were it not that the Labour Party and some Independent men came into the field.  Then, when this election was over, and before the Deputies elected to represent the will of the people could utter a word as to what the will of the people was, or were given an opportunity of declaring the will of the people, a step was taken which has led to all this, and if the people or the representatives of the people had been consulted, as they had a right to be consulted before this step was taken, we would not be in the position we are in to-day. To me there is nothing so abhorrent as the throwing of bombs in the public street, whether they are thrown at a lorry, or whether they are thrown at soldiers.  But, who are those on the Government benches to sit in judgment and condemnation of these things?  Who introduced the rule of the gun and the bomb into this country, and what has it gained for us?  I doubt very much if it has gained anything.</P>

      <P>There are a growing number of people who say that the difference between what has been gained by that and what could be gained by other and constitutional methods is not worth the demoralisation caused in the country by the introduction of the bomb and the gun.  And precious little was heard of the will of the people before that <Col N="2537" /> policy was adopted.  Now, I ask members of the Government to realise what they are driving to.  They had not the opportunity of discovering what the real will of the people was in the matter.  I ask Deputies here to go to their constituencies and ask there whether or not they are in favour of the executions.  The representatives of the people were not given a chance to see whether or not they were voting for civil war in this country&mdash;and that is what we have.  And I am asking the Government to realise the position they are in, and ask themselves how long are the people going to stand it?  One result will be to lose the position we have gained, and to lose the Treaty.  Now, I would appeal to the Government to say whether everything has been done that could be done to avoid the necessity of taking the steps they have taken.  I believe whatever you may think now, that future generations will say that your policy was an unwise one, and an unnecessary one, and that future generations in future history will condemn you.</P>

      <P>If we are going to be charged with using weapons that have been disastrous weapons; to place us where we are to-day in possession here in an Irish Parliament, discussing the control and utilisation of our own finances, with the English Army here cleared out of the country, and that thing which was the Royal Irish Constabulary taken from the doorsteps of our people, we are perfectly ready to answer all these charges and discuss the means that we have taken to achieve that.  We are told now that we do not trust the courage of the people, and that we are keeping from our people knowledge that would be of service to the people in realising what the situation was, and that the people should know what was the cause of the executions that are taking place here.  Do the people down in the Counties of Tipperary, Cork and Kerry want further information with regard to why it has been necessary to execute people than the knowledge that they have along their own roads and their own idle railways; and do people in Mayo that are only now being relieved of the host of looters and robbers that have been saddled on them there for months, do they want to know more than they learn inside their own homes of the necessity that brings about a policy like this? All during the last three or four years the <Col N="2538" /> Army that was called upon to do this, that or the other thing always held it up to those whom they could hold it up to that it was wrong for the Army to interfere with matters that should be left to some other arm of the Government. What we realised then we realise ten times as well now.  And if, in putting it up to the Government from the Army authorities that it is necessary to adopt this, that or the other policy, that it is necessary for us to set up courts, which ought to be Army courts, we are doing it simply because of the absolute necessity of the situation, and because we want to do work that we can do and that we believe no other arm of the Government can do.  If we have recommended to the Government that the conduct of military courts should be the manner in which they are being conducted, it is because we realise the weakness of the situation in which the country and the Government and the people find themselves; and it is because of the weaknesses of the people and the dangers that are around the people and the subtle voices that are trying to betray the people, that we have told the Government that, in our opinion, it is necessary to conduct military courts at the present time in the way in which they are being conducted.  When the Government realise a change in the situation, or when we realise that we are getting rid by degrees of our own weakness and the weaknesses of the people, then you can adopt other methods, then you can perhaps have more publicity with regard to the proceedings of these courts, or you can take these courts out of the hands of the military and hand them over to the civil authorities.  Take this particular case&mdash;the Oriel House case.  It gives you some idea of what you are up against. Here is the official report of the doings of a half dozen Irregulars at Oriel House on the night they attempted to blow up that house and kill every person that was in it, without any regard for the people in the street or in the neighbouring houses, except those that they were pleased to term friendly people, to whom they had previously sent warning.  The officer in charge of the work&mdash;and he has since himself died as a result of an explosion in Inchicore&mdash;writes:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;After seeing that my men were in proper position, I proceeded to O.C. infantry and received two men as <Col N="2539" /> covering party for my men while working; returning to my men and giving a pre-arranged signal, the whole party, including carrier with staff, advanced to job from Denzille Street direction, halting on right side about thirty yards from objective.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The first material unloaded was the first mine to be used including two sacks of clay to back up same.  With two men carrying clay and myself carrying mine the party advanced to entrance door placing mine and clay in favourable position.  I ignited fuse and retreated to second mines.  During above unloading a motor car approached from Denzille Street, was full of men presumed to be C.I.D. men, slowed down while passing my party and continued on around to Westland Row.  Five seconds elapsed between the ignition of fuse and first explosion.  During this time second party had unloaded second mines, etc., and allowed carters to get clear away.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Immediately following the explosion I had to call on the second party twice to seize the mines but all except one man appeared to be stunned by the concussion as all including infantry covering party disobeyed orders and hung back; the one man referred to seized one end of the mines while I seized the other.  We advanced to the objective with same; we fell twice as a result of mines slipping to one end of box; the weight was enormous; it was four men's work.  Getting to entrance we found a large hole blown through floor of hall.  Into this we dropped mines. During this time there was roaring and shouting and apparent panic inside building.  Retreating with cable running between finger and thumb, I connected same with battery.  No explosion resulted.  I retreated with battery, and left same under D. S. E. Railway when I heard people shouting that Free Staters were coming.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The two infantry men who should have advanced with us with second mines, according to their orders, did not do so, as when myself and the men referred to emerged from building we found that they, including the rest of my own party, had already retreated. The highest praise is due to the man who seized mines, as he stuck with me to the last; neither of us had arms.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2540" />&ldquo;I had to operate with four men on job.  Six men, including carter and myself, performed job.  I do not blame the men for being dazed by the explosion, as it was more powerful than I myself anticipated. Had all three gone off I fear two of us would not have escaped.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>His superior officer, writing on the matter, says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A report in writing of the attack on Oriel House on Monday night last has not been furnished by the officer in charge of the operation, but from a conversation with him I am enabled to give the following information:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As a prelude thereto it should be mentioned that no variation from the original plan of operations was necessary, though the operations themselves did not yield by any means the looked for results, due to the fact that so much destruction was worked by the first mine explosion that it was impossible to get the other three mines into the intended position.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The plan of operation included protection of the operating engineer units by infantry, and this was adequately attended to though the infantry <i>personally</i> protecting the former were momentarily incapacitated by the explosion of the mine, and failed to accompany the engineers during the second part of the operations.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Details of the plans are as follows&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Four mines were used; three containing about fifteen pounds of high explosives each, the cases being of iron; the fourth being of wood and containing almost forty pounds of the same.  The wooden mine was intended for blowing the entrance door, and was used to avoid `shrapnel' effect.  The three `iron' mines were placed side by side in a wooden case for convenience sake, and were detonated electrically.  The wooden mine was fired with a time fuse.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The mines were carted direct to the scene of operations, and unloaded by the engineers, who numbered five or six.  The wooden mine was carried up and laid on the step of Oriel House, and two sacks of clay placed against it: then it was fired.  The firing of the mine was the signal for concentrated fire by the infantry on all portions of the building above the ground floor against which the engineers were operating and <Col N="2541" /> under cover of this the engineers carried forward the case containing the three mines intended to blow up the building. It was found on reaching the spot where the door was last seen that not only was it blown away, but also the floor, so that the mines had to be lowered into the basement.  This operation resulted in such injury to the electrical connections that the mines could not be fired.  The result is that the destruction of Oriel House was not effected.  Considerable damage, however, has been done.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>There is nothing unfair in asking a question like that. These documents would be very important at any time, but you usually have to wait until you get them.  Six men and myself, and we come along, and but for the fact that we were careless about realising that the explosion we are going to make is probably bigger than we intended, that the little explosion which was to prepare the way was bigger than it was intended to be, we can destroy the whole fabric of the Criminal Investigation Department of the Government!  You can kill all the people that are inside, perhaps you can destroy the whole street, because you do not know what the effect would have been if the three iron-bound mines had gone off.  That is the situation you are in &mdash;whether six men, and six men without any political convictions of any kind, because that is the type of men who were on the job, young men of nineteen or twenty years of age, high-spirited, out for adventure of one kind or another, led by leaders out for nothing but pure destruction, led by leaders adopting a war policy that if the British adopted it against them, although they are prepared to fight the British, would leave this country a mass <Col N="2542" /> of broken houses and a mass of dying and dead people.  It is because gradually we have realised that that is the situation in which this country is, and in which the people find themselves, although the people do not really realise it because there is a lack in putting the fact before the people, and getting the people to realise it; and there is a bigger lack still in putting the policy before the people to deal with the fact and getting the people to accept it.  We have as the responsible Army Authorities represented to the Government that we have a certain Army strength; we are able to do certain things, but it is necessary for us to have these Courts, and that having regard to our own particular circumstances and the circumstances in which we consider the Government to be, it is necessary for the Courts to be conducted in the way in which they are at present conducted.  Now, as I say, these men who were executed this morning were perhaps uneducated illiterate men, never meaning perhaps to get into a situation like this, men of no political conviction perhaps, as far as political conviction in the present situation is; and that is the type of the rank and file of twentyone, twenty-two and twenty-three years of age that you are dealing with all round the country.  We provided for these men all the spiritual assistance that we could to help them in their passage to eternity; and as an instance of what people are up against, we have these people who are out to destroy the Government, those people who month after month, through negotiation and pact and antagonism were out simply to destroy the Treaty and to bring the British back, and to fight the British if necessary in their own way, and are out to-day still at the people, still trying to betray the people, still trying to fool the people; and we read the poster which was pasted up around Boyle:&mdash;</P>
      <P>EXECUTIONS.</P>
      <P>Hamar Greenwood's Military Court condemned Kevin Barry to death. Macready sanctioned it.</P>
      <P>The Secret Courts of O'Higgins and Cosgrave condemned James Fisher, Peter Cassidy, Richard Twohig, and John Gaffney to death.  Mulcahy sanctioned it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People of Ireland!  Have you given your authority to those murderers to <Col N="2543" /> execute mere boys by Secret Trial, without allowing them to say goodbye to their Fathers and Mothers, and without seeing a priest?  Even the English did not deny Kevin Barry this consolation.  How long will you allow this to happen in your name?</P>
    <P>There are priests whom we would not allow in to see a prisoner going to his death, because we have prisoners in prison who may go to their deaths that have been brought there by priests.  We have men prisoners to-day who could say that they were misled on the moral point, that they did not know what led them to do the things they did, but that they were misadvised morally.  We have those in one part of the country.  We have them in another part of the country.  We have prisoners in prison to-day who were told when the Four Courts was attacked that if they threw down their guns it would be a sin on their souls; and for very good reasons there are certain clergymen that we would not allow in to see prisoners, that we would not allow inside our own barracks, for their own good, for our good, and for the good of the prisoners.  But we are not what are called military sitting upon our prisoners, condemning them to death because we are military and because they are prisoners.  We are people who realise that man is made in the image and likeness of God, and we treat men as such; and if it is our fate to have to condemn a man to death in order to save our country, we do not consider him as a man in that position less made in the image and likeness of his Creator than we consider ourselves <Col N="2544" /> to be; and when a man is going to his death he does get a priest.  And do you know that we are a country whose people are able to be led because they are wrongly morally advised by a clergyman to do the things they are doing now. What effect is it likely to have in parts of the country to be told that the Government here in a Catholic country sends their prisoners to their death without seeing a priest?  These are some of the difficulties confronting our people, and these are some of the difficulties confronting us.  When you get a changed situation you can act differently.  Feeling the very serious responsibilities that are on us and wishing to save this country&mdash; and wishing for nothing else&mdash;we have advised the Government that their business to-day has to be conducted in the way in which we are conducting it.</P>
