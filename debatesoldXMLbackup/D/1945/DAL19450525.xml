      <P>Deputies in speaking to the Estimate last night in a number of cases, I think, did not realise that the Book of Estimates was prepared, as is usual, in the autumn and had gone to the printers by Christmas.  The war did not end until 1st May.  That accounts for some of the criticism that we did not provide in the Estimates for certain post-war plans that I mentioned. As Deputies will realise, that does not prevent us from going on with any plans we may be able to formulate.  As I explained, some of these plans depend on certain supplies, and I am not sure indeed if these supplies will be available during this financial year but, if they should be available, the matter can be regularised by bringing a Supplementary Estimate before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>A question raised in that connection had regard to a more liberal supply of boats and nets.  That would not come exactly within post-war plans; it would come within ordinary administration but, again, if boats and gear should become more plentiful than was anticipated when the Estimates were being prepared, we certainly will lose no opportunity in trying to get them.</P>
      <P>Deputy McMenamin did not think that the sub-head, Whaling, was very serious.  It is.  As a matter of fact, how that arose in the beginning was that we, being a maritime country, joined with other maritime countries in a convention on whaling.  We have never lost any money on it.  During some of the years a number of foreign ships which went whaling registered in this country, and under the Bill that we brought in we were able to charge certain registration fees.  We had, of course, to spend a certain amount of that money, but there was a small profit to be made out of it.  I do not know if whaling will be revived during the coming year, or, if it is revived, whether any ships will register here or not, but, if they do, the country will certainly lose nothing by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of cutch was raised. There is a suitable substitute.  I am informed <Col N="965" /> that the fishermen for whom Deputy McMenamin speaks, are not very favourably disposed towards this substitute, but it can be got if they are anxious to use it.</P>
    <P>The question of fish transport, of course, is a matter for the Department of Industry and Commerce, but as far as I am concerned, and as far as my Department is concerned, we are only too willing to help in every way possible.  We were asked also why we did not proceed with certain powers that we were given under the 1939 Act, with regard to the taking over of weirs and estuarine fisheries.  A lot of those activities in inland fisheries, and in many other departments were, of course, postponed for various reasons when the war came along.  One reason was that the staffs of the Departments were very busy on emergency measures, and matters of this kind were put aside for the moment. Secondly, a large amount of money would have to be provided, and, as Deputies know, the Exchequer found it fairly hard to cope with emergency conditions without having matters of this kind brought in.  Thirdly, we did not want to interfere in any way with the supply of food that was there.  To take an example, if we were to abolish fresh-water netting, which we could have done under one of the powers given to us by that Act, there would be, temporarily, at any rate, a somewhat lower price of food, and we thought that the emergency period was not a good time to take on that kind of thing.  Now that the war is over, and we may get back to normal conditions again, we hope to make some progress with regard to the powers given under the 1939 Act.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan asked about disease in trout in the Valleymount area.  The scientists have not come to any definite conclusion with regard to the cause. There is a number of theories, none of which has definitely been established yet.  As I said in the beginning, the technical side of my Department are giving whatever help they can to the Electricity Supply Board in dealing with this matter, and it is possible I think that we may be able to do something <Col N="966" /> about it.  I do not think there is great danger of the spread of this trouble to other rivers or other lakes. I need hardly assure Deputies that we have always kept in touch with any scientific advances that were made in other countries, and will continue to take advantage of any progress in that way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kilroy spoke about the neglect of the fisheries in the West. He mentioned Clew Bay, and talked of the necessity for piers in that particular area.  I was reminded of a quotation from a book written by George Bermingham, in which he said that Clew Bay has as many piers as a comb has teeth; so the plea that more piers are required does not appear capable of standing very much examination.  Deputy Coburn expressed anxiety about the cost which would be involved in carrying out the very grandiose scheme of post-war planning.  I think we can leave it to the two Departments concerned, that is my own Department and the Department of Finance, to see that there will not be any money foolishly spent.  Deputy Corish spoke of the difficulty of getting boats and gear.  There is a genuine difficulty.  In fact, I do not think we can say that we have any boat to spare at the moment, and the amount of gear is very limited, but if there is any genuine grievance I will certainly have it examined, and will see that whatever we have will be distributed as equitably as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bartley spoke of regional marketing.  There may be a good deal in that point.  Anything that would help to prevent the transport of fish, say, from Galway to Dublin and from Dublin back to Galway again, should be investigated very closely.  Whether it will be possible, as Deputy Bartley recommends, to have a regular and a level price for fish landed at the various centres all over the country is a question I cannot answer at the moment, but we should aim as far as possible at a scheme of that kind.  As the debate went on, I think there was some confusion with regard to what I said about a trawler service.  What I said was that the inshore fishermen <Col N="967" /> themselves could never give us a regular supply of fish of fair variety, and that it would be necessary to have a trawler service to supply certain types of fish at all times throughout the year. Some Deputies, perhaps, as a result of listening to one another, seemed to have the idea that I said those trawlers would be stationed all around the coast.  That is not the intention. The intention is that a trawler company should be got going somehow or other, and that it should operate, as a trawler company would operate, going to places where the fish is to be got, and especially the fish that might be required at a particular time.  I do not think that the number could be very definitely decided upon at the moment. Deputies mentioned ten to 12 trawlers. Probably that is too many.  I think if we were to start with four good trawlers, and make a trial, we might find that it would not be necessary to go to ten or 12.  It might be necessary to go as high as six or seven.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bartley also asked when this Bill, which I mentioned on more than one occasion, to deal with the powers and constitution of boards of conservators would be brought in.  Well, the intention was to have all such matters considered when the Consolidation Bill is brought before the Dáil.  I mentioned that at present a Consolidation Bill is being prepared, taking all the legislation which was passed since 1842, up to the present time, putting the whole lot into one Bill and bringing it before the Dáil.  At that stage, certain amendments in the present law would be considered, including, if thought advisable, such matters as the constitution and the powers of boards of conservators.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy asked about an experimental boat that was being allocated to his area of South Cork.  The boat, so far as the hull is concerned, has been ready for a long time.  The difficulty was to get a suitable engine, and I understand that that difficulty is now being solved.  The only other point I want to refer to was raised by Deputy Morrissey.  Deputy Morrissey got up to say that he, personally, did not know a lot about fisheries, but he had been listening for 20 years to the criticism <Col N="968" /> of the Fisheries Department and, from that, had concluded that that Department left a great deal to be desired.  Well, I think Deputy Morrissey is not so innocent as to believe that criticism in the Dáil is at all times justified in every way.  He said that a great deal of money had been devoted to fisheries, and apparently had not given any great fruit. Now, I do not think that some of the Deputies to whom Deputy Morrissey listened had made themselves very familiar with the facts.  The truth is that during last year the turnover in our fisheries, that is sea and inland fisheries, was almost £1,000,000, which was a very substantial figure, and I might say a very much bigger figure than was reached five, ten, 15 or 20 years ago.  Looking at the net amount spent on fisheries during the last four years, I find that it never exceeded £17,000.  In one year, it was as low as £14,000.  If the amount spent on fisheries every year runs from £14,000 to £17,000, I think Deputies will admit that that is an extremely small amount; it certainly is not very substantial, and to speak of substantial sums scarcely gives us a fair picture. It is true, of course, that large sums have been voted for the provision of boats and gear, but that is only by way of loan.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, at the moment there is not a penny of arrears due on the repayments that go to the Exchequer in respect of these advances. That is a very satisfactory statement to be able to make about fishermen. As everybody knows, fishermen have a very strenuous time in making a living. There is a great deal of chance and so on about the work on which they are engaged.  If, as a result of the scheme drawn up, they were able to get boats and gear and to increase substantially the amount of fish caught, as to which I gave figures in the beginning, and are now up to date in their repayments, I think we can congratulate the fishermen on the hard work they have put in during the last four or five years and on their commercial honesty in paying their debts.</P>

      <P>During the week I asked the Minister in a question if he would make inquiries as to whether <Col N="969" /> there was a market for cured mackerel on the Continent.  His reply was to the effect that there was a scarcity of barrels and salt and that there would be no point in making the inquiries. I am aware that a number of merchants have a small stock of barrels and salt on hands.  Will the Minister give a guarantee that, if the merchants cure the mackerel this year, he will procure a market on the Continent for them?  It is a very important question, because there is practically no demand in England for mackerel at present.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Deputy is correct in saying that I said that, as there were no barrels, the matter would not be inquired into.  No Deputy would believe that we would not make every effort to inquire into a possible market for the mackerel if they are properly packed in barrels. There may be a few barrels available and, if the barrels are packed properly, we will make every possible endeavour to see that the mackerel are sold.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to effect certain amendments of the Court Officers Act, 1926, which experience of the working of the system set up under that Act has shown to be desirable.  The Bill is not, perhaps, one which lends itself to the kind of debate usual on Second Reading, as it deals with a number of distinct and unconnected matters which could probably be more conveniently considered and discussed in detail on the Committee Stage.  I shall content myself, therefore, with a brief explanation of the Bill's provisions and the reasons for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="970" /> Under Sections 2 and 3 it is proposed to take power to enable the Minister for Justice to relieve the Master of the High Court of the purely administrative functions and duties in relation to the central office and the other offices of the High Court which are vested in him at present by Sections 4 and 5 of the 1926 Act.  The Minister will be able to exercise this power only after he has consulted the President of the High Court.  If an order is made relieving the Master of the administrative duties, these duties will then be performed by an officer of the High Court who will be nominated for that purpose by the Minister, again after consultation with the President. The judicial control provided for in the 1926 Act, so far as the conduct of business in court is concerned, is being fully preserved.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 and 5 deal with the pension terms of a limited class of court officers, namely, the Master of the High Court, the taxing masters of that court and county registrars.  These officers are at present pensionable under the Superannuation Acts on ordinary Civil Service terms, which means that they can qualify for full pension only with a minimum of 40 years' service.  The Act of 1926 lays down as an essential qualification for appointment to any of the offices in question a minimum period of practice in the legal profession&mdash;in the case of the Master of the High Court 10 years' practice at the Bar and, in the case of taxing masters and county registrars, 10 and eight years' practice respectively as solicitors.  The earliest possible age at which appointments can be made is, therefore, about 30 or slightly over.  In practice the persons appointed are usually older: in the case of county registrars, for example, the average age on appointment has been about 40.  The result is that, under Superannuation Act terms, few, if any, of these officers can hope to qualify for full pension and, where the person has been appointed at a fairly advanced age, his pension is very meagre altogether.</P>
    <P>This position has been the subject of representations by the officers concerned for some time, and it is felt that <Col N="971" /> they have a legitimate grievance which it is now proposed to try to remedy. Under Section 4 these officers are being accorded the same pension terms as district justices were given by the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, viz., full pension of two-thirds of salary after 30 years' service and proportionately for shorter service.  Section 5 makes special provision for existing officers who are being given the right to opt in due course between the new terms and their present terms.</P>
    <P>Section 6 proposes to amend the present law as contained in Sections 23 and 24 of the 1926 Act, relating to the qualifications for appointment to the posts of probate officer and examiner in the High Court.  At present a person to be qualified for appointment must be a serving court officer with a minimum of 12 years' service in the court offices.  Section 6 proposes two amendments&mdash;viz., (i) it dispenses with the requirement of 12 years' service in the case of any court officer who is a barrister or solicitor, and (ii) it opens up appointments to barristers and solicitors of not less than six years' standing provided that the Minister for Justice after consulting the President of the High Court, is satisfied that at the time there is no court officer with the necessary qualifications suitable to be appointed.</P>
    <P>The object of Section 7 is to enable a second examiner to be appointed in the High Court.  The work at present done in the examiner's office is the same as was formerly done by the two chief clerks on the Chancery side and their staffs.  What is now proposed is, in effect, a return to the system of two chief officers.  Actually, this does not mean the creation of an additional post.  So long as there are two judges doing Chancery work, it is convenient to have a fully responsible officer attached to each judge.  At present the examiner attends one judge and the assistant-examiner the other.  The law and practice require that certain final steps be done by the examiner in person, so that at present when the assistant-examiner has done the work, he must submit his papers to the examiner <Col N="972" /> before the case can be finally disposed of.  The only way by which this can be avoided is by the appointment of a second examiner which will be made possible by Section 7.  In practice it will mean the conversion of the assistant-examinership into an examinership.</P>
    <P>Section 8 enables the Minister for Justice to require any court officer to perform the duties of another office attached to his own or any other court, where such an arrangement is convenient and practicable.  Provision is made for consultation where necessary with the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court, and retrospective sanction is provided for certain arrangements of the kind in question that have been made in the past with doubtful legal authority.  Section 9 proposes that the assignment of county registrars to particular counties should be a matter for the Government rather than the Minister for Justice as it is at present.  A county registrar is appointed by the Government and there is no point in the Minister for Justice having to make a formal separate assignment to the only county in which a vacancy exists at the time the appointment is made.  In practice the Government will appoint expressly to the existing vacancy.  Section 10 is merely a machinery provision intended to remedy a minor defect in the existing statutory provisions relating to the revision or alteration of District Court districts or areas.  As to Section 11, since the enactment of the 1926 Act, no appointment has been made to the office of under-sheriff.  According as vacancies occurred in that office, the duties were taken over by the county registrar for the county or county borough in accordance with Section 54 of the 1926 Act.  This system has worked well on the whole, but in the case of Dublin and, to a lesser extent, of Cork, the duties of the county registrar are already so heavy that it is not desirable that he should also be made responsible for the duties of under-sheriff.  It may also happen in the course of time in some of the other larger counties that the double duties of county registrar and under-sheriff will prove too exacting for one officer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="973" /> Accordingly, it is proposed in Section 11 to take power to enable a county registrar, to whom the duties of under-sheriff have already been transferred, to be relieved of the whole or part of those duties and also, as regards any county in which an under-sheriff is still operating, to enable an Order to be made, if thought necessary, declaring that the provisions of Section 54 of the 1926 Act shall not apply, so that the county registrar will not be vested with the under-sheriff's duties on the latter vacating office.  In any such case, it is proposed that the Government may appoint a person to be sheriff and he will be responsible for such of the duties, functions, etc., of the former under-sheriff as are not vested in the county registrar.  Provision is made for the revocation on the occasion of a vacancy in the office of sheriff of the Order previously made under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) of the section, so that the under-sheriff's duties may revert to the county registrar if this course should be considered desirable at the time.  Paragraph (f) of sub-section (3) makes the necessary provision for cases in which the duties of returning officer are imposed on the sheriff.</P>
    <P>The purpose of sub-section (4) of the section is to preserve the existing area of jurisdiction of the County Dublin under-sheriff until the present under-sheriff vacates office.  Sub-section (5) specifies the qualifications for the office of sheriff. viz., (i) practice as a barrister or solicitor for not less than five years, or (ii) five years' experience as managing clerk or principal assistant to an under-sheriff or sheriff, and sub-section (6) specifies the various conditions of employment that will apply to the office of sheriff.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for the repeal of Section 45 of the Debtors (Ireland) Act, 1840.  Section 45 required every under-sheriff to nominate a deputy, resident or with an office withinone mile of the Four Courts, for the receipt of writs, decrees, etc.  In modern conditions this requirement is unnecessary.  Compliance with it involves some trouble administratively every time a county registrar takes over an under-sheriff's <Col N="974" /> duties.  Repeal of the provision will mean a small saving to the Exchequer, as the deputy nominated for each county registrar is allowed to retain a proportion of the lodgment fees which would otherwise be surrendered to the Exchequer.  The Incorporated Law Society and all the officers concerned have been consulted and there is unanimity of opinion that this out-of-date provision may be repealed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that there is very little to be said on the Second Reading of this Bill.  In so far as any principle can be extracted from the Bill which would be appropriate for comment on a Second Reading, it would be the alteration in the Master's duties and the change in the office of under-sheriff.</P>
      <P>With regard to the change in the Master's duty, the Minister did not give the House very much information as to why it was found necessary, as a result of experience, to relieve the Master of the various duties which were imposed upon him, from the administrative point of view, by the Act of 1926.  I do not want to enter into that matter here at the moment, but I would like to ask the Minister if he has fully considered whether the change is brought about merely by reason of personal differences which might be of a passing nature and whether, on reconsideration, the old machinery established by the Act of 1926 might be allowed to continue.  I would not like to think that it was merely because of differences of personalities that a change of this kind was brought about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will probably recall that when the Act of 1926 was going through the House, there was very considerable controversy as to its terms and as to how far they encroached on the judicial independence.  The blessed words, &ldquo;in consultation with,&rdquo; went very far to solve the difficulties that arose at that time, and I see they are still maintained in all their glory in this Bill.  At the same time, I am a little uneasy&mdash;though I do not wish to press the matter&mdash;as to whether conflict over personalities is not interfering in what ought to have worked very well as a system, certainly in the abstract.  I understand that the existing <Col N="975" /> official who occupies the position of Master has a dual rôle at the moment: in addition to being Master, he is carrying on the duties of the old Registrar in Bankruptcy.  I would like the Minister to see that his position in that respect is safeguarded.</P>
    <P>With regard to the office of sheriff, a change was effected by the Act of 1926 from the system whereby there was an under-sheriff who was an almost independent official, and not really part of the general machinery of government.  I think that the new system theoretically was a very good one, and that a good change was made. At the same time, I agree with the Minister that in certain cases the system has not worked as well as it was hoped it would, because of the mass of business.  One of the reasons why I was more or less converted to the scheme which is now embodied in this Bill was that some years ago&mdash; about a year or two after the change of Government&mdash;the late Deputy Patrick Hogan, who was Minister for Agriculture, and a member of the Government when the 1926 Act was passed, and who approved of this scheme as regards making the office of sheriff more closely united with the general machinery of the administration of justice in the way that was embodied in the Act&mdash;expressed the view to me, that, on the whole, he thought that system was not working too well, and that there was a lot to be said for the old system of an independent under-sheriff.  I have watched the administration of that particular side of the Department of Justice since that time, and I think that the onerous work thrown upon the county registrars as a result of the Act of 1926&mdash; and, in particular, the very inadequate pay they receive for the discharge of their duties&mdash;gives the justification for the provisions contained in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is one matter which might be more appropriate to the Committee Stage, but perhaps the Minister would consider it in the meantime.  The section dealing with the sheriff is pretty comprehensive and satisfactory in its own way, but I am not sure that <Col N="976" /> the provision in sub-section (6), that the office is to be held &ldquo;at the will and pleasure of the Government&rdquo;, is wholly satisfactory.  I presume that nothing I can say will change that or make the office more permanent or give more security of tenure to the holder. The office of under-sherrif is one of vital importance in the administration of justice.  It is essential that the person who occupies that position should be a man of outstanding integrity, that there should be no question of any interference or any possibility of any interference with him in the discharge of his duties.  The collection of debts and the enforcement of court orders is vital to the effective and smooth working of the machinery of justice.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any possibility of anything in the nature of bribery in the case of any of the holders of that office, but I would certainly like to see the office so built up that the holder of it would be free from any temptations in that regard.  It is, of course, very desirable that there should be control over the man who has that position and, to that extent, I suppose the Minister will justify the appointment being &ldquo;at the will and pleasure of the Government&rdquo;.  At the same time, the holder of the office should be so adequately remunerated as to be placed beyond the region of temptation.  It is an office which may leave the holder peculiarly subject to temptation and it is of the utmost importance that the holder should be a man of irreproachable character and one who will continue to be of irreproachable character during the whole tenure of his office.  He should, therefore, in my submission to the Minister, be adequately remunerated.  He has a very difficult task to fulfil and he should not be put into a position where his interests and duties might conflict, with consequent detriment to public interest. I think, therefore, that he should be suitably remunerated and that there should be an adequate pension provided for him.  However, the Minister is determined, apparently, that the office is to be non-pensionable.</P>

      <P>I quite understand the reason for it not being pensionable, but I wish to point out that the remuneration should be such as to render the holder of the office free from the temptations to which we know he would be peculiarly open.  I agree there is not much case to be made for a pension, but at least there should be adequate remuneration.</P>
      <P>The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of sub-section (6) appear to me to be slightly contradictory.  The office is to be held at the will and pleasure of the Government and then there is a provision that the age of retirement shall be 65 years, but the Minister could in a particular case continue the office for a certain number of years.  If the office is to be held at the will and pleasure of the Government, there does not seem to be any particular reason why 65 years should be put in if a man has no particular security of tenure.  I think the provision of 65 years is, perhaps, a little low and, as the Government have the complete control over the office, the situation might be met by putting in, instead of paragraph (b) of sub-section (6), a provision to the effect that the holder shall not in any event hold the office after he has attained the age of 70 years.  A provision providing that the office is to be held at the will and pleasure of the Government, coupled with a provision such as I suggest, that the holder should not occupy the office after the age of 70 years, would meet the situation clearly.</P>
      <P>However, the main thing I am anxious about in connection with this office is that so far as possible it should be free from political considerations. I do not hope for very much from that in the circumstances, but so far as possible I think the Minister should get the best man to act and, having got the best man, he should see that that person will continue to be in a position where he will not be subject to the temptations to which this office peculiarly renders him liable.</P>

      <P>So far as this Bill goes, it appears to be all right.  My great complaint is not in connection with what is in the Bill, but what is left out <Col N="978" /> of it.  There are a number of things that could well be dealt with in this Bill; in particular, certain court staffs should be covered by its provisions. These unfortunate men are left there for years, some for 20 years, without any provision being made for them.  In numbers of cases they are still unestablished and they expect to be thrown on the scrap heap without any provision being made for them, after giving 20 years' service or over.  It is unfair to expect men to give such long service under these conditions; it is unfair to differentiate between them and other people in the public service.  I think some provision for these men should have been included in a Bill such as this.  I should like to know if it is the Minister's intention to deal with these officers in the near future.</P>
      <P>It was only after years of experience of the 1926 Act that we found there were numbers of things provided for in that Act that would not work.  We are going back more and more to the position that existed before that legislation was introduced.  We have the High Court on circuit now established and appeals are being re-heard directly instead of on the stenographer's notes. We found that the previous practice would not work.  We also find that county registrars who, under the 1926 Act, were made general Pooh-bahs&mdash; everything was shoved on to them&mdash; could not cope with all the work. There are various reasons for that.  It is obvious that all the duties that were cast on the county registrar under the 1926 Act could not possibly be carried out in an efficient manner.  We have had many instances where, because they had so many duties to attend to, the county registrars were unable properly to supervise their various staffs. We have had some instances of trouble in county registrars' offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see that provision is being made to take the duties of sheriff away from the county registrar in certain instances.  I would like the Minister to go further and, in the country particularly, to take the duties of probate officer away from the county registrars.  There is provision in Section 6 dealing with the appointment of probate officer.  There does <Col N="979" /> not appear to be any good reason why the probate office in the country should be amalgamated with that of the county registrar.  The county registrar's duties are many and onerous. His duties, in my opinion, and in the opinion of other members of my profession, will increase.  In the future, for various reasons, litigation will increase.  For instance, there will be an increased number of cars on the road and there is the likelihood that accidents will increase in number, and we have also to consider the manner in which people carry out their work in modern times.  If the county registrar has to deal not alone with the chancery side of his work, but also with costs, particularly in the case of a large county, he will have quite enough to do without having to attend to other duties.  His responsibilities will undoubtedly increase and it is unfair to expect him to perform duties such as those concerned with probate.  He should not be asked to act as local probate officer.  I trust the Minister will see his way to introduce a further section providing, particularly in the case of county registrars who have to look after large areas, that the duties of probate officer will be made the subject of a separate appointment.</P>
    <P>In connection with the office of sheriff, I am inclined to agree with Deputy Costello that the sheriff should not be in the position of holding office at the will and pleasure of any particular Government.  I think, owing to the type of office and to the responsibilities of the office, that there should be permanency about it.  I also think the office should be pensionable, if that were possible.  At all events, I would like to see provision made for the proper remuneration of the occupant of the office.  The sheriff is an officer who will deal with very large amounts of money and who will have very difficult duties to perform in certain cases. I should like to see him as independent as possible.  Perhaps the Minister could give some assurance to the House that the remuneration for this office will be adequate.  I would not like to leave the officer to the tender mercies of the Minister for Finance, as he seems to be left under this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="980" /> The qualifications set out for the person to be appointed to this office are that he is a barrister or a solicitor of not less than five years' standing, or has acted for not less than five years as managing clerk or principal assistant to an under-sheriff or sheriff. I suggest that the latter provision should be deleted.  Perhaps it is a matter which would better be discussed in Committee, but there is one consideration which, while it may not weigh very much with the House, should be considered by the Minister. It is the position of the solicitor's profession, particularly the overcrowding of that profession, and the fact that the members of it have no outlet such as the members of other professions have.  If members of the medical or other professions can find no place for themselves here, they have the opportunity of going elsewhere.  Those in the solicitor's profession have not got that opportunity, and it is quite a common thing to find young men who have spent a number of years and quite an amount of their parents' money in order to be admitted to the solicitor's profession in the position of being unable to make a livelihood. I have had the experience of finding young men prepared to work in my office or any other office for as low as 30/- a week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with paragraph (c) of Section 11 (5).  I suggest that that provision should be removed and I am giving my reasons for that suggestion.  The Minister should confine the office of sheriff to the solicitor's profession, the position being that there is no provision of a panel for the solicitor's profession and no provision in respect of unemployment for these young men who can find no outlet and cannot make their living outside the country.  An office of this kind has always been filled by the solicitor's profession, and the Minister should now see to it that it will be confined to that profession.  Solicitors have a right to expect that the office will be filled by a member of their <Col N="981" /> profession when it becomes vacant under this section.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Bill so far as they go appear to be satisfactory enough otherwise, and I think the Minister will find after a very short experience of the working of the Bill that the position will be much more satisfactory from the point of view of both the public and legal profession, that we will not have the complaints we have had when all these offices were combined, when returns could not be acted on and when very long delays occurred.  I can only hope that the Minister will give some indication now that the people I have mentioned, who should properly be dealt with in this Bill, these unfortunate members of Circuit Court staffs who were left to wait and to hope for over 20 years&mdash; some of them are now becoming very old men&mdash;that under successive Ministers for Justice something would be done for them, are not being forgotten and will not, at the ages of 65 or 70, after a life's work in the service of the State, be thrown on the scrap-heap.</P>

      <P>I suppose that every vested interest in this country would like to ensure that profitable positions were reserved for them, but there is no obligation on any young man to become a solicitor.  If he does not want to become a solicitor, nobody is pressing him to become a solictor, but if he does spend his parent's money to become a solicitor, he should not be &ldquo;traipsing&rdquo; in here to tell us that he is on his beam ends, having become a solicitor. He could have become a veterinary surgeon, a shop assistant or a publican. He could have followed a wide variety of other profitable occupations in his native land, but the fact that he chose to become a solicitor seems to me no good reason why he should claim a preemptive right to displace a man who has acted for from five to 30 years as a managing clerk or principal assistant to an under-sheriff or sheriff.  I have the greatest regard for the solicitor's profession in this country&mdash;I have a great many friends among them, but if I had to choose between a solicitor, fresh from the Incorporated Law Society's premises on the quays and <Col N="982" /> a man who spent 25 years of his life as principal clerk to a sheriff, I would not have very much doubt as to whom I should appoint as sheriff.  If I were Minister for Justice, I would reserve my discretion in that matter, and I hope the Minister will.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moran heartily welcomes the division of offices.  Deputy Moran is a practising solicitor, and has more experience of what is convenient in the Circuit Court, and no doubt in the High Court, than I, but I want to enter this <i>caveat</i> as a simple, ignorant merchant citizen for whom these courts are primarily intended, that is that the costs in the Circuit Court are already fantastic, and that if the division of offices is to result in additional cost, the situation will become ludicrous. At present if I want to vindicate my land from the claim of a neighbour to use it as his hen-run, I must go to the Circuit Court, and if I want to dissuade that neighbour's hen from continually trespassing on my land&mdash;and when you have only seven acres of land in parts of the West of Ireland, it may be a pretty important business to keep your neighbour's hen off it&mdash;I have to go to the Circuit Court.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="983" /> The Deputy has made a trenchant case for solicitors.  I am speaking for the seven-acre man who wants to keep his neighbour's hen at bay and who will not be heard in the District Court. The moment he goes into the District Court, if he does go in, he is asked the question: &ldquo;Does this hen contest the proposition that you own the land?&rdquo; and, if he is obliged to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, then himself and the hen are sent to the Circuit Court.  Deputy Moran says that this Bill will not increase costs on people.  I am asking the Minister to assure me that the matter of the hen, or analogous matters under the operation of this Bill, will not impose additional cost on litigants going to the Circuit Court.  If it does impose additional cost, then, I think, onerous as may be the present burden on the county registrar, the fact is that we cannot afford to pay any more officers in the Circuit Court, and Deputy Moran and the solicitor's profession will have to wait in patience for whatever reforms they want.  The people are not able to bear any more expense in order to provide a more efficient service in the Circuit Court.  The only effect of an attempt to get a more efficient service in the Circuit Court, by raising costs there, will be to deny justice to people altogether, because they will not be able to afford to go into court at all.  I ask Deputies to bear in mind that we are coming very near that position now.  I know many people in rural Ireland whose smouldering differences might be properly resolved, and good feeling restored, if the cause of the difference between them was brought before an impartial court and there finally determined and disposed of.  But they will not, and cannot, go to court, because the costs are too high.  Do not raise them any higher.  No consideration conceivable, from the point of view of efficiency, would justify such a course.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moran has expressed his regret that Circuit Court officers are not dealt with more comprehensively in this Bill.  I want to say a word on the same lines as those adopted by Deputy Moran in respect of District Court clerks.  I regret that, when the Minister drafted the Court Officers <Col N="984" /> Bill, he did not avail of this opportunity to deal generously with the position of the District Court clerks. I think he is familiar with their circumstances, and that he will recall that not a few of them were old Petty Sessions clerks who had pension rights.  When this State came into being, it was not at all easy, in many of the remoter districts, to get the reliable man who was required to function as a District Court clerk in our courts, and hence in many cases these old Petty Sessions clerks were asked to take the job.  They were very glad to get the job, and at the same time the State was very glad to avail of their services.  I have no doubt that many respectable men who functioned in the Sinn Féin courts stepped forward and were put in the position of District Court clerks, and that others entered the service <i>de novo.</i> We had then the difficulty that most of those men were receiving remuneration for the limited work they did.  It was insufficient to provide an income for a married man and his family, but there was a tacit understanding that, as they were only part-time officers, they would be free to take up insurance agencies and other jobs of that kind.  But the necessity of supplementing their income from other sources of that kind made it impossible for them to consider the conditions attendant on establishment, because if they became established officers they would be liable to be transferred to any part of the country and were they transferred from the places where they originally got the job of District Court clerk they would be turning away from all the ancillary jobs which contributed to the total income they now enjoy. The fact is that many of those men are now approaching pension age and have no pension rights at all, so that on reaching the age of 60 or 70 years they will be thrown on the waves of the world with nothing.</P>
    <P>I fully sympathise with the Minister in his difficulty in respect of unestablished officers.  He finds himself in the great difficulty that if he were to concede in principle that unestablished officers were to get pensions applications would pour in from every branch of the service where an analogous position <Col N="985" /> obtains.  I would, therefore, suggest to him that he might consider whether those officers who were appointed after the establishment of the courts at the very beginning, or a year or two after the courts were first established, should be given special consideration.  I think there was some kind of an implied&mdash;I will not say expressed&mdash;undertaking that they would receive special consideration.  The Minister, having provided for them as an exceptional class, should then consider whether he would not resolve to amalgamate court districts, so that for the future when a man was appointed to the position of a District Court clerk he would know that he would be an established officer&mdash;that he would be in the position of a pensioned fulltime man.  That man might, under an amalgamation scheme, have three or four court districts, and would be entitled to his pension the same as any other civil servant.  He would be liable, however, to transfer to whatever area the Minister might assign to him.  The position has been reached at present where you have a number of men approaching the pension age and where no provision whatever has been made for them.  The number is microscopic, although that very fact often tends to make this House ignore their position on the ground that there are very few of them.  I beg the House to remember, and remembering, I have no doubt they will sympathise with the case that I am making, that the right to a pension in the case of one of these District Court clerks means all the world to his wife and family.  If they had been accustomed to hold their heads high, to keep a nice home, to educate their children and so forth, by stretching a very exiguous income to its limit, and then suddenly find that on the father reaching the retiring age a very essential part of their income drops away, with nothing to take its place, they may be reduced from a condition of modest affluence to one of extreme indigency.  I am thinking of these few individual cases.  I do not think that the representation they have made to the Minister has been by any means unsympathetically received, but the time has come when <Col N="986" /> something ought to be done, and I invite the Minister to avail of the occasion of this Bill to do in their regard what Deputy Moran has asked to be done in regard to the officers of the Circuit Court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Dillon in his plea for the District Court clerks who have been retired from the service, or who are about to be retired.  Many of them came into the service in middle life.  In fact, some of them were past middle life. Some of them had been previously engaged either as Petty Sessions clerks or as parish or District Court clerks under the Republican régime.  I know of cases in my own constituency of men who suffered long terms of imprisonment because of their services during that period and who are now in a state of destitution.  I know that the Minister has received representations from the District Court Clerks' Association, and that he is personally sympathetic.  I believe the trouble is with the Minister for Finance.  I would ask him again to make a special plea with the Minister for Finance in those cases of hardship.  They are not very numerous, but I can assure the Minister that there are some shocking cases of hardship, especially of men who are over 70 years of age.  I know of one man who acted as a clerk in the district republican court who suffered a long term of imprisonment. That man is in a state of destitution to-day if he has not gone to the county home.  Cases of that kind should have been brought within the terms of this Bill.  They are not very numerous, and it would not cost the State very much to give them a reasonable pension that would keep them out of the county homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another class of officer to which I should like to direct the Minister's attention is the court summons servers. They are part-time officers, but the salaries paid them in present conditions are entirely inadequate.  In addition, the fees are now out of proportion to the depreciated value of money, so much so that it is almost impossible in certain areas to get the <Col N="987" /> right type of person to come forward to act as summons server.  In certain counties we had the position that no summons server was available.  Many of these men served in the Old I.R.A. and have very small means and, for that reason, I ask the Minister, if possible, to try to bring these officers within the terms of the Bill.  If he cannot find it possible to increase the salaries, perhaps he would consider some slight increase in the fees which they earn by serving summonses and writs.  I cannot agree with Deputy Moran that the office of sheriff should be restricted to the solicitor's profession. I do not think the Deputy intended that when he began to speak. He stated that he was concerned to cut out managing clerks or assistant under-sheriffs, but when he developed his argument it was entirely in favour of making the position a closed borough for the solicitor's profession, cutting out even the barrister's profession. I do not think that was the Deputy's original intention.  If it was, he did not advance any argument for excluding barristers any more than excluding managing clerks.  I should not like to see the Minister's hands tied by a provision of that kind.  I think he should have wide discretion. As Deputy Costello pointed out, the position is one that requires a person of high character and integrity and, for that reason, it is essential that he should have the widest discretion in appointing sheriffs or in selecting candidates for the office.  Now that the opportunity occurs I ask the Minister, if possible to review the position of District Court clerks, particularly the cases of men who gave sterling service to the State in the Republican courts, many of whom are in a state of destitution, and also the position of summons servers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.S. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the Minister seeks to take control of the central office from the Master.  I consider that the Master, who is daily in constant touch with every detail of court procedure, is the person best qualified to be in charge of the central office and I trust that under this section, if passed, the Minister will not <Col N="988" /> make any Order transferring the control of that office.  I always considered that the Master should have increased powers and jurisdiction.  The original intention when setting up the office was that the Master should deal with all <i>ex parte</i> applications, matters dealing with procedure, and matters not contested, so as to save time and leave the judges their full time to deal with major issues.  That position has been departed from, because several orders made by the Master were set aside on the grounds that his jurisdiction was not sufficient to make such orders.  I consider that the Minister should seek to restore to the Master the jurisdiction that it was originally intended he should have.  Such a step would result in the speeding-up of procedure in the High Court.  I welcome the provision of pensions for county registrars, and I suggest to the Minister that he should allow county registrars to remain in office until they reach the age of 70.  That is the position with regard to judges in the High Courts and Circuit Courts and, if it is considered that judges may continue their duties until they reach 70 years, I can see no reason why the same should not apply to county registrars.</P>
      <P>With regard to the section dealing with the Examiner's Office, I always considered that there should be two Examiners for the High Court.  The Department of Finance always thought otherwise, and appears to consider every proposal connected with the courts to be extravagant, and that certain offices were not necessary at all. We may commend the zeal of the Department of Finance on behalf of the taxpayers, but they are not qualified to decide whether an officer of the court is or is not necessary.  In Section 7 the Minister has the right, after consultation with the President of the High Court, to appoint a second Examiner, but that is qualified by the words &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should take the latter words out of the section. The Minister is asked to consult the President of the High Court but he must get the consent of the Minister for Finance.  If the position were reversed I would approve of it.  I <Col N="989" /> would have it that the Minister should consult the Minister for Finance, and ask the consent of the President of the High Court.  If the President of the High Court and the Minister considered that there should be a second examiner, there should be no question whatever of having to obtain the consent of the Minister for Finance.  There is only one High Court in this country. It is not as if there were several officers of the same kind, and the amount of money involved is not so great that the Minister for Finance should be allowed to have a veto as to whether an appointment should or should not be made.  I suggest that there should be two examiners.</P>
    <P>I consider that the whole procedure on what is called the chancery side of the High Court, dealing with the winding up of estates, companies, trusts and matters of that kind, is wholly out of date, being too slow and too cumbersome. The greatest injustice is caused, notably by the delays that occur.  I am sorry to have to say it, but a good deal of delay is due to solicitors.  Very often several solicitors are engaged in these cases.  If one solicitor causes delay the others do not like to take steps to hurry him up.  I suggest that the Examiner should be given authority to intervene in a case where he thinks there is delay, and to take whatever steps he considers necessary for the purpose of speeding up the proceedings. With regard to the office of sheriff, I agree with the suggestion of Deputy Moran that clause (c) of the section should be deleted from the Bill. I consider that the office of sheriff needs a qualified lawyer, either a solicitor or a barrister.  I do not think the Minister will ever find the proper type of sheriff amongst assistants to under-sheriffs.  I do not know of any under-sheriffs who keep managing assistants.  The only assistant I knew them to keep was a court messenger. I consider that the Minister might take that clause out of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The office of sheriff should be confined either to a barrister or solicitor with five years' practice.  Again, I would say that the procedure for collection of debts needs stringent overhaul. For that reason, I am in favour of the <Col N="990" /> provision that the office of sheriff be held at the will and pleasure of the Government.  It is necessary that the Minister should have complete control over the sheriffs so as to ensure that they carry out their duties properly regarding the collection of debts.  It too often happens, particularly in my experience, that a decree is given to the sheriff, the sheriff's messenger goes to the house of the debtor and, if he is good enough to take him cut and give him a few drinks in the local public-house or give him a little present, the decree is marked <i>nulla bona</i> and handed back to the solicitor.  That is all you can do about it.  There are too many cases in which the sheriff fails to collect debts where the debtor concerned has goods.  For that reason, I am in favour of the Minister having absolute control over the sheriff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Costello hoped that it was not for reasons of a passing nature that the provision regarding the duties of the Master was introduced. I can assure him that the reasons are not of a passing nature.  A man might be an excellent barrister and, as such, qualified for the office of Master, but he might have no experience of administrative work.  He would require to know all about Civil Service procedure, and it is not desirable, we think, that a man who is appointed because of his special qualifications as a barrister should be asked to discharge duties of which he has had no experience and for which he had no training.  Therefore, we intend to relieve the Master of those administrative duties.  That is being done after a great deal of consideration and it is not due to reasons of a passing nature.  Deputy O'Connor wanted us to extend his functions, but I do not think we could do that.  As regards the appointment of a second Examiner and the mention of the Minister for Finance in that connection, the Minister for Finance is responsible for the entire Civil Service.  Every Minister has to consult him regarding staff matters and it would not be right or proper that his consent should not be required for such appointments.  So far as this question of the examiner is concerned, <Col N="991" /> he intends to agree to the proposal, but we have to get his formal consent. That is a thing which, I think, will be insisted upon by every Government.</P>
      <P>As regards the sheriffs' work, I understand that, with the exception of Dublin and Cork, the county registrars have not found the extra work which came to them when the under-sheriff passed out of office too onerous.  As Deputies are aware, there was no way of continuing the office of under-sheriff. Once the under-sheriff went out of office, all his duties devolved on the registrar and, in the County and City of Dublin and Cork, it is or would be practically impossible for the county registrar to discharge both duties. Therefore, this Bill was necessary to enable sheriffs to be appointed, where necessary.  As regards the probate question raised by Deputy Moran, we have had no complaints that that has involved very much extra work for the county registrar.  It is not the opinion of the Department that it has involved a great deal of extra work.  We think that the work is being done satisfactorily and that it is not necessary to provide separate officers to carry out the duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Dillon as regards those who should be eligible for appointment as sheriffs.  If there are any persons of the type mentioned, there should not be any question about appointing them.  If there happens to be in the office of the sheriff some experienced clerk, it would be a pity not to give the appointment to him, because he might be much better at the work than a solicitor with only a few years experience.  We are taking power to do that, if necessary.  I should not be prepared to deprive the Government of that power and to change the Bill in that respect. As regards the phrase &ldquo;will and pleasure&rdquo;, that is common form. In the Court Officers Act, 1926, it is set out that the county registrar &ldquo;holds office at the pleasure of the Executive Council.&rdquo;  The Minister must have control.  He will not interfere unnecessarily but, if the officer is not doing his duty, there must be some way either of compelling him to do it or of getting rid of him.  I do not <Col N="992" /> think that anybody will deny the necessity for that power.  We hope that it will not be necessary to use it. The intention is that the office of sheriff will be part-time.  The occupant of the office will be paid partly from remuneration provided by the Government and partly by fees.  The salary has not yet been fixed.  A solicitor who gets the appointment can carry on his ordinary work in addition to the work of sheriff.</P>
    <P>As regards pensions for the clerks, that question is under consideration and we are doing all we can in the matter.  I was unable to get a solution of the question in time for this Bill.  I do not know whether or not it will be necessary to introduce legislation to provide pensions for persons who were not previously pensionable.  However, consideration of the matter is being expedited and I hope we shall be able to do something for the persons concerned. We have, of course, to get the consent of the Minister for Finance.  He has to be very careful in these matters because, if he concedes a particular type of demand, all sorts of demands from persons in similar positions may follow.  The question was not settled in time for this Bill, which is more or less urgent, but I am doing all I can in the matter.  Deputy Dillon suggested that we should amalgamate adjoining court areas where there are part-time court clerks.  That is being done wherever practicable so as to permit of a worth-while salary being paid to those officers.  In a number of cases recently, that has been done but it is not always practicable.  As Deputy Dillon pointed out, many of those clerks do other work and it is merely part-time employment.</P>
    <P>As regards the fees of summons servers, if we were to raise the fees, it might create trouble from another angle.  I shall have that question inquired into, but I do not think that very much hardship is involved.  Most of the points raised are points which could be better dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>Before referring to the programme of works proposed for the current financial year I shall give a brief review of the work done in the year ended 31st March last.  The amount provided by the Oireachtas for employment and emergency schemes in the financial year 1944-45 was £1,250,000, of which £1,201,076 was expended within the financial year.  To this expenditure should be added the contributions by local authorities amounting to £178,940, making a gross expenditure of £1,380,016.  Subject to possible amendments in detail, the expenditure on the various sub-heads was as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Of the expenditure of £1,380,016, approximately, £386,000 was expended during the period 1st April to 30th September, and the balance of £994,016 during the winter months.</P>
    <P>The maximum number of workmen employed at any one time during the year was: farm improvement schemes, 8,628; other schemes, 17,146; making a total of 25,774.  The average number employed on all schemes during the period up to September was 8,255, and from October to March, 17,420.  Of these, approximately 40 per cent. were workmen who would otherwise have been entitled to unemployment assistance; but if the figures for farm improvement, bog development and rural improvements schemes, on which the numbers of unemployment assistance recipients engaged are relatively low, be excluded, the proportion of workmen who would have been entitled to unemployment assistance if not engaged on employment schemes was approximately 84 per cent.  The average period of employment given to individual workmen varies with the class of work, and in the different areas, but the total amount of employment afforded in 1944-45, apart from the farm improvements scheme, which is of a different order, is equivalent to 29,000 men each receiving part-time employment for four or five days per week, for an average period of 12 weeks.</P>
    <P>The total number of applications received for minor employment schemes during the year was 3,799 and about 5,800 proposals were investigated and reported on, including proposals already partially carried out.  During the spring and summer, approximately 600 minor drainage schemes were carried out at a cost of £36,500, principally for the development of bogs used by landholders for the supply of their domestic requirements of turf.</P>
    <P>The total number of effective rural improvements scheme applications received up to 31st March, 1945, was 2,841, of which 2,248 had at that date been investigated on the ground by inspectors <Col N="995" /> and reported on.  Of these, 234 were for various reasons found to be unsuitable, and offers of grants were issued in 1,497 cases.  The number of such offers accepted in the course of the year was 726, for which grants totalling £88,470 were sanctioned towards a total estimated expenditure of £114,607, the balance of £26,137 being contributed by the applicants. Allowing for difficulties such as the shortage of labour due to the pressure of turf production and farm work, good progress was made during the year in carrying out the works.  By the end of the year under review a total of 297 schemes had been completed, representing an expenditure of £40,000, while a further 257 schemes having a total value of £47,000 were in hands.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the rural improvements scheme was only begun in the previous financial year.  It is supplementary to the farm improvements scheme, and enables groups of farmers to carry out various kinds of works for their joint benefit, principally small drainage works, and the construction and repair of accommodation roads to houses, lands and turbary. The usual rate of a contribution by the landholders is 25 per cent., but this may be reduced in special cases where the work, in addition to being of benefit to the landholders immediately concerned, also serves members of the outside public.  It is rather early to make predictions, but it may be expected that as the scheme progresses and becomes better known, increasing numbers of landholders will be anxious to avail themselves of its benefits.</P>
    <P>With regard to savings and excesses on the Vote, it will be observed that there was an under-expenditure of approximately £49,000 on the Vote in the last financial year.  In explanation of this I should state that the employment schemes programme consists each year of 3,000 or 4,000 separate works, administered by several agent departments, and carried out by local authorities all over the country; and that, in addition, the works in the rural areas must, for the greater part, be carried out within the space of the winter months; in these circumstances it is virtually impossible to achieve the <Col N="996" /> expenditure of the exact amount voted for employment schemes.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, as the actual schemes on which the year's programme is based are not lodged until after the beginning of the financial year, it is generally impossible to make a close estimate beforehand of the amount required for each sub-head of the Vote. A considerable degree of latitude is therefore required in adjusting the amounts between the sub-heads, as the year progresses.  I should also point out that in a Vote designed to cover emergency services it is necessary to keep in reserve until a late stage of the financial year a certain proportion of the moneys available, in order to provide against contingencies.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the programme for the current financial year, 1945-46, it will be observed that the provision in the Vote for employment and emergency schemes remains the same, at one and a quarter million pounds.  In this regard I should mention that the allocation of the moneys provided in the Vote for the relief of unemployment amongst the various urban and rural units of area is broadly in proportion to the number of unemployment assistance recipients in each such area, and the programme for each financial year is based on a census of unemployment assistance recipients, including former recipients working on employment schemes, taken in the beginning of each year, usually in January or February, at a time when unemployment is generally at a maximum. The total number of men returned in the census taken in January last was just under 60,000 and showed practically no change on the previous year's figures.  The figure for the census taken in February, 1940, before there was any significant movement of workmen to Great Britain, was about 111,500, compared with which this year's figure shows a reduction of roughly 46 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that of the sum of £1,250,000 provided in 1945-46 Vote £692,000 will be spent on the continuation of schemes sanctioned before the 31st March, 1945, leaving a balance of £558,000 available for expenditure on miscellaneous new schemes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="997" /> To the amount of the Vote must be added contributions from local authorities and beneficiaries under the rural improvements scheme, estimated at £197,500.  This gives a total sum of £1,447,500 available for expenditure within the financial year 1945-46; and to enable this expenditure to be achieved as far as possible within the time limit, it is proposed to authorise schemes to the extent of £710,000 (State Grant) in excess of the amount of the Vote.  This sum, together with a proportionate amount for local contributions, will be carried forward at the 31st March, 1946, to form part of the ensuing year's programme.  In this regard it is desirable to remind the Dáil that a large portion of each year's Vote is allocated to local authorities and the expenditure of the full amount of the provision depends largely on the acceptance of the grants on the terms offered, and on the prompt submission of schemes by local authorities.</P>
    <P>Subject to the foregoing remarks the proposed allocation of State grants for each class of work in the current year's programme is as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <Col N="998" /> Administration expenses are expected to amount to £47,329, leaving a balance of £27,671 for miscellaneous schemes of an emergency character or for the relief of unemployment or distress.</P>
    <P>The figures I have just given make up the full amount of the Vote, i.e., £1,250,000, and, as previously stated, a further sum of £197,500 is expected to be forthcoming in the form of local contributions towards the cost of certain types of schemes, making a grand total of £1,447,500 available for expenditure in the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>If we have any quarrel with the amount provided in this Estimate, it is that it is not sufficient. So far as schemes which are covered by the Vote are concerned, I think Deputies will agree that they are very useful and very necessary schemes and that they do far more than merely providing a certain amount of employment for those who are unemployed. That is, of course, particularly true of the scheme known as the farm improvements scheme.  I want to say that my sole objection in regard to that scheme is that there is not sufficient money provided to enable those who are anxious to take advantage of it to carry out very necessary works on their farms.  Farmers at present are anxious to improve their holdings to the fullest extent.  They have, perhaps, at the moment more money at their disposal to supplement the State grant than they had in the past and, perhaps, more than they are likely to have in the future.  For that reason, I should like to see the farm improvements scheme expanded as much as possible. I think any money provided by this House for that purpose is money well spent, money which will be repaid many times over.  We know that in many cases, as a result of the work carried out under this scheme, there are lands growing food to-day which, prior to the introduction of this scheme, were simply more or less waste.  I would urge on the Parliamentary Secretary to make whatever representations he can to the Minister for Finance to provide the maximum <Col N="999" /> amount of money that can be provided for this very useful scheme.</P>
      <P>From the employment point of view, there is no improvement in the expenditure of money.  So far as I am concerned, I always have been, and still am, absolutely opposed to rotation work.  I think it is a great drawback to the expenditure of any money we provide for the relief of unemployment over a period that men are allowed to work for only four or five days in the week.  I, personally, would prefer if a smaller number of men were employed on those schemes so that those who did get employment would get a full week's work.  We know that the amount of wages paid to men even for a full week's work on those schemes is insufficient to provide the necessaries of life for a family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is something almost degrading in men being taken on for four days and then laid off.  There is something wanting in our provision when the Parliamentary Secretary tells us that the average period of employment secured under those schemes by each unemployed person, even when that work was limited to four or five days a week, was only 12 weeks in the year.  That is something which ought to give the Departments concerned cause for a certain amount of worry and reason to ask themselves whether more could not be done.  I know that we have been told year after year in this House, even before the emergency started, that there was no difficulty in finding money, that the difficulty in this country was to find work on which money could be usefully spent.  Every member of the House, particularly members living in rural areas, is aware that there is not a mile of road one travels in any part of the country where one will not find work which could be done, which would give useful employment and useful results from the point of view of the country.  I want to give full credit to this particular Department for the amount of very valuable and very useful work that has been done since these schemes were started. It has given a good return to the country. I know, and other Deputies from <Col N="1000" /> the county know even better than I do, that in Tipperary bad roads and boreens leading into farm houses have been improved under these schemes, with the result that it has been possible for threshing sets, reapers and binders to be taken to farms where six or seven years ago it would not have been possible.  We know how useful that has been, particularly in the last three or four years.  But there is something that gives us cause for reflection.</P>
    <P>One of the great troubles in this connection is that once roads are made either to bogs or farms, everyone washes his hands completely of any responsibility in regard to their maintenance. Roads which were made by the Land Commission and roads which were made under these improvement schemes within the last ten years are to-day, in many cases, in an infinitely worse condition than they were before the improvements were carried out. That aspect of the matter will have to be taken up by whatever Department is responsible.  The maintenance of Land Commission roads and roads which were made or improved under this Estimate must be attended to because there is very little use in spending money in making a road for which the local authority has no responsibility of maintenance.  Once they are made, they are left there and eventually become worse than they were in the beginning.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to hear the Parliamentary Secretary tell us that it is not thought necessary to make any greater provision for the present financial year than was made for the last financial year.  With 60,000 unemployed, with the prospect of more unemployed as a result of demobilisation of the Army and, I am afraid, the inevitable return of some of our people from Great Britain, I think this provision will be found to be totally inadequate.  I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to take the necessary steps to ensure that no scheme which, in the opinion of the Department, is in itself a useful scheme will be turned down merely for the want of money, that no man will be left unemployed in a district merely because the necessary <Col N="1001" /> money is not forthcoming to do useful work.  I do not think that any Party in this House would refuse to give to the Parliamentary Secretary money to carry on the work of this particular Department, because it is, in the main, work of a useful nature, it is, to some extent, work of a reproductive nature.</P>
    <P>There were two figures given by the Parliamentary Secretary which surprised me&mdash;for public health, in urban areas, £20,000&mdash;that seems to be a very small sum&mdash;and for the development of sites in urban areas&mdash;£20,000.  If we are at all serious in our talk about the immense housing schemes we are going to undertake immediately we are in a position to do so, that seems to be merely a token sum.</P>
    <P>While we may not be ready, because we have not the necessary materials, to start erecting houses, undoubtedly we could be going a long way in the provision and development of the sites so that they would be ready immediately the necessary building materials are available.  I must confess that I am disappointed that the amount provided for this particular part of the work is so small.  However, on the whole, I agree that the work performed here is useful and necessary work.  My greatest complaint is in regard to the retention and continuance of the rotational work.  It is about time that was dropped and about time that in this country, that we talk so much about, we should be able to provide at least six days' work in the week for a man who is able and willing to work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a particularly important Estimate this year in view of the likelihood or, shall I say, the danger that unemployment may increase to a serious extent during the coming year.  One would expect that the Parliamentary Secretary, in introducing the Estimate, would have made some reference to the plans he has in view in the Department for expanding relief work and employment work so as to absorb those who will be demobilised from the Army and the considerable number of men who will return from Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  It seems to me that the two branches of his Department in which expansion will first be necessary are <Col N="1002" /> those covered by the Vote for Urban Employment Schemes and the Vote for Rural Employment Schemes.  It is essential that very substantial grants should be made to local authorities to enable them to carry out big development schemes.  Urban employment schemes would cover a very wide field. As Deputy Morrissey has pointed out, the development of sites for the preparation of building schemes should be carried out and, if we have a large number of unemployed in urban areas, it would be necessary and desirable to carry out improvements in the appearance of provincial towns and villages by the demolition of old and unsightly buildings.  This would give the urban areas, particularly towns and villages, a more attractive appearance.</P>
      <P>That is work which could be carried out by unskilled workers and it is work that is required urgently to be done.  As far as rural employment schemes are concerned, I understand they include grants to the county councils for the improvement of roads.  In that connection, there is an almost unlimited field for employment and for the type of employment which would absorb unskilled labour.  We must remember that men who have been in the Army for four, five or six years cannot be regarded as highly-skilled workers now, and ample provision should be made to give them suitable employment.  Financial provision is being made for them, but that will be of very little avail unless they are given immediate employment as soon as possible after leaving the Army.  The same applies to men coming back from abroad.  There is an additional sum of £20,000 provided for rural employment schemes, but I think it will hardly be sufficient to meet the expected needs during the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the good work which has been done under the farms improvement scheme, there is always a danger that some of that work may not be permanent.  Here I am referring to the construction or reconstruction of farm boundaries and fences.  I know it is a difficult problem, but something should be done to provide suitable quicks for those fences.  Otherwise, <Col N="1003" /> they will crumble away in a very short time.  The Parliamentary Secretary may observe that some of the work done in the past three or four years is already showing signs of breaking down.  It is a pity that arrangements should not be made to provide proper fences, with a view to making them permanent.  They would also improve the appearance of our rural areas. Proper white-thorn hedges always look attractive.  They are not only useful as fences but they also provide a certain amount of firewood.</P>
    <P>Another very useful branch of farm improvement work which ought to be very much extended is the removal of rocks and stones from land which is under cultivation.  It is almost inevitable that in the future we will turn very much more to mechanisation in regard to farm operations; so it is necessary that, as far as possible, all stones and other obstacles should be removed from the land.  As far as that particular item is concerned, I am not sure whether it is entirely in the hands of the Parliamentary Secretary; it appears to be also under the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>With regard to rural improvement schemes, that particular branch of this Department has given very good satisfaction. But, unfortunately, there have been a great many disappointments, too: disappointments in the first place because of the difficulty of getting all the people concerned to share in the work and to share in the contribution.  Many applications which appeared to be very promising have had to be turned down because all parties were not willing to contribute. Another difficulty arises from the difference of opinion which almost invariably exists between applicants and the officers of the Department in regard to the cost of the work. Usually the farmers' estimate of the cost of the work is much lower than what the experts calculate.  I have been asked by some farmers to suggest that the officials of the Department should seek to make the work less expensive, that is, not to try to do as permanent a job as they would wish, but I am personally of the opinion that <Col N="1004" /> that would hardly be desirable.  When an improvement work is carried out on a laneway or roadway, it is desirable that it should be done as well as possible, and made as permanent as possible.  For that reason, I think the inspectors of the Department are usually right.  However, the fact that the cost appears to be too high does frequently deter farmers from availing of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Sooner or later, I think provision will have to be made for the maintenance of works carried out, whether under minor improvement schemes or rural improvement schemes.  There is no doubt whatever that many of the roadways made during the past few years have deteriorated, and where a number of ratepayers are using a roadway I think the maintenance should be made a county charge.  It is sheer waste of public money to widen and improve a roadway, and then find that in the course of a couple of years it has deteriorated to such an extent that it is worse than before it was originally improved.  In many cases where a roadway is improved and made wider, and where a considerable amount of material, perhaps of an inferior quality, has been utilised for levelling it up, it is inevitable that the roadway will eventually become worse than it was before it was improved and levelled.</P>
    <P>On every Estimate of this kind, the question of employment on the rotational system is raised.  In view of the changed situation, in view of the fact that there may be a considerable number of people coming on the employment register, temporarily at any rate, after the war, and that those people are not what might be called chronic unemployed&mdash;they are people who have not been in the habit of being casual workers or of being frequently out of work&mdash;I think they should not be humiliated or degraded by getting only part-time work.  Take, for example, men coming out of the Army; I think they should be treated exactly the same as, say, permanent road workers, and should be given a full week's work.  Apart from the hardship of having only a small income for the week, there is also a certain <Col N="1005" /> amount of a slur or degradation to those men in having to work part-time. It looks as if there is something in the nature of charity, or as if they are simply getting relief, instead of being allowed to feel that they are full-time employees of this State.</P>
    <P>Whatever can be done in this matter should be done immediately, because it is highly undesirable that men who have been in the Army, for example, or men who have been engaged in work across the water should be allowed to suffer under a grievance.  We do not want any widespread discontent amongst that type of workers, and I think that the plea which has been made from all parts of the House for the termination of rotational employment should be met now.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I want to deal with the development of bogs.  Now that the emergency is possibly drawing to a close, it might be considered that development work should be wound up so far as bogs are concerned.  I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary will take that view, and I do not think that he should be led by any Deputies to take that view.  Our bog areas were neglected for many years.  Our turbary areas were allowed to become waterlogged and the accommodation roads leading to them were allowed to deteriorate over a long period.  People in those areas were left to feel that they were of no importance whatever to the State; that they had very little hope for the future.  I think the emergency has shown that those people are useful and that the industry in which they are engaged is a very important one.  Whatever may happen in the future, I think there will be a permanent need for considerable development of turbary.</P>
    <P>In this connection, it must be remembered also that, in spite of the fact that a considerable amount of money was expended upon accommodation roads leading to bogs, the heavy traffic upon those roads deteriorated them and reduced their condition to such an extent as to offset the expenditure.  Thus we have still quite a number of roads leading to turbary in a very bad condition.  Further work should be done in developing <Col N="1006" /> these roads and putting them into a proper condition, because there is a future for turf in this connection, at any rate, that did not exist, say, 12 or 15 years ago, now that the development of motor lorry traffic enables turf to be conveyed a longer distance than heretofore. Thus a turf bog would be able to serve a much larger area in future than it did perhaps 10, 12 or 15 years ago.  For that reason, it is essential that we should have good roads leading to our turbary areas so that the produce of our turf workers may be able to be collected and distributed.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of drainage, which has only been tackled in a comparatively small way up to the present.  Bogs must be properly drained if we are to get the best results from them and if the workers engaged in them are to give a decent return for their work.  It is along these lines that employment will be found in our rural areas for the people coming out of the Army and coming back from other countries, as well as for the naturally increasing population of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>While there are, in connection with some Votes here, possibilities of reducing expenditure, I believe that in this particular case the House should agree to a considerable expansion of expenditure.  We should be far more ambitious in connection with schemes of this sort.  It is only by getting people into productive work that any nation can hope to achieve success, and I think that the types of schemes we have in this Vote are very useful.  If most of them do not lead to direct production, at least they certainly lead to indirect production.  In the matter of development schemes for housing, it is absolutely essential that all possible preparation should be made, because we are very much in arrear.  A great many houses are required, not merely in urban, but in rural areas as well, and a good deal of preparatory work can be done in that direction now.  The provisions here are scarcely adequate for that type of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as rural schemes are concerned, I think the farms improvement <Col N="1007" /> scheme and the rural improvements scheme are providing very useful and what will prove to be productive employment. But they are merely touching the fringe of the problem, and ought to be organised in a different way altogether.  So far as the farm improvements scheme is concerned, one big problem that we have in farm improvement is drainage.  We all realise that, so far as improvement work of that sort is concerned, and in fact in many other directions as well, our people&mdash;and it is not peculiar to our people&mdash;are expecting more and more State intervention.  Work of this sort is not carried out at all except where you have State intervention.  We have not achieved very much so far as field drainage is concerned.  I think we will be a very long time solving this problem of field drainage if we proceed by the methods we have adopted.</P>
    <P>The object is absolutely sound, but I think that we will have to adopt much more modern methods.  So far as schemes of this sort are concerned, we look at them mainly from the point of view of solving the unemployment problem.  That is not a proper approach.  While the unemployment problem cannot be overlooked, our object should be to expand our productive capacity, because that will eventually solve the other problem.  The adoption of the most modern methods for the expansion of production is, I think, the right approach.  Sometimes, schemes are possibly too costly from an economic point of view.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary, being in charge of the Board of Works, very much appreciates not only the problem of arterial drainage but the necessity of field drainage as well, if the arterial drainage is to be a success.  During this war, Great Britain claims to have reclaimed 10,000,000 acres of land. When you compare our little efforts here with the success which they have achieved in that direction and the huge amount of land they have brought into production as a result of that work, you see that we are merely touching the fringe of the problem.  We have great potential wealth there, awaiting development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1008" /> Some of the land which was at one time in production has deteriorated through neglect&mdash;through direct neglect in some cases and indirect neglect in other cases as a result of the neglect of arterial drainage.  A lot of the work done in Great Britain has been done by modern methods, by mechanisation, especially for the opening and closing of drains.  If we are to solve this big problem, we must have not only the direct State intervention that we have here at present but we must intensify it and modernise our methods.  The methods we are adopting at present make the final cost almost prohibitive.</P>
    <P>In preparing schemes for the post-war period, we must secure employment for more and more people.  It must be remembered that the use of more modern methods in drainage need not necessarily mean a reduction in the number of men engaged in the work.  We will need to use more men as well and that will help to solve the problem of unemployment.  We can increase very substantially the amount of work that can be done by the use of modern methods.</P>
    <P>As has already been said by other Deputies, it is time now to consider our programme for the immediate post-war years, to find employment for men discharged from the Army and for people who may return from Great Britain.  There are other schemes that could be expanded in every direction. The farm improvements scheme is something which we have not tackled intensively.  We have a lot of hill land covered with scrub and producing no national wealth.  It is a potential source of production, if it is reclaimed, and we should have a hill scheme of some sort.  There has been great success in that direction in Wales, under the pioneer there, Sir George Stapleton, who put up an experimental station and succeeded in providing excellent vegetation on hills which were barren and worthless from the national point of view.  We have the same problem here and there is no reason on earth why we could not achieve what they have achieved and bring that potential source of wealth into active production.  I imagine that there must be a very considerable acreage in that condition here and <Col N="1009" /> there is no reason why we should not deal with it.</P>
    <P>We have heard it mentioned by the Minister for Finance, by the Minister for Agriculture in the Vote recently, and by the Minister for Supplies in discussions on more than one occasion, that we may have an exchange problem and the only way we can satisfactorily import our necessary requirements is by an expansion of our export trade.</P>
    <P>I am merely drawing the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to two aspects of our rural economy that have been neglected to a great extent and that can only be tackled under a farm improvements scheme of this sort. The question should be thoroughly examined and would prove a great national asset if tackled in a constructive way.  The neglect of many years has accumulated, but the potential wealth lies there and can be brought back if we tackle the problem as other countries have tackled it.</P>
    <P>The rural improvements scheme is also very advantageous to the agricultural community.  In our circumstances, we have people living in very remote districts away from main roads and the means of approach to their homesteads is in a shocking condition, in many cases.  Apart from the type of transport they may have of their own, those people find that the modern lorries cannot approach their homesteads at all.  Some improvements should be effected in that respect and a further extension of the scheme would be of great benefit to the community. Of course, a rural improvements scheme cannot be applied to a single individual.  It is really in its infant stage yet, as it has been only a year or so in operation, so I suppose we may hope for further development. I feel it will prove a hardship on individuals who happen to live in isolation and have no neighbours nearby.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>No, as in that case he would get 50 per cent.  As a farm improvements scheme, he could do it if it only concerned himself.  Would you not have overlapping if you had not the stipulation of there being two or more persons concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, he has a definite advantage if he has two or three neighbours living in the one lane. I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that there would be some overlapping. It really costs him a lot more, as if the lane or road is to be improved, the whole burden falls on himself.  If it comes under the farm improvements scheme it costs him 50 per cent. of the labour cost.  In the other case, the 25 per cent. is divided between the two, three or more neighbours, as the case may be.  Deputy Morrissey has mentioned the maintenance of work of that sort.  Where roads are made by the Land Commission, in improvements of this sort, under the farm improvements scheme and the rural improvements scheme, especially where a group of people live on the road, there is divided responsibility and there is always neglect.  It is a problem which should get some attention, as it would look as if it is waste of money to develop it and provide a decent roadway, if the local residents neglect the maintenance.  If a decent job is made of it, some attempt should be made to make it a responsibility on the local authority.  Subject to the width of the road or lane, where there is any sort of a decent carriage way, it should be finished properly, steam-rolled and given a decent surface.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rotational work has been mentioned and is always adverted to on this Vote. I suppose that in certain circumstances rotational work can be defended. In the West of Ireland, for instance, where there are small holdings, and where a man is engaged on work of this sort and has a certain amount of work to do at home, you could defend it.  He does not mind if he is laid-off for a day or two in the week.  He can devote those days to ensuring that his own farm work will not get into arrears.  As regards the ordinary <Col N="1011" /> legitimate worker, I think it is a great hardship on him.  It is unfair to him and to his family to be put on rotational work and to be laid-off two days a week.  If it is suitable in certain areas to have rotational schemes&mdash;that might apply in the West of Ireland&mdash; we should not overlook the fact that in the eastern counties it would not apply so well.  The vast majority of the men in the eastern counties have to rely solely on their work to maintain themselves and their families.  The Department should operate the rotational idea where it suits people, but where it is not suitable, where workers have to rely purely on this employment, the rotational scheme means a great hardship, and some effort should be made to get away from the rotational idea in the areas where it does not suit the workers.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that expenditure under this heading could be expanded to a very considerable extent.  There is any amount of work in the way of improvement to be done all over the country, and some of it is an essential prerequisite to an expanding system of agriculture.  We cannot hope to get it done without State intervention.  That is the tendency, not merely here but all over the world, and we look forward to much more elaborate schemes to deal with problems that are tackled here only in an initial way.</P>
    <P>At this stage, facing a difficult post-war period, when there may be very serious difficulties so far as employment is concerned, and very great difficulties in securing raw material necessary for construction and other work, we have here a source of very profitable employment.  We have here a source of employment that will be productive and a decided national asset.  I hope we will see a considerable development of schemes of this sort.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary and his Department are to be congratulated on what they have done for the improvement of towns and rural areas, with much advantage to the community. I should like to point out the great necessity that exists for clearing derelict sites in towns and cities in preparation for the building schemes that are to come.  I join with Deputy Morrissey in asking for an extension of rotational schemes, so as to give employment in the urban areas. In many of our towns where there are local authorities, and in many villages where there are no local authorities, very little attention is paid to those schemes, and we all know the lack of amenities and sanitary conveniences that are a blot in some of our cities and towns.  We must wait, of course, for the materials that we now have not got in order to go ahead with those schemes in full blast, so to speak, but the time has come when preparations must be made.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the initiative in that respect must come, in a great measure, from the local authorities.  I think, since the appointment of city and county managers, that public representatives do not take sufficient interest in initiating schemes which would be of advantage to the communities they represent.  These things are left more to the managers, and that is not right.  The initiative should come locally.  At the same time, there is no doubt that local inspiration and incentive should get some assistance from the Department in the sense of taking an interest in the schemes and co-operating in the carrying out of them.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary is most anxious and willing to do anything in reason and I am sure that his help in matters of this kind will be appreciated.  I hope in the near future that more progress will be made in providing work for the unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1013" /> As regards rotational schemes, we know that those who draw the highest rate of unemployment benefit get preference, and rightly so, but this virtually excludes many deserving applicants.  We can see around us many openings for an extension of the schemes which the Department has initiated and of which the local authorities should avail more fully. The work that is being done in rural areas is greatly appreciated. The reclamation of land and similar schemes would more properly, I presume, come under the operations of the Drainage Act, but there are other schemes that could be proceeded with.  It is to be hoped that the rural community will take a greater interest in these schemes which, unquestionably, will have a good effect in improving not only rural dwellings for the farmers and by-roads, which are in a very bad way, but the amenities of our towns and villages to the general advantage of the community and will take from us many of the reproaches which are sometimes levelled at our day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I was surprised by the claim put forward by Deputy Hughes that the State should make itself fully responsible for the cost of field drainage.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>When one takes into consideration the fact that field drainage is an improvement of a holding, and that out of the improvement the occupier expects to get a benefit for himself and his family, and in view of the fact that it should be not alone the ambition but the constant endeavour of every occupier of land to improve his holding, the State, in my opinion, is generous when it contributes 50 per cent. of the estimated cost, together with the other contribution which it makes to agriculture in the having of the annuities.  Field drainage is something which ordinary farmers should be interested in, and the State is doing well by a farmer in contributing 50 per cent. of the estimated cost of field drainage on any farm on which it is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1014" /> So far as the drainage of hill land is concerned, I do not think the problem in England and Wales is the same as that which exists in this country.  There are no people living on hill land in England and Wales.  They left it years ago, but in this country many of our people reside, for historical reasons, on hill land.  In my opinion, people are living on land here on which they should not be living at all.  It would appear to be better for the State and for the people themselves to utilise fully our more fertile soils, because it is a well-known fact that full use is not being made of our fertile soils, or even of our grass lands.  When the Office of Public Works decides to tackle the problem of our hill land, I hope they will take into consideration the argument put forward by certain people that our hill lands are admirably suited to forestry.</P>
    <P>I want to pay a tribute to the Office of Public Works for the type of work they do.  There is no doubt that it is one Department which makes sure that the money spent is well spent and that the work done is well done.  I want to pay a tribute to them also for the expeditious manner in which they arrange for the sanctioning of grants to urban and county councils and carry out all the other types of administrative work necessary in order to have money made available to local authorities.</P>
    <P>With regard to the rural improvement schemes, it is unfortunate that we have not got more co-operation from the people who should avail of these schemes.  It is unfortunate that the State has to take to itself powers to enter on land in order to make improvements in rural districts.  It is an undeniable fact that, in a great many cases, when a form comes from the Office of Public Works for the signatures of local people and for the making of their contribution of 25 per cent. of the estimated cost, one or two people will not sign, that they wait until this House gives legislative power to the Office of Public Works to do the job and then collect the local contribution. It would be far better for the Office of Public Works, for the people and for the improvement of our <Col N="1015" /> rural areas if we had that co-operation from the people which is absolutely necessary and which will be more necessary in the future.</P>
    <P>In connection with rural improvement schemes, it would be advisable if the Office of Public Works could induce county surveyors to give the use of their steam-rollers wherever a roadway is being laid down.  In County Meath, the county surveyor and county staffs have done first-class jobs on small roadways by finishing off the jobs properly with their steam-rollers.  They have done jobs which will last for a long number of years, whereas, if the steam-roller had not been used, the work would deteriorate very rapidly and it would become necessary to do the job again in a short space of time.</P>
    <P>I thought the Parliamentary Secretary in introducing the Estimate would have given the House some idea as to the progress made in implementing the Arterial Drainage Act, and I hope that in closing the debate he will tell us how far he has got in that respect.  I should also like him to say whether, if labour comes on the market to the extent to which certain people think it will come in the near future&mdash;I do not share that view myself&mdash;it is the intention to implement the provisions of the Arterial Drainage Act so as to absorb a certain number of them.  I again express my appreciation of the type of work carried out by the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <P>The points made in the course of the discussion have been very few and, to the extent to which any criticism was levelled at us, I must confess that it was very mild.  The principal matter to which reference has again been made by most of those who spoke was this vexed question of rotational employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said last year, that has been discussed on this Vote all down the years.  There are many views that can be advanced both for and against, but taking one's mind back to the introduction of the Unemployment Assistance Act, and the developments that followed the passing of that law, I, at least, could always see the justification there was for an endeavour by the State to secure that those who were being provided for through the operation of the Unemployment Assistance Act should be called upon to give some return to the taxpayer in general in the provision of amenity schemes that would prove of value to the community, while at the same time making some extra provision for them over and above the amount to which they were entitled under that Act.  I have given a good deal of attention to this particular matter since I went to the office of Public Works.  I am prepared now to admit, as was said by Deputy Hughes, that this is a problem that can be viewed from different aspects in different areas.  When you examine the register of people entitled to benefit under the Unemployment Assistance Act you find that quite a number of them reside in rural areas. You find that quite a number of them are owners of small farms of land; you find another section composed of labourers pure and simple, and, in addition, you have the town workers. I would be prepared now to agree that every one of these sections presents a different problem.  While it is quite reasonable and, in fact, just and equitable to expect that the man who is the owner of some land can always find some work to do on it, the position is that while employment on three, four or five days, as the case might be, might be all right in his case, it might impose certain hardships on some of <Col N="1017" /> the other sections of people appearing on the register.  All I can say is that we have that matter continually under review.  To those who advocate a departure from this system of employment I would ask them to think of the other side of the argument.  After all, if a man is unemployed, and if the State decides to make certain provision for him while he is so unemployed, there is an obligation on him to seek work and to look for work.</P>

      <P>I throw out the suggestion that if you were to accept the argument that the State is to be responsible for the provision of full-time employment at the prevailing rates in the area in which the man is offered that employment, well, to my mind, to the extent that you make that offer to him, to that extent in certain cases, you relieve that man of the obligation to seek work, and you relieve him of the obligation to move about, as most people must move about, to try to fend for themselves.  I am inviting members of the Dáil who have been advocating the abandonment of the rotational system of employment to remember that there is that aspect of this problem that must be kept in mind.  Having said that much, I can only repeat again that, as far as my office is concerned, we have been keeping an eye on the effects of the rotational system, and, while, as I have said, I am prepared to admit that in certain cases it is possible to draw attention to certain hardships that may arise as a result of the operation of the system, it is also wise to remember that there are other sides to that problem.</P>

      <P>A few points were raised in connection with the bog development schemes and the advisability of providing money for the removal of derelict buildings and those roofless houses that one often sees in small villages and towns through the country. As well as I remember, the Dáil some years ago passed an Act giving to local authorities the power to remove such buildings.  As far as we are concerned, we have, through the Department of Local Government and Public Health, been inviting local authorities to submit to us schemes for the execution of that sort of work.</P>
      <P>In the case of bog development schemes we have not been ungenerous. There is no question of the Minister for Finance closing down, as it were, on the amount of money made available for this type of work.  We have certain standards to which we adhere.  They are generous, and it all depends on the area with which we are dealing and the amount of turbary in that area.  I think that the limited amount of criticism that is being offered on that head is indicative of the generosity that has been displayed by us in making provision for work of that kind.  The Estimate has been increased from £70,000 to £100,000.  The same thing applies in the case of rural improvement schemes. Although the sum of £90,000 is mentioned in the Vote, we have not in the past, and neither has the Minister for Finance, tied himself down in any way. It all depends on the number of applications received, on the number of groups of farmers who are prepared to come forward and make their contribution to enable us to spend money in making proper access to their dwellings, and in relieving them, in certain cases, of flood water.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the procedure of previous years, it is proposed to take Votes Nos. 9, 10 and 11 together.  Vote No. 9 bears the salaries and expenses of the administrative and technical staffs of the Office of Public Works, which is the Office responsible for the administration of Votes Nos. 10 and 11.  Vote No. 10 provides the necessary funds for the purchase of sites and buildings, for the erection, maintenance and furnishing of Government offices and other State-owned premises throughout the country, for the construction and improvement of national schools, for the erection of major military buildings, for arterial drainage, for the maintenance of parks and State harbours, and for a number of minor activities.  Vote No. 11 is a small Vote providing for the expenses of the management of Haulbowline Island in so far as the island remains in civilian control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Vote No. 9 there is an increase of £19,130 in the Estimate due mainly to the payment of cost-of-living bonus at an increased figure and to additional staff for drainage work which will result in higher expenditure on salaries and on travelling and subsistence. <Col N="1020" /> A slight decrease in receipts is expected.  Of the officers whose salaries are borne on this Vote, 20 are on loan to other Offices.  Vote No. 10 for Public Works and Buildings&mdash;at £834,441 shows a decrease of £29,464 on last year's Estimate.  Sub-head B&mdash; New Works, Alterations and Additions &mdash;is decreased by £10,000.  We are hesitant to embark on any new projects not definitely urgent in view of the difficulties of the supply position.  As will be seen from the detailed Estimate, we have in mind a number of important building schemes which we have had to defer during the emergency.</P>
    <P>We are again repeating the figure of £250,000 for grants for building and improving national schools.  Our expenditure on this service last year was £227,757, which is £28,754 less than the expenditure in the previous year, 1943-44.  The decrease is explained by the fact that in 1943-44 expenditure on certain large schools in the newly-developed Dublin City areas was heavier.  We are making every effort to overcome difficulties of supply and to keep this important service going.  The provision for airports has been transferred to Vote No. 56&mdash; Transport and Meteorological Services &mdash;administered by the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>The new drainage code became law on the 1st March, 1945&mdash;the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  The &ldquo;Appointed Day&rdquo; for the purposes of Part III of the Act has been fixed as at the 31st March, 1945.  We have virtually completed a survey of the River Brosna catchment area and are proceeding with the design and preparation of a drainage scheme for that area.  A survey of the Rivers Glyde and Dee catchment area is in hands.  We are also completing the overhaul of our existing drainage machinery.  Provision for expenditure on actual drainage work is not made in the Estimate.  If we are satisfied later that a start on drainage works will be possible and desirable, provision for the expenditure involved can be made by way of Supplementary Estimate.  There is an increase of £18,000 in the amount provided for maintenance and supplies to meet rising costs of materials and labour.  There are also slight increases <Col N="1021" /> in the amounts put forward for furniture and for fuel, light, etc.  Vote No. 11 for Haulbowline Dockyard is in the usual form and calls for no special comment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The important item to be discussed on this Vote concerns drainage.  I confess that I am disappointed at the very meagre information which the Parliamentary Secretary gave the House on the subject. This is work to which we looked forward to give the greatest relief so far as unskilled labour is concerned.  I should like to know when the Parliamentary Secretary expects work to begin under the national drainage scheme.  When the Drainage Bill was introduced the Parliamentary Secretary was not very optimistic as to the date on which work would actually start, after the Bill was passed.  He certainly frightened some of us when he envisaged drainage work not ending for 28 years.  Considering the size of this country, if it will take about 28 years to complete drainage, one begins to wonder whether we are facing up to this problem in a serious way.  I imagine that that period should be sufficient to complete the drainage of a country half the size of the Continent of America, having regard to all the machinery and appliances at their disposal for such work.  I am afraid as a result of the passing of the Drainage Act that, instead of the drainage problem being cured between the appointed day and the actual completion of the work, the position will be worsened rather than improved. It has to be remembered that field drainage to a large extent depends on work to be carried out under the Act.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary when concluding will be able to give more information as to when employment on this scheme will commence.  When we hear members of the Government, both inside and outside this House, talk about the grandiose post-war schemes which they say are in preparation, or that are ready to relieve the unemployment that is bound to arise towards the end of the emergency, and when there is vagueness as to when work is likely to start, we are inclined <Col N="1022" /> to become very suspicious as to the practicability of any of these schemes. The House and the country are entitled to expect from a Government that have been in office for a long period, and that have been free for the last five years from the major worries of the war, that they would have prepared schemes to absorb the unemployment at once.  As far as I know no such schemes are ready, even the national drainage scheme.  For that reason, I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to give us further information on this matter when he is concluding the debate on this Estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in this difficulty, that, when I hear the Minister for Supplies speaking, I am sometimes led to believe that our principal difficulty will be to get the materials wherewith to put any public works in hand.  Yet, when I hear the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance speaking, I get the impression that his principal difficulty will be to get the technical staff requisite to survey and complete the preliminary work necessary to put Gargantuan schemes in hand. However, as Deputy Morrissey has just pointed out, there seems to be one scheme of almost infinite size for which the minimum of raw materials to be imported from outside is requisite.  That is, a comprehensive drainage scheme.  But if a minimum of raw materials is requisite for that plan, it is equally true to say that a maximum of preliminary-survey and compulsory-acquisition work may be necessary.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary in a position to tell us now that these preliminary steps are being, or have been, taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey dwelt on the question of field drainage and I want to add a word in support of his submission. We are all conscious that certain districts clamour loudly for the completion of the drainage scheme, believing that Utopia will dawn on the morrow of the scheme's completion. Then, disillusionment ensues and the life of the Board of Works is made miserable by persons protesting that the flooding is three times worse than ever it was before.  I believe that that kind of disillusionment is due, in part, <Col N="1023" /> to exaggerated anticipations of what a drainage scheme will do, but it is also due to the fact that people do not realise that, no matter how good a drainage scheme is, it will not work unless the persons holding land in the area direct the water which lodges upon their land into the main drainage. The only way of doing that is to drain their own land.</P>
    <P>I have already directed the attention of this House to the fact that, when King Leopold of the Belgians passed on to his son, the late King Arthur, the absolute ownership of the Belgian colonies in Africa, that enlightened monarch decided that the revenues from this great property should not properly be applied to his privy purse. Therefore, he announced that, with those revenues, he was going to recondition the land of Belgium, irrespective of whose private property that land might be.  The result was that he increased the productive capacity of the land in Belgium out of all knowledge.  In this country we have a strong Department-of-Finance prejudice against the spending of public money on the private property of citizens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>All I want to do is to direct the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the fact that his best effort in regard to arterial drainage will prove ineffective unless he can persuade the people to drain their own land.  I leave out of consideration the provision of grants or material <Col N="1024" /> assistance.  Possibly, those are not the vital requisites of the present situation. Possibly, it is publicity that is required.  I know that some irritable Deputies will say that farmers do not want to be taught their business by Deputy Dillon.  I find from my experience of publicity and propaganda that the most obvious things which every body knows about his neighbour's business, comparatively few people know about their own.  I can see rushes and flaggers in my neighbour's field and I am astonished to see his land deteriorating for want of proper care&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that the Parliamentary Secretary should address himself to wealthy land proprietors, holding adjoining land, who do not want any assistance and who would not be eligible for assistance under the farm improvements scheme, and point out to them that they must, without any assistance or guidance from him, do their part of the work on their own land so as to make the drainage of the area a success. I am not asking for help, supervision or guidance from the Government.  I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary to bring home to the people that he cannot single-handed make a success of the drainage of the area unless the people in the area do their part.  Far from seeking assistance, the thesis which Deputy Coburn has often submitted in this House is peculiarly true in relation to <Col N="1025" /> this matter&mdash;that people have a duty to look after their own land and help to make the drainage scheme successful by doing their duty in their own close and encouraging their neighbours to do the same.</P>
      <P>Now, I touch upon a detail dear to the heart of the Parliamentary Secretary as it is to mine.  I should be glad if he would say whether he intends to put the Dromore drainage scheme on an early priority in the schemes he proposes to put in hands.  If he does, I can assure him that it will bring comfort to the soul of Ballybay Town Council and I have no doubt that the reverberations of joy will be heard in Cootehill and other areas in County Cavan.</P>
      <P>Now, in this connection, I should be interested to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary whether he has given his attention to the work of the Tennessee Valley Authority in America.  It marks a completely new departure in the administration of the kind of job for which the Parliamentary Secretary is primarily responsible. Therefore, the Federal Government of the United States of America have taken a certain territory and they have withdrawn, from a wide range of Federal agencies, all their functions in that peculiar territory and have transferred those functions to a semiautonomous body, closely analogous to our Electricity Supply Board.  The result has been that the Tennessee Valley Authority has been made responsible for industrial development, drainage, rural electrification, land improvement, provision of raw materials to these ends in that particular area.  Now, I confess that my information with regard to the results of that experiment is largely drawn from sources which would be prejudiced in its favour.  I have not seen an exhaustive <i>exposé</i> of the criticisms, but from what I do know of it, it has been an extraordinary success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to bear in mind, however, that the Tennessee Valley is many times the size of our whole country and that the river constituting its backbone passes through territories of widely different characters, which complement one another in a general economy, but in connection with the <Col N="1026" /> Erne, where we propose to have a hydro-electric scheme under the Department of Industry and Commerce and under which, perhaps, we might be undertaking drainage works, under the Board of Works, and in respect of which land schemes may be put in hand under the Department of Agriculture, and in respect of which also industries may be promoted under the Department of Industry and Commerce, the point arises whether all these various matters could not be vested in a body similar to the Tennessee Valley Authority.  That body could say: &ldquo;There is the Erne Valley, which is delineated on this map.  You are going to be charged with the production of power.  Your district will have first claim on the power generated by this river. You can use it for the manufacture of artificial manures, for instance, for distribution at a very low rate in that area.  You can supply current for the promotion of industry within that area. You can, out of the profits derived from your operations, subsidise, if needs be, drainage, or you can relate your drainage schemes to the general purpose of water control which you will require for the efficient use of the river as a generator of hydro-electricity.&rdquo; It is quite possible&mdash;and this is the difficulty that an Opposition Deputy always finds himself in&mdash;that on the examination of such a plan by the Minister's experts, it would become manifest, at a moment's glance, that the scheme was quite impracticable.</P>
    <P>I have not the means at may disposal to pursue the matter fully or get expert advice such as the Minister and his Department would have, but it does seem to me that if an experiment of that kind were made in connection with a limited scheme such as the Erne, if it were found to be practicable and if it prospers, then the Liffey, and other rivers, conceivably, would be susceptible to similar development. Now, it may be held that our departure would be so small individually as to make it ludicrous to compare it to the Tennessee Valley Authority, but if our purpose is to distribute industries through the country rather than to allow the natural trend of concentration in cities to prevail, I consider <Col N="1027" /> that even on quite small rivers the matter of drainage, hydro-electric, and general development along the lines of the Tennessee Valley Authority might prove a very valuable expedient in this country.</P>
    <P>Now, in connection with building, I have a few brief remarks to make. There is plenty of work to be done in regard to building, and I think it is a terrible mistake for us to shy away from undertaking great enterprises in the immediate future because they appear to cost a lot.  This is a time when we should mobilise credit and use it boldly and resolve, if necessary, to repay it over the next 100 years. The extension of credit should not deter us from embarking on bold schemes at the present time, always provided that they are good schemes. As a start in that direction, one good thing would be to build a new Oireachtas, and it would prove to be an economy in the long run.  We are eternally patching and tinkering with these buildings in order to make them adequate to fulfil the functions of an efficient Parliament.  It is common knowledge that half the Deputies cannot find accommodation in which to write a letter.  Even the Ministers' rooms are inadequate and they have not proper facilities.  We are trying to get our meals in a Restaurant which is built on top of the boiler-house and in which no person could sit in the months of August and September. The permanent officials are obliged to sit in cramped quarters up at the top and their teeth are made to chatter with the noise of the machinery in the basement, because we are trying to dislodge a beetle through the medium of a vacuum cleaner in the roof.  I understand that the roof is now infested with beetles and that it shall have to be rebuilt.  Of course, some facetious individuals will possibly say that we ought to transfer all our activities into the museum and there function under the shadow of Taoiseach de Valera's boots, but I am not one of those who believe that democratic institutions are best accommodated in the museum.  I believe that they are dynamic things which should have adequate facilities <Col N="1028" /> in which to work.  Now, that is work which could be planned at once and put in hand as soon as material is available.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I shall refer.  I am told that one of the great difficulties of housing the poor in Dublin is that if you want to pull down the tenement houses you must have some place in which to put the people until such time as proper substitutes can be built for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the concern of Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If you will wait a moment, Sir.  I understand that in that connection the authorities concerned have no open site on which to build, <i>de novo</i>, a block of houses into which they can transfer the inhabitants of a block of rotten tenements while they are pulling them down so that they may be able to put the people into decent places.  I say, with regard to that, why not give the building authorities Mountjoy Jail?  It is a dirty, old, smelly building, and they could pull it down and, say, build their evacuation block on that site. Then they could pull down the rotten tenement blocks, transfer the people to the evacuation block; then, when a new block was erected, they could pull down another rotten block of tenements, transfer the people to the new block, and so on.  In that way, you can go on gradually cleaning up the whole place.  Also, by doing that we will get rid of an antiquated and smelly old jail; we will provide the key of what has appeared to be an insoluble housing problem in the City of Dublin, and we will be able to provide ourselves with an eminently desirable public work, and that is the provision on the outskirts of the city of a decent, modern jail.  By that I do not mean something like a first-class hotel, but a place where criminals and tough people can be kept under proper control and, at the same time, satisfy the Legislature that substantial justice is being done.  I move to report progress.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
