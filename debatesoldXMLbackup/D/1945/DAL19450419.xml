    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if persons in receipt of R.I.C. pensions under the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923, are liable to reductions of their pensions in the event of their being in receipt of wages from the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Royal Irish Constabulary (Resigned and Dismissed) Pensions Order, 1924, provides for the reduction or suspension of pensions payable pursuant to this Order in the event of the appointment of a pensioner to an office remunerated out of moneys provided by Parliament, the word &ldquo;Parliament&rdquo; being defined by the Order as including the Parliament of Great Britain.</P>
      <P>Suspension or reduction is, of course, determined by reference to the rate of remuneration received in the office in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it not seem an unreasonable thing, in an Order made under the authority of this Oireachtas, to interpret the word &ldquo;Parliament&rdquo; as including the Parliament of Great Britain?  If a man was in receipt of wages from the Parliament of Canada, Australia or New Zealand, would we also include those Parliaments in the definition of &ldquo;Parliament&rdquo; used in an Order made by this House?  If the Parliamentary Secretary agrees with me that such a strict interpretation of the word &ldquo;Parliament&rdquo; would be unduly to the detriment of industrious <Col N="2182" /> men who have received pensions from this Government for services rendered and who work in England, will he consider reviewing the existing interpretation of the word &ldquo;Parliament&rdquo; and, if he accepts the view that &ldquo;Parliament&rdquo; in an Order made by this House should mean the Dáil and Seanad, will he restore the pensions to those men, pensions which have been taken away because they were in receipt of wages from the British Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order has been there for 21 years.  The definition of &ldquo;Parliament&rdquo; is as I have stated and I do not think I am called upon to express any opinion on the matters raised by Deputy Dillon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I not correct in saying that the first time the Order has been brought into force with this new interpretation, that the word &ldquo;Parliament&rdquo; includes Great Britain, was in the case of a Mr. Gormley, who is the first of these pensioners to receive wages from the British Government since the pensions were awarded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary is made so aware, will he call for a review of this definition of the word &ldquo;Parliament&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see what bearing it would have in relation to the Order.  The Order is there, the definition is there, and it could have no bearing when it came into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Parliamentary Secretary realise that, while the Order has been there for 21 years, and the word &ldquo;Parliament&rdquo; in an Order made by a Minister in this Oireachtas includes the British House of Commons, the British House of Commons is a very recent definition, made only when the case of Mr. Gormley arose, when he got employment under the British Government during the present emergency; and, if it is deemed undesirable to define &ldquo;Parliament&rdquo; under an Order of this House as including the British House of Commons, will the Parliamentary Secretary consider recasting the definition <Col N="2183" /> or reviewing the definition and restoring to Mr. Gormley the pension to which he is entitled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct to say the definition is a recent one.  Section 5 (c) of the Order defines &ldquo;Parliament&rdquo; as the Parliament of the State and also the Parliament of Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, perhaps, the Minister will review it, and consult the Taoiseach when he is reviewing it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that under Section 68 of the British Income Tax Act, 1918, the Bank of Ireland was accorded the privilege to assess and tax itself; and, if so, if he will state the reasons for not taking steps to repeal this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he has received representations with a view to having the Dromore River, Ballybay, County Monaghan, drained under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945; and if he proposes to take any steps to this end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received and replied to the representations referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The Dromore River is situated in the River Erne catchment area.</P>
      <P>It would be impossible for me to give any indication, at this early stage, of when a scheme for that catchment area can be formulated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary prepared to say that the claims of this drainage area are under consideration, in view of the fact that the Drainage Bill has been through the Oireachtas, and presumably schemes in connection therewith are under review in his Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

      <P>I do assume it, but I know the high principles of the Parliamentary Secretary would prevent him showing any preference for any area or any person in his constituency, and it is because I am apprehensive lest his exceptionally high sense of duty should make him lean backwards in connection with this drainage area that I venture to mention it on this occasion.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Position of Rural Fishmongers.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he is aware that the failure to make any allowance for transport purposes to rural areas in the Prices Order fixing the price of fish has made it impossible for rural fishmongers to carry on their trade; and, if so, if he will amend the Order to permit of transport charges being added to the fixed retail prices of fish in areas outside Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the absence from the Emergency Powers (Fish) (Maximum Prices) Order, 1944, of a provision to allow them to increase the maximum prices for fish laid down in the Order, by any costs incurred in transport of such fish, is making it impossible for rural fishmongers to carry on their trade, and I see no reason why this should be the case.  I, therefore, do not intend to amend the Order in the manner suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister fixed a price which was fair for fish in Dublin, presumably he fixed the lowest price which, in his judgment, would be fair to the retail fishmongers, and how can the fishmonger in the extreme West of Ireland purchase fish on the same terms as the retailer in Dublin, ship it down to the West of Ireland or to the North of Ireland and there sell it at the same price as the fishmonger in Dublin, if he is not allowed to add on the cost of freight from Dublin to the place of retail sale?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The margin between the maximum wholesale and maximum retail price is adequate to permit the rural fishmonger to make a reasonable <Col N="2186" /> profit.  If we were to take into account the higher transport charges which a rural fishmonger may have to meet, we would obviously also be obliged to take into account other charges of rural fishmongers which might or might not be higher than those of traders in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is true that in connection with almost every other fixed price Order made by the Minister, he has provided, in addition to the fixed price, that the cost of transport to the point of distribution may be added.  That appears in dozens of Orders made by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, it does, because I operated them myself repeatedly.  Is the Minister not aware that numerous rural fishmongers have been obliged to go out of business simply because they cannot afford to pay the transport charges out of the margin of profit referred to by him?  Inasmuch as it is desirable to promote the consumption of fish throughout the rural areas for the sake of the industry itself, would the Minister not reconsider the matter? All that is at issue is 1d. or 1½d. per lb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <P>There is no provision in the Tourist Traffic Act, 1939, for the payment of compensation to proprietors or others who find themselves obliged to comply with the statutory requirements of the Irish Tourist Board in connection with the establishment of the registers <Col N="2188" /> prescribed by Section 24 of the Act.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a constituent of mine plastered her house with cement, and that in the process of plastering it, she incorporated in the cement plastering the words &ldquo;St. Farney's Hotel&rdquo;, or some such words?  Her hotel is in a rural area and is more readily classified as a boarding house.  It is a country residential hotel and it does not suit her to conform to the requirements of the Irish Tourist Board for hotels. She elects to be known as a residential hotel or boarding house, where upon the Irish Tourist Board inform her that she must remove the word &ldquo;hotel&rdquo;.  If she does, she must re-plaster the whole front of the house, because to hack the word out of the existing plaster would hopelessly disfigure the frontage.  She is quite prepared to let the Irish Tourist Board do it, if they wish to, or she will have it done and send the Irish Tourist Board the certified bill of the contractor who carries out the necessary repairs.  In these circumstances, would the Minister not consider requesting the Irish Tourist Board, where they are satisfied that structural alterations are necessary, at least to share the cost?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not remember what his answer was, but I should like to inquire of him, is it not manifestly inequitable that the reform secured on behalf of teachers in this country in 1920 should be applicable to every teacher who was then in the profession and to those who came in thereafter, but that the very few survivors who bore the heat and burden of the day to get those increases from the British Government should be denied the right of having their pensions brought up to the level that they would have been entitled to had the 1920 scales been in operation?  I say this, especially in view of the new principle laid down by the Minister himself when he abolished the contributory element in the national teachers' pensions scheme and accepted it as a State liability.  Did not that imply that, inasmuch as the contributory element no longer existed, all teachers in the public service would have their pensions related to the salary scales without differentiation? Yet, you have a miscroscopic group of teachers who retired prior to 1920, and who are living, in some cases, on £1 a week.  Surely, in respect of the pre-1920 teachers something might be done for the very few years of life left to them, and not have them die under an unjustifiable sense of grievance.</P>

Furthermore, although the group in question is not a large one, it is obvious that this particular group cannot be dealt with apart from the question of teacher-pensioners in general of <Col N="2193" /> whom there are over 3,000, I think. As the Minister for Finance explained in the answer I have referred to, the question of teacher-pensioners cannot be dealt with apart from superannuated persons who have retired from the public service or, indeed, the other classes of pensioners.  The whole question of dealing with pensioners in this manner has been considered by the Government and a decision has been reached, and I see no prospect of that decision being repealed.</P>

      <P>The wages of both classes of labourers are related to the rates payable to other classes of labourers in Government employment, and may not be altered at the sole discretion of my Department.  It is customary to review their rates of wages in the light of the variations in the minimum rates payable to agricultural labourers under Orders promulgated from time to time by the Agricultural Wages Board.  The rates were last reviewed on the 7th February, 1944, following the Agricultural Wages (Minimum Rates) Order, 1944, and an increase of 4/- a week was then granted to each of the two classes.

In view of the fact that other State servants have got an emergency bonus and a cost-of-living bonus, I think the Government should pay a bonus to the people it employs on forestry and land work. We all know that, with the cost of living at what it is to-day, it is impossible for the men in the rural districts to live on £2 a week.

      <P>I indicated on the Second Reading of this Bill, in connection with the Presidential election, that the date for taking the poll would probably be fixed for 15th June.  The 15th June happens to be a Friday and it has been represented to me that that might be inconvenient, particularly in urban areas and, accordingly, if a poll has to be taken, I propose to fix the day for taking of the poll for Thursday, 14th June.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the under-sheriff. Section 10 says that the local returning officer for a constituency shall, in relation to the taking of the poll in any local electoral area in the constituency for the purposes of a 1945 local election, be the returning officer. Hitherto, of course, as the Minister is aware, the returning officer for local elections was the secretary to the county council.  Under this Bill, apparently, the secretary of the county council will not perform any functions, although it would appear from the wording of Section 10 as if it is the Minister's intention to bring back the secretary of the county council and to give him certain functions in relation to electoral areas as distinct from constituencies.</P>

      <P>There is no contradiction. <Col N="2199" /> For the purpose of the Presidential election, under the Presidential Election Act, 1937, the poll has to be conducted according to the Dáil constituencies. In order that all the votes, say, for the county council and the votes for the Presidential election will be counted in the one place, and to avoid a great deal of confusion that might arise if ballot boxes had to be sent here and there, we are providing that in general the constituency for the purpose of the Presidential Elections Act this year will be the administrative county or county borough, as the case may be.  That means that we have to define or prescribe who is going to be the local returning officer for the purpose of the general conduct of the Presidential election and that is prescribed here in Section 6.  When we come, however, to consider the taking of the poll, we anticipate that we shall be in this position, that in some places we may have only one presiding officer presiding over both polls, and perhaps even in some cases the one set of ballot boxes, because of supply difficulties.</P>

      <P>I was trying to deal with the point which has been raised by Deputy Roddy.  I was pointing out the circumstances which we think may exist.  We hope, if we can, to avoid them.  If we can get an ample supply of boxes, if we can get an ample supply of polling compartments and arrange for separate polling booths for the taking of the poll for the Presidential election as distinct from the taking of the poll for the local elections, all this will be done, but there are places, we fear, <Col N="2200" /> where we may have to use the one polling booth, where we will have only the one set of polling compartments and the one set of ballot boxes and, therefore, the one presiding officer.  In order that there may be no doubt as to whom the presiding officer will derive his authority from, and in order that there may be no doubt as to who is to be responsible for the conduct, particularly of the Presidential election, but also of the local elections, we are making, for the purpose of taking the poll only, the local returning officer for the purpose of the Presidential election, the returning officer for the purpose of taking the poll for the local elections, but for that limited purpose only.</P>

      <P>Is not that arrangement likely to give rise to a certain amount of confusion?  As I understand the Minister, the county registrar&mdash;because the under&mdash;sheriff is only the deputy for the county registrar&mdash;will act as returning officer.  His responsibility apparently will end when the poll finishes on the day of the election and then, from what the Minister has stated, seemingly the secretary of the county council takes over and he will be responsible subsequently for the counting of the votes and the actual returns of the election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No. First of all, let me clear up a misapprehension.  In most constituencies the county registrar is returning officer.  In certain other areas, because the office of under-sheriff still survives, the undersheriff is returning officer.  There is no question of one being deputy to the other.  So far as the general conduct of the poll is concerned, as I have already indicated, the local returning officer under the Presidential Elections Act will be responsible for the taking of the poll everywhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that I am still suffering from a certain amount of confusion in connection with the arrangements for the carrying out of the provisions of this Bill.  According to the Minister's statements, the county registrar or the sub-sheriff will be the returning officer for the purposes of both the Presidential and the local elections and then, immediately the poll is over, it appears that another returning officer will take control and will be responsible for the actual counting of the votes and the making of the final returns to the Minister.  Is not that arrangement likely to create a certain amount of confusion?  Is it not <Col N="2203" /> likely to lead to a certain duplication of work?  Is it not likely to cause unnecessary expenditure?  The county registrar, I presume, or the sub-sheriff, as the case may be, will engage one staff for the purpose of carrying out the poll and the other returning officer, the secretary of the county council or the town clerk, as the case may be, will engage another staff for the purpose of counting the votes.  It has been customary both at local elections and at Parliamentary elections for practically the same staff to perform both sets of duties.  In this instance, apparently, these two responsible officers will be left free to engage separate staffs for the purpose of carrying out separate sets of duties.  I think the whole thing is likely to lead to confusion and unnecessary expense.  Would it not have been better for the Minister to have appointed the county registrar or the sub-sheriff, as the case may be, not only to take charge of the poll but to take charge of the counting of the votes as well?  If he did that, does he not think that the work would proceed much more smoothly and efficiently than it will under this peculiar dual arrangement provided for in this Bill? Dual control in any circumstances does not give satisfaction.  It is unlikely to give satisfaction in connection with this election.  I think that the Minister was badly advised when he put a provision of this description in a Bill of this kind. I do not know who is responsible for advising him, but I think the advice was bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Roddy.  I think the Minister is right to separate the counting of the votes for the Presidential and the Local Government elections, otherwise it would mean that the urban and town commissioners election votes would all be brought to one centre and the count would probably take a fortnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister make it clear why it is necessary to duplicate the office of returning officer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not duplicating the office of returning officer.  We <Col N="2204" /> have envisaged a situation in which there may be a contest for the Presidential election and because we feel&mdash; and I think the House agreed with us &mdash;that if there is to be such a contest the country should not have the disturbance of two elections within three or four days of each other, but that they should be held on the one day, we have tried to make such departures from the existing arrangements as may be necessary, but only such departures as may be necessary, to enable that to be done.  Now the existing law provides that the returning officer for the purpose of the local elections will be the secretary of the county council or, in the case of urban authorities, the town clerk.  We do not want to interfere with that arrangement except to the very minimum extent that may be necessary.  The Presidential Election Act provides, on the other hand, that the Presidential election is to be conducted by constituencies and the local returning officer will be the county registrar or the under-sheriff, whoever in the normal way would be the returning officer for that particular Dáil constituency.  We are faced with this problem, that the elections are not only to be held on the one day but may be held in the one booth and that the ballot papers may be actually put into the one box.  We must therefore make somebody responsible for that day for the conduct of both elections.  Therefore, for the purpose of taking the poll we say that, since we must choose between one officer and another, the officer who is made responsible for conducting an election which is of national importance will be the officer who is to assume the whole responsibility for the taking of the poll in connection with both elections.  Further, we must fix responsibility for conduct within the polling booth upon one person, for we could not have a conflict of authority within the polling booth.  We could not have one presiding officer telling a voter that he could vote there but another presiding officer saying he was not entitled to vote there.  We cannot have two separate returning officers; we must have one person responsible for the general management <Col N="2205" /> of affairs inside the polling booth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right, as far as it goes.  It is clear enough in regard to the taking of the poll, but when the counting takes place, will the returning officer, the country registrar, count the votes for the Presidential election, and will the secretary of the county council count the votes for the local election? Will there be two different counts or will one person be responsible for the lot?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have explained it and I must remind the Deputy that he knew very well what was going to happen.  It is very simple.  I have already said that we wish to be responsible for the minimum amount of interference with the existing arrangement.  The Deputy is aware that the votes in the local elections are counted by the returning officers for their respective local authorities. Therefore all we are doing is to ensure that, where there will not be separate ballot boxes, the papers will go to the right local authority.  Naturally there has to be a preliminary sorting and that sorting will be conducted under the control of the local returning officer for the purposes of the Presidential election.  When the votes are sorted, they will be made into parcels and sent to the appropriate returning officer for the local authority.  That is the position.</P>

      <P>I want the Minister to make this clear.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware of the <Col N="2207" /> queer things which could happen in a polling booth, where there is considerable excitement.  Supposing a bundle of Presidential votes gets mixed up with the local authorities votes, or, on the other hand, if a bundle of county council votes were mixed up with the others&mdash;I suppose there are to be different colours but I do not know&mdash;it will lead to confusion.  I would like to see in practice how it would work out. I do not think it is as simple as the Minister thinks.  I would suggest that the returning officer, the county registrar, when he is the returning officer for the Presidential election, should be responsible for the whole lot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 11 to insert the following section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>For the purposes of the qualification and nomination of a candidate at a 1945 local election, any person, who is registered in the register of local government electors for a particular registration area which came into force on the 1st day of June, 1944, but is not registered in the register of local government electors for that registration area which will come into force on the 1st day of June, 1945, shall be deemed to be registered in such last-mentioned register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment seems to have been generally misunderstood in the Press.  It has nothing whatever to do with the Dublin electoral areas&mdash; let me emphasise that&mdash;because there is no residential qualification in relation to candidature for the Dublin Corporation. The purpose of the amendment is to meet a contingency which might arise, but is not likely to arise.  If we had fixed the polling day for the Presidential election for the 15th June or up to the 20th June, the polling day for the purposes of the local elections would also have been the 15th, 16th, 18th or 19th of June.  It might have been any one of those days.  That might lead to the situation, that you had some people in a county electoral area, perhaps a remote one, wanting to nominate a candidate for a local authority and because of the difficulties of transport nowadays they might have found some difficulty&mdash;I say they might, though I do not anticipate they would; however, we have to try to cover the contingency&mdash;in getting a copy of the register in advance, so as to enable them to satisfy themselves as to whether persons whom they wished to nominate them or whether a candidate whom they wished to nominate would be qualified under the Local Government Act, 1941, to be a candidate or to be a nominator for that particular county electoral area.  The way we propose to get over that, if the situation should arise, is to say that any person who was qualified to act as a <Col N="2209" /> nominator or to be a candidate for that electoral area in the year 1944 will be qualified to act as a nominator or to be a candidate for that electoral area in 1945.  In fact, we do not think that that position will arise, but, in any event, in order to be on the safe side, since the possibility has been adverted to, we feel that it is desirable to make the necessary provision in the Bill to cover it.</P>

      <P>It had been my intention to put that query to the Minister, to ask him to define or explain the qualifications referred to in the amendment, as the 1898 Local Government Act, sub-section (5) of Section 2, does not apply to the Dublin Corporation elections.  The section reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A person shall not be qualified to be elected or to be a council or for a county, unless he is a local government elector for such county.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Is it quite clear from what the Minister said that the acceptance of this amendment in no way supersedes the 1930 Dublin Act, the provisions of which make no call for a residential qualification?  The general opinion amongst those of us who saw this was that it was quite simple and we could not understand the idea of the Minister in introducing it, so far as Dublin is concerned, as we have had no residential qualification since the elections in 1930.</P>

      <P>Does it not simply mean that we are providing extra facilities for the elections?  At the last elections we provided extra booths in the country and it meant that you took smaller areas, in dividing the electoral areas, and to cover these small areas you must put them in this county?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Under the law as it stands, a person going forward for a county council&mdash;we can leave Dublin completely out of it, as Dublin is not affected one way or another by this amendment&mdash;in order to be qualified as a candidate must be a local government elector for the county electoral area for which he is nominated. Now it may happen that people may have some difficulty in ascertaining whether a person fulfilled that qualification in the register for 1945 and all we are saying is that, to avoid confusion and inconvenience, we will accept it if the man's name was inscribed in the register for 1944 as an elector in that county electoral area. That will be accepted as a qualification.</P>
      <P>This has nothing to do with Dublin. It is intended to deal with areas outside Dublin, with county councils, urban districts or town commissioners. In the case of the urban districts and the town commissioners, there is not likely to be the same difficulty in getting a copy of the register.  I do not think there will be that difficulty, even in the most remote county electoral areas.  But, in order that there will be no hardship or disqualification, we are making this provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  I do not feel happy over this amendment.  It seems to me it opens up a rather wide field.  It is intended to admit people who, in the ordinary normal way, would not be eligible to come forward as local government candidates.  In the interval between 1944 and 1945 a candidate may have left the country and it seems to me, according to the terms of this amendment, that man would still be eligible for nomination for the local elections.  I am sure it is not the intention of the Minister to facilitate that type of person.  Again, a candidate may have transferred from one part of the country to another, but because his name happens to be still on the register of the area which he had recently left, he would be eligible as a candidate for the local council, notwithstanding that he was not residing in the area and was not likely to go back to reside there.  I think the terms of the amendment are too wide and it is likely to lead to abuses which, I am sure, the Minister is anxious to avoid.  It is also likely to encourage the nomination of candidates who will probably never sit on local councils to which they are elected.</P>

Apparently the point that is worrying the Minister is that in remote districts the register will not be available for individuals anxious to nominate a candidate. He need not worry about that, and I do not think the amendment is really necessary.  If the register is in the hands of the people for about a week or so, I think there will be ample time.</P>

      <P>There are a dozen <Col N="2214" /> reasons why that date would not be suitable.  These matters have all been considered carefully.  It is generally to be found, and I am sure the Deputy knows it, that Monday is not a good day for a poll.  Various arrangements have to be made, taking into consideration the convenience of candidates and Sunday would not be a good day on which to carry out arrangements for a poll on the succeeding day. Then, again, we are not living in normal times and we have to allow the returning officers a longer period than usual to make the necessary arrangements, particularly where they are dealing with remote districts.  The whole question of the islands and the possibility of interruption of communication between the islands and the mainland have to be taken into consideration, and the net result of all our cogitations was that the 15th would be the date which would give us time to enable the necessary arrangements to be made, but it has been represented that the 14th would be generally much more acceptable to the urban populations and a number of others.  Friday is pay-night and many housekeepers and others have domestic arrangements to make on that night.  Therefore, in order to give everybody an opportunity to vote with the least possible inconvenience, I decided that, taking everything into consideration, the best date for fixing the poll for the Presidential election is 14th June.</P>

They were not held until 1942 and I took the decision, with the consent of the Government, to restore the principle of local elections and they were held in 1942.  The fact that a Presidential election falls due this year has nothing whatever to do with the holding of the local elections and the Deputy, if he is a democrat, ought not to try to create the impression that local elections can be postponed at the whim of any Minister or anybody else. The law provides that they shall be held and so far as I am concerned they will be held.</P>

      <P>We may.  The Deputy again is jumping to conclusions which are unjustified by anything I have said.  I said that if the polling date is 14th June, the last day for receiving nominations for urban authorities will be 2nd June.  The register for 1945 will be available to every urban elector on 1st June, and, we believe, earlier.  The 1945 register will also be available to those rural electors who wish to make the journey to the place where the register is available.  It will also be available, we have every reason to believe, before 1st June, but we are inserting this amendment to provide for the contingency where it might not be convenient for a man to make the journey to the place where the register is available a day or two days before he had to make up his mind as to whom he is going to nominate as candidate.  We are trying to meet the convenience of the candidates and the nominators.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dublin County Borough (Local Electoral Areas) Order, 1945, made by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health on the 4th April, 1945, be and is hereby annulled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion arises out of the undertaking given by the Minister on the passing of the Local Government Bill that Orders under that Bill would be laid on the Table of the House for at least seven Parliamentary days.  That has been done and we have since got the Minister's scheme in relation to the City of Dublin.  I want to say quite frankly that the general opinion of the members of the city council who are competent to judge the divisions of the area is that not alone is it a be wildering and unsatisfactory scheme, but the <Col N="2218" /> divisions are of such a character as almost to arouse the suspicion that considerations other than natural boundaries have entered into their determination.</P>
    <P>The history of this matter of increased representation goes back to 1936 when the city council at the time considered the results of the assimilation of the local government and Parliamentary franchises.  Certain representations were made to the Local Government Department arising out of the increase in the number of electors which, in 1943, was practically 100 per cent.  Following the decision in that year, we found certain anomalies in the five areas into which the city was divided under the 1930 Act.  Certain anomalies arose in that some areas would be under-represented in comparison with others, on the basis of the votes cast.  The general purposes committee of the corporation considered the position and decided to make representations to the Government in August last year.  The representation was:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We recommend the council to make representations that in any future revision of Dáil constituencies the Dáil and municipal boundaries should be assimilated, and that, if possible, the Dáil constituencies and the borough electoral areas should be coterminus.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A separate recommendation was made on the possibility of increased representation. That was sent to the Department of Local Government in January of this year.  It was only within the last couple of weeks that the Minister, in the Dáil, asked for sanction for these particular areas under the provisions of the Local Government (Dublin) Bill of 1945.  When that Bill was before the House I, and other Dublin Deputies attached to the corporation, agreed that the Minister was, in fact, giving effect to the desire of the corporation so far as increased representation was concerned.  We asked at the time that, in any recasting of the areas which took place, cognisance should be taken of existing differences so far as the municipal and Parliamentary boundaries are concerned. Particular reference was made <Col N="2219" /> to areas like Crumlin, one section of which comes in for Parliamentary purposes and another section for municipal purposes.  The desire was to have such areas assimilated.  Particular stress was laid on Crumlin and other outside areas.  The recommendation which I have read laid particular stress on that and urged that as far as possible those areas should be made coterminus for Parliamentary and municipal purposes.  I gathered from the Minister at the time that the overriding consideration in any recasting would be the assimilation of the Parliamentary municipal boundaries.</P>
    <P>I must confess that, in the scheme before us now, no attempt has been made to rectify the position which the corporation in January last asked should be rectified, and earlier in 1936.  In conversation with various members of the corporation I can find no basis whatever for some of the distinctions that are being made in the city at the present time.  My own area, on the north side&mdash;No. 3&mdash;may be taken as an illustration.  That area, in its altered form, is now a perfect copy of the map of Italy, even to the inclusion of the famous toe.  There is a cutting across streets, roads and areas that should, in the normal way, have features in common.  One would expect that the Minister, or those to whom he delegated this very important task, should have taken note of the requirements of the inhabitants of these particular areas, and that, as far as possible, natural division should be made which would contain features common to the area and the people as a whole.  That has not been done.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to avail of this opportunity to say&mdash;because of the delay there has been in bringing about this change, the preparation of the register, and notwithstanding the official communication which was issued by the Government Bureau&mdash;that there are grounds for stating, I understand, that the register will not be available at the time that the candidates for the local elections in Dublin would desire to have it.  They may have it in the period round about the 1st June, but thereafter another operation has to <Col N="2220" /> take place.  There is the question of the arrangement of the polling districts and of the polling booths.  Therefore, even after the 1st June, the officials of the corporation, or whoever will be responsible, will need a certain period of time to carry out these details, so that we will be right on the eve of the election, I understand, before candidates for the Dublin municipal area will have an opportunity of completing their arrangements.  That is entirely unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to have to say that what appeared to be quite all right in the early stages, namely, that the Minister was in effect about to implement what the corporation desired, is not so.  In the actual result, we have got something which is completely unsatisfactory. Because of the necessarily short period that will be available, confusion will inevitably arise on the day of the election.  You will have electors who, since 1930, have been familiar with particular candidates in different areas&mdash;old people going in to vote for their old nominees&mdash;and they will find that, as electors, they are not in that area at all.  You will, therefore, have confusion on polling day.  When one considers that a situation of that sort will be superimposed on a possible Presidential poll on the same occasion, it will give the House an idea of what the unfortunate officials will have to face on the day of election.</P>
    <P>I am going to ask the Minister that, while he is making provision for ten additional members&mdash;we welcome that on the basis of population&mdash;that even at this stage he might withdraw the Order for the purposes of this election. I suggest to him that he should allow the additional candidates to be spread over the existing five areas&mdash;that is two extra members for each area. That, I suggest to him, is the procedure which he should adopt for this particular election.  These five areas are pretty well defined.  The only flaw found in them so far was that they did not fit into a perfect assimilation with the Parliamentary areas.  Our main request, in addition to getting increased representation, was that these areas would be straightened out, <Col N="2221" /> once and for all.  The position that we have now produced is utterly impossible, and is in strong conflict with our own ideas so far as the Parliamentary constituencies are concerned.</P>
    <P>There is an aspect of the new areas that I would like particularly to refer to.  I have in mind area No. 9 which seems to have been specially devised for the purpose of giving representation to the business element of the city. It runs in line down O'Connell Street, takes in sections of Grafton Street and goes right on to Leeson Street, with strips of the city on either side.  When I remember that in 1930 the Minister and his Party railed at the provision made by the Fine Gael Government for what was known as the commercial register in the corporation, I confess I am rather amused at the introduction of this particular area known as No. 9. I do not hesitate to say that I would welcome representation for businessmen. That is not to suggest that there are no business men in the corporation at the present time.  There are, but if you want to have them represented in their capacity as businessmen I would welcome them in that way in the corporation but I do protest against any class distinction so far as qualification or nomination is concerned in respect of this particular area.  The businessmen in that particular area make their living out of the residents of the outer areas who have the option of taking their part in civic life, and whose duty it is to do so by voting, in either the inner area or the outer area, as the case may be, wherever they may select their vote.  But to parcel out a section of the city is something that we in the corporation, in 1945, do not agree with. I repeat my plea that the Minister loses nothing by the adoption of my suggestion.  Since he will not allow the assimilation of the Parliamentary and local electoral areas, at this stage, he should at least allow the existing areas to stand and to secure the extra ten members in the way I have suggested, namely, by having an additional two for each area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion to annual the Minister's Order concerning the local election.  Deputy O'Sullivan, the Lord Mayor, has covered the <Col N="2222" /> ground which I intended to traverse and I do not wish to detain the House by going over it in detail.  The Dublin Corporation did not seek the redistribution of the city areas but they did seek the revision and assimilation of the polling districts of the city, to bring them into conformity with the Dáil constituencies.  The corporation, at one of their meetings, adopted the recommendation of the General Purposes Committee regarding the assimilation of the Dáil and municipal boundaries of Dublin.  I will read the recommendations because, although Deputy O'Sullivan, the Lord Mayor, has referred to them, I think it is well that we should have them on record:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the recommendation of the committee regarding the assimilation of the Dáil and municipal boundaries in Dublin be and is hereby endorsed; and that a copy of this report be forwarded to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health for the purpose of directing his attention to this matter and to the suggested revision of the basis of election of members of the city council.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was in August, 1944.  The General Purposes Committee in their report, No. 17 of 1944, recommended:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the city council, by formal resolution, should make representations to the Government, in the strongest possible terms, that in the next revision of the Dáil constituencies, the Dáil and municipal boundaries should be assimilated, and if possible the Dáil constituencies and the borough electoral areas should be made co-terminous.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>They concluded by saying that it was the opinion of the committee:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;that these anomalies should be rectified at the earliest possible date, particularly in view of the fact that a municipal election is due to be held next year, and accordingly, we recommend the council to take immediate and suitable action in the matter.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Action was taken in the matter, but the Minister neither approved nor disapproved, except to the extent that his disapproval is shown by the Bill he has submitted to the House for the redistribution <Col N="2223" /> of the seats.  As already stated, there has been no objection raised to the increase in membership of the corporation, but the members of the corporation feel that they have been very unfairly and unreasonably treated in this connection, because the whole machinery is dislocated.  The normal triennial election would take place, and all Parties would be making the necessary arrangements for the conduct of the elections, next June. The registers have always been made up in wards.  They are now going to be altered, and will be made up in areas that will conform to the areas on the map, which is, as Deputy O'Sullivan, the Lord Mayor, said, very bewildering to anyone who has anything to do with the election.  I presume that some official of the Department of Local Government got instructions to divide the city so as to give an average of 50,000 voters in each area and that he got his blue pencil and encircled the area on the map, believing that, so far as he was concerned, he was doing his duty.  I think it is very unfair.  It is treating the members of the corporation as a whole badly.  When this matter was discussed at a recent corporation meeting the members of all Parties joined in the protest.  I can appreciate that the members of the Government Party in the corporation do not wish to discuss the matter here or embarrass the Minister. It is easy to understand that, but I can assure the Minister that it is not in any Party spirit that Deputy O'Sullivan, the Lord Mayor, and I have tabled the motion, but it is because we feel that it is grossly unfair, on the eve of an election, to break up all the ordinary machinery for the conduct of an election by altering the areas as is proposed in the new scheme of redistribution.</P>
    <P>The discussion at the corporation meeting recently was followed by a statement on behalf of the Department of Local Government which, I submit, did not deny the existence of the difficulties which were outlined. In normal times, one would expect that the register would be available so as to facilitate candidates in carrying out the work of addressing <Col N="2224" /> envelopes and providing the electorate with their numbers and all the other work associated with elections.  In normal times it is a difficult job and there is considerable expense involved. We are on the eve of an election and there is not a sign of the register yet.  I think it is grossly unfair.  It will not encourage citizens to take their part in civic administration. Many members of the Dublin Corporation have spent their lifetime in it, voluntarily.  They have nothing to gain and only wish to take their part as citizens in the discharge of their public duties.  It is very discourteous that they should be treated as they have been by the introduction of this Bill at such short notice.  It is not, as I have said, making an effort to encourage citizens to take part in the affairs of the city council, as I think the Minister would like to encourage them.  It is going the wrong way about it.  The feeling in the city is that this is merely got up for Party purposes and that it is to end there.  People are being discouraged from devoting their time voluntarily to this class of social work. I am sorry that that position is being taken up.</P>
    <P>As an instance of the confusion which will arise owing to voters who have for many years been voting in certain polling stations having to vote in other stations under the new arrangement and having to go a long journey to vote, which will not give them much interest in the elections, I would point out that there is one case in which a whole street of houses is in one area with one exception, that house being in another area.  That is a nice kind of distribution.  No. 3 area and No. 9 area have been already referred to.  All I can say is that it was a mistake that some people who knew something about the areas were not consulted before the blue pencil was drawn around those streets which are to form the new areas.  I would appeal to the Minister to have regard to the shortness of time for making arrangements for the election.  This election ought to be permitted to proceed in the normal way under the old arrangement, or else an extension of <Col N="2225" /> time should be given in order to give an opportunity to those interested in municipal affairs, both official and otherwise, to get the machinery going so that the election can be conducted in a proper way.  I hope the Minister will see his way to annul this Order.</P>

      <P>I have fought, I suppose, as many elections as any Deputy here&mdash;one local and, I suppose, countless numbers of Parliamentary elections almost&mdash;and therefore I am not without sympathy for the position of any person who is likely to be a candidate or for any person who has been a member of a local authority who is to be a candidate, when he embarks upon an election contest.  But the responsibility which was imposed upon me was not to safeguard or, indeed, to concern myself with the interests of members of the Dublin Corporation or with those who aspire to be members of the Dublin Corporation, but to concern myself with the problem of giving, so far as it was reasonably practicable to do it, to the citizens of Dublin fair and equitable representation on their own corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that the existing position was anomalous, so anomalous that the city council itself adopted resolutions asking me to modify and to change the existing system.  They pointed out that, under that system, there existed gross inequalities in the apportionment of their representation in the Dublin Corporation; that in 1943, 43,000 electors elected seven members in No. 1 area, whereas in No. 2 area, 66,000 electors were only given the same number of members.  There was one member to each 6,200 electors in No. 1 area and only one member to 9,400 electors in No. 2 area.  It required, in fact, 50 per cent. more votes to secure representation in the Dublin Corporation in the No. 2 area than it did in No. 1 area.  No. 3 area, with only 62,000 electors, was given one member more than No. 2 area, because No. 3 area had eight members against the seven allotted to No. 2.  In No. 4 area, which I think presented the greatest anomaly almost, you had 49,000 electors with only six members. <Col N="2226" /> In No. 5 area you had 70,000 electors with seven members; 10,000 electors in that particular area for each of the seven members.  Upon what principle of fair and adequate representation of the people could that position be justified?  The Dublin Corporation themselves, to their credit, recognised this fundamental injustice and they asked me to remedy it.</P>
    <P>When the Local Government (Dublin) Bill was going through the House I indicated that, as we were increasing the representation of the people in their own city council, it would be necessary for me to provide for the allocation of the additional members. I thought that if I did that I should do it in accordance with well-defined principles and the principles were stated in what was then a Bill when we were discussing it in this House and what is now a statute which is binding upon me.  The Local Government (Dublin) Act of 1945 provides that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;in assigning, by an Order under this section (that is Section 3 of the Act) the numbers of members to be elected for the electoral areas specified in that Order the Minister shall have regard to the populations and the rateable valuations of such areas&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, if I were to act in accordance with that Act, and I do not see how I could act otherwise, I could not possibly, whatever else I might do, having regard to the fact that the responsibility was put on me of making a new division of the city, allow the existing electoral areas, with all the anomalies to which I have referred, to remain.  If I could not do that, I certainly could not go further and make the position even more anomalous by allocating to the existing five electoral areas two additional members each, giving to three areas nine members, to one area eight members, and to another area ten members, on the basis of their existing populations.  As I have said, that would be to accentuate the injustice and the inequality which the city council itself has recognised to exist and which they asked me to remedy.  That is the fundamental position, but even if there were no question of fundamental fairness in a matter of <Col N="2227" /> this sort there would still remain very practical difficulties from the point of view of the citizen which would prevent me from assenting to the proposal which has been made here.</P>
    <P>Proportional representation is not an easy system to work.  It makes more than normal demands, perhaps not so much on the intelligence as on the education and certain natural faculties, the need for concentration and for remembering things like that, on the ordinary voter.  If I were to accept the proposition&mdash;and this would be a fresh acceptance on my part and it would be, in fact, the first time I was ever asked to assent to it&mdash;that it is reasonable to have as many as ten representatives allotted to any one constituency, it would make the voter's task more difficult.  I know that that position, which I regard as a very regrettable one, may exist in this country, but it is not of my making and it is not at the present moment in my power to change it.</P>
    <P>The occasion presented itself to me when I would have to determine for myself what, from every point of view, was a convenient basis for proportional representation as applied to municipal affairs.  When that opportunity presented itself to me, naturally I had to consider, as I did, whether the simple thing would not be to take, as Deputy M. O'Sullivan has suggested, ten additional members and distribute them, two to each constituency, making the representation, as I have already mentioned, in three of the electoral areas, nine members; in one area, eight members; and in the other, ten members.  Now, I ask anybody to consider the type of ballot paper which the electors in Dublin City would have presented to them.</P>
    <P>We know that there are at least three political Parties likely to be represented on that ballot paper, either directly or indirectly.  It is no secret that the political organisation to which I belong will put forward official nominees; I suppose the same will hold true of the Labour Party; and I have no doubt whatever that Deputy Doyle will not forsake the banner which he has carried so long and so <Col N="2228" /> honourably in the Dublin Corporation and will be there as a Fine Gael candidate as well.  In addition to that, we all know that the local elections induce a number of Independent aspirants to seek municipal honours and we may rate them as, perhaps, ten or 12.  Think of the task of the local government elector in No. 3 area, with ten representatives to elect for that area, presented with a ballot paper on which there may be 20, 25 or 30 names. Is it reasonable to expect that that election will be conducted in an orderly way and conducted expeditiously? Consider that, apart from the fact that we might have a Presidential poll taken on the same day.  Would it be a rational, a commonsense or a practical proposition, to put in the hands of an elector a ballot paper with 25 or 30 names on it, in addition to a ballot paper for the Presidential election?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Minister, but in point of fact that is what the local government electors have been doing for years. The number of candidates has extended from 20 to 30, even where there were eight seats in No. 3 area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>So the Deputy's proposition comes down to this, that I must increase that already overladen paper by from 33? to 25 per cent.&mdash; that, if there were 30 names on the ballot paper in No. 4 area, which returns at present six members, and I make that area return eight members, then I have to add to that 25 or 30 an additional ten candidates.  The same thing would hold true for all the other areas.  It is an undoubted fact that the more vacancies there are, the greater the inducement there is to put forward candidates, on the part of a political Party, and the greater the inducement to Independents to come forward as well.  So we get this as a general matter of practical politics, that if you increase the representation allotted to any area you also increase the inducement to people to come forward and the voter is likely, as a consequence, to have a greater number of candidates to select from on his ballot paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2229" /> I do not wish to deprive any citizen of a proper opportunity to select a candidate, but I certainly think he is likely to make a better selection, if he has a ballot paper of normal size with a reasonable list of candidates to select from, than if he has to wade down a ballot paper that has 20, 25 or 30 names on it, as I have indicated.  Therefore, if there were not even the fundamental principle that the people should be given a fair and equal representation in Parliament, if there were not even that fundamental objection to this proposal, I would still reject it on the grounds of mere expediency.  It would make the existing situation in Dublin &mdash;which is bad, as Deputy O'Sullivan admitted&mdash;even worse.</P>
    <P>Therefore, what did I do, when I had to consider the situation?  I looked, first of all, very carefully into the history which lies behind the existing divisions and I looked at the map upon which those existing divisions are shown.  Deputy Doyle talked about one house in one street being in one area and the remainder of the houses in the same street being in another area.  I think the Deputy must have had in mind the old division, as that was quite a common thing.  Not merely that, but you had a piece of a house in one area and a piece of a house in another area.</P>

We were very careful &mdash;it was one of the difficulties we had to contend with in defining and laying down the boundaries&mdash;to follow wellrecognised and easily recognisable natural features.  How did the old areas, which are now being superseded, come into existence?  They date back, I think, to the Act of 1845 when, for one reason or another, a commission of the old corrupt corporation, <Col N="2230" /> as it was then, was set up to map out the wards.  Now nobody will tell me that there is any rational principle behind the old Dublin City wards.  It is quite clear, the moment you begin to look at these things, that there must have been certain territorial considerations, certain personal considerations operating when the City Fathers of 1845 sat together and decided to parcel up the territory of the new city, the enlarged city, between them, and everything that has happened since then has been based on that division until the position was reached at which, as between one area and another, there was no well-defined boundary existing at all, because houses had been built across old town-land boundaries and new roads had been cut through landmarks which had been in existence in 1845.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, when I came to consider the question of defining the areas, the first thing I said to myself was this: &ldquo;I am bound to have regard to the population in each area.&rdquo;  And I said to myself, looking at the city with its 450,000 odd inhabitants and with 45 members to be elected: &ldquo;What is the most reasonable arithmetical norm that I ought to work to&mdash;what is the most reasonable unit of population that I ought to work to?&rdquo; Bearing in mind the number of members to be elected to the Dublin Corporation, and bearing in mind that our population is, in round figures, about 450,000, surely the most natural thing to do was to try &mdash;I was not able to succeed&mdash;so to arrange those electoral areas that every 10,000 people will be represented by one member in the Dublin Corporation. It was on the basis of that unit of 10,000 of the population per member that I started to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then I had to ask myself what was the minimum size of the constituency that would allow the principle of proportional representation to operate fairly freely.  If I were dealing with a Dáil election, where the factor that has to be taken into consideration is that we must try to provide a stable Government for the country for a period, I might say that three was perhaps the best unit.  But we are not <Col N="2231" /> dealing with a body where it is necessary to provide a stable administration over any period.  We are dealing with a body the purpose of which is to give fairly representative views to the citizens and, therefore, I said to myself: &ldquo;If I can get convenient electoral areas with a population of about 50,000 or so returning five members, I will, I think, have done a good job and the representation allotted to each of these electoral areas will be large enough to allow the principle of proportional representation to operate freely and effectively.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the representation allotted to the areas will not be so great as to make the ballot paper inconvenient.  And let me remind the House again that the purpose of this Bill is not to serve or safeguard the interests of the people who are sitting in the Dublin Corporation, but it is to serve and safeguard the interests of the people whom men and women are sent to the Dublin Corporation to represent.  That ought to be kept in mind.  Therefore I said to myself: &ldquo;If I can give the citizens a convenient unit, an easily identifiable unit, I think I will have done a good job.&rdquo; I submit that is what I have done, without any of those ulterior considerations which the Lord Mayor suggested some people believe I had in mind.</P>
    <P>I took the 45 members of the Dublin Corporation and divided that number by five and I said: &ldquo;I am going to provide nine electoral areas, returning five members each, and, so far as I can ensure it, these electoral areas will have more or less the same population.&rdquo; Having the opportunity to redress or remove the anomaly to which the city corporation had drawn my attention, I was not going to perpetuate it and, therefore, I said I would give to each of these nine areas five members representing a population of about 50,000 people.  That is what I tried to do.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, the next thing was that I made up my mind that, so far as I was concerned, the confusion which I know to have existed <Col N="2232" /> as to what were the exact boundaries of the old electoral divisions would not again arise, and I took natural features, the greatest of them being the Liffey, which runs, as any Deputy can see who looks at the map in the Lobby, right through the whole city.  I took the canal and the existing city boundary and tried to work inwards from the existing city boundary to the Liffey on both sides, and to the canal where it formed a convenient line of delimitation.  And because I had to find some lines&mdash;you cannot describe them as radial&mdash;running approximately from north to south, I took the main thoroughfares.  I took thoroughfares like Drumcondra Road, the East Wall, Gardiner Street and Parnell Street and a dozen others that I might name, places with which I am most familiar, such as Ranelagh Road, Palmerston Road and Dartry Road.  These are thoroughfares that are not likely to be obliterated in our time or in the next generation.  They are landmarks which will stand, and a person standing for a Dublin electoral area now will have no difficulty in recognising where his constituency ends and his colleague's constituency begins.</P>
    <P>These are the principles upon which I worked and I think that I have made a very sound division of the city.  Some attempt has been made to suggest that in dealing with No. 9 area I have had regard to class distinction.  If I were criticising openly and publicly, as I have criticised to myself privately, the No. 9 area, it would be on this ground, that though it has a population of 60,000, nevertheless it has been given a representation of only five in the Dublin Corporation, but that happens to arise from the fact that it was not possible, bearing in mind the need to get readily identifiable natural boundaries, boundaries which are likely to be permanent, to find any other division than that which I have chosen, and there is this further consideration, that in the course of time the population of No. 9 area is likely to fall, and to approximate much more closely to that of the other electoral areas.</P>
    <P>Wherever you find an anomaly, a certain discrepancy between one area and another, as you may, because I could <Col N="2233" /> not control the course of the Liffey and I did not make the canal or build the East Wall or any other roads I chose as boundaries, wherever you find, say, an apparent discrepancy as between the populations of electoral area No. 5 and electoral area No. 6, you have to remember that by the mere execution of the Dublin Corporation's building programme, in the course of which you take people out of area No. 6 and settle them, as you are doing, in area No. 5, the balance, within a very few years, will be redressed and the apparent discrepancy which exists at the moment will not exist for very long.</P>
    <P>These are the lines upon which I have worked.  I think I have done a very good job. I have not left out of my mind any one consideration which, I am certain, would have been present to the minds of Deputy O'Sullivan or Deputy Doyle, if they had the responsibility, and I have, I think, provided units which are not only fair from the point of view of the people but convenient from the point of view of the people's representatives.</P>
    <P>Some suggestion has been made here that the work which has been done has caused a great deal of dislocation in the preparation of the register, that it is likely to occasion a certain amount of delay and to defer for longer than was normally the case the date on which the persons who are going to be candidates would get advance copies of the register.  I can assure Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Doyle that there is no foundation for that statement. On the contrary, the preparation of the register is much further advanced than it has been at any time over the past number of years.  I am told that the whole register, rearranged on the basis of the new electoral areas, will be with the printers at the end of this week.  Over half of the register is in proof and about one-fifth of it has been returned for final printing, and proofs are being pressed without delay. The delivery of printed copies of the register may be expected by an early date.  The register on the basis of the new electoral areas will be available for anyone who wants it much earlier than normally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2234" /> The other point made was with regard to the revision of polling districts. These changes have not made such a lot of difference in the relationship which should exist between the electoral areas and polling places under the existing polling scheme.  I think there are only about 31 places where any adjustment may have to be made.  I am pressing to get the new polling schemes prepared, but if it should appear that, notwithstanding all the efforts now being made, there may be any difficulties about a new scheme, I have power by Order to make existing polling districts the polling districts for the new election, and, if any polling district is divided by an area, each part can be made a separate polling district.  That will get over any difficulty which may arise in relation to the polling districts, but the fact of the matter is that the number of adjustments which have to be made are so few by comparison with the adjustments which had to be made for 1942, 1943 and 1944, that I do not think any difficulty need be anticipated at this stage.  If any difficulty should arise, I have full power, I think, to resolve it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the amount of labour, and so on, which is occasioned in connection with these adjustments in advising electors of the changes in their polling areas?  If there were time to do all that, I would agree with the Minister, but our main difficulty is the shortness of the time, and, notwithstanding all the Minister says about the register, having regard to the drastic changes being made, it is a big job and cannot be done in the time to the satisfaction of everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is speaking on behalf of those who may be candidates at these elections, I do not want him to regard me as being unsympathetic.  I am not, but I do not think that any of the difficulties mentioned are likely to arise.  So far as the vast bulk of the electors are concerned, they will vote in exactly the same places as those in which they voted before.  If it is found that the polling scheme will interfere unduly <Col N="2235" /> with the accustomed habits of the electors in that regard, I have power to ensure that they will vote at their old polling places, even though they may vote there for the purpose of the election in the new electoral areas, and there is nothing I can do to lessen even the slight inconvenience that may be occasioned that will not be done.</P>
      <P>There is another point in regard to which Deputy O'Sullivan seemed to be under a misapprehension.  He spoke rather pathetically about the aged citizen who finds that his honoured and revered representative is no longer going to stand for a particular area. The electoral divisions, as I emphasised earlier in the evening, do not impose any disqualification on any intending candidate.  If his existing area has been divided, all he will have to do is to satisfy himself as to the fraction of his former area in which he has the greatest amount of support.  There are few members of the corporation in the happy position of Deputy O'Sullivan or Deputy Doyle of drawing their support from a widespread constituency. Most members of the corporation get their suffrages within fairly limited and well-defined areas.  A candidate can say: &ldquo;That is where I get my main support and that is the electoral area I am going to stand for.&rdquo;  He can stand for that area and his aged supporter can still go to the poll and vote for her favourite citizen in exactly the same way as she voted prior to the introduction of the new scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These disadvantages and inconveniences are, I suggest, almost entirely fanciful.  They have arisen from the fact that, like most changes, they disturb the existing tenor of our ways.  We want to go on in the old accustomed groove.  Even the members of the Dublin Corporation satisfied themselves several years ago that they could no longer continue with the existing areas, and when they asked me to make a change, I made the change.  The moment a change is made everybody sits up with a jolt and begins to think that the change could only be made to his disadvantage. On the contrary, this change is going to improve matters, to bring members <Col N="2236" /> of the Dublin Corporation into closer touch with their constituents.  It will mean that there are now nine areas in which men who aspire to public life can become candidates.  They are much more convenient areas than those which existed heretofore.  They are of convenient size, they are smaller, and more compact, and are well defined.  People can stand now as candidates in them and can build up, if they want to, a certain local influence which may lead from municipal to national affairs.  For that reason, I think the whole arrangement is a good one.  That is why I have made it, and I ask the House, if Deputy Martin O'Sullivan puts his resolution to a division, to reject it.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to enter deeply into the discussion on this, because I am not familiar with the position in Dublin.

I want to call his attention to the position in towns like Wexford, Kilkenny, Clonmel, Sligo and Drogheda.</P>

      <P>In these towns there are 12 members to be elected in the one area.  On the last occasion, in Wexford, 36 candidates offered themselves. In these towns they also have elections for the county council on the same day.  On the last occasion in the area which takes in Wexford there were seven members to be elected to the county council.  As well as I remember, the number of candidates who offered themselves was 22, so that with the <Col N="2237" /> borough candidates you had a total of 58 candidates.  This time we are going to have a Presidential election as well. If the Minister is going to be consistent, I think he should extend some of his anxiety to the electors in these towns.</P>

      <P>I say that because the position as regards the electors will not nearly be as bad in Dublin as in the towns I have mentioned.  The task of the electors in these towns is going to be a colossal one, where they will have on one ballot paper the names of 36 candidates, to elect 12 members, and on another the names of 22 candidates, to elect seven members, and on top of all that a Presidential election.  The position in Dublin cannot nearly be as bad as that.  I should say that it is comparatively simple when you compare it with the task that confronts the electors in Wexford, Kilkenny, Clonmel, Sligo and Drogheda.  To a lesser extent the same position will apply in Enniscorthy and New Ross where nine members have to be elected, with also, on the same day, a county council election and a Presidential election.  In view of that situation there is bound to be confusion. In my opinion the task of the Dublin electors is a very easy one compared to that which will face the electors in those provincial towns.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I want, if possible, to disabuse the Minister of the idea that personal considerations of any sort influenced either Deputy Doyle or myself in bringing this forward.  Our personal position so far as the corporation is concerned, or any consideration affecting the city members of the corporation, had nothing whatever to say to it.  The motion emanated from a discussion in the city council where it was decided to make the most effective protest that we could possibly make in connection with the new areas set forth.  Deputy Corish has dealt admirably with some of the points which I had intended to refer to.  The Minister says he cannot accede to my request for a postponement of the Order to allow two members to be added to each of the five existing <Col N="2238" /> areas.  Take the position in my own area where there are eight city members at the present time.  The fact that there might be two more members added would not influence, to any considerable degree, the number of candidates who might come forward in that area.  Since 1930, in that area, we have had an excellent team of candidates so far as numbers are concerned, and the electors apparently have never had any difficulty in marking their ballot papers to elect at least eight candidates.  The Minister omitted to make any reference to the point which centres round the motion, namely, that an appeal was made to him from the corporation for a reconsideration of the position.  We pointed out that we were actuated by the idea that any recasting that took place, should take into consideration the assimilation of the areas as between Parliamentary and local.  I quoted instances where that might usefully be done.</P>
      <P>What the Minister has now done under this Order is to make the position impossible.  His proposal leaves the position worse than it was, because there is no link between the Parliamentary constituencies to be and the municipal areas that we have.  In the case of the No. 9 area, even the Liffey was not taken into consideration as a natural boundary.  That new No. 9 area runs right from O'Connell Street to Westmoreland Street, Grafton Street and so on.  It cuts right across two Parliamentary areas.  The same thing may be said of other areas. Therefore, the main request of the corporation has not been given effect to so far as the Bill is concerned.  In fact, the position as compared with January, 1944, when we sent forward the proposal, is very much worse than it was under the orders now promulgated by the Minister.  Because of that, and because of the fact that the Minister is not prepared to accept the very reasonable suggestions that we have thrown out for the purposes of the coming election&mdash;that the existing areas should stand with the addition of ten members&mdash;I shall have to ask the House to divide on the motion.</P>

      <P>On the last occasion I was dealing with Deputy Dillon's speech and I tried to deal with any points that were raised as I went along.  The Deputy spoke about the riot in Mountjoy Jail and asked if I proposed to hold an inquiry.  I do not propose to do any such thing.  I think that riot was due to the action of a small gang of very troublesome people.  They have been dealt with and I think that is sufficient.  He also asked me about the case in Monaghan and whether any inquiry would be held about that I think it was Deputy Coogan suggested that a man should not be put in jeopardy twice.  There was a question as to whether there should be a disciplinary inquiry as to the charges made in court against the Guards or whether there should be legal proceedings. Proceedings were taken against the two Guards; they were acquitted, and I do not propose to go any further.  I think the case was dealt with all right.  The question of the discipline of the Gárda has been raised.  Several Deputies spoke about that.  Generally speaking, I think the discipline of the Gárda is quite good. There may be a little slackening, due to the fact, as Deputy Coogan pointed out, that transport facilities are not quite as good as they were and inspections are not as frequent.  But, generally speaking, I think the discipline is all that can be expected.  A year very seldom goes by without some disciplinary action having to be taken against some Gárda, but in a big body like the Gárda that is only natural.  I think they are in no way abnormal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon also spoke about recruitment to the prison service and suggested that there should be a sort of cadet system.  If suitable candidates cannot be found amongst the staffs of the prisons for the post of governor the question of getting somebody suitable from outside could be taken up.  I do not agree that warders do not sometimes make good governors.  I met some of them when I happened to be in prison and they are quite good governors.  There was one man in Cork who made a very <Col N="2242" /> good governor.  On the other hand, it may be that the type of man you would want for a governor may not be in the prison service and in that case we will have to get outsiders.  I would not, however, commit myself to any such system as suggested.  As to recruitment to the Gárda, which was referred to by Dr. Brennan and others, I think I dealt with that satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell spoke about the question of dealing with tinkers. Tinkers are a nuisance but they are not so numerous; there are about 5,000 of them.  It is very hard to know what to do about them and I must say that I have no proposal to make. They give trouble in some areas, but I do not think they are a very big problem yet.  The police have instructions to pay special attention to them. I must admit, however, that I have no proposals for dealing with them. Then the question of clinics for youthful offenders was referred to.  I think there will be something done about that in connection with the Mental Hospitals Bill which was passed recently in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan had quite a lot of suggestions to make about the reorganisation of the Gárda.  I dealt with that question last night and I do not think I need go into it again.  I am satisfied that the present system is as good as you can get.  The question of a mechanised force was advocated several times, but I do not think it would fill the bill.  The Deputy also spoke about discipline in the Guards with which I have dealt.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan also dealt with the question of the detection of crime and asked what the figures were.  He said that I did not mention that in my introductory statement.  I have some figures here about it.  Taking the year 1938, the latest year for which comparable figures for both Great Britain and Ireland are available, the percentage of detections over the whole State was 64 per cent. against 48 per cent. in England and Wales.  The percentage over the Dublin metropolitan area was 43; that is very low, but it was 27 in the London metropolitan area; whether they are comparable <Col N="2243" /> I do not know.  In 1944, the percentage of detections was 55 for the country as a whole and in the metropolitan area 32.  The indicatable crime figure for 1944 was 53 per 10,000 of the population.  These figures compared very favourably with Great Britain.  I hope that I have given all the information that the Deputy required.  The Deputy also dealt with police being engaged on other work than the prevention of crime.  That has been dealt with already.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon dealt with the question of having juries of seven, and I think Deputy Costello said it was the thin end of the wedge for doing away with the jury system.  The principal reason for that system was, I think, that we were asked to have jurymen drawn from a smaller area in order to allow people from country places to get home.  Then, in order to get juries, naturally there had to be fewer jurymen.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins said that the Guards were uneconomic, and many Deputies took up the idea of changing the system and not having the Guards doing any work expect police work.  I do not think that would work at all.  Deputy Larkin advocated legal aid for the poor.  I will have that question examined and see what can be done about it, because it is a very difficult one; it is full of difficulties. Deputy Dillon said that the State should pay the costs where the defence was successful in criminal charges. That is another question that will have to be gone into and I am not prepared to deal with it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2244" /> Deputy O'Higgins said things about the removal of sergeants which I think were most unfair.  He said that representations were made about the removal of a certain sergeant in his constituency and that the demand was met.  I explained to Deputy O'Higgins the reason for that removal and I want to make it clear that it was not due to any interference by me.  The fact is that this sergeant had his family grown up and gone away and he had a big house, while there was a sergeant in another district who had a small house and a big family.  It was in the interests of the other sergeant that it was decided to change him.  There was no other reason for it, none whatever, and I told Deputy O'Higgins that, and he knows that as well as I do.  Still, he wished to bring that up yesterday, saying that there was political interference, because his colleague from the same constituency insinuated that I was being influenced, being one of the political bosses of my Party, that it was thought I could have cases with drawn and Guards shifted.  I absolutely deny that.  It is not true.  But in order to try to give some colour to that, Deputy O'Higgins mentioned this case about the sergeant, knowing as well as I do that the sergeant was shifted for the reason I have mentioned. As a matter of fact, due to representations made to me by Deputy O'Higgins and others on behalf of that sergeant, his transfer was delayed. Any representations made to me were on behalf of the sergeant and not against him.  I think it is a shame that the principal member of the Opposition should give an impression that that sort of thing happens.</P>
    <P>In regard to Deputy Davin, I do not know the person to whom he refers, but it is absolutely untrue that anybody ever asked me or ever tried to use the political organisation of which I have been secretary since its inception, to get me as Minister for Justice to have any case quashed or any Guard shifted.  I have never been asked to have trials stopped.  I do admit that I am asked to have Guards shifted.  Deputies on all sides have been doing that and I have a standard reply for them.  I am sure that, if <Col N="2245" /> Deputies who have ever written to me about that would compare the replies, they will find they all say that it is not a matter for me but that I am sending it to the Commissioner.  It is too bad if Deputies keep repeating these statements, throwing mud, in an attempt to discredit the whole administration of justice.  I was really surprised that Deputy O'Higgins should fire that shot before he left the House last night.  He walked out immediately afterwards.</P>
    <P>Deputy M. O'Sullivan asked about the recognition of gallantry.  I am sorry to say that the scheme has not been finally approved yet.  It is before the Government and I hope to have an announcement made shortly.  These things require a lot of investigation, and I am not in a position to say what award will be made, but I hope to have the matter cleared up very soon. There is the question of the people who would make the awards, and things of that kind, to be settled yet.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin made a suggestion about the people in Portlaoighise. These people are refusing to carry out the rules and I am not prepared to change my attitude in that matter one iota.  The crimes for which these people have been put there are very serious indeed and, as far as discrimination is alleged, I am personally responsible for that.  I have the right to say to which prison a man should be sent to serve a sentence, and I am taking full personal responsibility for saying that the people who commit these crimes shall go to Portlaoighise. As long as I am Minister, I am not going to let a little gang like that break up the prison discipline.  That is my attitude.  I am most anxious for an end to all this and, whenever anyone gives an indication that there will be an end, and that nobody will claim the right to take life, whether of a civilian, of a member of their own organisation or particularly of a Guard, there will be time to consider that question.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of those interned, I would be anxious to have them all out.  We are coming near the hard core I spoke of last year and I think there is something satisfactory about that.  I do not know what we will do.  We must be very careful not <Col N="2246" /> to let people out, to take the lives of other people.  We simply cannot do it.  Even if our powers of internment expire, we will have to consider some means of dealing with this thing, which has gone on top long and which has got to stop.  We were soft enough.  If any blame is put on us, it is that we made too many attempts to be concilatory. It has to be put down and is going to be kept down until there is a firm undertaking that this thing will cease.</P>
    <P>In regard to gang warefare, which a Deputy mentioned, we have no report about the incident which he referred to.  I am having the whole question examined by the Commissioner and the inspector in charge in Dublin.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in the Civil Service is that, on retirement, a civil servant gets a year's salary, but gets only half his salary.  When he got two-thirds of his pension he got no capital sum.  A Gárda gets two-thirds and therefore his pension is two-thirds. I do not see any possibility of getting the Minister for Finance to agree to give better pension terms for the Guards than have been given. Of course, if they are prepared to take the half-salary, it might be considered.</P>

      <P>There was one matter I overlooked when I was speaking&mdash;the question of women police.  Will the Minister say how many women police are employed, what their duties are, if they are satisfactorily performed and if there is any necessity for an increase in the number or the duties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only four actually employed and they are mostly, I believe, dealing with shop-lifting offences.  I see no need to increase the number and I do not think there is any case for it.  I have been asked about it by a lady in Cork on behalf of some society down there, and I was asked only last Saturday by a deputation from Dublin.  I will have the matter examined, but at present I am not inclined to increase the number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2247" /> Someone asked about probation officers.  The question was raised several times in regard to places like Cork and Dundalk.  The St. Vincent de Paul Society or some such society can apply to be recognised and, if recognised, gets a grant to enable it to employ people to act as probation officers for them.  That system has worked very well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be much better to appoint permanent district justices for the ordinary tenure?  There is a danger, if there are temporary justices on the bench&mdash;some of them are perfect and some are imperfect&mdash;of the impression spreading abroad amongst temporary justices that, if they do not work in the way the Minister likes, they may not be continued.  That would leave the way open to the worst kind of abuse in the judiciary.  I would be glad if the Minister would say that his object is to appoint on ordinary terms of tenure three, four or five permanent district justices, whom he would use for sending round on holiday or sick duty, rather than be perennially appointing temporary ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do agree, and I said so in answer to Deputy Costello some time ago, that it is most undesirable to have temporary district justices or temporary Circuit Court judges.  Unfortunately, the difficulty is that at the moment we have the maximum number permitted by law, and it would need an amendment of the law to enable us to appoint more.  If it were thought that this increase in crime would continue, I certainly would agree to ask the Dáil to give the Government power <Col N="2248" /> to appoint more; but we are hoping it will not be necessary.  Naturally, I cannot do anything I want in these matters.  We have to convince the Government and the Minister for Finance that this is necessary.</P>

      <P>On these agreements. The Chair will have to regulate the rest.  The two international agreements covered by these motions are so closely related as to form virtually but one single arrangement and it is as such that I am asking the Dáil to approve of them.</P>
      <P>The first, the interim agreement, is intended to cover the period that must elapse before the permanent arrangement provided for by the convention can come into force.</P>
      <P>These agreements have resulted from the deliberations of the International Civil Aviation Conference, held in Chicago in November and December last, at which 54 nations, including Ireland, were represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both the interim agreement and the convention have already been signed on behalf of the Government.  What is now desired is the approval of the Dáil so that the Government of the United States may be formally notified that our signature constitutes formal acceptance of the interim agreement, and so that the further steps for the <Col N="2254" /> ratification of the permanent convention may be taken.</P>
    <P>Up to yesterday the interim agreement has been signed by 42 States, and formally accepted by five of these States.  The convention has been signed by 39 States, but has not yet been formally ratified by any.  Both the agreement and the convention require the definitive confirmation of 26 States to bring them into operation. The texts of these agreements have already been circulated.</P>
    <P>As civil aviation is within the province of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and as officers and experts of his Department have taken a major part in the negotiations which led to these agreements, I will now hand over to him the task of detailed explanation.</P>

      <P>The invitation which was received from the Government of the United States to participate in an International Civil Aviation Conference intimated that the matters for discussion would include the establishment of provisional world route arrangement and matters connected therewith, the establishment of an interim council, and discussion on the principles to be followed in setting up a permanent aeronautical body and a multilateral convention dealing with air transport, air navigation and aviation technical subjects.</P>
      <P>It was intimated that the invitation had been extended by the Government of the United States to all members of the united nations and nations associated with them during the war and to European and Asiatic neutral States.  As the Taoiseach stated, 54 nations were represented at the conference.  The Government decided that the invitation should be accepted. Our interests in the development of civil aviation in the North Atlantic area made that decision inevitable and, in fact, we gladly welcomed the opportunity of contacting the representatives of other nations similarly interested and we welcomed also the prospect of the development of civil aviation being regulated and assisted by international agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two documents covered by the <Col N="2255" /> resolutions before the Dáil are the Interim Agreement on International Civil Aviation and the Convention on International Civil Aviation.  Other documents relating to the future of civil aviation were also drawn up and I shall make some reference to them later.  The documents which are referred to in the resolutions before the Dáil were, however, the main instruments resulting from the conference.  I do not propose to review in detail the provisions of the agreement or of the convention.  They have been circulated to Deputies and presumably have been studied by them.</P>

      <P>The interim agreement provisions differ from those of the convention only in so far as arises from their temporary and interim character. The principles enunciated and the organisations set up are essentially the same.  I propose to confine my remarks in explanation of the convention to the provisions which might be regarded as of special interest to this country, or as having a bearing upon our present practice or legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Chapter 1 of the convention states certain important principles relating to the sovereignty of the air.  It defines State territory for the purposes of the convention; provides for the proper use of civil aviation; and limits the convention to civil aircraft only. Chapter 2 states the conditions governing flight over the territories of contracting States.  Aircraft engaged upon non-scheduled flights are given general permission to fly into and across national territories without prior permission. They are given permission to make stops for non-traffic purposes. Scheduled air services, however, will require special authorisations.  The right of internal transport is reserved to each State, and that right cannot be granted to another State on an exclusive basis.  The right to declare prohibited areas is protected.  Aircraft may be required to land on or take off from designated customs airports.  Airport and similar charges are to be applied on a non-discriminatory basis, <Col N="2256" /> such charges being subject to review by the council set up under chapter 9 of the convention.</P>
    <P>Chapter 4 deals with measures to facilitate air navigation, including the application so far as practicable of customs, immigration and general air navigation procedures in accordance with the standards and practices established or recommended under the convention from time to time.  It provides for the exemption of aircraft engaged in international transport from customs duties, and makes provision concerning measures of assistance to aircraft in distress, as well as provision-for the investigation of accidents. Chapter 7 in Part II of the convention sets up an international organisation. The organisation is made up of an assembly, a council, and such other bodies as may be necessary.  It is provided that the first meeting of the assembly will take place as soon as the convention comes into force.  The permanent seat of the organisation remains unsettled until the end of the interim period.</P>
    <P>Chapter 8 deals with the meetings of the assembly, and with its powers, duties and system of voting.  It is provided that all contracting States shall have equal right to be represented at meetings and that each State shall have one vote.  It is further provided that a majority of the contracting States constitutes a quorum and that decisions of the assembly will be taken by a majority of the votes cast. Chapter 9 deals with the composition, functions and election of the council as well as its president and system of voting. The council consists of 21 States elected by the assembly for a period of three years.  In the election, the assembly is required to give adequate representation to States of chief importance in air transport, States making the largest contribution to the provision of facilities for international aviation and States of major geographical importance.  Decisions by the council require the approval of the majority of its members.  It is provided that any contracting State may participate in the council on any question which especially affects its interests.</P>
    <P>Chapter 13 provides that the organisation <Col N="2257" /> may enter into appropriate arrangements with any general world security organisation, or with other international bodies.  Chapter 15 deals with airports and other air navigation facilities, and provides for the council promoting the improvement of air navigation facilities and making arrangements with a contracting State, if the State should so desire, for the financing of new facilities and improvements. Chapter 16 permits joint operating organisations between contracting States and empowers the council to suggest the formation of such organisations to States.  Chapter 17 requires States to denounce the Paris Convention or the Habana Convention, as the case may be, upon the coming into force of the Chicago Convention, and also requires the registration of all aeronautical agreements then existing, as well as the abrogation of arrangements inconsistent with the convention.</P>
    <P>Chapter 19 states that, in case of war or national emergency, the provisions of the convention are not to affect the freedom of action of a contracting State, whether a belligerent or neutral.  Chapter 21 provides that the members of the United Nations and neutral States may adhere to the convention. Other States may be admitted to participation in the convention, subject to approval by any general international security organisation and on a four-fifths vote of the assembly; but it is provided that in each case the assent of any State invaded or attacked during the present war by the State seeking admission is necessary.</P>
    <P>The major differences between the new permanent convention and the Paris Convention of 1919, to which this country is at present a party, are the constitution of a council as well as an assembly, the inclusion of certain matters relating to air transport within the province of the new organisation, the specific power given the organisation to enter into arrangements with other international bodies, including any world security organisation, and the establishment of and improvement of air navigation facilities by arrangement between a contracting State and the council under which the council provides the finance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2258" /> The necessity for international regulation of aircraft has always been recognised and the law of air navigation is based on international agreement. Aircraft, by reason of their speed and extensive range of operation, find no physical restriction in national boundaries.  It follows that whatever regulations might seem desirable should be by the common consent of nations.  A convention for the regulation of aerial navigation was drawn up in Paris in October, 1919, and this country has been and is a party to that convention.  In 1939, there were 32 States parties to the Paris Convention.  Of the States in the American Continent, only Canada, the Argentine and Peru were parties to the Paris Convention.</P>
    <P>In 1928, another convention dealing with civil aviation was drawn up at Habana and the United States and ten other States in Central and South America later ratified that convention. The assembly in Chicago of 54 nations, amongst them being almost all the signatories to the two existing conventions, provided an opportunity for the consideration of a single convention on civil aviation which could be observed in all continents.  The conference addressed itself, amongst other matters, to a revision of the public law of the air and to a re-drafting of the articles of the existing conventions in a form which made them acceptable to a greater number of States.</P>
    <P>The convention, which was drawn up at Chicago, is intended to replace-both the Paris and Habana conventions, so that on its entry into force international co-operation on civil aviation will be expressed in the one instrument.  In the documents before the House, there is little or no change in the basic principles contained in the Paris convention.  The already well-recognised principle of inter national law of the complete and exclusive sovereignty of each State over the air space of its territory is confirmed. In accepting these instruments, each State incurs certain rights and obligations in the belief that it is promoting, in the words of the Preamble to the Convention, &ldquo;that co-operation between nations and peoples <Col N="2259" /> upon which the peace of the world depends,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the development of international civil aviation in a safe and orderly manner.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At Chicago, for the first time, an international conference on civil aviation considered the possibility of settling the international regulation of air transport as distinct from air navigation.  Air transport might be defined as the aviation activity which is concerned with the carriage of passengers and cargoes for hire or reward.  Air navigation covers all other aspects of civil aviation activity. As might have been expected, the proposal to introduce the operation and economics of air transport into a code of international law raised many problems. After weeks of discussion of these problems it became clear that the necessary general agreement on measures to regulate international air transport was not forthcoming.  The convention, accordingly, deals almost entirely with air navigation.  It contains no provision on the contentious issues of the freedoms or privileges of the air, or on the adjustment of airline capacity to traffic offering or ancillary matters which were debated at Chicago.  While the differences which arose at the conference on air transport matters received most publicity, most valuable work was done on the air navigation side, and resulted in general agreement on the two documents which are now before the House.</P>
    <P>The new convention represents a considerable advance in the field of civil aviation.  It is to be completed by the attachment of technical annexes which, in themselves, constitute a considerable achievement.  The time available was too limited, however, to permit of carrying the technical discussions to a final conclusion, as the matters dealt with involved problems of great variety and complexity, and in many cases new ground was being broken.  There was general agreement that the largest possible degree of international standardisation of practice is important to safe, expeditious and easy air navigation.  Accordingly, the technical annexes, while shaped at the conference into final form, are to be <Col N="2260" /> regarded as drafts for immediate and continuing study by the States participating in the conference.  The final views of the States on the technical drafts are to be forwarded to the United States Government or to the Interim International Council, and it is expected that further meetings of the technical committees, to be held in this year, will produce the annexes in final form for attachment to the convention.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the privileges or, as they are commonly known, the freedoms of the air, the grant of some or all of which is a fundamental element of commercial air operation. These freedoms of the air have been defined under five headings: (1) the right to fly over another State's territory without landing; (2) the right to land for non-traffic purposes, for example, for purposes of refuelling; (3) the right to disembark traffic coming from the country of origin of the air craft; (4) the right to embark traffic destined for the country of origin of the aircraft, and (5) the right to convey traffic between intermediate countries outside the country of origin of the aircraft on an international air route.</P>
    <P>The mode of treatment of these freedoms of the air in the new convention gave rise to two major proposals.  One viewpoint, of which the United Kingdom was the main protagonist, was that the new international organisation should be given powers of regulation over international air transport, powers which would include the determination of the maximum traffic capacity to be made available by countries operating on any particular international route, the distribution of that capacity between the countries concerned and the fixing of rates of carriage in relation to standards of speed and accommodation.  Traffic capacity may be defined as the amount of space available for the carriage of passengers, goods and mails.</P>
    <P>If there had been agreement to vest in the new international organisation that power of regulation of air transport, presumably the first four freedoms, as I have defined them&mdash;the right to fly over national territories, the right to land for non-traffic purposes, <Col N="2261" /> the rights to embark and disembark traffic to and from the country of origin of the aircraft&mdash;would have been included in the new convention, and it would have been proposed that the rights arising thereunder should be granted on a multilateral basis between the nations signing the convention, the fifth freedom&mdash;the right to convey traffic between intermediate countries on an international route&mdash;remaining for negotiation between the countries directly concerned.</P>
    <P>The other proposal, for which the United States was the main advocate, envisaged an international organisation alike in constitution but differing in its powers.  The proposal was for a purely consultative international organisation without powers of limitation upon air transport operation and for the multilateral grant of the first two freedoms only&mdash;that is, the right to fly over national territory and to make stops for non-traffic purposes&mdash;the grant of the other freedoms of the air to be a matter for bilateral negotiation between the nations concerned.  The ebb and flow of the discussions at Chicago saw modifications accepted in both proposals but ultimately there still remained a difference which was basic enough to prevent reconciliation of the conflicting proposals.  As I have stated, the convention, the multilateral instrument which was finally agreed and which we are now asking the Dáil to ratify, does not include provisions covering the five freedoms and commercial operation, so that the position which obtained under the Paris Convention still exists, namely, the prior authorisation of each State is necessary before a regular international air service may be operated.</P>

      <P>In the course of the conference it became clear that a number of nations were prepared to subscribe to a multi-lateral instrument granting the first two freedoms and that a smaller number of nations were prepared to agree to a similar multi-lateral grant of all five freedoms.  Independently of the convention and of the interim agreement on civil aviation, two other documents were drawn up and were opened for signature at the conclusion of the conference at Chicago. The first of these documents was called the International Air Services Transit Agreement, providing for the multi-lateral grant between the signatories of the first two freedoms, that is to say, the right of transit over national territories and of making non-traffic stops, and the second document was called the International Air Transport Agreement, providing for the multi-lateral grant of the five freedoms, that is to say, transit and full traffic rights.  Thirty-four States have signed the former document and 22 States the latter document.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy cannot expect me to express an opinion on <Col N="2263" /> that subject.  After careful examination of this country's position in relation to these two agreements, it was decided that the Irish delegation should not sign these agreements.  It will be appreciated that the rights granted under the &ldquo;two freedoms&rdquo; document, the right of transport over national territory and the right to make non-traffic stops, are of vital importance to this country and involve implications as serious as would the grant of the traffic rights covered by the other document which provides for the multi-lateral concession of all five freedoms.  If the transit agreement were signed by this country, then air services could be operated freely over our territory by any of the other signatory countries.  The United Kingdom and the United States are amongst the signatories.  International air transport operators, in the present stage of aeronautical development, have a major interest in obtaining transit and non-traffic rights in this country because of our geographical position and our importance to operators over the Atlantic route, the route which, it is confidently expected, will be the blue ribbon route of air transport, as it is in the case of shipping.  There are alternative routes across the North Atlantic, but the shortest route from the great centres of population, like New York, on the western continent, passes within a few miles of the River Shannon and of the Shannon airport on the way to the major centres of population in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While our participation in air transport operation over the Atlantic is contemplated at some stage, we have not at present the same degree of interest in advancing our rights as operators as we have in establishing our interests as air transport facility-providers and in considering the signature of the two documents, the paramount factor was the effect of our action on the future of the Shannon airport.  The Government was satisfied that our interests would best be served by maintaining our liberty of action in so far as the grant of the freedoms of the air was concerned. That attitude does not mean that the Government is adopting a restrictive <Col N="2264" /> policy.  On the contrary, the Government is quite willing to negotiate with the countries interested the grant of the necessary' freedoms through bi-lateral agreements, and the agreement recently concluded with the United States exemplifies our policy in that respect.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the agreement with the United States, it may be well to state very briefly that our policy regarding the Shannon airport is to ensure its inclusion in the main transatlantic route and on a basis securing the maximum traffic at the airport.  It may be anticipated that there will be an inducement to operate connecting services between points not directly served by the trunk-line aircraft and the Irish airport on the west coast of Europe.  The establishment of the Shannon airport connotes not only the provision of first-class airfield facilities, which include long runways and extensive buildings, but also the organisation and maintenance of first-class ancillary services providing adequate assistance for the navigation of aircraft. These services are, air traffic control, meteorological and radio communication, and it is fully appreciated that the standard of these services as well as of the airfield facilities must be at least as high as in the other countries concerned in the Atlantic route.  A point of basic interest is the degree of operational importance of the Shannon airport on the transatlantic route.  Of all forms of transportation the aeroplane is the most sensitive to gross weight; that is to say, the combined weight of fuel, revenue load, and the weight of the aircraft itself which constitute the gross weight to be carried.  The longer the flight, the greater the amount of fuel which must be carried and the less the revenue load capacity remaining.  The vice-chairman of the U.S.A. Civil Aeronautical Board, Mr. Edward Warner, has analysed long-range operations under specified conditions and has stated his conclusion that &ldquo;the practically desirable distance between stops where economy is a factor of major importance would appear to range from 700 to 1,250 miles.&rdquo;  Another U.S.A. study recently issued entitled <i>The Geography of <Col N="2265" /> World Air Transport,</i> by J. Parker van Zandt, shows that the optimum non-stop lenght of flight for maximum economy of operation is not likely to exceed 1,700 miles for some years to come.  For immediate post-war operations a non-stop range of well under 1,500 miles will probably be preferable. Beyond these ranges economic penalties accumulate rapidly for the type of transport equipment which is foreseen in the near future.  It is over 3,000 miles from New York to Ireland; the distance between Newfoundland and this country is 2,000 miles, so that the use of the Irish airport would appear to be a vital element in the economy of transatlantic airline operation. London and Paris are respectively 400 and 600 miles flying distance from the Shannon airport and the conclusion is obvious that the operation of express services non-stop to such points could only be carried out at high cost which the ordinary customer would not be disposed to pay in return for the small saving of time involved.</P>
    <P>Aircraft can, of course, be designed to fly almost any distance.  It is also possible that the conception of economic flight distances will have to be revised when radically new developments such as flying wings and jet-propulsion become commonplace.  While, however, the present type of aircraft remain standard, a lower operating cost is likely to be reached by designing for non-stop flights of considerably under, rather than over, 2,000 miles.  So far as is known, all the aircraft contemplated by prospective Atlantic operations are of the present standard type.</P>
    <P>The agenda of the Chicago Conference contained, as well as the permanent convention, the more immediate question of the grant of operating rights to enable commercial air services to be developed throughout the world as soon as the course of military events made that possible.  It was recognised that civilian air transport systems could bring aid to needy countries and hasten the return of normal trade and commerce.  At the same time, it was felt that there should be as great a measure of uniformity as possible in any agreements that may be made between States for the operation of air services.  The conference <Col N="2266" /> drew up a set of standard clauses for incorporation in the bi-lateral agreements which would be entered into by States desiring to produce an early expansion of air transport.  These standard clauses are set out in the final act of the conference under the title &ldquo;Standard Form of Agreement for Provisional Air Routes&rdquo;, as a recommendation to the States attending the Chicago Conference.  It was, of course, left entirely open for States to add other clauses so long as they were not inconsistent with the standard clauses.</P>
    <P>While our delegation was in Chicago the United States indicated that they desired to negotiate a bi-lateral agreement with this country following the framework of the Chicago draft.  The Government authorised discussions between the two delegations on that basis and the eventual result was the agreement effected by an exchange of notes between this Government and the American Government of which copies have been circulated to Deputies.  Articles 1 to 9 of that agreement are based on the standard articles accepted by the Chicago Conference. They comprise general provisions relating to the technical competency of the air-carrier, non-discrimination in airport charges and operational facilities, application of national laws and regulations, nationality of operators, registration of the agreement with the Provisional Civil Aviation International Organisation, and the preservation of operating rights already granted.  Article 10 preserves the existing air navigation agreement with the United States except to the extent to which it is modified by the new agreement.  Article 11 provides for amendments of the agreement by mutual action.</P>
    <P>Article 1 and the Annex to which it refers are the provisions of major importance. Airlines of the United States are by the agreement granted full commercial rights of operation at the Shannon airport, and Irish air lines are accorded identical rights in the United States.  Where non-traffic stops are made by the aircraft of either party, the other party may require <Col N="2267" /> that aircraft making such stops will provide a commercial service reasonable in the circumstances.  The rights of traffic desiring to embark or disembark at the Shannon Airport are safeguarded by that provision.</P>
    <P>The routes which are specified in the Annex are from the United States to Ireland and countries beyond, <i>via</i> intermediate points and in both directions. That section must be read in conjunction with the statement made some months ago by the United States Civil Aeronautics Board as to the international air routes which they considered were desirable for post-war operations by United States carriers.</P>
    <P>Four routes over the North Atlantic were specified by the United States Civil Aeronautics Board.  Route 1 was from New York to Newfoundland or Labrador to Ireland and thence to London, Amsterdam and points beyond. Route 2 was from New York to Newfoundland or Labrador to Ireland and thence to Paris, Switzerland and points beyond.  Route 3 was from New York to Newfoundland or Labrador to Greenland and Iceland and thence to Scandinavia and Russia. Route 4 was from New York to Bermuda, to the Azores and Lisbon and points beyond.  An estimate made of the distribution of traffic flow over those routes shows that over 80 per cent. of the traffic is expected to travel on routes 1 and 2.  These are the official United States routes over the Atlantic. They may be modified to a minor extent in the course of hearings for operating certificates before the Civil Aeronautics Board, but so far as the interpretation of the agreement is concerned, it is clear that the routes covered in the Annex are routes 1 and 2, which I have defined.</P>
    <P>The clear determination of the routes involved is a matter of much importance in the interpretation of the provision in the Annex regarding landings at the Shannon airport.  It is agreed in the Annex that, in view of the long trans-oceanic flight and the still limited development of aeronautical science, all east-bound aircraft on the routes specified in the Annex shall stop <Col N="2268" /> at the Shannon airport as first European port of call, and all west-bound aircraft on the same routes shall stop at the airport also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister say that west-bound aircraft would stop here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Of the whole agreement and Annex, that provision gave rise to the most prolonged discussion when our representatives were negotiating with the United States representatives.  Before it was written into the final draft, it had been examined from every angle.  The Government considered its inclusion in the agreement to be of major importance, in view of our policy regarding the Shannon airport.</P>
      <P>Deputies may remember that a similar provision was included in the agreement regarding transatlantic air services made between the Irish, Canadian and British Governments at Ottawa, in December, 1935, and to which I will refer again later.  The text of that agreement reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Subject to force majeure, all east-bound aircraft on the transatlantic air service on the direct route shall stop at the Irish Free State airport as first European port of call and all west-bound aircraft on the direct route shall stop at the Irish Free State airport.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have already explained the considerations mentioned in the Annex of the new agreement of long flight and limited development.  The clear interpretation of the agreement is, accordingly, that United States aircraft flying over Irish territory in the course of transatlantic operation on certain routes, which must be assumed to be those officially specified by the United States authorities, will all land at the Shannon airport, either east-bound or west-bound.</P>

    <P>Although the agreement protects our rights as potential transport operators, the operation of transatlantic air services by this country would involve very large initial expense and for some time to come would require a subsidy.  As I have said, our right to operate them has, however, been <Col N="2269" /> fully safeguarded.  It is desirable that the operations of the Irish company should be expanded and, in present circumstances, it would seem that participation in connecting services to and from the Shannon airport is the most likely development.  The complete inability of the Irish company, in the circumstances of the past few years, to obtain aircraft of the type they require has necessarily restricted its expansion. It is hoped that conditions in the near future will alter that situation. At present, as well as operating the cross-Channel air services, Aer Lingus Teoranta also provide the traffic handling organisation at the Shannon airport in connection with certain services operated by the British Overseas Airways Corporation.</P>
    <P>The Dáil was informed in 1936 of the agreement to which I have referred, made with the Governments of the United Kingdom and Canada, in connection with transatlantic air services. That agreement envisaged the setting up of a joint operating company, in which each of the three countries&mdash; Canada, the United Kingdom and ourselves&mdash;would have an interest.  It was then contemplated that the joint company would take over operation of the North Atlantic air service as soon as certain experimental flying had been completed.  It seemed that this stage had been reached in 1939 but, unfortunately, efforts to have the company established and operating did not meet with success.  Conditions which arose during the war brought about changes in the relative operating positions of the countries concerned in the proposed joint company.  It became clear that there was no likelihood that proposals along the lines originally drawn up would be implemented and that agreement is inoperative.</P>

      <P>The joint operating company was never established.  The permit which was granted under that agreement to Imperial Airways, which has since been merged in the British Overseas Airways Corporation, to operate services in and out of this <Col N="2270" /> country on the Atlantic route, has been renewed on an annual basis up to date.  The agreement made with the Government of the United States is in no sense exclusive.  As I have stated earlier, our position is that we are ready and willing to enter into negotiations for bi-lateral agreements with any other countries which may desire to make such agreements with us.</P>
      <P>The main aims of our civil aviation policy in relation to Atlantic services are, I think, fully appreciated and approved by all members of the Dáil. They are, first, to ensure that we will obtain due advantage from our favourable geographical position on the main North Atlantic route, by the provision of first-class airport facilities, by participation in international agreements which have the effect of discouraging the possibility of non-commercial considerations preventing air transport operators availing of these facilities and by the conclusion of bi-lateral arrangements which will ensure their use.  Secondly, there is the provision of adequate air transport facilities, in which the Irish company will play an appropriate part, between an Irish airport and destinations across the Atlantic and in Western Europe, which will be suitable to the needs of our citizens.  The agreements concluded at Chicago are in line with these aims of policy, and, therefore, the Government recommends them to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to discuss to-day other aspects of civil aviation policy. Deputy Dillon inquired if all aspects would be open for discussion.  I have confined my observations to the agreements concluded at Chicago, and to matters affecting the operation of transatlantic air services.  I have not attempted to deal to-day with the development of internal air services or the development of services to Great Britain or to the Continent of Europe. These matters might be raised more appropriately on another occasion&mdash; for example, on the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce, in which certain expenditures and subsidies are provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These agreements which the Dáil is <Col N="2271" /> asked to ratify provide a general code of international law for air navigation purposes, and as our interests are undoubtedly served by the establishment of such a code by international agreement, it is clearly desirable that the Dáil should ratify these agreements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <P>I wish to say that the Minister's statement, as it developed, became quite satisfactory and has cleared the atmosphere very considerably. He has been, perhaps, brutally frank in indicating that the major part of our policy here is to sell to those people who can use it, the favourable geographical position that we have at the Shannon for aerial transport services.  I think it is a matter for congratulation that the United States Government have realised that they have something to get there that will be worth any money they pay for it.  When we consider that in the past the development of civil aviation has been tied up with the prestige of various countries and their security, and when we consider how much apparent disagreement and fighting for position that there has been among the various countries concerning aerial plans, I think it is a matter for congratulation that the number of countries that have been mentioned by the Minister has agreed to the convention that is now put before us and, arising out of that, that an agreement with the United States has actually been reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we saw that there was a conflict, let us say, between the British and the United States points of view with regard to what might be fundamental principles concerning the organisation of air transport in the future, and when we saw a certain amount of intemperate language used by the representatives of various countries in relation to what was going on, we might have been a little bit disturbed. When we saw a Commonwealth Air Transport Council set up to carry out exhaustive investigations into various routes that the countries in the British Commonwealth were interested in from the point of view of aerial <Col N="2272" /> development, and that we were not represented on that council, or could not get any information as to whether our Government knew anything about that council, naturally we were a bit disturbed as to what might be the relations, in matters concerning aviation, between ourselves and the British Government. I think the Minister's statement has cleared the situation to some extent, and it is gratifying to us to be able to place the interpretation on the Minister's statement that we feel we are able to place on it to-day.</P>
    <P>I can understand that many people would be interested in getting a rather realistic statement of what this country's interest is in the development of the air, but if the Minister confines the discussion here simply to saying that we are not yet quite clear as to what operational interests we are likely to develop, and if he asks us to consider these motions simply in the light of the Shannon airport and its place in the world of aviation, then I think we are quite satisfied to subscribe to these motions: but at the same time I think it would be of some interest to us if the Minister would indicate what expenditure he considers is likely to be undertaken in order to make the Shannon an airport equal to the requirements and to the standards of the countries that will be using it.  These countries, if we understand the Minister correctly, will be Great Britain, the United States and France.  It will, I think, require a very considerable development of the technical services at Foynes, the repair and maintenance and stores services there, if the Shannon is to hold the premier place that the Minister indicates it could hold on the blue ribbon route for air services.  It is a matter of importance for this country to know whether we will get back in actual economic benefit the money we are likely to have to put into the development, to a proper standard, of the Shannon airport.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Minister that the agreement that has been made with the United States is likely to be the pattern of the agreement we may make with France, on the one hand, and Great Britain on the other.  I would welcome a little more lifting of <Col N="2273" /> the curtain by the Minister as to what he hopes for, or what would be our natural normal policy in relation to agreements with Great Britain or with Canada.  When the Minister says that our operational business here will be participating in connecting services, I take it that the connecting services in which we would participate in an operational way will be services lying between ourselves and Great Britain, on the one hand, or ourselves and the Continent of Europe on the other. When he speaks of participating in connecting services, does he mean the running of separate Irish services from here to Great Britain, or from here to Europe, or does he contemplate the kind of participation in aerial transport that was contemplated by the 1935 agreement where, so far as I understand the Minister's references to it, it was possible that a company jointly composed of Canadian interests, Irish interests and British interests, might be formed for the purpose of running services that would connect Great Britain with this country and with Canada?</P>
    <P>The Minister may not be in a position to outline very much with regard to that, but I think it would be of help if we could have some information as to what the Minister's tendency is in the matter, because I take it this has been given a considerable amount of consideration.  When we read what the position is with regard to aviation in countries that are particularly interested in its development, the number of aeroplanes likely to be used in the operation of their air services in any particular year will be fairly limited.  The cost, which will be very high, the types of aeroplanes to be used and the training of pilots, ground staff and technicians are all matters of very great importance.  They are matters which can scarcely be brought to a very high state of development in a country with as few air services as we are likely to develop here.</P>
    <P>However, I want to express my satisfaction with the Minister's statement so far as it went, and to express satisfaction that he has removed some of the doubts we had when we could not get any information as to why we <Col N="2274" /> were not represented at the Commonwealth Air Council.  I take it that that is a matter arising entirely out of the emergency situation and that the spirit which dictated the making of the 1935 agreement with Great Britain and Canada in respect of the North Atlantic route still exists, that the economic, geographic and other interests that impelled the making of that agreement still remain and that, following the initiative taken in making the agreement with the United States, we may very shortly see other agreements of a similar or, at any rate, a suitable kind, which will put us in a clear and definite position in the aviation world, whether we look to the East or to the West.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given a very clear and comprehensive statement in respect of the proceedings at the conference in the United States and of his interpretation of the agreement with the United States, together with a brief survey of our position <i>vis-a-vis</i> the world point of view on the development of civil aviation.  I think our delegation in the United States had a very tough furrow to plough and that, in all the circumstances, they did pretty well, having regard to the difficulties which surrounded them, and I also think that the Government's decision that our delegation should not sign the two documents but rather endeavour to negotiate a bilateral agreement was the wisest in all the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are in a rather peculiar position in the matter of civil aviation and its development.  We are a very small country with 3,000,000 people under our jurisdiction, wedged in between two very powerful nations with very large populations, and, more than that, two nations with enormous financial resources and an enormous aeronatical potential, an aeronautical potential which is probably unrivalled in Europe to-day, especially because of the enormous strides which have been made in the development of aircraft as a result of the war over the past five or six years.  Consequently, in relation to these two great Powers, our possibilities of civil aviation development <Col N="2275" /> are bound to be dwarfed, and our range of activity bound to be circumscribed in a very considerable degree.</P>
    <P>We have, however, one big advantage, that is, the geographical position in which we are placed&mdash;between Europe, on the one hand, and the vast Continent of North America, on the other.  Our obvious strategy and policy &mdash;indeed our only ability&mdash;is to exploit that special position to the utmost.  I think the delegation and the Government have done that, so far as they possibly could, and it may well be said that they have got as much as they could out of the agreement, or out of whatever resources we had for sale or for bargain at this International Air Conference.  There is, I think, considerable satisfaction in the fact that carrier aircraft owned by United States lines which must stop here coming from America and going to America will give Foynes an international reputation, and will generally tend to enhance and exploit our advantages as a special point of location in air transit between the two worlds.</P>
    <P>There is, however, one weakness in this agreement.  It is its duration of one year.  That year is going to be a rather troublesome year in the international sense, and it might well pay the United States Government, or any other Government, to conclude an agreement with us, or with anybody else, for one year, because very little will be done in that year.  I do not say that unworthy motives were behind the agreement, but it might be that the United States Government were anxious to get in and make a preliminary agreement with us for a year during which there will be no effective activities of an aeronautical character between the two countries, and use the fact they got in on the ground floor this year as a means of jockeying for position at the end of the year in the hope of getting a more favoured position on the termination of the agreement.</P>
    <P>It probably was not possible for us, with only one salmon biting at the bait, <Col N="2276" /> to decide that we would not make the agreement unless it was of longer duration, but I think it is a point which must be borne in mind in putting a valuation on the agreement, and I should like the Minister to tell us whether any discussions took place as to the policy of the United States Government, on the one hand, and our Government, on the other, with regard to the operation of the agreement outside the one-year period provided for therein.</P>
    <P>Many people who take an intelligent interest in aerial development and who have an opportunity of discussing air development with folk whose task during the war has been to operate aircraft will develop the suspicion that we are probably on the threshold of an era of aeronautical development such as we have never experienced.  I have had the opportunity from time to time of discussing aeronautical development with folk who have been engaged in long-range flying in various parts of Europe and some of their stories of that development would stagger one.  As these are people well versed in air navigation and in the technique of aeronautical development, one is inclined to get the impression from them that we are reaching a stage at which distance will almost be annihilated by the plane, even the passenger-carrying plane.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the importance of Foynes.  It was a feat of endurance and of durability if an aircraft crossed the Atlantic safely 20 years ago.  Even perhaps, in more recent times, a speedy flight across the Atlantic was regarded as an achievement worthy of mention in the world Press.  But, nowadays, particularly during the past few years, fleets of bombers have been flown across the Atlantic, so that, in fact, the Atlantic is like Charing Cross from the point of view of air traffic.</P>
    <P>I do not think we have reached the limit in respect of the mechanical and scientific development of aircraft.  My belief&mdash;it may be an inexperienced fear based on the ordinary observation of developments and with such information as one can get from experienced persons on these matters&mdash;is that we are rapidly reaching a stage in which Foynes may not have the value which <Col N="2277" /> it has to-day, and that all aircraft flying from the United States will probably prefer to land where its main cargo of passengers desire to go, namely, to the large centres of population in Britain or on the Continent.</P>
    <P>If planes can travel safely from Labrador or Newfouldland to Foynes, it would be no great aeronautical development to get them to fly another 400 miles to London, or 200 miles further on to Paris, with the advantage of a non-stop at Foynes, a non-stop at London, and with no necessity for a change of route.  My fear of the whole matter is, that while I hope Foynes will endure as an important airport for this country, that development in aircraft will be such that no matter what we try to do, and no matter how we try to exploit Foynes, the scientific and mechanical developments in aircraft will be such that they will probably by-pass Foynes and probably lessen the value which Foynes had in the pre-war world, which it probably had in the war-time world, and which it may now have for a short period until scientific development renders its value less than it is to-day.</P>
    <P>The Minister confined his remarks, in the main, to interpreting the agreement with the United States, and to reviewing the proceedings at the Chicago Conference.  I understand that he expressed the desire that the development of air services generally should be discussed on his Vote later. I wonder, in connection with the American agreement, can the Minister give us any idea as to whether within the period of the currency of this agreement it is contemplated to purchase aircraft for operation between Foynes and the United States, because when the agreement ceases to exist we have got to negotiate an agreement with the United States before we can fly aircraft to that country?  Is it contemplated to purchase flying aircraft for use from here to the United States within the period of this agreement, or is it contemplated at this stage to purchase aircraft for use from Foynes or whatever other connecting centres may be established arising out of the use of the North Atlantic route and the stopping of American aircraft <Col N="2278" /> at Foynes, or does the Minister contemplate any kind of link between Aer Lingus and a company established to operate a scheme of aircraft between the United States and here?</P>
    <P>I would like if the Minister could tell us generally what is the Government's policy in respect of the utilisation of our air possibilities, such as they may be.  I gathered from portions of the Minister's speech that he thought at the moment that our best policy was to sell Foynes and the possibilities which Foynes offers and to allow our development of our actual air services to await, perhaps, more favourable times or the growth of events.  I would like to know if the Government contemplate any aeronautical development which may result in an Irish air service operating between Foynes and the United States as a separate company, or does it contemplate any kind of link-up between an air company here and a United States company.  Does it contemplate establishing an Irish company which may operate a service between Foynes and such other centres of traffic which it might be desired either by ourselves or by the United States services to fly aircraft over?  I realise that in the circumstances confronting ourselves, and the delegation, that the Government had a particularly unenviable task.  I think that in the circumstances they have done pretty well.  I think that, at this stage, it would be rather premature to put a value on the agreement, particularly in view of its short duration.  The Minister may tell us, if it is not unwise to do that in a public Assembly at this stage, what the Government contemplates is likely to be the development when this agreement with the United States expires.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two motions on the Order Paper.  One deals with international civil aviation.  So far as that document is concerned, we had no alternative but to subscribe to it. No one gave a straw whether we liked it or not.  We had to do the best we could.  Of course, it would have been folly for us to disassociate ourselves from it.  It is a vague document, manifectly a document that will not long <Col N="2279" /> survive in its present form as soon as the big aeronautical powers have reached some sort of <i>modus vivendi.</i> It will be amended to contain such agreements as they reach between themselves, whether by way of annex or new documents, and the nations will be asked to subscribe or disassociate themselves from the new arrangements.</P>
      <P>When we come, however, to the agreement which we have made with the United States Government, I want to warn this House that I think it is a diplomatic blunder of the first order. Secondly, it is of no material value to this country whatever.  These facts I propose to demonstrate to the House. Thirdly, it is turning our backs on the one hope we had of making the Shannon airport virtually indispensable to the transatlantic traffic of the future, and Deputy Norton notwithstanding, permanently indispensable to that. We have a gold mine in the Shannon if we go the right way about it.  We have a gold brick in the Shannon if we go the wrong way about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now it is notorious that at the Chicago Conference there was a head-on collision between the British delegation and the United States delegation, and that the conference wound up its proceedings in an atmosphere that was none too sweet.  It is bad policy for this country to go fishing in troubled waters of that kind.  If we had any sense we would make no agreement of this kind with the United States without a contemporaneous agreement with the United Kingdom.  Everyone in this country knows that I boast of the fact that I am pro-America.  I regard America as the closest and the best friend that this country has ever had.  I have never been afraid or ashamed to say that in fair weather or in foul.  But this agreement simply makes a pawn of us in the fight that is going on between the aeronautical interests in the United Kingdom and in the United States.  I interpret the meaning of the agreement to be&mdash;America giving notice to Britain that unless there was a softening-up in the attitude adopted by Lord Swinton at Chicago de Valera would <Col N="2280" /> be called into play.  I want to warn the House that if that course of diplomacy is going to be followed in the peculiar position in which we find ourselves, in a fight between the United States and the United Kingdom, we are going to get ourselves into trouble. This country ought to serve as a link to combine together the two great pillars of democracy in the world.  We should do it and sometimes we might display, when they with their great interests are in conflict, a wisdom and prudence that they are not capable of. Instead of entering into a bargain with either of them, as a pawn in that battle, it might be much better for us to say to both of them: &ldquo;Now, gentlemen, you have allowed great interests and their clash to confuse your judgment. We decline to be thrown into a maelstrom of that character because we know that ultimately you will have to reconcile your interests in the interests of the whole world.  We are willing and we are anxious to collaborate in any plan which represents a reasonable compromise between the pair of you.  We are anxious to lend our counsel, our facilities, in the working out of such a plan. but let neither of you ask us to concede special facilities to one wherewith to bring pressure on the other.  Ask us for anything that will promote goodwill between you, ask us to make any contribution within our power to smooth out ruffled feelings and difficulties, but ask for nothing which one of you proposes to use as a lever against the other.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In my judgment, the nominal concession made here in this agreement is merely a petulant gesture to demonstrate to Great Britain that, if she is not able to soften up in face of United States pressure, other means can be brought to bear and that the peculiar position of Ireland will provide facilities that Great Britain may be tempted to withhold in her own territory from the United States, in the course of negotiations in which the British were trying to make the British view prevail over that of the Americans.</P>
    <P>Is this agreement of any real use to us?  The Minister has frankly given <Col N="2281" /> us his interpretation of it.  The Minister for Air in London has given his interpretation of it.  Remember, it is not what our delegation said to somebody else's delegation in the course of a luncheon party in Chicago that is going to rule the meaning of that agreement. It is what is written on the face of it.  The jurists of China, or the jurists of Peru or the jurists of Great Britain have as much right to apply their powers of interpretation to that document as we have.  I notice that the jurists of the United States of America have not yet given any authoritative interpretation of that. But the Minister for Air in Great Britain has assured the British House of Commons that that agreement does not mean that every aircraft coming from the United States of America to Europe must stop at the Foynes airport, and our Minister here to-day has made it perfectly clear that all aircraft travelling on routes 3 and 4 do not pass here.  He is under no misapprehension as to that and he recognises that all aircraft travelling on routes 3 and 4 do not come within this agreement, but he does, I think, use language here to-day, if not explicit, designed to persuade the House that all aircraft travelling on routes 1 and 2 must pass here and come within the purview of the annex to that agreement, but he does not go on to say that by adding seven miles to the trip, the United States Government can use the airfield outside Belfast and not cross Irish territory at all, and if the aircraft never crosses Ireland, never touches Ireland, never comes near Ireland, can it be said that it is on a route to Ireland and countries beyond?</P>
    <P>Suppose we seek to enforce our rights under our agreement with the United States, the United States can divert their entire traffic to their own air base at Lough Swilly and to their own air base in the outskirts of Belfast.  What is that document worth then?  Less than the paper it is printed on, but it will have left behind this nasty taste, that the moment the United States and Great Britain get at cross purposes, the mischievous disturber, located by the Lord God Almighty between them, acts the role of the mischievous promoter of discord, <Col N="2282" /> instead of accepting the lofty destiny of being the interpreter to the British of the Americans and of the Americans to the British which we were surely destined by God to be.</P>
    <P>I take this occasion of saying to the House&mdash;and the Taoiseach knows by his own experience that what I am saying is true&mdash;the Minister for Industry and Commerce does not know it as well as the Taoiseach knows it; he has not travelled in America or in Great Britain as widely or as frequently as the Taoiseach has done&mdash;this phenomenal statement is true that we understand the British and we understand the Americans, that we can get on with both of them, but that the Americans and the British find it very difficult to get on together.  In matters relating to air agreements of this kind, we are the one people in the world who can come between these two great nations and, understanding the faults and qualities of both, interpret them to one another.  If ever there was an occasion offered when that might have been profitably done it was in connection with this aeronautical agreement.  When we were offered this agreement by the United States Government, had we been equal to the position we ought to occupy in the world, we should have said to the United States Government: &ldquo;No.  The making of an agreement of that kind is capable of the gravest possible misunderstanding in Great Britain.  We do not choose to get any little advantage for our country at the expense of the greater consideration of promoting understanding and goodwill between you and the British people. We know you may be vexed at the moment.  We know that you may want to give the British lion's tail a twist. No one in the world can twist it better than we can, but we are not prepared to use our peculiar skill in conducting that operation at the present moment, for it is expedient neither for Great Britain, the United States nor for Ireland to do it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I believe that agreement is useless from our own interests, not only because it is capable of half a dozen different interpretations but also for the reason mentioned by Deputy <Col N="2283" /> Norton, that at the end of 12 months, when the international atmosphere in relation to aeronautics has changed between Great Britain and the United States, as it most certainly will, because greater interests, wider interests, more universal interests, will require those two parties to smooth out the differences that divide them on these very specialised questions at the present time&mdash;when that new situation arises, we will be informed by the United States that the renewal of this agreement will require certain amendments or we will be informed that the United States Government knows that we have interpreted this agreement to mean a certain thing; that it does not mean that and that we ought to realise at once, before we renew it, that aircraft passing over Ireland shall be interpreted to mean traffic from the United States to Ireland and countries beyond, but if the aircraft does not pass over our territory, the terms of this agreement do not apply to it at all and that unless we are prepared to accept that interpretention, they will divert all their traffic on routes 1 and 2 <i>via</i> Lough Swilly, Belfast, and so on. They can do that any day by adding seven miles, and only seven miles.  In how much better a position would we stand at this present moment if we had rejected that agreement and said: &ldquo;We will have no agreement except an agreement which promotes understanding and goodwill between ourselves and the Government of Great Britain and we are not prepared to make an agreement with either of you until such time as you can approach us with the assurance that such understandings are well under way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Instead of having that worthless agreement with the United States of America and the measure of ill-will which has already been raised in Great Britain by the discussion of this agreement which has taken place in the British House of Commons, we would be in a position to take up a proper attitude towards these two nations, with neither of whom we can compare from the point of view of force or wealth or anything else.  But we might have proved their superior in wisdom <Col N="2284" /> at this early stage of these difficult negotiations that have to take place between these two partners.  We might have set a headline for them.  We might have stood between them and warned them that when embarking on negotiations of this kind they should not allow ill-will to override prudence in their own interest and the interest. of everyone else.  I am afraid that we have been presented to the British people as a Government prepared to fish in troubled waters and to take part in silly little manoeuvres when some men lost their tempers, when we might have acted as an interpreter between the two parties in order to secure an understanding which, put into operation, would produce a greater understanding between two peoples upon whose good understanding the destinies of the whole human race ultimately depend.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I want to suggest to the House that we have it in our power to make the Shannon a gold mine.  The Minister, <Col N="2285" /> in dealing with the matter, quoted from a number of American authorities on aeronautics opinions phrased as follows: Of all forms of transportation the aeroplane is the most sensitive to gross weight.  He went on to speak of the maximums fixed by experts where economy is the major issue.  I ask the House particularly to note that in every case where the Minister was prepared to quote an authority to that effect you always find the word annexed to the opinion: &ldquo;Where economy is the major issue.&rdquo; Does any Deputy so far deceive himself as to imagine that in express passenger traffic economy will ever be the major issue?  Has any Deputy ever travelled on express passenger routes on the Atlantic where economy was the major consideration?  I remember speaking to captains of ships crossing the Atlantic and they said to me: &ldquo;If we cut down the speed of the ship by two knots we could save practically half of our transatlantic expenses, but it is the extra two knots of speed that win for us the Blue Riband of the Atlantic and that is what gets us the express traffic.  But, if we had not got that, human creatures are so irrational that they would willingly pay the German lines, the Italian lines and the American lines a fantastic premium for the privilege of getting to New York five hours earlier than we would deliver them.&rdquo;  It is contrary to reason, it is silly for a man to pay £20 more for five hours, because he might save the five hours in the middle of the night. The difference between the Blue Riband liner and the fast liner might be that he will arrive in New York at a quarter to one in the morning instead of a quarter to six.  Nevertheless, human beings, being what they are, so long as they are travelling the fastest way are prepared to pay any premium.</P>

It is the big <Col N="2286" /> shots like the Taoiseach who will go on the aeroplane.  Do you imagine that he will go in a two-funnel liner when he can get an aeroplane?</P>

      <P>He can pay.  The Taoiseach is doing plenty of hard work; most of it is very bad work, but it is hard work.  No man in this country, if it is volume of work is considered, is giving better value for the money, but thank God, they are not all so mistaken.  For volume of work, let nobody reflect on the Ministers of this State, they are not getting more than they are worth for the volume of work they do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The express passenger service will never stop at the Shannon; it will fly over it.  People will laugh at the suggestion that the express passenger service to the continent of Europe should come down on the Shannon. The handicap of doing it is unthinkable as compared with the advantage that would accure in the form of the extra passengers that might be carried in lieu of petrol load.  The great argument for the Shannon is that if a transatlantic aeroplane coming from America comes down on the Shannon she has to carry far less petrol when leaving New York and that measured in terms of pay-load, that means a dozen or half a dozen extra passengers. But no express air liner will get its extra dozen passengers and then pay the dues at the Shannon to curry out the extra repairs made necessary by the extra descent, pay the various other charges, too technical and too numerous to mention, made necessary by an intermediate stop between two great centres of population.  I venture to predict, and I believe the Minister knows it as well as I do, that in five years' time, if you suggested that an express air liner from the United States to a point east of Ireland from <Col N="2287" /> their point of view would come down on the Shannon to take on petrol, the pilot would break his heart laughing. You might just as well suggest that in pre-war days the &ldquo;Queen Mary&rdquo; would stop at Castletownberehaven to get fresh water.</P>
    <P>But there is a gold mine in the Shannon and it is this.  Let us turn our minds from passenger traffic.  We have no more chance of collecting the transatlantic passenger traffic than we have of making emus breed in Kerry.  But at the Shannon we have an entrepot port for freight such as Danzing used to be.  If we exploit that, we have within our grasp the thing that made Hamburg and Danzig two of the richest ports in Europe.  Freight traffic, no matter how express it may be, with the exception of jewellery and items of that kind, will never attach the same importance to a few hours as passenger traffic does. I hope to see free trade all over Europe.  I hope to see common agreements about transport regulations and so forth in my time and I hope that a great many years will pass before my time is done.  During those years I want to see the Shannon becoming the hub of distribution for all merchandise going to and coming from the United States of America.</P>
    <P>Conceive the problem that a merchant has in sending a parcel of merchandise to Europe to-day.  He has to determine the tariff barriers and the packing regulations.  Nobody who has not some experience of foreign trade will realise what an extraordinary complex thing package regulations can be. He has to understand the traffic laws, the kind of things that cannot be carried by aeroplane over the territory of a particular State.  These will differ in every State in Europe, quite possibly.  If we rail off a square mile round the Shannon airport and declare that within that square mile aeroplanes can go in bound for Europe, with any freight they like to bring, we should give the assurance that there is neither tariff restriction nor anything else to hinder them, that it is understood that every facility they want. <Col N="2288" /> however extravagant, will be provided by us at a price and that we are not concerned to say they must do this or do that.  We should provide a luxury service for freight.  The Minister has described one of the ancillary services that a port of that kind should have and I would add one&mdash;an adequate repair service, to enable repairs to be made to aircraft in transit, which I think is a very important service.</P>
    <P>Our effort should be to have every conceivable convenience that luxury accommodation could reasonably expect there for incoming aircraft.  Our object should be to provide for those who desire to avail of our link lines with their ultimate destinations, as a permanent feature of our service, freight taxis prepared to carry a consignment of freight to any other centre to which the consider wants it to be sent.  We should have available there not only these services, but if any individual with any particular aeronautical problem of his own desires some special supplementary service, however extravagant and difficult it may be to provide it, we should be eager and ready to afford it at a price.  We want those who use the airport to feel that it is their airport and that our primary concern is to ensure that, at that port, they will receive facilities which they cannot get in the various other quarters of the world.</P>
    <P>If we can jump in on that now, the greater volume of the entrepot traffic of America with Europe and the greater part of the entrepot traffic of Europe with America will be done there in both directions.  Remember this, whoever cashes in first on that traffic will keep it.  Anybody who is in business knows what goodwill is.  Once train the international merchant to look upon Shannon as one place where he can dump his cargo without any difficulty, and have the authorities in Shannon and other parts of the country as his agents, concerned with one thing only and that is getting the freight where the consigner wants it left, and you have established a goodwill that no other country will be able to take away from you.  If we do that now, there is an immense opportunity.  If we fail to put that work in hand and go dandering <Col N="2289" /> round with draft ideas that we are going to divert all the transatlantic passenger traffic to the Shannon, we are sunk.  We are suited to one kind of traffic&mdash;freight, and all that codology that we are going to become the air capital of Europe is of no use.</P>
    <P>There are other features of that trade that may be dealt with, but one of them ought to be touched upon now. It is natural that we here should desire to see Irish services functioning on the air trade routes of the world, but we ought to make up our minds to the fact that, apart from the internal passenger traffic in our own State and, possibly, between our State and Great Britain, we have no role to play, none whatever. As a freight distributing centre, we could become as important in the aeronautical world of to-morrow as Greece or Norway was in the shipping world of yesterday.</P>
    <P>Remember that Greece was one of the greatest tramp nations in the world.  Greece!  Who would imagine it, on looking at the map?  Who taking no interest in international transport would have thought of Greece as one of the greatest carriers of the seven seas?  But it was not the Blue Riband line: she knew she could never finance that or have the traffic where with to build up such a trade.  Yet with to built up a trade that paid her well, and that provided her, in times of emergency, with equipment that would have stood her in good stead, had she been allowed to use it.  We have an immense opportunity and one which, I trust, the Minister for Industry and Commerce will proceed to exploit, without delay, in the commercial sphere.</P>
    <P>In the diplomatic sphere, we have what is to me an even more precious opportunity.  Even at this eleventh hour of our diplomatic history, we have still the opportunity to regain the place which we have almost thrown away&mdash; that is, the role of interpreter between the American and British peoples, the link to bind together the one force remaining in the world which can secure liberty and decency for all mankind. All of us will hope that the invocation of that force may never come, that it may never be necessary to mobilise <Col N="2290" /> those great resources for the defence of the things in which we believe; but only fools will close their eyes to the possibilities of the imperfect world in which we live.  Bearing these considerations in mind, I ask the Taoiseach, as the Minister for External Affairs for the next four years, to remember the immense responsibility that rests upon him.  It is what will be done in the next two or three years that is going to shape the destiny of things to come.</P>
    <P>We can either take up the position in which we make the whole world our debtor, or we can play the ignoble role of a little chancer fishing in troubled waters.  This country was never born for such a wretched rôle. We have the capacity; God has given us the opportunity to play a nobler part, and strangely&mdash;for it is not given to many for this to happen&mdash;our interests coincide with our destiny, our higher destiny, in this regard.  By linking those two nations ever closer, not only dignity but wealth may well accure.  We must depend on the Taoiseach as to whether Ireland is to occupy that place or not.  I hope and pray that this agreement and the circumstances surrounding it are not typical of what we may expect in the years to come but, rather, given the extraordinary opportunity he has, he will lead his nation in a rôle of conciliation, whether it be to our material advantage or not, and will refuse resolutely the offer of either party, Great Britain or America, to trade on passing misunderstandings that may draw them apart, that he will consistently reject such proffered gain, in the assurance that the role of interpreter and conciliator will secure far higher and more precious dividends to the country for which he speaks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate at all, and I would not do so were it not for the speech which has just been delivered. I think it is very regrettable that that speech should have been delivered.  I think that Deputy Dillon allowed his emotions to run away with the wisdom which, as he said, should have been <Col N="2291" /> exercised in connection with this whole matter when he declared that there was something very dishonourable, some thing highly mischievous and with the deliberate purpose of driving a wedge between the British and American peoples, in the signing of this agreement. The Deputy has alleged here that the outstanding motive actuating our delegation in signing this agreement was to give the lion's tail another twist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No such allegation was made by me at all.  I said advantage was taken of a misunderstanding between interests in Great Britain and America to accept the invitation of interests in America to twist the lion's tail and that we should have replied: &ldquo;We will not do that, but we will try to have a good understanding between them.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire in the world to exaggerate in any way what the Deputy has said.  I would feel far happier if I could minimise it.  The Deputy not only said that, but he stated it in a number of ways; he repeated it over and over again.</P>
      <P>Speaking for myself, I do not subscribe to one word of the speech made by Deputy Dillon.  It is rarely in this House within the last 20 years, certainly within the last 12 or 13 years, that it has fallen to my lot to agree with the Government rather than with the Opposition.  But this is a highly dangerous time for anybody in this country, and particularly for anybody in this House, to say anything that might endanger our position, situated as we are between two of the greatest Powers in this world.  It is dangerous to suggest that it was in a spirit of mischief that this agreement was initiated and signed.  I do not believe that.  I believe that the agreement was signed in an open and honourable way. I believe it was signed because those who signed it believed they were doing it in the best interests of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To suggest that we should have refused to sign this agreement merely because there was a disagreement, or there were different points of view, between the heads of the American <Col N="2292" /> authorities and the heads of the British authorities in Chicago, and that consequently we should hesitate to take any part in it is childish.  It is still more childish to suggest that we should have offered to step in between the two great Powers and keep them from each other's throats. Those two great Powers have agreed. and had to agree for the past five years, on matters of far greater importance than these aeronautical agreements.  They are welded together and have proven it by far greater bonds than anything we could hope to achieve in linking them together.</P>
    <P>I am one of those who firmly believe in telling the truth, in having the truth told.  It is quite another thing to tell what you think is the truth, but what may be far from the truth.  I think that Deputy Dillon ought to get this into his head, that there are people in this House, in all parts of the House, who are as anxious for the safety and security of this country as he is.  There are people in this House, perhaps on all sides of the House, who are anxious for the closest possible co-operation with our nearest neighbours and with America, and any man who is not anxious for that is a lunatic.  Mind you, it is sometimes a case of &ldquo;save me from my friends&rdquo;, and sometimes in telling what we are pleased to call the truth, we may be doing more harm than good.</P>
    <P>Further, I would like the Minister to make this position clear.  Right through Deputy Dillon's whole speech was running the suggestion, the implication, the innuendo, that by signing this agreement we had locked the door against the British, that we could not sign any similar agreement with the British.  The Deputy's suggestion was that we had tied ourselves hand and foot to the Americans, that we had allowed ourselves to be used. by the Americans as a pawn in the game, as the stick with which to beat the British.  He said the bargaining powers of the British had been lessened by our placing at the disposal of the Americans the airport at Foynes.  To me that seems to be childish reasoning.  If American aerial <Col N="2293" /> traffic is not going to Great Britain but beyond it to the Continent, they will not want Foynes, it will be no use to them.</P>
    <P>The Deputy in the first half of his speech took up the line that Foynes was all-important.  In the second half of his speech he said that from the aerial point of view it was of no importance, that planes would simply pass over, the same as if Foynes did not exist.  Unlike some people in this House, I am not an expert in regard to this matter; I know very little about it, but I do know that this world is going through the most trying time ever known in its history.  I know we are living in highly dangerous times. Public men, and particularly noted public men in neutral countries, would need to be careful of every word and sentence they utter, dealing particularly with international matters.</P>
    <P>I feel that we are not doing a service to this country or to our people, and we are not doing any service to our present or future relations with the United Kingdom or the United States of America by taking up, to use the Deputy's own words, the sort of mischievous line that has been taken up here this evening.  In this matter I am speaking for myself.  I have had no consultation or contact with any of my colleagues.  I want to make it quite clear that my views are absolutely different from the views expressed by Deputy Dillon.  I believe this agreement was signed in good faith, not only by ourselves but by the Americans, and I have more respect for the American Government and the American people than to think they will treat this agreement as a scrap of paper and, instead of flying to our territory, that they will go northwards and fly over Lough Swilly or over Belfast.</P>

      <P>In case some official or other person interested in civil air transport development should read the record of debates of this House, I think it a good thing that Deputy Morrissey put on record an exact definition of Deputy Dillon's status here.  I do not think Deputy Dillon intended to create mischief.  I think it was just sheer inability to understand the significance that might be attached to his words by somebody who did not understand his status that <Col N="2295" /> prompted his remarks.  The Deputy is so far from a realisation of the truth in relation to this agreement with the United States of America that it is almost impossible to begin putting him right.</P>
      <P>The outcome of the Chicago Conference was a convention which contains no provisions relating to the control of air transport.  If inter national air transport is to take place, it must and can only be as result of bilateral agreements made between States.  The Government of the United States of America informed the conference of its desire to conclude such bilateral agreements with States there represented.  The conference itself drew up a series of standard clauses which should, in its opinion, be inserted in all such bilateral agreements which it hoped and expected would be concluded following the termination of the conference.</P>
      <P>The British representatives at the conference were fully aware of the fact that discussions were proceeding between the Irish delegates and the American representatives with a view to the conclusion of a bilateral agreement. They had been informed of our willingness to conclude a similar agreement with the Government of the United Kingdom.  The American Government have, since the conclusion of the Chicago Conference, completed similar bilateral agreements with the Governments of Spain, Sweden, Iceland and Denmark, and, according to reports appearing in the newspapers, are at present negotiating bilateral agreements with other European Governments.  Do these facts not completely dispose of the contention of Deputy Dillon that there was some ulterior motive behind the conclusion of this agreement between ourselves and the Government of the United States, on our part or on their part, because that, of course, was the full implication of his allegation?</P>

      <P>I have no reason to think that the Government of the United Kingdom dislike or disapprove in any way the agreement we have concluded with the United States. Let us be clear, however, that the concern of the Government of this country is to protect our interests.  Deputy Dillon said that, as a result of making this agreement with the United States, we have increased the bargaining power of the United States in some future negotiations with the Government of the United Kingdom.  If we had refused to make this agreement with the Government of the United States, we would presumably have lessened their bargaining power in any future negotiations.  The representatives of the United States invited the representatives of this country to discuss the conclusion of a bilateral agreement on civil aviation.  Should we have refused?  Should we have refused for the reason Deputy Dillon has stated, that otherwise the United States might get some mythical advantage in some future negotiations?  I do not think it necessary to labour that point.</P>
      <P>We have our interests to protect. We concluded an agreement ten years ago with the Government of Great Britain and the Government of Canada relating to the development of air transport services across the Atlantic. That agreement was one designed to exclude from the business of air transport across the Atlantic all other countries, unless each one of the parties to the agreement assented to their admission. Under that agreement, with the full assent of all the parties, a permit to operate transatlantic services was given to an American company.  Discussions proceeded, and ultimately agreement was reached to give a similar permit to a French company. In practice, however, because of war developments, the French company was unable to operate and the joint operating company which it was intended should have a major interest in that route was never established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have reached the position now at which there is no intention to have exclusive rights given to any single country or any single company to <Col N="2297" /> operate over the Atlantic.  Should we have refused to the American Government the rights which are given in this agreement?  Surely not.  Apart altogether from the question of our own interests, if there is to be a development of air transport services across the Atlantic, it is because we, having regard to our geographical position, are prepared to give facilities to those operating these services.  It is not merely a question of airport facilities. Planes operating across the Atlantic will require more than a right to come down at the Shannon airport.  They will require meteorological information; they will require radio direction; and they will require traffic control. We, because of our position and because of our decision, will provide these facilities to all companies operating air transport services across the Atlantic.</P>
    <P>In return for these facilities, we want from them recognition of our interest in the matter.  We want from them some assurance that non-commercial considerations are not going to exclude the use of the Shannon airport. We are satisfied that, so long as commercial considerations predominate, the use of the Shannon is inevitable. It may be that at some later time there will be developments in aeronautical science which will reduce the commercial advantages at present secured by companies utilising the Shannon airport.  Those developments are not in sight yet.  We know what the main companies operating across the Atlantic from the Shannon at present have in contemplation in the matter of aircraft design, and we know that if commercial considerations determine the issue, if political or other non-commercial considerations are not brought in, and provided we have at the Shannon facilities as good as can be provided elsewhere, the future of the Shannon airport is assured.</P>
    <P>But let us not blind our eyes to the fact that there are in Great Britain municipalities which regard themselves as rivals of the Shannon in the provision of airport facilities for transatlantic services.  The agitation and the political pressure which the representatives of these municipalities <Col N="2298" /> may direct against the British authorities will undoubtedly influence these authorities, but, so far as the information available to the Government here is concerned, there is no reason to assume that, in the ultimate development of transatlantic air services, the Shannon will not be an important, if not the most important, factor.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon suggested that there would be advantages in making the Shannon airport a free port.  He appears not to be aware of the fact that the intention of the Government to promote legislation to make the Shannon airport a free port was announced before the Chicago Conference met.  If he reads the terms of the convention he will find there in specific provision made at the instance of the Irish delegation for the establishment of a customs free airport. There is, in fact, no recorded intention of any other Government to adopt a similar course.  So far as we are aware the Shannon airport will be not merely the first but, possibly, the only free port of its kind in the world. When I spoke of transatlantic traffic I was not speaking of passengers only. I referred specifically to passengers, goods and mails, and there is no reason to assume, if we make the facilities available, that the great bulk of the traffic in passengers, goods and mails that will cross the Atlantic by air will not pass through the Shannon airport.</P>

      <P>I prefer to rely in this matter upon the recorded opinions of experts in civil aviation whose writings are available, and upon the recorded and published decision of the United States Civil Aeronautical Board which has laid down the routes which it is proposed to sanction for American companies operating international services. They may not have heard of Deputy Dillon and perhaps they will change their opinion when they have read the report of his speech, but I doubt it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are undertaking a substantial capital expenditure to provide these <Col N="2299" /> airport and other facilities at the Shannon.  We have already expended over £1,000,000 there, and it will take probably another £1,000,000 to complete our programme.  The airport has been developed only partially so far. Concrete runways of substantial length have been built upon the land-plane landing field.  The harbour for flying boats has not been completed.  The dredging work could not be undertaken during the war, but the contract for the completion of that dredging work is about to be placed.  A temporary airport building is being constructed. The permanent building, which is being designed, will not be completed for about three years.  The runways, which are at present being extended up to 8,000 feet for the main runway and to 6,000 feet for the subsidiary runways, will have to be further extended.  The design of aircraft, and the speed of aircraft have so developed since the construction of the Shannon airport was begun that it is clear we will have to contemplate runways much longer than those which we originally intended.</P>
    <P>The issue between land planes and flying boats is not yet settled, but in so far as it is possible to get an indication of the intentions of the main transport operators, it appears probable that the land plane will be the main instrument of transatlantic transport, and, consequently, we are fortunate in the fact that the construction of the aerodrome at Rineanna has proceeded so far that we can afford there immediate facilities for land plane operation.  At the present time the flying boat services, now operated by three companies, are based upon Foynes.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have spoken of the Shannon airport as the Foynes airport, and some as the Rineanna airport.  The Shannon airport includes both Rineanna and Foynes, and it is intended that the work that is being done at Foynes in the provision of facilities for flying boats, will be retained, and that Foynes will, at all times, be an integral part of the Shannon airport, even though there will be constructed, side by side with the flying field, a seaplane <Col N="2300" /> base which can be fully utilised in all weathers and serviced by the staff housed in the main airport building.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the expenditure and the work which we have undertaken at the Shannon, it is clearly in our interest that we should avail of every opportunity that may arise to ensure that the transatlantic services will use that port.  I would say that we would have neglected our duty as a Government if we had failed or refused to respond to the invitation of the American Government to conclude an agreement on these lines.  Again I want to say that we cannot leave entirely out of account the possibility that some technical development in aircraft, or the introduction of noncommercial considerations in air transport policy, will result in the Shannon being by-passed by some, or all, of the main air transport operators.  I think, however, that we would have failed in our duty if we had not taken steps to develop the facilities that are available at the Shannon, facilities which, in the opinion of pilots operating civil aircraft across the Atlantic, are unequalled anywhere else.  We may not put the Shannon into the centre of the world air transport map, as we hope to, but we could not have done so if we had not provided the facilities there.  The provision of these facilities was decided on many years ago.  If the construction of the airport has not been completed according to our schedule, it is due entirely to the fact that we were unable to obtain during the war the equipment and the materials necessary for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton appears to be under a misapprehension concerning the duration of this agreement.  He read one clause as signifying that it was an agreement for one year only.  It is incorrect.  It is an agreement of indefinite duration.  There is, however, provision contained in it which empowers either of the contracting parties to withdraw from the agreement on giving one year's notice. That is the provision which Deputy Norton misread.  The agreement does not terminate in a year.  There is, in fact, no provision in the agreement <Col N="2301" /> for its automatic termination at any time unless and until notice to terminate is given, in which case the requirement of the paragraph of the agreement is that one year's notice of intention to withdraw must be afforded to the other party.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to enter into any discussion with Deputy Dillon as to the most suitable air routes across the Atlantic.  I informed the Dáil that the United States Civil Aeronautics Board has laid down and published the routes it is prepared to authorise for American civil air transport companies operating to Europe.  Two of these routes pass through Ireland. There is certainly no suggestion that other routes are covered by the terms of the annex to this agreement.  The annex to this agreement relates clearly to the two routes published by the American Civil Aeronautics Board to be operated by American companies from the United States to Newfoundland or Labrador to Ireland and from Ireland to London, Amsterdam and points beyond or from Ireland to Paris and points beyond.  There is certainly no intention to interpret the agreement as requiring American aircraft flying on the route from Greenland to Iceland to call at an Irish port or American aircraft flying on the route from Bermuda to the Azores and to Lisbon to call at an Irish port.</P>

      <P>What I am trying to make clear to the Deputy is that the American Civil Aeronautic Board has laid down four routes, and only four routes, which it is prepared to approve for American companies operating these services.  That board may change its routes at some time, but at the moment these routes do not include any such route as the Deputy apparently contemplates.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton in quired if we contemplated acquiring aircraft for the purpose of operating a transatlantic air service ourselves. We do not think it is probable that the operation of transatlantic air services by an Irish company will be undertaken in the near future.  Clearly, the development of our activities as air transport operators, other than services to Great Britain, will be most likely to be undertaken in the direction of providing feeder services to the main transatlantic services to and from points not served by these services. In the provision of services of that kind, we hope Aer Lingus Teoranta will be able to play an appropriate part.  Arrangements for such services must, of course, be made with the Governments in the countries to which the services will operate.  Under our existing arrangements with the American and British companies operating into Foynes we have the right to participate in the link services to the Shannon airport.  We have not been able to exercise that right because of inability to procure suitable aircraft during recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not easy to give a precise indication of the economic benefits which will accrue to this country from the development of the Shannon as an international airport.  The air companies using that airport pay fees They involve themselves in consider able expenditure upon staffs and materials in this country.  The total outlay of these operating companies in respect of airport fees and other charges arising in connection with their operation at Foynes in last year <Col N="2303" /> was about £110,000 and a very substantial expansion of that figure might be anticipated when normal conditions are restored.  But it is, of course, reasonable to assume that other less direct benefits will accrue to this country if we make good our ambitions in relation to the Shannon.  It is not correct, as Deputy Norton assumed, that the potentialities of civil aviation in this country are limited by our population.  While population is an important factor, and while the main international transport operators will always be the countries with the big populations, nevertheless, it is possible for us to contemplate participation in international civil aviation on a larger scale than our own population would appear to indicate.  While, no doubt, in the case of Holland before the war there were exceptional features, particularly the fact that Holland had a large colonial empire, it is, nevertheless, worth remembering that Holland before the war had established for itself, despite its comparatively small home population, a prominent, if not a predominant, place in long-distance air transport operation.</P>
    <P>I doubt if there, are any other matters that it is necessary to refer to at this stage.  The Dáil will, I am sure, agree that the convention which was signed at Chicago and which has been accepted by a very large number of nations as representing an agreed international law governing civil aviation matters should be ratified by us.  It is clearly necessary that there should be an international law regulating air navigation and international air contracts.</P>

      <P>There can be no question about the desirability of having these conventions accepted by all nations and brought into force by their agreement.  Whatever course we may subsequently take for the protection of our own interests or to develop our own services can at all times be discussed in the Dáil.  They arise annually for review upon the appropriate Estimate, but when this convention is ratified and comes into force <Col N="2304" /> it will establish an international code to replace that previously in operation, that which was drawn up in 1919 and which has been adhered to since by most European countries.  This new convention has this advantage over the 1919 convention, that it is acceptable not merely to all the countries that subscribed to the convention of Paris in 1919 but also to a number of other countries which were unwilling to participate in that convention and were parties to another separate convention prepared in 1928.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister look at Article No. 2 of the International Civil Aviation Conference and inform us whether the words &ldquo;State aircraft&rdquo; refer exclusively to battle craft?  There is a distinction drawn there between civil and State aircraft.  Does &ldquo;State aircraft&rdquo; apply only to war-planes or might that be interpreted to include the aircraft of a transport company which is owned and operated by the State?</P>
