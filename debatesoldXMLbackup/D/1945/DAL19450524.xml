      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that there is a large number of patients on the waiting list of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Dun Laoghaire; and, if so, if he will state if there are any proposals before his Department for the extension of the hospital to accommodate such patients; if so, if he will indicate the nature of the proposals; if they have been or will be sanctioned; and if the maintenance grant per patient will be increased.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the large number of patients on the waiting list of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Dun Laoghaire.  On the 17th July, 1944, I approved, provisionally, of a proposal to install 43 additional beds and an operating suite in the hospital at the cost of the Hospitals Trust Fund, subject to the usual conditions for securing the due expenditure of the grant from the Hospitals Trust Fund for the purposes specified as required by Section 25 (5) of the Hospitals Act, 1933.  On the 30th April last, it was intimated to me that the authorities of the hospital are not prepared to agree to those conditions and the matter is now the subject of correspondence with the solicitors for the hospital authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am unable to approve of any increase <Col N="852" /> in the maintenance grant per patient until I receive an assurance that the hospital authorities are prepared to abide by their existing agreement regarding the quality of the milk to be supplied to the patients in the hospital.</P>

      <P>In the meantime, we are interested in the patients&mdash;I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is also interested&mdash;who are waiting for beds and it would be well if the Parliamentary Secretary would use his influence to speed up the provision of those beds. The conditions attaching to the grant do not affect me very much nor do they affect the patients.  I am interested in the provision of beds for tuberculous patients.</P>

      <P>It has been decided that Tully farm will be used in the future for the purpose of a national stud.  Legislation is being prepared which will enable a company to be set up for this purpose and to which Tully Stud Farm will be transferred.

    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night, I was trying to make clear our attitude towards agriculture, and also towards the development of other industries. While there are people, and certain Deputies, who would like to tie on to our Party the suggestion that we stand for a high tariff policy in order to protect certain industries, and that, by doing so, we are causing a disadvantage to the farming community, since the farming community are directly responsible for the existence of those industries, due to the fact that they are contributing towards their existence by purchasing their finished products and paying in excess of what they are worth, that is not our plea nor our policy.  We hold, as I have already said&mdash;and I should like to emphasise it again&mdash;that the farmer is prepared to pay a little extra for anything that can be manufactured in this country so long as the manufactured article is of reasonable quality and standard, and I am sure that Deputies here, who claim to represent the farming community, will agree with that.  In that way, we are helping to build up a home market, and by that means we will be giving employment to men and women who otherwise would have to emigrate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By creating a home market in that <Col N="857" /> way, we are enabling those people to remain here at home and sustain themselves by employment here.  Even though it may mean paying a few extra shillings for a plough or a tractor manufactured here, over and above what the English manufactured article might cost, we are ensuring, by producing the articles here, that we will have a market here at home which could not be compared with any other market, no matter how near it might be.  Not alone that, but the Government of the day, whatever Government it might be, would have control of that market.  No matter what Government may be here, they cannot control an outside market, but they can control the home market for the benefit both of the producer and the consumer.  For that reason, I think we can claim to understand and speak on behalf of the farmers, and say that they are a community who have a certain sense of citizenship, who have a patriotic outlook, and who would not despise Irish - manufactured goods merely because they cost a few shillings more, so long as these goods could compare favourably with goods produced elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Now, while we would agree with that policy, we would not agree that it should be necessary to continue a high tariff wall to such an extent that our industries here would never mature. We expect that after a certain number of years our young industries will be able to compete with their parent industries in other countries and that, given a chance, the day will gradually dawn when they will be able to meet competition from other countries without the necessity for any protection. That, of course, cannot be achieved overnight.  In that connection, the case has often been argued about certain old-established industries here, such as Guinness's, Jacobs, and so on, which succeeded without protection, but the competition in the case of these great firms was never very keen. The same would apply to certain other industries, but a number of new industries are now being established in this country, which need protection at the moment, and I do hope that the day will dawn when these industries <Col N="858" /> will be able to place their commodities on the market and compete with any other goods of a similar kind, no matter where they come from, without having to be protected by tariffs.</P>
    <P>There is another point to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention, and that is in connection with the services of veterinary surgeons to the farmers.  I have been often approached in connection with this matter and asked to put down a question in the House.  In the case of the ordinary part-time veterinary surgeon, the ordinary people in the country cannot afford to avail of his services on account of the charges involved. If the part-time veterinary surgeon has to travel a few miles, it means a fee of two or three guineas. Now, a farmer might have a nice mare worth, perhaps, 30 or 40 guineas. The animal gets a pain and the farmer does not know what is wrong with her, but if he sends for the vet. he has to pay a fee of £3 or £4, and he may not be able to afford that.  Even if he can afford it the mare may die, and the result is that a farmer is sometimes tempted to accept the services of quacks and to administer to animals the doses put up by these quacks, which may result in the death of a valuable animal, and the farmer is at a loss of 30 or 40 guineas, as the case may be, due to the fact that these part-time veterinary surgeons can charge what they like, and the ordinary farmer is not in a position to pay £3 or £4 out of his pocket.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister understands that as well as I do, and I am sure that Deputies from all parts of the country understand it also.  I understand that there is a report out at the moment dealing with such matters, and although I have not read it I understand that there are recommendations to the effect of having veterinary surgeons appointed through the country something on the same lines as the dispensary doctor. I do not know about that, because sometimes it is not very easy to get the services of a dispensary doctor, and if you are to have dispensaries for animals set up on the lines of the <Col N="859" /> dispensary doctor and have to pay in the same way as you have to pay for the services of the dispensary doctor, you will be in the same position as you are to-day in regard to the veterinary surgeon.</P>
    <P>I think that it would be a paying proposition, if we are to have such officers, to give them fixed salaries so that their services would be free to the farming community.  It would pay in the long run.  I know that the Minister cannot say to the part-time veterinary surgeons: &ldquo;You must go such a distance and charge such a fee&rdquo; but if we are to have a reorganisation, I hope it will be on the basis that the services of the veterinary surgeon will be free to the farmer.  A system of that kind would be of great assistance to the farmer and would serve to mitigate the many disastrous losses that occur from time to time among small farmers.  If a farmer whose total stock is five head of cattle loses a cow he feels the effect of that loss for two or three years afterwards.  The bigger farmer who has 40 or 50 head of cattle will not miss a cow or two, but the loss of a cow, a heifer or a pony, as the case may be, represents a very big item to the small farmer, more perhaps than the loss of 10 or 12 head of cattle to a big farmer.  I hope the Minister in his reply will indicate what his intentions are in regard to such a scheme for the immediate future.</P>
    <P>I have made a number of points with which I hope the Minister will deal. The first is that we must have a rearrangement of our marketing system so that there will be a closer relation between the price which the consumer pays for farm produce, the price charged by the retailer and that which the producer gets.  It is essential that some steps should be taken to bring that about if we are to get anywhere. The second point which I made dealt with the attitude of this Party so far as the development of industries, apart from agriculture, is concerned.  I listened to Deputy Dillon's remarks about the high tariff policy and while a lot of what he said is undoubtedly true, I think at the same time Deputy <Col N="860" /> Dillon would be the last person to suggest that we should throw open our market to the industrial products of the world and chance the consequences. I am sure the Deputy is as desirous as anybody else of seeing in this country an industrial organisation which would be able to turn out every possible article which our people need. If, as I said before, the products of our home industries are able to compete in quality with the articles manufactured in other countries, and if we can get them at a reasonable price, though not perhaps at the price at which the English manufacturer would be able to offer them, I think we would have no ground for complaint. It is quite obvious that the English manufacturers can sell us certain articles or implements at a cheaper rate than the farmer in England can buy them.  We know the reason for that too.  While I quite appreciate the force of what the Deputy advocates, I would not think for a moment that he would stand for throwing open our young industries to meet the competition of older and longer established industries in England or any other country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>My third point is that I hope the Minister for Agriculture will make representations to his colleague the Minister for Industry and Commerce, not to repeat the disaster of last year, when he prevented, by an Order under the Emergency Powers Act, young men from my constituency going to seasonal employment in England.  These men do not desire to take up employment in the Midlands. It has been a tradition among them to go to England to seek such employment and if they did not do so, Deputy Dillon, Messrs. Flannery, and other shopkeepers in Ballaghaderreen and elsewhere in my constituency, would have no money to get to clear their books at the end of the year.  These people incur debts with the shopkeepers at the beginning of the year. The shopkeepers are good enough to give them credit and at the end of <Col N="861" /> the year, when the men return from England, the debts are paid off.</P>

      <P>May I point out that the Minister for Agriculture, on representations from various farmer Deputies that it was his duty to ensure that there would be sufficient labour for farmers, made representations to his colleague the Minister for Industry and Commerce to see that these men, who used to emigrate, were prohibited from doing so?  I ask him now to correlate his duty with that of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to ensure that these men will not be prohibited from emigrating this year.</P>

I have nothing more to add, except to say, now that my colleague, Deputy Moran, is present, that I am glad that the Minister has accepted the suggestion which I made last year which was then very severely criticised by my colleague.  I am glad that the Minister has recognised the necessity of giving some aid to the small farmer to get back into pig breeding again, to help <Col N="862" /> farmers to get sows and to start breeding bonhams.  I advocated that last year.  Perhaps if Deputy Moran had advocated it last year I might have contradicted it myself, but the fact is that I did advocate it.  Later I noticed that Mr. Cassidy, who belongs to the same Party as my colleague, made a similar suggestion at the Mayo County Council.  I am glad that the Minister has taken note of these suggestions and has put a scheme as near as possible to the lines suggested into operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to this debate my mind goes back to a statement made by the late Deputy Hogan when he was Minister for Agriculture.  It was, I think, the last speech he made in this House on the Estimate for Agriculture. On that occasion he deplored the tendency on the part of the people of this country to rely on the Government for everything.  It appears to me that during the last nine or ten years that tendency has been increasing rather than decreasing.  Suggestions have been made to the Minister as to what he should do to help the farmers.  I come from a county that is the smallest in the country but I can safely say, and I say it without offence, that so far as the farmers of that county are concerned, the Minister might as well not exist at all, for this reason, that they carry on their work without relying on the Minister for Agriculture.  They take his advice, but they are self-reliant.  The policy of the Party opposite in the years gone by was Sinn Féin, which means self-reliance. I have not seen much of that policy during this debate.  The Minister has been asked to do this, that and the other thing by people who forget the fact that the Minister cannot do these things without money.  If he has to get money, it must come from somewhere and, of course, agriculture being our chief industry, ultimately the money comes out of the pocket of the farmers.  I presume that the Minister and his staff could not do the work one bit more effectively or as economically as the farmers themselves can do it.  I am not a farmer, but I am a practical man in other directions and I know that I can do <Col N="863" /> things much more economically by doing them myself than by asking somebody else in a high position to do them, and do them more expeditiously. We must get away from the point of view that the farmer is down and out. It would be a bad thing for this country if he were down and out. Candidly speaking, I do not think he is.</P>
      <P>Suggestions have been made as to what should be done and what ought not to be done for the farmer.  The fact is that the farmer can do most of these things himself, if left alone.  Give him the opportunity.  He has proved during the past six years that he is one of the men who can tide the country over an emergency.  What he has done in the past, he will do in the future.  A question usually put to the Minister is, what is his policy and what is going to be his policy in regard to post-war agriculture.  I shall not put that question to the Minister, for the simple reason that I know he cannot answer it and he could not answer it during the last six years, because he is not master of the situation.  Like a wise man, he just carried along and muddled through the best he could. He is in the same position to-day and deep down in his heart I think the Minister will admit that the next five years will be more difficult for him if he is still in power, than the past five years have been.  The Minister cannot determine his policy.  With all respect to the policy of self-sufficiency which has been adumbrated and put into operation, it is going to be exploded sky-high.  I am not blaming the Party opposite for their policy of self-sufficiency but I say that they cannot continue it and the best proof of that is the Minister's statement here in referring to the interim report on post-war emergency agricultural policy.  He was very reserved and very cautious; most of his remarks were prefaced by the words, &ldquo;I think&rdquo;, &ldquo;I assume&rdquo;, etc., but I think it is worth while quoting two passages from his speech in reference to this report:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;For instance, before bringing any commodity into the category of commodities that can be dealt with <Col N="864" /> in this way, you must have a home market&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For instance, there is the whole problem of feeding stuffs&mdash;whether it is advisable that we should, for all time, produce our own feeding stuffs or go back to complete freedom of trade, throwing the gates open and letting them come in from other countries, or whether there should be some compromise between the two extremes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Listening to the Minister the other day and reading the report, there seemed to me to be a touch of Dillionism about that statement. Deputy Dillon had been criticised to the fullest extent for saying exactly the same thing.  I am not criticising the Minister for making use of that. Wise man that he is, he knows that the day is coming and, with the usual astuteness typical of the Fianna Fáil leaders, who always put a buffer between themselves and the public, the members of this committee are the smokescreen behind which he makes the apologia, so to speak, for the policy as pursued during the last 12 years.  I want to be fair as regards that policy.  No other policy could have been pursued during the last five or six years, because war has no respect either for policies or politicians, but there will be a war which will be just as difficult, just as inhuman as the war that has now ended&mdash;a war of economics.  The force of economic pressure will compel a reversal of the policy.  It will compel the Government to pursue a different policy as indeed it has compelled and will compel greater countries than ours.  We cannot live within ourselves. That is definite.  We have not done it during the past five years.  No nation can.  Anyone who has read the report of the committee on post-emergency agricultural policy, even though it may not have been considered in its entirety as yet, cannot come to any conclusion other than that these men see that, perforce, the policy as pursued and that had to be pursued for the last five or six years must be altered to a very large extent if this <Col N="865" /> country is to continue giving to the people as a whole what is commonly called a decent standard of living.  I do not wish to enlarge on the findings or recommendations of that report. They are not new to me, I have heard them before.  I have heard the recommendations and some of the suggestions debated and thrashed out here since 1927, over and over again.</P>
    <P>It strikes me that in this country we think that by spending £10,000, £20,000 or £30,000 on certain things, we can change matters overnight.  That is not so.  There is no short road to success. There must be perseverance and, above all, there must be hard work. The people of this country must recognise the fact that a Government, no matter how good it is, cannot solve or nearly solve the difficulties confronting them, unless they have the full cooperation of the people and unless there is a desire on the part of the people themselves to help themselves and to make the necessary sacrifices in order to make good.  Everyone knows that after a great war world conditions change practically overnight. Science has made such progress during this war that many things that stood us in good stead during the last six years will vanish overnight.  That is why the Minister is very guarded in his references to this report.  He must wait until the members of that committee come to their final decision. Even then, we still will not be masters of the situation.  We will still have to consider the position in the world at large.  The Minister has made reference to the wheat scheme.  Everybody knows that that will not continue if the present rate is continued.  It may be a good policy not to bid the devil good-morrow before you meet him, but I think everyone of commonsense will agree that many of the things we held dear in this country&mdash;especially some of the things that Deputy Corry held dear; I do not see him here now&mdash;will have to go by the board, and that we will have to change our policy to suit the changed conditions that will exist in the course of a year or two.</P>
    <P>There are just one or two points which I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister in so far as they <Col N="866" /> affect the farmers of County Louth. Those farmers know their job, but the Minister has hardly been just to them. He knows that many of the farmers in North Louth grow beet, and he is also aware of the fact that when they get a return from the beet factory they find that the average cost of delivering a ton of beet to the nearest factory is somewhere in the region of 18/- to 20/-. I have figures here showing that one farmer sent something over 11 tons of beet to the factory and the cost was £11.  I readily admit that included tare.  I admit that, due to the bad weather at the end of the last harvest, possibly that beet was not just as clean as it might have been, but, even allowing for all that, the average cost per ton was somewhere in the region of 16/- to 18/-.  That is the cost to the man who saved his beet in tolerably good condition.  I think that is most unjust to the farmers of that county, who answered the S.O.S. sent out by the Minister calling on the farmers to grow beet in order to provide sugar for the people of this country since it could not be imported in the quantities in which it had formerly been imported.  It is most unfair that those farmers should be asked to pay from 16/- to 18/- per ton as against an average of 6/- to 8/- paid by the farmers who are in the vicinity of the factory.  In all justice, even at this late hour, I think the Minister should do something to meet the legitimate and fair demands of those farmers.  It is true that he gives a rebate of 2/- in the £.  That is very little.  I think the Minister could at least give a rebate which would mean that the cost to the farmers of Louth of sending their beet to the factory would not exceed 10/-. That would be some little inducement to them to continue to grow this most necessary crop, a crop which they have been growing for the last four or five years, and which, judging by the condition of affairs in the world at the moment, I presume they will have to continue to grow for the next few years.  Mind you, beet is not the great paying proposition that some people think it is.  I have seen the figures of a grower's costings and, in fact, he had very little for his own labour or that of his family.  I think the Minister <Col N="867" /> should endeavour to meet the demands that have been sent to him on numerous occasions by the members of the local committee of agriculture.</P>
    <P>The next matter to which I should like to direct the Minister's attention is the question of the potato problem there.  It must just be nothing short of heartbreaking to a section of the most hardworking farmers in the country, namely, the Cooley farmers, to see potatoes sold at anything from £13 or £14 to £18 a ton&mdash;in some cases they went to £20 a ton this year&mdash; while they have to deliver potatoes to the Cooley factory at £4 10s. 0d. a ton.  I readily admit that that £4 10s. 0d. means at least £6, because those potatoes are not picked; they are what is called in the rough, big and small.  That £4 10s. 0d. is as good as, say, £6 if they had to pick them for export.  But they are not allowed to export potatoes at the moment, and I think something should be done either by way of increasing the price or giving them some little bounty or subsidy on the quantity of potatoes which they have delivered to the factory this year, in view of the higher prices prevailing in other parts of the country.  Mind you, this area is scheduled primarily in order to safeguard the interests of potato growers in the rest of the State, and they get very little subsidy or consideration on that account.  If there is an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in a particular part of the country, stringent measures are taken at once to eradicate the disease, and the rest of the country has got to pay the cost in order to safeguard the industry all over.  I think something should be done to reimburse those men for the losses they have sustained this year, in view of the fact that the average price per ton in other parts of the country was so much higher.</P>
    <P>I think it would not be out of place to co-relate the position there with the suggestions which have been made here under the item dealing with veterinary research.  It is a good thing to see the Minister making extra provision for veterinary research.  Let us hope that some results will accrue <Col N="868" /> from this increased expenditure.  It sometimes happens that we are very ready to vote moneys, and we just leave it at that, fortified by the belief that everything in the garden will be lovely, and that we will not have to go out of our way to see that the advantages which are supposed to accrue will really accrue as a result of the spending of those moneys.  If it is going to take the veterinary people as long to make some improvement in the cattle industry and the horse-breeding industry as it has taken to eradicate the disease known as black scab in the Cooley area, then some of us will be as old as Methuselah before any progress has been made.  That is all I will say about that matter.</P>
    <P>It seems extraordinary that the poor should have to pay such an exorbitant price for potatoes while thousands of tons are being sent to the factories to be turned into alcohol.  The Minister knows that beet from that area is being sent to the beet factories, and as far as I know there has been no spread of the disease to the counties through which the beet passed.  Of course it is said that the disease is inherent in the soil.  That may be so.  Not being a professional man, I will not pit my opinion against that of those best qualified to judge those matters, but the disease has existed in that particular area for many years, and there seems to have been absolutely no progress made in regard to its eradication.</P>
    <P>Now, in connection with the policy of the Minister, I should also say that he will want to make great improvements, especially in regard to increased production of bacon, butter, etc.  It seems extraordinary to the ordinary man in the street that this country&mdash;I can make allowance for the war period &mdash;should be short of such things as bacon, butter, etc.  Now that the war is over and that possibly many of the factors that contributed to that shortage will be removed, probably we may hope for a very speedy improvement as far as the production of bacon and butter is concerned.  While on the question of bacon, may I respectfully suggest to the Minister that, strange as it may seem, one of the factors <Col N="869" /> which have contributed to the shortage of bacon is fuel.  I have been speaking to many farmers in County Louth and inquiring from them what was the reason for the shortage of pigs, bacon, etc.  One farmer said to me:&mdash;&ldquo;One of the things that prevent me from keeping pigs&mdash;I used to keep 20 or 30&mdash;is the fact that I have no fuel.  Turf is all right in its own way, but I am living in an area where it is scarce and I have to bring it from a distance.  It is not much good.  If we had a little coal, even with the shortage of feeding stuffs I would continue with the raising of pigs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would respectfully say to the Minister that he should suggest to the Taoiseach, now that possibly the period of long-range sniping with Mr. Churchill has passed, that the two of them might come together and as a result of the very nice sentiments which both expressed in their recent duel&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to point out that the scarcity of coal in this country was one of the factors responsible for the scarcity of bacon, and that the Minister might be in a position to use his good offices to bring about a <i>rapprochement</i> with the people on the other side so that we might get a few cargoes of coal which would enable the farmers to whom I have referred to rear more pigs and thus give us a little more bacon.  I make the suggestion with the best intentions and in all sincerity.  Agriculture is our chief industry and is one of the industries that must be kept going.  It is an industry that gives much-needed employment.  Whatever the reasons <Col N="870" /> are, it is regrettable to see the flight from the land.  I cannot understand it. There must be something responsible for it.  Reference has been made to wages, etc., and the difficulties in connection with milk production, such as getting men to milk on Sundays.  Men are brought up to do many jobs, and I do not subscribe at all to the statement made here in regard to the difficulty of getting men to work in the dairying industry.  I represent a county in which a good many cows are kept and I have heard no complaints in that respect.  After all, there must be men found to do certain things. They are brought up to them, just as men in other professions are brought up to do certain things.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is much use in magnifying the difficulties and stating that a certain kind of work is slavish. We all had to work in our day and we know all about hard work.  We know that there are certain types of work which must be done on Sundays.  There are many other classes of people who have to work on Sundays.  What about the woman in the house?  She has to work on Sundays; in fact she has to work morning, noon and night and, in some cases, never gets away for a holiday.  There are, of course, things which people would not work at for £1,000 a day.  Some people would not do the work of a steeplejack if they got a million.  But that is no reason why the steeplejack should ask for a million.  Men go down the mines because they have been brought up to it.  A miner would hardly ask for £1,000 a day.  It all depends on the spirit in which the people take it. Therefore, I do not think there is much point in magnifying these difficulties. They have to be faced.  After all, men engaged in the dairying industry know what they have to meet.  So far as I see, it is working very smoothly.  I do not think the Minister has any responsibility for these matters.  I do not see what he can do to make any change in regard to that.  It is a matter of human nature and the Minister cannot change human nature.  Human nature, being what it is, will remain what it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say <Col N="871" /> that we will have to change our policy bit by bit, we cannot just change it overnight.  But certainly many of the things that the Minister held dear during the past five or six years as parts of his policy will have to be dispensed with, willingly or unwillingly. He will have to be in a position to meet the changed conditions.  One thing is certain and that is that we cannot live within ourselves.  The policy of isolationism or any other 'ism must go by the board, not alone in this country but in every other country.  Having made up our mind on that point, there is no reason why we should not be in a position to carry on, or to muddle along if you like, in the future, as we have in the past five or six years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>My sympathies go out to the Minister because he has quite a lot to contend with.  We heard the Minister for Finance, the man who holds the purse in this country, state in the Dáil not so long ago that the farmers were rolling in riches.  Yesterday, in the Seanad, again he stated that they were never better off than they have been since 1939 and that they had millions in the banks.  Of course nobody is worried about people who have millions in the banks; nobody has any interest in how they get on because they are apparently well able to get on themselves.  Let us compare these statements, however, with the statement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce not long ago when he said that the stagnation in agriculture was due to under-capitalisation. When you compare the two statements it is obvious that there is some muddling between members of the Government on this matter and there should be an investigation into it.  One of them says the farmers are well off and have millions in the banks, while the other says that the industry is starved for want of capital. I would ask the Minister to refer that to the Taoiseach, as probably he could find a way out and would come to the decision that both were right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very little credit is given to the <Col N="872" /> Statistics Branch.  They have made a statement regarding the years 1931-42 that 48,000 people have left the land. Considering the wages given across the water, many more thousands must have gone in the past three years.  We also find statistics showing that in 1931-42 the number of sheep went down from 3,500,000 to 2,500,000; that poultry dwindled from 23,000,000 to 17,000,000; and that the number of pigs dwindled from 1,250,000 to 500,000.  In view of that, how can any man with commonsense make out that those people who live by live stock are better off than they were?  If it can be proved that they have more money in the bank now than they had when they had this live stock on hands, the fact must be that they got rid of their live stock, poultry and pigs and placed the money in the bank to earn 1 per cent. interest on it, which was greater than the profit they would draw from the live stock. We cannot come to any other conclusion, so it must be the correct one. My sympathy goes out to them, in view of the statements that other Ministers have made.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister is greatly concerned about agriculture, but he is up against these statements by other Ministers.  I am sure he realises as well as everyone else does that this country must stand or fall by its agricultural exports, that is, by the export of what we have to spare after feeding our own people.  Some people say the Minister should go hat in hand to England, but it is my opinion that he need not go hat in hand at all.  We are a creditor nation, as England has something like £400,000,000 of our money. We also have to import as well as to export, so the Minister should go to them and say that we have certain stuff to sell, good stuff of proper quality which they require, and that he wants to import certain things necessary for our people and is willing to buy from them.  There could be an agreement, without the Minister or the Government belittling themselves in any way.  Whether we hate one another or love one another, it will be a business proposition in the world to come.  We do not owe anything to these people and neither do they owe <Col N="873" /> anything to us&mdash;in their opinion&mdash;so that bargain could be made with them. It is up to the Minister to make the bargain and to get the best price he can.  They need the goods, so they must pay for them.</P>
    <P>A suggestion was made by Deputy Corry regarding a prices commission or a costings board.  A certain amount could be said in favour of that and something in that line is necessary.  I do not know how some of the farmers are managing to carry on at all, and I regret to say that, in some cases, it is just from day to day.  Some prices board should be set up to consider the cost of production and leave a reasonable margin of profit, as is left to other industries.  If that were done, production would be increased.  The people on the land, like any other section of the community, will do exactly what they think it is most profitable to do. Profit, in many cases, goes before patriotism, as people naturally look forward to the profit before they consider doing something which may be unprofitable for them.  During the war, the people on the land stood by the nation and in the vast majority of cases they did the work voluntarily, as the Minister will agree.  Naturally, there were some who had to be compelled, but there are those in every section of the people.  The farmers did their work well and they did not grumble a lot.</P>
    <P>If representatives of the producers were put on the costings board, they would be able to give evidence as to the cost of production on the land and the farmers would then feel that arrangements were being made so that they would be sure of a reasonable profit for their produce.  They would then be willing to do everything possible to increase production.  The Minister should not be led astray by the statements of his colleagues in other Departments regarding the money the farmers have in the banks. If he looks at the statistics, he will find that the amount of stock on hand has dwindled considerably.  That should not happen at present, when increased production is necessary.</P>
    <P>The war is over, but there is a war for trade coming on, where every <Col N="874" /> country will be struggling.  We are in the happy position that we were not involved in the war, our country was not ravaged by it, our people are here and willing to work and, if the Minister strikes out, I believe that the after-effects of the war will pass over us as lightly as the effects of the war itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am intervening in this debate not for the purpose of disagreeing with some of the points Deputy Donnellan made.  A lot has been said as to how the ills of the farmers might be cured.  The greatest harm we can do at present is to go too far in representing the farmers as being impoverished.  That is not the case at all.  I believe that farming is one of the most dignified and independent professions in the country.  Instead of speaking with that kind of inferiority complex, we should give the farmers every encouragement.  They should realise that it is really the finest profession, the finest calling and the most independent of any business in the country.  It certainly is that, because, after all, the farmer, if he pays his annuity and rates and looks after his farm, if it is a farm worth having&mdash;indeed, some of them are not &mdash;is his own master and manager; he is king of his own castle, and that cannot be said about any other section of the community.  He stands out on his own in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told about demonstration farms and how useful they would be if the State undertook them.  I do not think there is any need at all for demonstration farms run by State aid or under State supervision.  We have numerous demonstration farms all over the country worked by good farmers. I am quite sure Deputy Hughes has a farm that could be classified as a demonstration farm and that there are several other farms through the country that would serve just as useful a purpose, if our young men were taken to see them, even from the local schools, and shown how they are run. It would be a very good thing if the boys going to our primary schools in different parts of the country were occasionally taken on a visit to farms of that kind, led by the local agricultural <Col N="875" /> instructor who would point out to them how the work was done and, if there was any way by which he could show where the method of working might be improved, it would be very desirable and it would have a good effect.</P>
    <P>Some people are talking all the time about an improvement of live stock and poultry.  Of course, it is very necessary and quite right to give all possible assistance in this connection, but I feel it has been lectured on quite long enough to give the people a grasp of its true meaning, if they want to grasp that at all.  There is one thing we could lecture upon&mdash;and in this respect all our people should come together and the Department of Agriculture could assist, in conjunction with the Department of Education&mdash; and that is the important subject of pointing out to farmers how they can cut their losses.  I think that would go a long way to minimise the losses the farmers have to bear and it would also minimise the difficulties they have to contend with when they are called upon to pay their rent and rates and meet other liabilities.</P>
    <P>I hold that the greatest losses on all farms are to be found in the farm-house. That is no fault of the people there.  We talk of self-sufficiency, but self-sufficiency should be something in reality and not in name.  A farmer can produce almost everything that he requires for his own household, with the exception of tea, sugar, boots and clothes.  All other essential commodities, vegetables of all kinds and even meat of all kinds, can be produced by the farmer.  The difficulty is that instead of our housekeepers being in a position to cook properly and to make the fullest use of the commodities at their disposal, they are far behind, and that is not through any fault of their own, but because of lack of proper education.  If our girls are to be good housekeepers they must be properly trained in domestic economy, and it will take some time before we can attain that objective.  Housekeeping subjects should form part of the programme in the primary schools. If it is necessary, we should raise the <Col N="876" /> school-leaving age by one year and give the last year to a course in domestic economy and cooking.</P>
    <P>It is a hard thing to say, but nevertheless it is a fact, that there is not one in every ten of the housewives of this country who are capable of making country butter in a way that it would be marketable.  The real reason is that the young girls have not been properly educated in the making of butter.  There is no reason why creamery butter from the creamery districts should be utilised in any farmhouse.  We should have sufficient butter on our own farms, particularly on farms of 20 acres and upwards, to supply the needs of every household in the country.  We should also be able to rear and kill our own pigs and cure the meat in such a way that if we require rashers we will have them just as good as the costly rashers sold over the counter by the shopkeepers.</P>
    <P>Vegetables can be utilised in many ways.  We can get different kinds of vegetable soups in the restaurant in Leinster House and there is no reason in the world why our young girls could not be taught to prepare a dish equally as good for their own households. This is the type of education that is really necessary.  It does not matter whether a girl becomes a farmer's wife, a business man's wife, a tradesman's wife or a professional man's wife, or even goes into religion, it would be a very sound education and one that would pay back with interest. I say that because I believe it is true. I believe that with that form of economy in the household the annuities and rates that we hear so much about would be a very small item in the farmer's expenditure.</P>
    <P>In order to bring that situation about we will have to go a step further. There is no use in saying that all this fine cooking can be done in houses all over the country on the ordinary open hearth fire.  There is one place to-day in the agricultural community where there is really hard work and drudgery and that is in the kitchen of a farmer's house.  It is nothing short of slavery to have to cook food on an open hearth fire on a warm day in summer for the people employed on a farm.  It is the <Col N="877" /> greatest form of slavery.  We are told that will all pass away when our houses are electrified, when we have rural electrification; but it is very doubtful if electricity will be capable of doing all the fine things that we are told it will do.  I believe there should be a range installed in every house.  The roofs of the houses will provide a considerable amount of water if it is collected, and it should be collected and proper tank accommodation should be provided for the purpose.</P>
    <P>Whatever other things are necessary to give proper amenities to the people working inside the house must be provided. The people themselves cannot provide the capital for doing these things, but, if there is any form of loans for agriculture visualised, I believe this is one form of loan which could be given with very good results, and it should be given at the lowest possible rate of interest.  Until such time as something on these lines is in operation here, it does not matter what Government or what Party is in power, the losses will continue.  They will not diminish and they will represent a very serious set-back to the whole agricultural economy of the farmer.</P>
    <P>The farmer at present produces vegetables, but in many instances he does not use the vegetables he produces. He sells them and they are sent away. They come back in containers and are bought back again by the farmer at three times their price.  The greatest enemy the farmer has, and I believe the greatest enemy of any household&mdash; and it is in use almost every hour of the day&mdash;is the frying-pan.  The frying-pans in every household should be broken up, because they produce nothing but waste, and, furthermore, they do not provide the proper type of food from the medical point of view. If the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Education would set out on a campaign in this regard, they would do much to improve the lot of the farmers and particularly of the farmers' wives and daughters who are the real slaves.  There is no real hardship and no real slavery on a farm at present because all the work is done by horses or tractors.  Conditions now <Col N="878" /> are quite different from conditions when I was a youngster, when corn was cut with a scythe and threshed with a flail, and when hay was cut with a scythe and turned with hand-rakes, but the conditions under which other members of the farmers' household work have not changed.</P>
    <P>I hope wheat has come to stay and that it will be a permanent feature of our agricultural economy, but I think certain precautions will have to be taken.  Farmers have grown wheat and have grown it with profit.  Wheat-growing has been a success and it has been proved that wheat can be grown in this country as well as, if not better than, most countries, but one of the big drawbacks is the lack of proper storage accommodation.  There is also a lack of knowledge of how to deal with the crop.  It is a difficult enough crop to handle, and a number of farmers find it very difficult to understand when it is properly ripe, and, even if they do, it is very often not put together in a proper manner when cut and sufficient care is not taken with it.  The Minister and some of his officials have lectured from time to time and have given talks over the radio on how it should be handled, but the radio does not reach everybody. Very great care should be taken in the stooking of wheat or in making it up into small hand-stacks.  Some people take very little care with it at that time, with the result that there is a good deal of loss.</P>
    <P>Many farmers have not sufficient storage accommodation, and the wheat, when threshed, is often thrown into a barn or store two or three feet in height and the next thing they find is that it starts to heat.  I do not know whether the provision of storage accommodation for individual farmers, or an insistence on millers and wheat dealers having proper accommodation for it, would be the better and cheaper way of meeting the problem, but I think the latter would be the better course.  Millers should not be granted a licence to purchase wheat unless they have considerable storage accommodation as well as drying plant, and the same should apply to all wheat merchants who buy in a big way. <Col N="879" /> Under such a system, they would be enabled to take away the crop immediately it is threshed.  Further, it might be well, in order to induce farmers to dispose of their wheat, if, instead of giving the higher price in the latter part of the year, it were given in the earlier part of the year.</P>
    <P>I want to say again that the farmers are as dignified a set of people as any others and they are entitled to the gratitude of this nation for the great work they did during the past five years under a very great strain and the very great handicap of having to switch from one form of agriculture to another without the proper equipment. If we are to take our proper place in the post-war period, farmers will have to get proper equipment, for in no other way will they be in a position to compete with other countries which have equipment in the form of up-to-date machinery and implements.  If our farmers get that chance, if they are provided with proper implements and machinery&mdash;I do not suggest they should be provided free of cost&mdash;I believe they will be able to stand on their own feet and to stand with any other farming or agricultural community the world over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I always think the Agriculture debate is one of the most interesting we have.  This is an overwhelmingly agricultural country, and, as this Dáil is representative of the country, the members are in the main connected with agriculture.  So the Agriculture debate goes on for several days, winding up and down and in and out, and we get the point of view of the extremely technical farmer as well as the point of view of the small farmer; but, in spite of the interest of the debate, it never seems to make the Government do very much for agriculture.  I am not an agriculturist&mdash;I am a city man born and bred.  I represent a city constituency, but I start off by saying that I know, and have known for many years, that all life in this country comes from the land.  If the farmer is not prosperous the cities will not be prosperous.  In the last six years those of us who have lived in a city have <Col N="880" /> realised that, without the produce put on the market by the agricultural community, we might, and very probably would, have starved.</P>
      <P>Arising out of some of the things said by the last Deputy who spoke I would say that whilst we in the cities realise the debt that we owe to the farmer and give him full credit for having fed us in the last few years, the farmer, if he had to pay the bills that some of the city people have had to meet for these agricultural products&mdash;products for which we are grateful to him&mdash;he would know that we had contributed something to him that was a little bit more solid than just grateful thanks. I want to enlarge on that point.  The cities are the great home market for the agricultural community.  In all our Irish cities we have a large number of poor people.  Indeed, that position exists in all the cities of the world.  Some of those poor people are not able to consume the quantity of butter, milk and eggs that they would consume if they were available at a cheaper price.  I am a believer in a large turnover, and I am convinced that, if the volume of our agricultural produce could be substantially increased, we have here in our cities a large and relatively untapped market for its consumption amongst the poorer people.  I do not want Deputies to think that I want to drive down the price the farmer gets for his produce.  I do not.  I think I have too much intelligence to do that. I have said that we all live on the prosperity of the farmer.  Therefore, if he does not get an adequate remuneration for his goods and services we will all suffer, and so he must get a fair price.  But the price that he gets must be such that he can sell the maximum amount of his goods in the home market.  I am referring in that connection to the home market only, and not to the foreign market. I do not believe that that has been adequately realised.  Certainly, the Government has never done very much in pursuance of such a policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When considering the question of agriculture, there are certain points that must be kept in mind.  First of <Col N="881" /> all, it is the duty of the Government to encourage the good farmer and to help the backward, poor farmer, because in all communities we have the poor and backward brethren.  There is no doubt whatever but that in many areas our agricultural methods are very poor and backward.  It is the duty of the Government, I submit, to teach those people.  In my opinion, the backward agricultural methods of certain farmers are due to a variety of causes.  One may be due to the fact that a man may have an uneconomic holding.  What constitutes an uneconomic holding is, of course, size in the main, and also its geographical position.  A few acres of land close to Dublin may prove to be highly remunerative, because it is so near to our best market.  A holding of the same size in the West of Ireland could barely support a man and his family. All sorts of factors enter into what is an uneconomic holding.  There is the size of the holding, its geographical position, the amount of knowledge possessed by the farmer, lack of capital, or the possession of capital, the state of his buildings, stock and machinery.  All those factors enter into it, but the fact remains that due to a variety of reasons we have a number of such persons in our community.  I believe that until the Government takes its courage in both hands and recognises that there are large sections. of the agricultural community that must be brought up to the highest level of efficiency, we shall never increase, to any great extent, the volume of our agricultural production. I do not think that this Government has faced that question boldly and fearlessly.  It is bound to be a rather unpopular one, but I would say it is the high duty of the present Government to recognise where our weakness lies, and to do everything in its power to eradicate it.</P>
    <P>We have other aspects of agriculture to consider.  We have the foreign markets.  I should really say the foreign market, because the only outside market we have is Great Britain. About 12 months ago I read in the newspapers that long-term contracts had been made by the Governments of New Zealand, Australia, Canada and <Col N="882" /> South Africa with Great Britain.  I asked the Minister for Agriculture if there had been any negotiations between our Government and Great Britain as to the possibility of this country concluding similar agreements or contracts with Great Britain.  He told me that there had not been, and the reason he gave was that the prices offered were not considered remunerative. I have been quite seriously wondering during the past year how it was that the Australians, the New Zealanders, the Canadians and the South Africans, with the very high standard of living that obtains in those countries, could afford to take contracts on the British market which, we say, we could not afford to take because of the prices offered.  It seems to me that, judged as a Government and as an agricultural country, we ought to pull up our socks.  In that connection, I do not know how far our failure to make contracts was purely on the question of price, or whether other and, perhaps, more unpleasant factors entered into it.  I am not going to say that, since I do not know anything about it.</P>
    <P>The fact remains that here, within 60 miles of the greatest agricultural market in the world, as the Americans say, &ldquo;we are out-smarted&rdquo; by people who live thousands of miles away from that market.  I think the Government has failed in not putting these facts before the country.  One Deputy referred to the price of potatoes and contrasted the price paid for potatoes in the Dublin market and the price paid at the factory.  That is an example of what a big market there is for potatoes.  Surely the price would be somewhere between what is paid in the Dublin market&mdash;and that price is at present a scarcity price&mdash;and the price paid at the local alcohol factory. Something between these, £6 10s. and £20 per ton, should fairly remunerate farmers.  That is a matter with which the Government should deal with all the power at its disposal.</P>
    <P>I consider that we shall have great opportunities in this country of ours in the next few years to supply our own needs and to get for our agricultural surplus, a good price on the market in Great Britain.  But, in order to do <Col N="883" /> that, we will have to have all the assistance which the Government can give.  The paradoxical thing about this Government is that while it has always paid lip sympathy to the needs of agriculture, it has never done very much for agriculture.  It adopted a policy of &ldquo;Sow More Wheat&rdquo;, but, strange to say, that was part of its industrial policy.  It was not really and purely an agricultural policy; not what economists call a struggle between the cities and the country.</P>
    <P>Under the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government we have seen the interests of the country sacrificed all the time for the benefit of the cities.  The Minister for Agriculture knows as well as I do that the policy of this Government has been purely an industrial one.  It has not been an agricultural policy. Ireland is the most agricultural country in Europe, but for the last 12 years the Government has sacrificed the interests of agriculture to industry.  I speak as an industrialist but, in the long run, the present policy is not in the interests of industrialists, and it certainly has not been in the interests of the agricultural community.  In the years to come, years of which people are so much afraid, I trust we will have a much more intelligent policy on the part of the Government, one to assist those in the agricultural community who need education or financial help, and not a policy to hinder the many fine farmers who can do all the work that is required of them if they are only left alone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very gratifying to hear from a Deputy, who described himself as city born and bred, the high measure of appreciation he expressed towards farmers.  It is certainly gratifying to hear a man accustomed to city life speak so highly of those engaged in agriculture.  Deputy Dockrell's line of approach to this debate was very different from that of the Deputies who preceded him. Deputy Beegan and other Fianna Fáil Deputies, led by the Minister for Finance, stated that the farmers are a fine body of people, but I think, to put it very crudely, that attitude is one of hypocrisy.  The attitude displayed was that farmers were constantly <Col N="884" /> whinging, and crying out for something.  They are not.  That is not their attitude.  As a class Irish farmers answered the call of the Government and of the Dáil, and responded better than any other section when an appeal was made to them.  When the world war broke out farmers, regardless of their political views, went to work with a will to feed the population of our towns and cities, as well as the countryside, and, as a result, the Government was in a better position to provide for the people.  The most backward onlooker could see that a world conflagration was coming, yet the Government Departments concerned made no provision for an adequate supply of the fertilisers, raw materials and machinery required by farmers.  To put the matter in a nutshell, Government Departments were badly caught off guard when war broke out.  All they could then do was to appeal to farmers to come to the rescue and to save the country by providing food, fuel and clothing.  The farmers have done so unselfishly.  The provision of food was the big item.  In order to do that farmers had to draw on their resources and on the fertility of their land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was stated recently by the Minister for Finance that farmers have millions of money to their credit in the banks.  They may have millions in the banks, but if they have, it is as a result of cashing-in on the fertility of their land during the emergency.  It is a poor reflection on life on the land that farmers should be willing to put money in the banks at 1 per cent. interest, which is the rate they are paid, rather than reinvest it in the land.  A great many improvements are needed in the case of almost every farm-house in the Twenty-Six Counties.  If the farmer is to compete successfully, a much more extensive system of out-offices and other buildings must be provided. There must be more stock-houses, so that farmyard manure will be increased and used to restore the fertility of the land, which was stolen so that the towns and cities should not go hungry during the emergency period.  We have a very funny system operated by the Department of Local Government <Col N="885" /> by which, if a farmer erects an out-office or other agricultural building of any kind, his valuation is immediately increased.  Many Deputies from our Party have urged the Government to drop that policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, I should like to ask the Minister for Agriculture to urge upon his colleagues in the Cabinet that this policy, which is a legacy handed down since the days of the old landlords, when a man's rent was increased if he improved his land or buildings, should be dropped. A better design of, and additional, out-offices are much needed on practically every holding.  The Minister for Agriculture has a very definite part to play in this connection and the improvements are badly needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the distribution of the farm machinery which has come in during the past few years, only two threshing mills have been allotted to County Mayo this year.  Small Counties like Carlow, Louth and Leitrim will get the same number of machines as Mayo, which is the third largest county in Ireland.  I do not think that that is fair.  Doutbless, the Minister will tell me that the percentage of tillage is low in Mayo.  I do not think that that is so.  If he were to get accurate statistics, I think that he would find that the area under tillage is much larger than he thinks. Accurate returns have been denied to the Gárda Síochána in many areas since the emergency, due to a mischievous rumour which got about in the early days of the emergency, that if the farmers grew wheat, they would be allowed a small quantity per head and the rest would be taken by the Government for national purposes, the same thing applying to other crops. The way the average farmer met that was to avoid furnishing accurate returns.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the position.  I do not ask him to distribute the machinery according to the size of the county, as there is a big acreage in Mayo of waste land&mdash; mountain and water&mdash;but I ask him to <Col N="886" /> distribute the machines on the basis of acreage under tillage.  That would be the fairest way.  It is only about nine or ten years since farmers became tractor and threshing-mill conscious there.  Prior to 1935 there were not half-a-dozen threshing mills in Mayo. Since then the people have been gradually getting into the habit of using up-to-date machinery, but the war caught them, more or less, off their guard.  I ask the Minister to distribute the machinery on the basis of acreage under tillage, because it is not fair to give the same quota of machinery to a small county as to a large one.</P>
    <P>I raised a question in the House some time ago about prosecutions for using tractors without pneumatic tyres on the roads.  I know that that is definitely illegal, but it had to be done to meet the emergency situation, due to lack of rubber.  I know that tractors used in this way are harmful to roads, but great care was taken not to damage the tarred surface.  Since I raised the matter there has been no prosecution for this offence, and I hope that that situation will continue until the rubber situation becomes easier and the problem can be properly met.</P>
    <P>As regards the veterinary side of the Minister's Department, a few diseases which were fairly rare some years ago are now definitely on the increase in many parts of the country.  These diseases include Louping III, which is ravaging the sheep flocks very badly. I spoke on the same subject last year and I put a few questions to the Minister in the course of the year with a view to having produced at home the vaccine necessary to meet the situation. I regret that nothing has been done in the matter.  Some of the diseases to which I referred last year are so much on the increase that cattle are now known to be suffering from them.  I have received letters from sheep owners in every part of the county.  One man, who had 600 sheep, had, up to mid-April, lost 120 through &ldquo;trembles.&rdquo;  The veterinary surgeons in the area are quite able to cope with the disease if the Minister would arrange with the Minister for Local Government to get a permit to permit <Col N="887" /> of the importation of the necessary vaccine or serum to meet the situation. I think that the Minister told me last year that the vaccine prepared previously in England, Scotland and America carried the virus of another disease with it.  That has since been overcome, I understand.  I have it on good authority that a small outlay would provide all the vaccine and serum required by the whole veterinary service.  I hope that the arrangements the Minister has made regarding Thorndale will include provision in connection with this matter and that this will be made at the earliest opportunity. In the meantime, I ask him to get in touch with whatever Government Department has the granting of permits for the importation of vaccines and serums, with a view to relieving the situation by allowing in as much as is required to meet the immediate needs.  Some farmers along the west coast and in the mountainous area of Connemara are being robbed by the inroads which this disease is making.</P>
    <P>I spoke last year on the growing of wheat.  A very definite line of knowledge is needed for the correct growing of what.  I am afraid that we have lost much of the knack of making a success of wheat-growing, compared with our knowledge in connection with the growing of oats, potatoes, turmps and other crops.  Once again I ask the Minister, where land is low-lying or wet or of an acid nature, to see that his inspectors suggest to the people that they should grow spring wheat instead of winter wheat.  In a great many cases the growing of winter wheat has been sheer waste of a good food.  In moorland districts, particularly, because the temperature was too low, winter wheat failed to germinate, and if the wheat policy is to be continued, which I hope it will, I ask the Minister to have pointed out to the people the wisdom of growing spring wheat in certain districts.  In certain spots which are of a dry, sandy nature and in which the soil is warm and free from acid, winter wheat would be a great success.  In those areas the matter should be left to the discretion of the tillage inspectors, <Col N="888" /> because most of them I have met are very capable men and have very good knowledge of the crops and of wheat, in particular.  I think that it could be safely left to their discretion to decide in what portions of the county wheat-growing could not be successfully undertaken and to increase the quota in other areas where crops are heavy and where loss would not be caused to the farmers.  They are gradually getting into it, and once that happens wheat will not be such a loss as it was in the earlier years when we did not know so much about it and when the growing of wheat sometimes meant a dead loss to the farmer concerned.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to hear Deputy Beegan backing me up in a matter that I brought to the Minister's attention some time ago, and that was in regard to the drudgery that women on the farms have to endure.  The Deputy, I suppose, had particular reference to Galway, and perhaps it is true there, but it certainly is true of most parts of the country, and although I do not see how that matter is concerned with this particular debate, I must say that I was very pleased to hear the Deputy backing me up on that matter and pointing out that a great deal of the drudgery of women in farmers' houses could be removed if some more facilities or amenities, such as hot water, electricity, and so on, were provided on the farms.  However, I shall not go further into that matter, as I do not think it is appropriate to deal with the subject in connection with this particular Vote.</P>
    <P>I think that the farm improvements scheme was one of the best schemes introduced by the Department of Agriculture for many years.  The pity is that it cannot be given a much wider extension, because it is one of the methods by which the farmers could improve the amenities of their holdings of land, their farmyards, outbuildings, and so on.  At the present time, it seems that the scheme is pinned down to a very narrow circle and I would ask the Minister to widen its application because in any case <Col N="889" /> where farmers have taken advantage of the scheme it has made a vast improvement in the whole countryside. Where farms had formerly been in a bedraggled and neglected condition, this scheme has made a huge change in areas where the farmers were wide awake to the benefits of the scheme and took advantage of it.</P>
    <P>I think that that is all I have to put before the Minister, but there is one matter that I should like to stress in closing, and that is that I hope the Minister will take into account what the farmers have done during the emergency, at his call and at the Government's call, and that now that the period of emergency is coming to a close and that restrictions will be going off, he will lay down some post-war plan by which the farmers may be enabled, as soon and as rapidly as possible, to restore the fertility of the land which has been so sadly depleted during the emergency.  It is up to the Minister to see to that.  The farmers responded to the appeal of the Government.  I think that even the city Deputies will admit that the farmers, during the emergency, stood between us and disaster.  There may be a period of depression after this war, as there was after the last war.  I hope not, but it is on the shoulders of the Minister and his Government alone that the responsibility will fall of seeing that our principal industry will not suffer now that the war is drawing to an end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colbert</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather surprised to notice that Deputy Blowick, in the course of his remarks, found fault with those who expressed the view that the average farmer in this country is well off to-day.  I think that that attitude of mind, if it is accepted throughout the country, will do great injury to the farmers as a whole.  It will affect the farmer's credit; it will affect the dignity of his position, and it also will reflect upon the chances of his children in their efforts to find employment away from the land.  Every one of us, I am sure, and the individual farmer, at any rate, would like it to be known that he is comfortable and well off, and even if he is not doing as well as <Col N="890" /> he would like, he does his best to conceal that fact.  I hope, therefore, that the attitude of mind to which I have referred will be corrected, because it is not doing any good to the farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I represent a constituency in which dairying is the main industry, and I propose to confine my remarks to matters affecting that particular industry. It is generally accepted that dairying is the foundation of our whole cattle trade in this country, and to a great extent it is the foundation of our whole agricultural economy.  For that reason, it is essential that the dairy farmer should be guaranteed such a price for his produce as will enable him to run his business on a successful basis, because if any decline should occur in the dairying industry, it will have repercussions on every branch of the agricultural industry here. Reference has been made to the setting up of a prices commission, or a commission dealing with costings.  There is already in existence a commission dealing with wholesale and retail prices, and endeavouring to determine what is an economic price for agricultural produce.  Many farmers claim that to-day they are not receiving an economic price for their milk, and milk is the main item of their output.  The only way to determine that is by creating or setting up an authority or body of experts who will be in a position to examine all the factors connected with the position and who will publish from time to time what they consider is a fair price for all these items.  To my mind, that is the only way to approach the problem.  In that connection, one thing that occurs to me is that the present price of 10½d. a gallon for milk delivered at the creameries during the summer months, which has now been in existence for over two seasons, is one that calls for revision.  During that period overhead costs have advanced considerably and many farmers have had to face various difficulties, particularly in regard to a supply of suitable labour.  I know that that is one of the farmer's greatest difficulties at the moment.  Whether it is due to modern ideas or not I cannot say, but I do know that young boys and girls, who used to be prepared to <Col N="891" /> milk cows for a farmer on a Sunday, are not prepared to do so now.</P>
    <P>I know of the case of a boy who was going to work for a farmer and who, on concluding the contract, said to the farmer that he would do no Sunday work.  The farmer asked him would he have his meals on Sunday, and the boy said that he would.  The farmer then said to him: &ldquo;How do you expect the cow to produce milk and butter for you if you will not milk her?&rdquo; However, this boy said he was not prepared to do any Sunday work. That is the position.  Dairy farming has been declining for that reason. We had a similar situation towards the end of the last European war.  I remember the British Government set up a commission at that time to inquire into the causes of the decline that had set in in the dairying industry. I gave evidence before the commission in Limerick in 1918.  I do not know if there was ever a report published, as the Black-and-Tan war put an end, I think, to the activities of that regime.  In any case, the general view held was that the difficulties of providing suitable labour, coupled with the higher prices for dry stock, were the two main factors responsible for the decline at that time.  In my own experience of the period, having an average of 70 cows milking, we found it necessary to install a milking plant.  At the time it was a complete innovation and we were rather dubious about the success of it.  Nevertheless, we found it fully successful.  It was working successfully until the Black-and-Tans came and smashed it.  I shall not refer to that further than to say that it added considerably to our difficulties.</P>
    <P>The present price of butter, at 2/4 per lb., in my opinion, is rather low. It is the cheapest fat in the market to-day, cheaper, I believe, than cart grease.  There is certainly room for some increase there if, by doing that, we could bring up the price of milk to an economic level.  The main problem is to determine what is an economic price for the produce of the dairy farmer&mdash;that is, as far as the average farmer is concerned.  I realise <Col N="892" /> that there are factors affecting the position of one farmer which might not obtain in the case of another farmer. One may have his own help, whereas another may have to employ hired labour.  I am speaking of the farmer who has 20, 25, 40 or 50 or more cows in his herd.  Where the smaller herds are concerned, there is usually sufficient family labour to milk the cows.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bennett, in the course of his remarks, referred to the crossing of breeds.  I am sure he had in mind the Live-Stock Breeding Act.  As he knows, that Act was introduced by a former Minister for Agriculture and, whatever may be said about the merits of it, I do not think the present Minister can be blamed for its ill-effects. My own view, as a result of personal experience, is that the old dual purpose bull was a greater success than the pure-bred dairy Shorthorn.  As a result of experience and from a knowledge of the characteristics of the milking strains, we were able to produce a good average milking cow and also a good quality store beast. People maintain to-day that we have neither milk nor beef.  Nevertheless, so far as crossing is concerned, that does not affect foundation stock.  I have had experience of breeding successfully from an Aberdeen Angus bull and Shorthorn cow.  The Aberdeen Angus produced a high-class store beast that commanded a ready market.</P>
    <P>As we all know, there is a good deal of drudgery connected with dairy farming, and any schemes that have for their object the removal or the relief of that drudgery should be worthy of consideration.  It is to be hoped that when the electrification scheme is extended to rural areas that farmers will avail of it and take in current for light and power.  That should help to brighten things on the farm considerably. In the same way, farmers should avail to the fullest possible extent of the farm improvements schemes for the purpose of improving stalls, yards and farm premises generally.  We have to concern ourselves with improving the amenities of life in the rural areas, otherwise I am afraid we <Col N="893" /> cannot get our young people to take an interest in farming.</P>
    <P>As I am on that question, I should like to express the view that one of the great essentials is more and more housing and more labourers' cottages and plots.  In times gone by we solved our social and economic problems in rural Ireland through the medium of the emigrant ship.  We hope that we shall have sufficient brains and energy from now on to solve these problems in some other way.  In the average family of, say, five boys and three girls away back in the 70's or 80's the oldest boy was intended for the land. No other member of the family could find room there.  In time, the second boy and the eldest girl went to America and after some years they sent home the passage money for other members of the family.  The second girl, perhaps, got a fortune and was married into some other farm, the third boy also got sufficient money to enable him to marry into a place, the <i>cleain isteach,</i> as it is described, and the remaining members of the family followed the others across the Atlantic. That was, roughly, the way in which families were settled in those days. There is no reason why one of these boys should not become entitled to a cottage and plot on his father's land, or on some neighbouring farmer's land, where there would be sufficient acreage; it would be an incentive to him to settle down at home.  When housing is not available there is no such incentive.  We saw the energy of the labouring boy and the small farmer's son in the non-building period from 1914 to 1932.  When he wanted to settle down he built for himself any kind of shack and in the majority of cases these men raised large families in such hovels.  You have them still in existence all over the country to-day.  The desire of young people is to stay at home and work at home, if they are given the facilities and the encouragement to do so.  In conclusion, I should like as a Deputy to pay a tribute to the farmers throughout the country for their magnificent response to the appeal to produce food for the nation during the emergency and I would also like to pay <Col N="894" /> tribute to the Minister for Agriculture for the help and guidance which he has extended to every section of the agricultural community throughout the whole period of the emergency.  He has occupied a position equal in importance to that of the Minister for Supplies, and I feel that he deserves the congratulations of Deputies of all Parties in the House as well as the community as a whole for his services during this trying period in our history.</P>

      <P>In the debate to-day and yesterday some remarkable assertions were made by Deputies who, in my opinion, did not give thought to what they said.  This evening a generous tribute was paid to the farmers of the country for the excellent way they have supported the Minister's tillage policy and thereby ensured the production of food for the people of the country in the emergency period.  It was, however, asserted that the Government had given more attention to the industrial policy than to the agricultural policy.  As a farmer, I can assert that there is another side to that story.  I am old enough to remember the days when the farmer's produce was sold in a limited market at a price over which the farmer had no control.  I have seen&mdash;any farmer who wants to be honest about the position will admit that he has seen&mdash; farmers having to hawk their corn around trying to get it off their hands. I have seen, ten or 15 years ago, pigs being sold at as low a price as £1 a cwt. and even at a lower figure.  I have seen combines of buyers at fairs who left the farmers there all day until it suited them to start buying and then they bought at their own price. If the Government has given attention to the industrial policy, they have been very consistent in doing it.  The industrial policy and the agricultural policy in this country are inter-dependent. Thank God, as a result of the combined industrial and agricultural policy, the Irish farmer to-day has got what he is entitled to.  He has some control over the home market and the home market is not subject to external influence.  It is to the mutual advantage of the <Col N="895" /> industrialist and the farmer to help each other.  The industrial concerns that have been established in this country are helping out the home market and every worker put into employment in industry in this country means, in due course, an extra purchaser and an extra family to purchase agricultural goods.</P>
      <P>A Deputy this evening stated that our policy of self-sufficiency cannot be continued.  I say we can go further on the road of self-sufficiency.  If people would realise the benefit of the policy we have been pursuing it could be further promoted.  I have here a leaflet published in 1931.  I would not put it before the House but for the fact that it answers, I think, the industrial policy <i>versus</i> agricultural policy question.  It is stated in this leaflet:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We will feed our people with Irish bacon, Irish beef, Irish mutton, Irish eggs, Irish butter, Irish cheese, Irish poultry and Irish fish, and then we shall circulate in the home-land the following sums lost every six months under present policy:&mdash;</P>

      <P>From a leaflet published in 1931 by the Irish Grain Growers' Association.  I do not introduce that in any controversial way, but merely in reply to a Deputy and to try to get him thinking along the line that in promoting and strengthening our industrial arm we are making it possible to provide a home market for these commodities.  In fact, the Irish farmer, if he rises to the occasion&mdash; and he has done so to some extent&mdash; can control exports.  The Irish farmer could produce more of some of the commodities that have been mentioned and that appear to be in short supply. In the case of butter, we know that far more butter is being used at home at the present time than was formerly used because other fats have not been available, such as margarine, etc.</P>

      <P>I think the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is in control.  Even when Deputy Morrissey was in the Chair I abided by the ruling of the Chair.  I will leave the representatives of the creamery districts to speak for themselves. <Col N="897" /> I come from a non-creamery district.  If Deputy Morrissey wants more butter&mdash;and I should like to see more butter being made available&mdash;I suggest that the surplus home butter that is at present being produced in many non-creamery areas might be collected, remanufactured, stored and released at the proper time on the market.  That would relieve the butter situation.  Undoubtedly it is a fact that in the Midlands on many farms there is a surplus of butter.  They have more than they can readily sell in the local market.  Something should be done about that.  I have been speaking to farmers who have told me that within the last fortnight or so they have been buying extra calves to use up the surplus milk following on favourable conditions, due to growth of grass.  The accusation was made to-day that the Minister merely muddled through.  We have reached a stage when such statements should not be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we can congratulate the Minister on the policy which he has encouraged the people to pursue in the matter of supplying our own bread needs, for instance.  That is a good policy.  The only fault I have to find with it is that the compulsory regulation was not introduced a year or two sooner.  I think it is to the shame of a certain small section of the farmers that, in the last two years of the emergency, they had to be forced to do what it was obviously their job to do.  It is our duty to produce food for our people, and there should be no relaxation in the control of the wheat acreage, no matter what anyone may say.  Whatever variation may be made in regard to other crops in the post-emergency period, I hope the Minister for Agriculture and the Government will insist on maintaining our wheat acreage.  It can be done, because artificial manure will be in more plentiful supply.  There will also be extra farmyard manure, and the farmers can avail themselves of the system of green manuring.  By that I mean ploughing up the land after taking off a crop of hay.  One of the most successful farmers in the Midlands, who lives within a few miles of my home, produced between 18 and 20 barrels of <Col N="898" /> wheat on ground from which he took first or second crop hay the year before and ploughed down the aftergrass in early autumn.  He did that in order to manure his land, because on account of the extra tillage he had not sufficient farmyard manure.</P>
    <P>I was very sorry to hear two or three farmers yesterday evening denounce agricultural co-operation.  I cannot understand why Irish farmers should denounce what is likely to be one of their greatest assets in the years ahead of us.  Other countries have been held up to us as examples of what co-operation can do in securing for the farmers agricultural implements, manures and seeds, etc., at cheaper rates, as they are entitled to; but still our farmers get up here and denounce agricultural co-operation.  I will not say any more about it at this stage, because I do not want to prolong the debate unduly.  On some other occasion, we may get a chance of going further into the matter.</P>
    <P>The question of the farm improvements schemes has been raised, and I wish to congratulate the Minister and his Department on the great progress which has been made in that regard. I should like to direct the Minister's attention to one statement of his which, I hope, was a slip.  He said: &ldquo;There is a temporary scheme in connection with farm improvements&rdquo;.  I would suggest to the Minister that instead of regarding that as a temporary scheme it should be put on a definitely permanent basis.  Very much remains to be done, even allowing for the good progress which has been made all over the country, progress to which Deputies on all sides of the House paid tribute.  It is obvious to anyone who takes an interest in the farming industry that excellent work has been done in the majority of homesteads. Where you had thrifty farmers, who had their own help and worked as a team, those schemes have effected a transformation on hundreds of farms all over the country, but I would suggest that there is a ten years' programme ahead of us in the clearing of ditches, the improving of drainage conditions, and so on, as covered by the scheme.  I was very glad to hear the Minister suggest that the <Col N="899" /> scheme is being widened to include the putting up of walls as a source of shelter for cattle, and as a place where extra manure can be secured by bringing the cattle to that point for shelter for feeding.  In this connection, I would suggest that, when that is an approved part of the scheme, such shelters, if placed in proximity to the farmyard, could be converted into lean-to sheds, which would have the advantage of affording extra shelter to cattle.</P>
    <P>I am one of those who were sorry that the old Board of Works system of helping the farmers to improve their farms, to build outoffices, or even to improve their own homes, was done away with.  That did not happen in this Government's time; I think in the previous Government's time that scheme was on the way to discontinuance. I had experience of that particular scheme, and I am aware that it helped many farmers to provide themselves with much needed outoffices, barns and lofts, and also dwelling houses.  It was on a long-term basis. A barrel of wheat at the present time would almost pay the annual sum which would have to be repaid for £100 at the then rates.  I do not think the present system of loans from the Agricultural Credit Corporation is in any way comparable to that.  When I say that, I am prepared to hear arguments to the contrary, but from my experience I would say that there is a great necessity for making long-term loans available to the farmers for such purposes.  The farmers cannot do without his ordinary working capital, and if he wants to build a new barn or a new storehouse of any kind it very often happens that the Agricultural Credit Corporation will not grant him a loan.  I think that is a matter which should be looked into.  Where a farmer is obviously in a position to repay such an improvement loan, he should be given better facilities than are available at present.</P>
    <P>In regard to the subsidy of 2/6 per barrel on wheat produced in the last two or three years, a subsidy which is intended to be used by the farmers for the purchase of manures to restore fertility <Col N="900" /> to wheat lands, I should like to know from the Minister whether his Department has compiled returns from the various wheat producers.  I know that in some cases the farmers have mislaid their certificates.  Then, when the time comes, if a farmer had mislaid his certificate for wheat produced two years ago it would be rather unfair to deprive him of the subsidy.  Therefore, it would be well that the returns from the various millers should be in the hands of the Department right through.  The reason I raise the question is that I have been asked by quite a number of farmers about this extra manure scheme and when the distribution of the money will take place.</P>
    <P>I thoroughly approve of the Government's policy in regard to wheat, beet and other crops.  I think our beet acreage should be maintained and even increased.  I think certain producers of beet are not getting a fair crack of the whip.  These farmers are growers in the Carlow factory area, who live 30 or 40 miles, as the case may be, from that factory.  In the case of the other three factories, there is a very much higher rebate on railway freights.  In the Carlow factory area they only get 2/- of a rebate on the freight paid from the station to the factory.  I think that unfair discrimination should be got over somehow. I speak on behalf of farmers who have been growers of beet since the outset in the Carlow factory area. I think that matter deserves sympathetic consideration, because in years to come we will have to rely on those who, through thick and thin, have been tillage farmers, to keep up our beet acreage.  It is the good tillage farmer who will keep our factories going.  A number of farmers have gone in for beet growing in recent years.  I hope they will continue to grow beet, but I am afraid that if and when times are easier they will be inclined to allow their land to revert back to grass, and because there is a good deal of trouble connected with beet growing, the acreage under beet will be the most likely to drop.  The matter I have referred to, therefore, should be dealt with in some way, because, in the case of the farmers for <Col N="901" /> whom I can speak in the midlands, even though the beet is sent to the Tuam factory, it amounts to a handicap on them as compared with farmers living within four, five or six miles of the factory at Carlow, of from £2 to £5 or £6 per acre.  Therefore, I think there should be a levelling-up process.</P>
    <P>I have suggested that the wheat acreage should be maintained.  If the wheat acreage is to be maintained on a compulsory basis, the Minister should give consideration to the question of an improvement in the price of barley, without prejudice to the wheat crop, because I think, from my own experience and the experience of farmers generally, that 1 cwt. of good barley is value for £1, even for pig or cattle feeding.  The maltsters could well afford to pay the extra 5/-, even if the farmers were asked to give the extra 5/- for barley for feeding purposes.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that the Minister is paying special attention to the agricultural colleges.  I am glad he has made increased provision for the college at Pallaskenry, County Limerick, and I am sure the grants made available for the Salesian Fathers for the great work they are doing for the sons of farmers, are a step in the right direction, because there will be a greater opportunity for farmers' sons who want to go back to their father's farm, or even become the owners of a new farm.  They will be able to acquire the technical knowledge which they require, just as people in other walks of life require to get the best education possible for their avocations.  I cannot agree with some of the farmer speakers who decry the value of agricultural education.  I agree that there is no way in which these people can get a practical education better than on the land.  But there is none of us but can learn something.  When youths are sent to one of these colleges at the right age, for a year, they will acquire a knowledge of up-to-date methods and get a general training which will be very useful to them when they go back to carry on as farmers.  Up to the present, the agricultural colleges were being availed of chiefly by persons for the purpose of qualifying <Col N="902" /> as agricultural instructors or for positions on the staff of the Department. A small percentage of them only went back to work on their holdings.  It is to the credit of the Minister and the Government that they are widening the scope of these colleges.  I hope that, not alone at the Pallaskenry College, but in the other colleges, extensions will be made in the future when further building can be undertaken so as to give in the different provinces a greater chance to farmers' sons to get even a year's training after they leave school so that they may be better and more progressive farmers.</P>
    <P>This Estimate is one of the most important which comes before the House.  So far as the people I can speak for are concerned, I can say that they are satisfied with the Minister's policy.  The Minister has done his best in very trying circumstances. Now that the emergency is coming to a close, it can be said that it was lucky for us that the farmers had been initiated into what was almost a lost art, namely, the production of wheat. We were told in the Dáil and elsewhere that wheat could not be produced in this country, but time has proved otherwise.  Thank God.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to resist the temptation to reply to some of the points made by the last speaker.  I wish to ask the Minister if he would take steps to deal with one particular matter in connection with the transport of grain&mdash;and, particularly, of wheat&mdash;in the harvest time.  I would like to impress on the Minister the considerable loss in grain on account of transport not being available and the grain having to be kept over for a considerable time.  It may have been in good condition when it left the threshing mill and before it was taken from the farmer's haggard, but by the time it reached the mill it was not in good condition.  If grain is left around in the farmer's haggard, in the canal stores or in the railway stores, before it reaches the mills, there is a further loss.  Not only is there a loss in grain, but&mdash;what is of considerable importance at present&mdash;there is sometimes serious damage done to sacks.  I can <Col N="903" /> assure the Minister that the position last year was far from satisfactory.</P>
      <P>Not only was there a considerable shortage of road, rail and canal transport, but some of the types of wagons provided for the cartage of wheat were very unsuitable, and grain which left the haggard in good condition arrived in the mills in bad condition, and it was the farmer who had to suffer for that.  I recognise the transport difficulties that exist, but I would like the Minister to urge on those responsible for public transport services to do what they can to improve the position. One of the greatest difficulties in transport is that, at the busiest point of the harvest season, the three most important harvest items are dovetailed. There is grain, fuel and beet, and the demand comes on the transport services for them at the one time.  I am informed that beet has priority over wheat for transport.  I would be glad if the Minister would say if that is true, as it seems very surprising if it is.  Beet is a far less perishable commodity than wheat and is not as easily damaged and, while the beet is of great importance, I do not think it is quite as important as wheat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Morrissey has just concluded, I will deal with his point first.  I know that, at the end of the last harvest, there was considerable trouble with regard to the transport of grain.  I need hardly assure the Deputy that we were very troubled about the matter, and I made every possible inquiry and tried to use every possible influence to get the thing right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was satisfied, from the inquiries I made, however, that it was absolutely unavoidable.  There was not as much heavy internal traffic in this country ever before, I was assured.  It was not possible to get any increase in fuel and also we had only a certain number of railway engines and wagons and a certain number of lorries; and they were all kept going full-time, as far as we could, but they just could not keep up with the demand.  I think <Col N="904" /> the difficulty lasted only for a couple of weeks at the very peak of the season, and after about ten or 12 days the railway company assured my Department that they were in a position to deal with everything satisfactorily&mdash;and they did so from that on. I hope that we may be better prepared in the coming year, though I do not think we can do much more.  I am not sure if one could say that beet gets priority over grain.  I know that the transport company undertakes to deliver so much beet per day to each factory and I suppose they try to keep that up as far as they can.  I agree with Deputy Morrissey that wheat is sometimes more important, but I suppose the company tries to keep both things going.  Anyway, I promise to keep the matter under observation for the coming year again.</P>
      <P>I took a considerable number of notes on this debate, and hope I will deal with most of the points raised, and that Deputies will forgive me if by chance I overlook anything.  Naturally, the question of price was of great importance to most speakers.  I wish to point out some difficulties, but I would like Deputies to keep in mind what I said at the beginning of the debate&mdash;that is, that I am in favour in principle of fixed prices, guaranteed markets and regulated marketing.  At the same time, it is not so easy to apply that principle to certain commodities. One of the things mentioned was oats.  I am afraid it would be impossible to bring oats under that principle.  For instance, Deputy Keating complained that the buyers of oats in County Wexford last autumn were reluctant to buy at all, even at the minimum price of 21/-, and that they took only the very first quality at that price and left the rest on the farmers' hands.  That is true.  In the previous year&mdash;or, perhaps, even two or three years previously&mdash;we had a maximum price as well as a minimum price, and they did not observe the maximum price, but paid far more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department could not compel merchants to take oats even at the minimum price, if they did not want to take it; neither were we able to <Col N="905" /> prevent people paying more than the maximum, when we had a maximum. Therefore, I am afraid oats is one of the things which must be left out, in any arrangement for price fixing.  The point about oats is that it does not conform to the conditions I laid down at the beginning of the debate.  The bulk of it is used at home, but it is not used for human food.  The greater part is used for animal feeding.  Also, there is no particular marketing organisation for the portion that is sold, and it would be almost impossible to draw up one, as it is sold at every market and to so many buyers, and those buyers sell to so many different consumers.  It is not like wheat, which has only one destination, the mill, and the number of millers is comparatively few.  Barley has one destination as far as malting is concerned, though, of course, part of the surplus goes to feeding stuffs.  Beet has only one destination, the beet factories, and they are easy to deal with.  But oats goes to so many people and is used for such a variety of purposes that it would be impossible to do anything about it.  I think we must face the fact that it must be left to find its own level, that is, it must be left to the ordinary law of supply and demand.</P>
    <P>The point was made about barley that we had fixed a price of 35/- a cwt., and should have fixed a higher one.  I quite agree with any Deputy who spoke on that matter that we could have fixed a higher price and could have made an order that the brewer or distiller would pay more for his barley. That is quite a simple matter to arrange, but all the barley did not go for that purpose.  In fact, I think I can say truthfully that if we had fixed the price for barley last year at 40/- or 45/- and then told the maltsters to buy what they wanted at that price, a very bad position would have been created in the barley trade.  We fixed the price at 35/- and we got the maltsters to agree to take all the barley that was offered and we gave a guarantee to the maltsters that we would see them through.  What happened was that the brewers took a certain amount, the distillers took a certain amount and a certain amount went <Col N="906" /> back for seed, but there was a fair amount left over and that has to be absorbed gradually into feeding stuffs. Although Deputy Gorry has just said that he believes barley is worth £1 per cwt. for feeding, I do not believe it is, and the manufacturers of feeding stuffs do not think so either.  They could take it very gradually and incorporate it into mixtures and be in a position to sell those mixtures for animal feeding and poultry feeding at 17/- or 18/- a cwt.  It is obvious, however, that if they have to sell this mixture at 17/- or 18/- a cwt., they could put in only a very small proportion of barley at 20/-. That is the position of barley.  There is a surplus and it is quite likely there will be a surplus next year also.</P>

      <P>That firm got barley from Britain and the finished product from that barley was sent back to Britain.  That is a different matter altogether.  Britain wanted Guinness to brew beer for them and for that purpose Guinness got the barley. When I speak of a surplus, I mean there was a surplus of home-grown barley over and above what was required for brewing and distilling for home consumption.  We want barley; but at the price that obtains we cannot absorb it very rapidly because the feeders will not pay the price.</P>

      <P>The Deputy wants to know why we did not let farmers buy barley, one from another.  The year before last we had not enough barley for brewing and distilling for home use and possibly for supplementing bakers' flour.  We thought that as long as barley was needed for human consumption it should not go for stock feeding and, therefore, that a farmer should not be allowed to buy barley from another farmer for stock feeding until we could be sure there was enough.  The same thing applied last year and that was the reason the regulation was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The barley is going to feeding-stuff manufacturers now.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, so far.  I do not know whether a case could be made for selling direct to farmers.  The price of beet was referred to and the point made was that the 17½ per cent. was too high a target for any farmer to reach.  I do not think that is of any great importance, because the price is fixed on a 17½ per cent. standard.  If a Deputy suggests that the price of beet is not high enough, we can argue that point. A farmer may have beet with a 15 per cent. sugar content, but that means that the price will go down.  If the farmer wants to base the price on 15 per cent., I am sure the sugar company will not mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose there will be differences of opinion as to the price of beet, wheat or milk.  I stated here on many occasions that it is the best we can do during this emergency.  I hope when the emergency is over that we will have better machinery.  Possibly we will have a costings section and possibly some sort of a tribunal.  But we have not those things now and all we can do is to fix a price which we consider is sufficient and we ask the farmer to <Col N="908" /> accept that price for beet, wheat and milk, and to go ahead.  If we think the farmer is satisfied, that is all we can do at the moment anyway.</P>
    <P>As regards the price of milk, Deputy Halliden said it was very hard to understand why we fixed 10½d.  He said he could show that the costings in some cases were as high as 1/7 a gallon.  He talked about a cow yielding only 200 or 300 gallons&mdash;of course that is ridiculous.  If that same cow was yielding 500 gallons&mdash;and that would be a poor yield&mdash;the cost of the milk would be 9½d., and if we gave that man 10½d. it would not be so bad.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies argued that the price fixed for milk was obviously wrong because the production of butter was declining from year to year.  There are other factors to be considered in connection with the production of butter. I submit that the past few years were unfavourable years for butter production. There was very dry weather at this time of the year, with the result that there was not the same flush of grass and the cows did not yield as well as they would if there was good grass to be got.</P>
    <P>Last year the autumn was very cold and wet and there was a reduction in the milk production.  I do not say that I have figures that are conclusive evidence, but I can say that from 1st April this year to the middle of May the production of butter in the creameries has been somewhat higher than last year.  If Deputies argue that butter production is declining and is likely to decline further, that is not borne out by the facts.</P>
    <P>As regards cattle, one Deputy on the opposite benches, Deputy Cafferky, talked of the price and said that farmers in Mayo were very dissatisfied with the price of cattle last autumn. We could not possibly deal with live cattle by way of a fixed price or a guaranteed market.  You could not have a fixed price because the commodity is not uniform.  You could not have a fixed price in order to sell cattle even by weight because of the different qualities.  You could not sell them by age, and neither have we any opportunity of a guaranteed market because <Col N="909" /> the great majority of our store cattle are exported.  Therefore, we must leave out of any scheme we may have, such things as fixed prices or guaranteed market for cattle.  It is one of the things that will be left to console those who place implicit faith in the British market and have always advocated that we should keep our hands off these things and let them go their own way and find their own level.</P>
    <P>The point raised about price was that the amount received by the producer compares unfavourably with that paid by the consumer.  That is not a matter for my Department, but I suggest that Deputies should not make such statements too lightly, because if they examine the statement with regard to butter, they will find that the margin is not very big at all, and the same applies to bacon.  If any Deputy will examine what he gets for a pig, selling it dead weight, and what he pays for a side of bacon from that same pig, he will find that he does not pay very much more than he received for the pig sold by dead weight.  There are other cases, I admit, where the margins appear to be very big, such as milk, vegetables and so on, but there may be points to be explained and reasons to be given for the spread of prices in regard to those commodities.  In any case, it is a matter which should be raised on another Estimate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes made some observations about our leaflets.  I agree with him that our leaflets should be as up-to-date as possible, but he will have to remember that these leaflets are compiled for the ordinary farmer.  They are issued with that in mind&mdash;that it is the ordinary farmer who will read them&mdash;and we do not expect the ordinary farmer to have a very deep scientific education.  Deputy Hughes said, for instance, that, in our leaflet on lime, we did not mention the hydrogen-ion concentration of the soil.  We did not, because we thought the great majority&mdash;I think I am right in saying the great majority&mdash;of farmers would not know the meaning of hydrogen-ion concentration.  What we did was to discuss at length the soil conditions which require lime, and, as is recommended in many of these leaflets, <Col N="910" /> advised the farmer if he is in any difficulty to consult the agricultural instructor.</P>
    <P>That is the best we can do in most of these leaflets&mdash;to go as far as we can, keeping in mind that we are dealing with an intelligent man, but a man who has not a very deep scientific education, and then to suggest to him that if there is any difficulty which he cannot solve for himself after reading the leaflet, he should consult the agricultural instructor.  The agricultural instructor will be in a position to give the farmer further advice, and, if he himself is in doubt, he can take a sample of the soil and have the necessary analysis carried out.  Up to this, admittedly, we had not any great facilities for analysis of the soil, but still we got them done as they were offered to us, and, as I mentioned at the beginning of the debate, we have got on to the building up of a soil section in the Department.</P>

If possible, that laboratory will be got going before the end of this year, but in the meantime samples will be dealt with as usual.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="911" /> We had a lot of discussion about education, but I should like Deputies to realise that we are not so very much behind in the matter of agricultural education.  It must be remembered that the farmer's son has the opportunity of attending night classes.  They may come to his parish possibly only every fifth, sixth or seventh year, but a young fellow growing up on the farm has the opportunity of attending these classes between the ages of 17 and 23 or 24 years. It is a very good course to start with, because it gives him an idea of the fundamentals of such subjects as the analysis of manures, the qualities of good seed, information on soils, a good ground work in the analysis of feeding stuffs and the balancing of rations for animals, etc.  In fact, it gives a young man sufficient foundation to enable him to go on reading for himself and becoming as proficient a farmer as a man in any country need be.</P>
    <P>It would be useful, I admit, if a greater number of our young farmers could go to college for a year, but we shall never be able to attain a position in this country in which every young farmer will be sent to a college for a year.  That will always be the privilege of the few.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be no necessity. If one in ten went to a college, it would be quite satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The winter classes are quite good and a person who goes to them has plenty of literature to draw upon for reading up any subject he may be interested in.  There was some discussion here some time ago about model farms and I remember saying, because I had looked up the matter, that in some of the continental countries they had given more attention to agricultural education than we had and had tried various methods, but that the experience, in some of these continental countries at any rate, was that the best and most acceptable system of education for young farmers was the system that brought that education to them, that is, the travelling school, which is <Col N="912" /> exactly what we have in our winter classes, and the itinerant instructor, which, again, is what we have in the form of the county instructor, so that really, if we only had a little higher opinion of our own methods, we would agree that we appear to be fairly up to date in our methods.</P>
      <P>If we could do a little more in that line, if, for instance, we had more instruction in the various counties and could get these winter classes to go around oftener to the various areas, and also if we could have more colleges, and could afford any boy anxious to go to a college the opportunity of spending a year in a college if he wanted to do a little more than the ordinary amount of study, it would be all to the good.</P>
      <P>Some Deputy made the point that it would be preferable if our Veterinary College were situated on a large farm where there would be a large number of animals which the students could see and treat.  There was a very long investigation of that matter in Great Britain, and they came to the conclusion that it was better on the whole to have these colleges in the cities, because it was easier to get good teachers, more convenient for the students, and in many other ways better for the college.  They said there was no great advantage in putting the college on a big farm, because obviously if there are a couple of hundred cattle, a dozen horses, and so on, on such a farm, and if there are a lot of veterinary professors, naturally, they ought to be able to keep all the animals healthy, and there will not be any unhealthy animals for the students to see. There will, of course, be an odd one or two, but it is not worth putting the college there for the sake of the odd animal the students could see.  The present system of having animals which are diseased brought in is, on the whole, the better system.  Students have to see the live animals for certain purposes.  It would not do to send a city man out as a qualified veterinary surgeon, without his having seen a live animal at all, but that is provided for.  There is no reason, therefore, why the college should be situated on a farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="913" /> The farm improvements scheme was referred to by a number of speakers. There were very few points raised on it except a general advocacy, I think I might say, of extending it.  It was, for instance, advocated that it should be an all the year round scheme so that farmers could come along at any time and apply to have certain work done, and if they got the necessary sanction go ahead with it.  No doubt, from the farmer's point of view, that would be very good.  When first we got on to this scheme in the Department, I need hardly say that that was the thing that struck the Department and myself: that a person would put in his application, that his application would be considered, and then, if it was sanctioned, that he would go ahead with the work.  We found, however, that, in a scheme of this kind, which involves a good deal of administrative work, it would be impossible to run it on those lines.  Therefore, we had to adopt this sort of seasonal arrangement, of having the applications in at a certain date, of having them considered by a certain date and of having the works completed by a certain date.  I do not know whether it would be possible to ease up on that sort of regulation in connection with the scheme if we get it going in a permanent way.  We still regard it as a temporary, an emergency, measure. Every Deputy appears to think that it is a very desirable scheme, and I suppose if everybody is agreed on that, it is likely that it will be considered as a permanent scheme later on when changes of the kind suggested by Deputies might be considered.  It was also advocated by many Deputies that it should be extended to include other classes of work.  One of the things mentioned by a number of Deputies was the erection of a loft for the storage of grain.  That is a most desirable thing for any farmer to have, but I would prefer to deal with that particular item under another head later on when I am speaking on farm buildings in general.</P>
    <P>Deputy Giles made one point that did not come in with these general matters. He dealt with a matter that I have always been very interested in personally. He said that the system of <Col N="914" /> farmers selling their cattle in fairs is not the best system, and that it would be better if all the cattle went through the sales ring.  I have often thought that there is an awful lot in that.  I must say that the present system has such a tradition and so many vested interests behind it that it might be very difficult to change it, but I think there is a lot in what Deputy Giles said, because the farmer who goes, say, once a year to the fair to sell his cattle, cannot possibly be as good a judge as the man who is going to buy them off him, and he probably very often makes a bad bargain.  I think if we could, if you like, through propaganda, induce farmers to go in more for the auctioning of their cattle at the markets that they would probably do better.  Of course, many farmers, even though they go to a fair only once a year, have a very high opinion of their judgment, and might prefer to make a bargain rather than take a chance in the auction ring.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>They have a high opinion of the value of their animals as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  Of course, by the time they are finished with three or four dealers, they may begin to think they were wrong.  Deputy Dillon referred to my statement that I was awaiting a report from the Committee of inquiry that is at present sitting, before announcing a general agricultural policy, and found very great fault with that.  He wanted to know if the Government or the Dáil or this Committee of inquiry was the master in this country.  Now, that was a most ridiculous question to ask.  I can imagine how Deputy Dillon, who has much more eloquence than I can command, would deal with me if I said that I was going ahead and was not waiting for the report of the Committee. Deputies would then hear what he had to say about me.  I said that out of courtesy to that Committee &mdash; and there is more than courtesy in it: there is prudence &mdash; I should wait for their report.  We have already got three reports from the Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that, on the whole, they are very good, honest reports.  There <Col N="915" /> is a lot of commonsense in them and some very good suggestions.  I think that if their general report, what I may call their big report, on general policy with regard to the lines of production that we should engage in is on the lines of the interim reports already issued by them, it will be well worth waiting for and considering before we come to any conclusion.  Naturally, the members of the Committee know that the Minister for Agriculture will consider their report, and, if he thinks well, will recommend their findings to the Government for approval.  Then, in due time, the findings of the Committee will come before the Dáil, and if these involve any change in the law, or any expenditure of public money, the Dáil will have to hear about it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon also talked about tariffs on certain things.  Without going into the general question of protection or free trade, which is a very big question, I would like Deputies to realise the serious position we might have been in if we had not protected certain industries that were necessary to agriculture, such, for example, as the artificial manure manufacturing industry and the agricultural machinery manufacturing industry.  We did get a certain amount of raw phosphates during the emergency.  Deputies may be interested to know that over the last three years we imported 45,753 tons of rock phosphate, and that we produced from home sources 44,000 tons.  We could not, of course, have dealt with that unless we had the manufacturing facilities here to grind the phosphates and do the necessary chemical processes of converting the phosphate into superphosphate.  The Government was assured, some years ago, that our fertiliser manufacturers here could not carry on unless they got a measure of protection.  The measure of protection they asked for was protection against countries outside Great Britain, and Deputies should remember that there was never a tariff here against superphosphates from Great Britain.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the measure of protection they got was not unreasonable, in my opinion, because they had to keep their <Col N="916" /> prices at least in line with the prices in the factories in Great Britain. Otherwise, the British factories would send in their stuff here, and our manufacturers would have to come down in their prices.  What they sought was protection against dumping from some continental countries.  I was not the Minister who went into the details of the matter, but if their story was true, and if they were compelled to close at that time, and if we had not saved them by protection, then, small as our supply was during the war, we would have had no superphosphates at all. The same applies, to a great extent, to agricultural machinery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Was not that danger there long prior to the war?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was getting worse.  That was the claim made, that the position was getting worse.  Towards the end of the 'twenties, competition became very severe all over the world for manufacturing products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Did not Belgian phosphates come in here after the last war?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  To some extent the same applies to agricultural machinery. I do not think we could claim that agricultural machinery was being dumped here, but it was being sent in at a price that our own manufacturers claimed they could not compete with. They got tariffs which saved their business, and as a result, in the emergency we had to turn to horse-drawn machinery, mowing machines, ploughs, harrows, corn drills, and potato drills.  We would not be in a position to manufacture all that machinery.  We might have got some consignments of imported machinery if we had no manufacturers here.  That is the point with regard to the protection for machinery, looking at the question from the agricultural point of view, and leaving aside the bigger question of protection from the point of view of employing our own people, keeping them at home, and using our own money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the usual arguments in favour of a general policy of protection. To go further, with regard to the manufacture of articles, Deputy Dillon <Col N="917" /> claims that farmers should be free to buy anywhere they liked; that there should be no tariffs or anything else on what comes in.  With regard to the protection of the agricultural industry itself, some Deputies suggested that we were inclined to change our policy. I do not know why they say that.  If they expect that there is going to be any change of policy they will be very much disappointed when policy comes to be announced regarding wheat growing or cereal crops.  I suppose Deputies are aware that in many areas it was impossible to get the ordinary equipment required to go on with tillage work for the emergency. There were no ploughs, no harrows, no horses and no ploughmen.  In fact, there are wide areas where a man could not be got who could plough with a pair of horses.  Men can be got who are able to manage tractors.  Deputy Dillon was right there.  It is easier to plough with a tractor than with a pair of horses.  The art of ploughing was gone, the men were gone, the horses were gone, the machinery was gone, as well as knowledge of how to grow cereals.  Some farmers in such areas sent for the inspectors to advise them when wheat was ripe.</P>
    <P>Deputies know that the trend up to 1941 was that tillage was going down and down.  If we had not stepped in and offered some inducement to farmers to grow wheat, and even to go further than to induce them, or if you like, practically compelling them to do so, and inducing maize millers to purchase a certain amount of oats and barley, the position would be much worse in 1939.  There would be much bigger tracts of country where there would be no knowledge of growing wheat, no horses and no implements. There would be no seed to go on with and no knowledge of tillage.  I do not know if we could have succeeded in getting any production worth while going during the emergency.  I do not know if Deputies who study higher politics believe that the war which has just ended is going to be the last war for all time.  I do not think we should pin our faith to that.</P>
    <P>There may be another war in 20 or 25 years' time.  Keeping that in mind <Col N="918" /> I do not think that this Government is likely to go back to the former policy.  I am quite sure that if the Opposition Party came in they would not go back to the 1931 policy.  I am quite sure that they would maintain some measure of protection for farmers and induce or compel them, as the case may be, to keep up a certain amount of tillage.  That must be done.  The only thing necessary to consider is&mdash; whether it is going to be inducement or compulsion, not whether we should drop this policy or not.  It is a case of how it is going to be done, and how tillage is to be kept going.  I do not want any Deputy to conclude that we should keep tillage at the present percentage. That may not be necessary when all danger is over.</P>
    <P>As far as the food situation goes, we are not out of the wood yet.  We will probably have to keep tillage on for a year or two longer.  Surely, Deputy Dillon does not expect Deputies or the ordinary public to believe a man who said that he would be ashamed to be caught with wheat or beet on his farm; he does not expect the public or Deputies to believe he was right when he made that statement, and he does not expect the public or Deputies to believe that those who advocated wheat growing were wrong. We do not think we were wrong.  We have no intention of changing. Coming to a more practical problem as to how far we should go, Deputy Dillon said one thing that we can all agree with, that so far as the economics of growing or producing our own requirements are concerned, they are a matter of degree.  He said that obviously we would not grow oranges, because it would be uneconomic to do so here, but quite obviously we would produce butter or bacon.  But in the Deputy's view we should not grow wheat.  What is the difference?  We could import wheat before the war for 15/- a barrel.  We paid our farmers 30/-.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon thinks we were wrong because we paid farmers double the amount for which we could bring wheat in.  But the Deputy has no doubt at all that we could produce bacon and butter for export.  At the <Col N="919" /> present time our creameries are getting about 240/- per cwt. for butter.  I am quite sure that no Deputy would have the courage to tell me that we were giving too much for butter or that we should give farmers less for their milk.  Would not every Deputy, including Deputy Dillon, say: &ldquo;You will have to continue giving 240/- here, although Great Britain can get butter at present for about half that price.&rdquo; The same applies to bacon.  Our factories are selling bacon at 200/- per cwt.  Deputies know what the factories are paying for pigs.  No Deputy is going to tell me that the farmer should be paid less for pigs.  Nobody is going to advocate that.  Great Britain is getting bacon at about half the price paid here.</P>
    <P>Then there is the position with regard to butter and bacon.  We were told by Deputy Dillon that it is quite a sane policy to produce butter and bacon for export at about half the price that we think our farmers should expect, but that it is an insane policy to grow wheat, when it costs about double what we could import it for before the war.  If to grow our own wheat costs double the price at which we could import it, surely it is more sensible to have the things that we use ourselves, rather than the things we export.  As far as we can, I think we should do both.  Whatever Deputy Dillon or other Deputies may argue about what I say now as to developing exports as being inconsistent with anything I said in the past, I say again that we should have a protective policy within reason to produce here what we want for ourselves, such as wheat, beet, etc., and at the same time try to develop, as far as we can, our export trade.</P>
    <P>I may have said certain things against an export trade in the past but I never believed we should not have an export business so far as we could develop it.  Deputies who were in the House in the period from 1932 to 1934 will remember that the Government went to a lot of trouble in seeking for export markets, so that it cannot be said that we did not believe in export <Col N="920" /> trade.  In 1932, we had to put a tariff on dressed beef coming in here because we found that we could import beef more cheaply than we were producing our own beef.  That is all a matter of comparison, as Deputy Dillon said. The question is where to draw the line.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon spoke about the reduction in poultry and eggs.  There is no doubt there is a reduction there but, as I haye said before in this House, if we want to reverse that and to turn the decline in pigs and poultry into an increase, the first essential is to get at the truth&mdash;the real cause. Deputy Dillon is not interested in that in the slightest.  If we are to discuss the real cause of the decline, we shall have to proceed without Deputy Dillon, because he is more interested in making those silly, student debating points that he learned when he was young&mdash;he has not developed beyond that&mdash;than in trying to find a solution for anything that may be wrong.  Some Deputies say that we made no plans but we did.  We thought that a war might come and we had plans prepared. We considered that it might even be necessary, in order to feed the population, to get out of pigs and poultry altogether.  That was fairly obvious at the time.  If we were bringing in 500,000 tons of wheat and 500,000 tons of feeding-stuffs and if we found ourselves completely cut off from other countries and in a desperate way, our first duty would be to grow what we wanted for human beings and, if necessary, to let both pigs and poultry go.  We did not let them go.  Poultry went down by about 20 per cent. and pigs by half. That was due to want of feeding-stuffs. Everybody knows that.  Now, the question is to get that type of production back.  Egg production has come back to a great extent.  When I brought in a Bill, five or six years ago, to improve the production and marketing of eggs, I remember distinctly advancing the argument that, in the City of Dublin at the time, the great majority of the people would not eat an egg because they were so uncertain whether the egg would be good or bad.  We discussed the legislation here.  I think <Col N="921" /> that everybody approved of the Bill and it has had a very good effect.  It is estimated, not by me but by those who take the statistics, that the home consumption of eggs has increased by 50 per cent. since 1939.  I believe that that is the result of the legislation we brought in to ensure that people would get a fresh egg when they bought one. In other words, the people of Dublin are not now afraid to buy an egg, because they have a fair assurance that it will be all right.  We have, therefore, that increase in the production of eggs which is hidden away, because the export figure is the only one at which people look and that is not nearly as good as it was in 1939.  The number of people consuming eggs and the number of eggs are going up, and we may hope to reach again our export business in eggs before long.  That is one of the commodities in respect of which we have a real advantage in the British market.  We are so close to the British market that we can give them fresh eggs more easily than any other country.  As Deputies are aware, however, the British are making a valiant attempt to be self-sufficient in egg-production.</P>
    <P>Deputy Heskin said tillage had given us additional food and had not reduced the number of cattle.  That is only part of the truth.  From 1939 to the present time, we increased our tillage by 1,000,000 acres and our cattle by 300,000.  The number of cattle went up.  We had the same experience in the last war.  Every Deputy will, probably, have his own explanation of the fact to which I am now about to refer, but there is no apparent explanation&mdash; that, in times of increased tillage, the number of cattle does not go down but the number of sheep goes down. The number of sheep went down very considerably during the 1914-18 war, and it also went down during the last war.  Deputy Beegan suggested that we should ease off tillage somewhat. We cannot, because the food situation is not any better than it was.  It is the opinion of all the experts from outside the country who have been speaking of the situation in Europe that the food situation is much worse than it was.  I think that there is no chance whatever that we can ease off the tillage regulations <Col N="922" /> for 1946.  However, that need not be decided for a few months more.</P>
    <P>Deputy Heskin complained that the co-operative societies were getting hold of the machinery being distributed and thought that it was very unfair.  He also complained of co-operative societies engaging in retail trading, buying farms and producing pigs, and so forth.  I should like Deputy Heskin to know that no Government or Minister could interfere with farmers&mdash;even if they thought they should&mdash;who want to combine to produce, sell, process, or buy a thing.  I do not think that the Government should interfere.  It is argued that the co-operative society running a shop has a great advantage over the ordinary trader because it has not to pay income-tax.  That is a debatable point, but it is not one with which we need deal at the moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Giles put a question about pedigree seed-wheat.  We hope to have 40,000 barrels of high-class pedigree seed-wheat after the coming harvest. If all of it is properly saved and distributed, it should be sufficient to sow about half our acreage this year.  After that, we shall have a large amount of seed of a, more or less, pedigree character, but the foundation pedigree seed will continue to be produced.  All our seed-barley might be regarded as pedigree seed.  We are making arrangements for oats on the same lines.  We may have a stock of 4,000 or 5,000 barrels after the coming harvest.  That we shall increase rapidly and, in the course of a few years, we should have a substantial supply of very good seed-oats.</P>
    <P>Deputy Beegan made a point which seemed to be resented by members of Clann na Talmhan.  He said that we should not look upon the farmer as a man in poor circumstances or as a mendicant, but that we should look upon his occupation as the most dignified and most independent of all.  Now, I think that Deputy Beegan has a perfect right to say that.  Nobody in this House has a monopoly of the right to talk about the farmers, and I do not see why Deputy Beegan should not have the right to say that.  I agree with him that the farmers are the most independent and dignified of the members <Col N="923" /> of this community.  They have proved that all through the centuries. They have always taken a leading part in every movement for independence, including independence movements in our own time.</P>
    <P>There is another matter about which we should be clear.  There is no use in any Deputy saying that he advocated water, electricity, and so on, being brought into the farmers' houses, and claiming credit when that is being accomplished. It is not a question of who first advocated such schemes.  I am sure that we all agree that the farmers should have the same amenities as the townsmen, and it does not matter who first asked for these amenities.  We are aiming at the provision of water for the farms, but the first step towards that is rural electrification.  When electricity is brought to every farmer's house, then the water will follow because, where a farmer has not got water at present, he will then have the electric power to bring the water to his farm, and after that, naturally, will follow proper sanitation.  At the same time, I do not see why we should not try to do something about putting in proper stoves, cooking facilities, and so on, in farmers' houses.  We should aim &mdash;and I am sure that every Deputy of any Party in this House will agree&mdash;at having the country house just as well equipped as the city house, so that the farmers will have proper lighting, heating, hot and cold water, proper sanitation, and so on, so that if a girl has to make a choice between marrying a farmer and settling down in the country or settling down in the city, she shall at least have the same amenities in the country as in the town or city.  Naturally, it will take a long time to achieve that, but I think we should be able to reach that point.</P>
    <P>Deputy Beegan said that so far as the men were concerned they have no such drudgery now on the farms as they had in the past, but that the women are still under the same conditions of drudgery.  I think that the men on the farms are also suffering under conditions of drudgery.  I think I mentioned here the setting up of an inquiry into <Col N="924" /> such matters, and I have been informed that the members of that committee will report on farm buildings.  Now, I am very anxious to provide the same amenities for the woman in the farmer's house as her sister in the city or town enjoys, but I am also anxious to see that the farmer and his sons should have as decent living conditions as possible on the farm.  We should do everything possible when we get this report, to see that the farmer is provided with proper housing, well-paved and concreted yards, and so on, so that work in the winter time will be as pleasant as possible, and then we should do everything that we can do to enable him to purchase machinery.  I think that every Party is agreed on that, and the question is how to get these things done in as reasonable a way as possible. Naturally, nobody expects the State to pay for everything.  The farmer will have to contribute his share, but at any rate we should try, as soon as we can, to get these things going.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donnellan quoted two Ministers who, he said, contradicted one another.  He quoted the Minister for Supplies talking about the matter of financial credit for the farmers, and the Minister for Finance claiming that the farmers were rolling in wealth, and had money in the bank.  I do not know whether the statements were made in exactly that way, or whether they were properly interpreted by Deputy Donnellan, or if they were incompatible, but even if they are incompatible, does the Deputy think that all Ministers must agree on a particular matter?  Deputy Donnellan has stood on the same platform with other Deputies, but do they always agree on every item?  Certainly not.  The same applies to Ministers.  One might be of opinion that the farmers are well off, and the other might be of the opinion that they are not well off.  I think that that is quite natural, and it will get us nowhere to be talking of two Ministers opposing one another in that way.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Blowick who raised the question of the restoration of soil fertility.  Now, that is a very important matter.  I think it was about <Col N="925" /> three years ago that we brought in a scheme for giving a credit docket to every farmer for every barrel of wheat delivered either to a miller or a seed assembler.  The reason we gave it in the case of wheat was that wheat is sold off the land.  After all, if a man grows oats, it is generally sown back to the land again, and, therefore, the fertility of the soil is not removed, but wheat is sold off the land, and, therefore, a farmer who has been growing a lot of wheat during the emergency will need more fertilisers than a farmer who has not been growing wheat.  These dockets are there, and they will be converted into cash for the farmer as soon as fertilisers are available in fair quantities, and I need hardly say that everything possible will be done to import fertilisers as rapidly and as cheaply as possible to help the farmer to restore the fertility of his soil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it is very hard to answer that question, but, I may say, in that connection, that I have a confession to make to Deputy Dillon and others, and it is that only for me we could have had any amount of nitrogen during the war.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce had a proposal submitted to him prior to the war by an outside firm to set up here a plant for the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia.  They were prepared to guarantee that the price would not exceed 10 per cent. over the price of sulphate of ammonia manufactured in Great Britain.  I, as Minister for Agriculture, held that even 10 per cent. was too big a margin, and that it should be sold at a price no higher than that of sulphate of ammonia manufactured in Great Britain, and because of this attitude of mine, the firm concerned would not go on with the scheme.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £11,686 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1946, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Sea and Inland Fisheries, including a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The gross total of this year's Fishery Estimate is £37,331, as against £38,271 for last year, a decrease of £940, but this year's receipts coming in as Appropriations-in-aid are estimated at £2,940 less than last year, so that the final result on the Estimate is a net increase of £2,000.  As regards the items under Sea Fisheries, the E group of sub-heads shows little variation. Sub-head E (2) makes, in existing circumstances, only token provision for co-operation with the International Council for the Study of the Sea.  Sub-head E (5) also consists of a token item.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to the sub-heads which deal <Col N="927" /> with inland fisheries, F (1) shows an increase of £175.  The first and fifth items of this sub-head are closely related, due mainly to an increase in one of our commitments under the Fisheries (Tidal Waters) Acts.  These Acts charge the Fisheries Vote with the recoupment of fishery rates lost to boards of conservators as a result of the Erne legal decision some ten years ago, which threw open to the public certain highly-valued tidal salmon fisheries up to then rated as privately-held fisheries.  Sub-head F (2), which makes provision for salmon and trout hatchery operations, is increased by £265 this year, owing to the need for extensive repairs to the Department's hatchery at Glenties.  Sub-head F (3) is increased by £175 to meet the cost of maintenance works at the State fishery on the Owenea River, Co. Donegal.  The remaining sub-heads in the F group show the same provision as last year.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of inland fisheries, I should like to refer to the outbreak of disease amongst the trout in the Liffey reservoir at Poulaphouca. The disease is due to an intestinal worm and has caused heavy mortality amongst the large stock of fish in the reservoir.  The rapid growth of these trout, which occurred when the river basins of the Liffey and King's River were submerged, offered an exceptionally promising field for anglers, but the stock has now been greatly reduced, especially the older fish.  The technical fisheries staff of my Department have been in close touch with the Electricity Supply Board and with the scientists who have been investigating the disease, and we are facilitating them as far as our resources allow. The future course of the epidemic cannot be predicted but there seems no reason to anticipate a widespread extension.</P>
    <P>Passing on to the G sub-heads, which are concerned with the Sea Fisheries Association, sub-head G 1 has an increase of £600 as against last year, due to the emergency bonus awarded to the association's employees.  Deputies will notice that under sub-head G 2 only £600 is provided as against £4,000 last year.  That is because it is anticipated <Col N="928" /> that it will be much more difficult to get equipment during the present year.</P>
    <P>The receipts expected to come in as Appropriations-in-Aid show an increase of £150 on last year for letting of sporting rights, etc., on State properties. Item (5) for £7,000, in respect of repayment of State advances by the Sea Fisheries Association, is down by £3,000 on last year's figures.  That is not to be taken as any indication that fishermen are in any worse position. The fact is that a great number of fishermen have repaid their loans completely and there are no instalments, therefore, due from them.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be glad to hear that our sea fishing industry continues to do well.  The quantity and value of the total catch in 1943 were satisfactory, but the figures for 1944 are still better. In 1943 the total catches were 277,000 cwt., and in 1944, 307,000 cwt.  The value of the 1943 catch was £510,000, and of the 1944 catch, £513,000.  That is for wet fish&mdash;everything except shell-fish. If the landings of shell-fish are included, the total for 1944 is £626,000 as compared with a total of £233,000 in 1939.  That shows a very big increase in the earnings of fishermen, but I should not like Deputies to think that it is altogether due to increased prices. As a matter of fact, fishermen have been working hard and very effectively to supply the fish needs of the home market.  The quantity went up from 172,000 cwt. in 1938 and 188,000 cwt. in 1939 to 307,000 cwt. in 1944.  There was, therefore, a very considerable increase in the quantity of the landings and that increase, I may say, was very badly needed.</P>
    <P>Certain Deputies will have seen from the balance sheet and yearly report of the Sea Fisheries Association that during the calendar year 1944 the members of the association brought in just four times the quantity landed by them during 1939 and that the amount disbursed to the members for the 1944 catch was exactly six times the amount paid out to them during 1939.  The association continues to pay special attention to the needs of small holders&mdash;part-time fishermen&mdash;resident in the Gaeltacht for curraghs, trammel nets, mackerel nets, and gear for escallop dredging, etc. <Col N="929" /> The experimental marketing of frozen escallops from the Connemara area, after these shellfish have been subjected to a special process, brought a considerable and very welcome addition to the earnings of the local fishermen who engage in the dredging of this shellfish.  The directors referred to the great difficulties they have experienced and are experiencing in securing the machinery necessary to catch fish &mdash;engines, fishing nets, ropes, etc.&mdash;but we hope for better times.</P>
    <P>I devoted a lot of time on the Vote for Agriculture to the question of postwar planning and I should like to say a few words with regard to our postwar plans for fisheries.  One of the first problems is to define where we can fish, our exclusive fishing limits. We have never got an agreement with the various countries on what our exclusive fishing limits should be.  We have some hopes of getting that matter fixed up with the various countries concerned.  When that is done, the necessary by-laws will have to be made relating to trawling, etc.  Our own men will know, at any rate, the waters in which they have an exclusive right, but then we must go further and protect them.  That brings us to the question of the cruisers we had before the war commenced and which we handed over to Defence.  These cruisers will, I presume, be available for protection but under what ownership I am not able to say at the moment.  That will be a question for negotiation.</P>
    <P>The further development of our inland fisheries will necessitate certain legislation.  I think I told the Dáil before that we are having all the Acts from 1842 to 1944 consolidated.  The draftsman is working on the measure at the moment and I hope it may come before the Dáil in due course, probably not this session but, I hope, next session.  That, again, will be followed by further legislation in respect of any amendments that may be thought necessary.  Then we will have one Act dealing with all questions relating to inland fisheries.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the 1939 Act there are certain provisions to be implemented, <Col N="930" /> for instance, the acquisition of estuarine and weir fisheries, the abolition of fresh-water netting, the restriction of estuarine netting by common law fishermen, the introduction of a brown trout licence, and some other minor matters.  We will have some difficulty, as a matter of fact, with regard to staff.  We have, as perhaps Deputies are aware, rather a small, but a specialised staff in the Department of Fisheries.  We have been extremely unlucky in our staff arrangements.  It will take some time before we can get going properly again.</P>
    <P>During the emergency, scientific investigation of the sea has been practically suspended.  This will be resumed, I hope, as soon as boats are allocated again for protection of fisheries. It was from these protection boats that this work was done.  We must carry out a certain amount of investigation, and make a certain amount of returns.  Otherwise, we cannot join in the advantages to be derived from the Council at Copenhagen, where various countries share their knowledge.</P>
    <P>It is felt that young people who intend taking on fishing as a profession should get some elementary training which would fit them for that particular work.  We hope it will be possible in certain technical schools near fishing centres to include in the curriculum the general principles of navigation, the elements of marine biology, some ideas of meteorology, the care and maintenance of marine motor engines, and the care of nets, with periodic lectures on sea fisheries of other countries, with particular reference to modern methods of fishing.  This question, of course, will take some time, because we have to get agreement with the Minister for Education and, if the Minister agrees, we have to arrange where these courses will be given, and then, of course, we will have to arrange for the necessary teachers, and so on, that are capable of giving such lectures.  But I think it will be possible to do something along that line.</P>
    <P>We must continue then the study of <Col N="931" /> the life-history and habits of our principal river fishes.  In the Fisheries Act, 1939, provision is made for the acquisition by the Minister of a suitable river from source to mouth so that a thorough study can be made of the history of the salmon during its sojourn in fresh water.</P>
    <P>The development of the shellfish industry is another matter calling for attention.  The principal varieties of shellfish which we are concerned with are oysters, lobsters, escallops, mussels, periwinkles and cockles.  They each will require some different treatment but, generally speaking, the development will consist in protection against immature fish being taken, reseeding of certain varieties, storage tanks in some cases, purification tanks in others, and the freezing of certain varieties before being sent to the market.  When these measures are taken they should help to make more fish available for producers and thus create a better supply for consumption.</P>
    <P>That deals with the provision of fish. The next thing is to give the fishermen a chance to get them.  Boats and gear for inshore fishermen will be the points to be considered there.  They will be the first necessity.  Our present stocks, of course, are very low, but as soon as possible we mean to renew the fishermen's gear and get them fishing full time again.  We had a number of firms in this country building boats but they have disappeared to a great extent. It would be a pity if we lost the art altogether; and my own feeling is that we must try to get the industry started here again.  We know from experience that the inshore fishermen will not, or cannot, keep up a constant supply of fish of good variety.  They will perhaps give you fish of a kind practically all the year round, but the inshore fishermen are not able to provide a fair variety and a good supply.  It would be necessary, therefore, to have deep sea trawlers.  If we intend to go out on the business of trawling, we should try to have good modern boats, probably Diesel engines, and so on. The big question to be considered is the management, ownership, and the <Col N="932" /> type of fleet we might get going, but we certainly will have that question considered before the boats are available and then we will get them as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Even that may not give us enough fish.  We have had the experience in the past that although we had inshore fishermen and trawlers, at times we wanted fish of a certain variety or had not enough fish of any kind and we had to import.  We will have to consider fully our policy for importing fish when the war is over.  We had a certain line laid down as a result of negotiations with Great Britain in 1938.  Of course, that has disappeared now and we will have to negotiate some sort of agreement again.</P>
    <P>We have to import fish at certain times and at other times, in fact maybe at the same time, we have to export fish, and we must make agreements as far as we can both on the import and export side.  We have a fairly big export of salmon and we should like, if possible, to build up an export business in mackerel, herring, and so on. That may not be so easy.  I pointed out the difficulties in that matter in answer to a Dáil question yesterday. At the present time the Minister for Food in Great Britain takes all the salmon we can give him.  They are taken at a certain agreed price, which varies with the season.  As long as that lasts, it suits us all right, but the Minister for Food may, possibly, at some time or another seek a new agreement.</P>
    <P>It is a well-known fact that certain fishes come in large shoals at certain times, and one sees in the paper reports about fish being thrown back into the sea or being shovelled out to manure the gardens, and so on.  It is a pity that these great supplies of fish should go to waste.  We can deal with it to some extent in the future by cooling.  There are two processes that we should distinguish between, cooling and cold storage.  A big catch of fish might be made available for use over a week or 10 days by cooling, but if we want fish to last for very much longer than that it has to be cold stored.  The Sea Fisheries Association have been experimenting with cooling, <Col N="933" /> quick freezing and cold storage, and they have gained a certain amount of experience.  Of course, experiments have also been carried out in other countries, of the results of which we have some knowledge here.  There seems to be some future at any rate for these processes, and we must pursue our investigations as far as we can.</P>
    <P>We are not a fish-eating people. There is a big consumption of fish on Friday and not so much on other days. Some people think that the reason is that we have not got sufficient fried fish shops, or, perhaps, they are not as good as they should be.  We are considering regulations or, perhaps, legislation to deal with the fried fish shops. We want to improve them if we can and to see that they are run on proper lines so that when people go into a fried fish shop they will get a good meal and that it will not be too dear. It will not be the dear fish, but it should be good fish.  We want to develop that as far as we can.  Of course, in addition to providing these fish shops, not only in the cities, but in the inland towns also, we should try as far as we can to develop a sale of fish in the inland towns.</P>
    <P>Then it is urged that we should engage in more publicity to advocate that people should eat more fish.  I do not see that there is much object in that as long as we are importing fish.  In so far as we increase the consumption here, we would be increasing our import. When we have built up our fisheries properly, and are producing a good supply ourselves, we might do some advertising in regard to the benefits of eating fish, and perhaps secure a higher consumption than we have at the moment.</P>
    <P>Deputies will realise that I have given only a very sketchy outline of the various matters which have been under investigation by the Department of Fisheries for post-war operation.  Of course, a number of those things will have to be very carefully considered yet.  Some of them will require financing, and there may be some delay at any rate in convincing the Minister for Finance of their benefit.  I think Deputies will agree generally with the <Col N="934" /> outline I have given of those various matters.</P>

      <P>The Minister told the House that Deputies would be glad to know that the fishing industry continues to do well.  There is not much evidence of that in the provision for this year.  He also read out a long statement with regard to post-war policy.  The war in Europe is over, but there is no evidence in the Estimate that those things will be initiated this year.  As a matter of fact, under Appropriations-in-Aid, there is no provision for the sale of even one boat for the current year.  Certainly, that fits very badly into the hypothetical statement which the Minister has made.  Of course, those hypothetical statements about what will be done post-war read quite well.  The world was to be reformed in the post-war period.  That period has arrived, and there is not the least evidence of any initiative at all with regard to this Department.  The evidence which the Minister gave to show that the fishing industry is doing so well was that last year 307,000 cwts. of fish were landed. When we consider the coastline of this country, we should not be clapping ourselves on the back because we landed 307,000 cwts. of fish.</P>

      <P>The pathetic position in this country, particularly during the war, was, that owing to the price of fish nobody, especially the poor people, could get near buying it. Yesterday we had two questions on the Order Paper addressed to the Minister with regard to the disposal of superfluous fish down in County Cork.  One question was by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and the second by some other Deputy from that county.  Is it not a remarkable thing that fish which was there in abundance, could not be sent to this city, or to the other towns in Ireland, in order to give everybody, and particularly the poor people, a chance of purchasing it, especially when we think, first, of the price of potatoes, and secondly, of the price of beef and mutton?  I am not sure what <Col N="935" /> answer the Minister gave to those questions, but I am wondering whether that superfluous fish was allowed to go to loss down there.  Apparently, the trouble was that barrels could not be got to enable it to be salted.  But it is not necessary to salt any fish in this country.  I think all the fish landed could be sold in any day, or at least in any week, provided it could be cold stored for Friday.  In the present week there are three fast days. But where is the fish?  Where is the superfluous fish that was down in Cork last week?  There is an ample market in this city for four or five times the amount of fish that is landed.  I hope it was not another instance of what happened some four or five years ago when it was stated in this House, and not contradicted, that in order to rig the market fish were taken out to sea from the port here and either dumped or taken somewhere else.  Surely, when there is such use, if not abuse, of emergency powers, some power should be used to prevent such a thing happening.</P>
      <P>The Estimates for this year do not impress me at all.  There is nothing to show that there is any initiative, or that any progress will be made on the lines indicated by the Minister in referring to the post-war period.  With regard to the figure of £513,000 for wet fish landed last year, that is beside the question.  The question is the weight.  I do not know what is the reason for the continued stagnation in the fishing industry around the shores of this country.  It cannot be claimed that there is an abundance of fish on the market at any time, because there is not a town in this country where a person could get anything like a reasonable supply of fish of any kind on practically any day of the week.  In good sized towns, you could not buy enough fish for your dinner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the meaning of all that stagnation? Is it that the fishermen are afraid that if they land too much fish there will be a slump in the price, and that they will suffer a loss?  If that is so, I think when material becomes available steps should be taken, even <Col N="936" /> by the Department, to set up a factory in this country for tinning fish. Yesterday, I got tinned herring from Canada for my dinner.  Certainly, that is a sorry commentary.  There is a surplus of fish in County Cork, but when a person sits down to his dinner here he finds that the only fish he can get is canned herring from Canada or from California or Alaska.  Certainly, that is as big a joke as the provision I see in the Estimates for my old friend the Whale Fisheries Act, 1937.  I see there is £5 down for expenses, and £5 under Appropriations-in-Aid.  How is the whaling industry getting on?  I do not see anything returned to Appropriations-in-Aid except this £5.  Who got hold of the £5 worth of whale?  I think that should be wiped out, instead of turning the whole thing into a joke. What was the £5 about?  Is there somebody in this island who took out a licence or licences to fish whale? Have any licences been taken out since the passing of the Act in 1937?  I thought the passing of that Act was a typical Irish joke.  Has anything come of it?  What is it all about?  Has it been put into operation ever since? Has any protection been given to whales?  Has something been done to ensure that no whales within the prescribed size were killed by our fishermen during those years, or was it left to the depth charges to blow them up? Were any precautions taken to protect from depth charges the whales within our territorial waters?</P>
    <P>There is no use in talking about this Estimate as there is nothing in it.  It does not lead anywhere; it does not give the slightest evidence of the putting into operation of the post-war policy indicated by the Minister. During the last five years, of course, we were governed by circumstances. The fishermen had to do the best they could in the circumstances obtaining. They were also restricted by the amount of fuel available.  On many occasions they missed the fishing season, possibly through some fault of their own in not applying for the fuel or not filling up forms.  Now that the war is over, however, we should take our courage in our hands and do something about the industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="937" /> I do not want to develop this matter too far as it would take too long and would lead up to other problems, such as the employment problem.  One cannot ignore the symptoms with regard to employment in the fishing areas. In the immediate future, some 150,000 of our men may return from England&mdash; and in the main they come from the fishing areas&mdash;plus some 200,000 of our young men who are in the various British services, the Air Force, the Army and the Navy, as well as those who are in the Six Counties.  Then there are those in our own Army and in the emergency services.  I think, therefore, it is incumbent on this House to take active steps in the matter.</P>
    <P>I think it would be well-spent money to establish a canning factory in this country and, in conjunction with that, to establish some fast service by sea or land by which surplus fish in any district could be rushed immediately to the canning factory whilst it was in a fit condition.  I think we should do something along these lines.  Our whole marine products industry, carrageen, kelp and fishing, is in dire straits.  All along the coast there seems to be no life in it.  The people working in it do not seem to have any hope.  They see no future in it; no hope for themselves and for their children. That is the future these people are looking forward to in a country with such a huge coastline.</P>
    <P>I am certainly not impressed either by the Estimate or by the post-war policy of the Minister.  The statement of the Minister was anything but inspiring. It certainly gave us little hope, having regard to the possibilities of the industry.  This House should make some provision for employment for those people who will be clamouring for it.  Some ten years ago I suggested that the Government should pay a flat rate of, say, £5 a ton, for kelp and put it into storage.  All sections of this industry should be linked up.  They should not be under two Departments.  They all form one problem in which the same people are concerned. A house divided against itself cannot stand.</P>
    <P>I regret the condition into which this whole marine industry has fallen.  No <Col N="938" /> vision has been displayed in regard to it and no direction exercised.  I think something is expected from this House, because we have been jointly and severally responsible.  So far as I am concerned, I feel like making an apology to the people who live in these coastal areas.  We have given them very little ground for hope.  Considering the large number of people resident in those areas, I think we should set up a committee of the House representative of all Parties to consider this matter and submit recommendations to the Minister.  The various branches of the industry will have to be co-ordinated and put in charge of one man with commercial and organising capacity who will inspire confidence. Until that is done all the chopping and changing and cheeseparing are merely waste of time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was amazed to hear the last speaker say that this Government had done nothing for the fishing industry.  They are doing and have done excellent work.  The Deputy should remember that when his Party came into office they got the fishing industry in a flourishing condition and they gave no assistance to the industry, so that in 1930 the industry practically ceased to exist.  Were it not for the assistance which the Government gave to the fishermen by supplying boats and gear they would not be in a position to avail of the last five prosperous years in the industry.  I admit that this Government have not done as much as they should have done for the fishermen. I am satisfied that the present prosperity in the industry is due to war conditions.  The question must be asked: how will the industry fare after the war?  After a few years of good fishing and good returns, we will find that there will be a decline in the fortunes of the industry unless we adopt a new system of marketing and of preserving fish.  I also admit that, if the industry is to be prosperous, we must export our surplus fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must either find a market in foreign countries for it, or be in a position to preserve our surplus fish for the days of scarcity.  I am aware that it is very easy to dispose of the prime fish in this country at the <Col N="939" /> present time.  I am sure that after the war we will have no difficulty in getting it absorbed by our local markets, as I believe that, instead of landings of prime fish increasing in this country, we will find that the landings by small trawlers will decrease.  This will be due to over-fishing inside our territorial waters by foreign trawlers.  The Government must make a serious effort to keep those trawlers outside our territorial waters if our inshore fishermen are to make a living.</P>
    <P>I am quite in agreement with the Minister when he states that the area of our territorial waters must be extended. Several countries object to the limit of three miles, as it is obvious to anyone that that limit does not give inshore fishermen any protection. Prior to and during the last war, and for some years afterwards, the surplus mackerel and herrings in this country were cured, and we had a ready market for mackerel in America, and we had in Europe a market for herrings; but owing to the fact that the last Government did not give sufficient protection and assistance in the industry, we lost that entire market. That was a serious matter for the trade, as we had no means of disposing of the surplus fish.  The British people did not require it, as their own trawlers were able to supply sufficient for their needs.</P>
    <P>There are many people in this country&mdash;fishermen and private individuals&mdash;who have expended large sums of money on boats and gear, and they are very anxious as to the future. They trust that this Government will adopt some progressive policy and will improve on the old methods of curing and handling fish.  The British Government realises there will be a great difficulty in disposing of herrings after this war, and for that reason, for some years, they have been considering carefully the quick-freezing of fish.</P>
    <P>I should impress upon the Minister the necessity for considering this matter carefully and for seeing that it is considered by the association, so as to find out if the successful quick-freezing of herrings is a practical proposition. <Col N="940" /> If the quick-freezing of fish is a practical proposition, it will probably be a solution of all the problems in the fish industry, and, so far as I can see, unless this quick-freezing of fish is a success, there is no future for the mackerel industry here.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed to find that practically no research work is carried out in this country.  I know that there was an official of the Sea Fisheries Association experimenting with the quick-freezing of shellfish and who made a success of it, but I believe that that official has not received the encouragement from the association that he should receive.  That man should be given sufficient funds to continue the research work and also a larger number of scientists should be employed to deal with quick-freezing.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed to find that the Sea Fisheries Association has not made any effort to develop the home market.  I agree with the last speaker when he states that very little fish is consumed in this country.  I have no hesitation in saying that we should consume at least five or six times the present quantity.  The association should take a lead in that matter, but so far they have not made any serious effort to do so.  One of the reasons why fish is not consumed is that it is too dear. Last week in my own fishing port I saw mackerel bought for about a halfpenny each and was amazed to go into a restaurant not very far from Valentia Harbour and find that fried mackerel was being sold at 3/6.  That should not be tolerated and there should be some restriction on that sort of conduct.  I have always believed that there is too much difference between the price paid to the fisherman and the price paid by the consumer.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister state that it is intended to purchase a large number of trawlers after this war.  I agree with that policy as if we have not up-to-date trawlers&mdash;trawlers which can go to sea in all weathers and which can go a good distance&mdash;it is obvious that we cannot have a continuous supply of fish.  The Minister should purchase at least 10 or 12 big trawlers as soon as possible, and place them in certain ports along the coast.  In that <Col N="941" /> way we would have a continuous supply and an equal distribution of fish.  If the question of quick-freezing is a success, we will always be able to keep up a steady supply, and there will be no necessity to import fish.</P>
    <P>I admit that excellent work has been done by the association, but I think they could do much more for the industry than they are doing at the present time.  For instance, they have made no effort to develop the home market or to procure a new market, and they have made no effort to improve on the old system of curing herrings and mackerel.</P>
    <P>I was informed last year that the association exported prime fish.  I would impress on the Minister that if the association had trouble in finding a market for prime fish, they could have got sale for that fish in this country and there would have been no necessity to export it.  The association should not be allowed to engage in the export of fish, but should look after the interests of fishermen and leave the export in the hands of people familiar with it.  I assure the Minister that if the Sea Fisheries Association embarks on the exporting of fish after this war, it will cost the country a very large sum of money in a short time.</P>
    <P>I would also like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the Sea Fisheries Association is acting at present in a very unreasonable manner towards fishermen in regard to the supply of nets.  I believe the association has refused now to give nets to fishermen who require them, unless they pay 50 per cent. of the cost.  In my own constituency recently, a large number of fishermen lost many nets and the association refused to supply them without the 50 per cent. payment. Those men were compelled to go to merchants and borrow money to procure the nets.  The Minister must remember that the association was set up to help the fishermen, and if that rule is persisted in it will mean that the wealthy fishermen or the lucky fishermen will have an advantage over his unfortunate brother.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I raised in this House the question of the scarcity of <Col N="942" /> cutch for the fishermen in South Kerry.  I know it is difficult to get supplies, but the Minister for Supplies stated that the Sea Fisheries Association carried out research work and found that they could procure a substitute. Several people have approached me and told me that they wrote to the association, and were informed in reply that they could not supply the substitute.  I would ask the Minister to try to get a supply of cutch for the fishermen as soon as possible, as the situation is very serious.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw attention to the landing facilities at our chief ports.  Certainly the landing facilities at the majority of our fishing ports are nothing short of a disgrace. Valentia Harbour is one of the most important mackerel fishing centres in the country, but we find there is only a small slip there, which was not intended for the landing of fish, but for the use of the people of Valentia Island when coming to the mainland. We find 50 local boats trying to land fish at that slip, and in a period of heavy fishing, the boats cannot approach the slip.  As a result, the fishermen are not able to land the catch, and the fish miss the train, so the men receive a smaller price and the merchants suffer substantial losses.</P>
    <P>There is great necessity for boat shelters for fishing boats along our coast.  I have repeatedly drawn the Minister's attention to the necessity for erecting boat shelters at Valentia Island and Portmagee.  Portmagee is a very important fishing centre.  There are at least 25 motor boats fishing from that port, and the owners have no place in which to keep the boats in safety.  I must urge the Minister to see that proper landing facilities are provided at Valentia Harbour and Portmagee, and that the boats are given reasonably good shelter there.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that at the present time if fish which are sent from South Kerry do not reach the North Wall before 6.30 o'clock in the evening they will not be loaded on the night boat for Britain.  I raised this matter recently by way of question. <Col N="943" /> I need not impress on the Minister that in the warm weather it is essential that our fish should be shipped to the British market with the least possible delay.  Owing to this rule of the shipping and railway companies, our fish reach the English market 24 hours late.  Within the past few weeks tons of fish could not get into the British market in time owing to delay at the Dublin port.  At the present time British trawlers are landing huge quantities of fish in England.  Our fish arrive there in a poor condition because of the delay at Dublin port, and when they reach the British market they are not acceptable to the people and there is no sale.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to take this matter up immediately with the shipping company and the railway company so that we may be allowed to ship our fish, as in other years, by the night boat.  The fish merchants at Valentia Harbour are very anxious to have their catches shipped by the night boat, and they are prepared to pay the shipping company and the railway company whatever is reasonable. These companies should have no difficulty in accepting the fish for transport. The stationmaster at Valentia Harbour could always communicate with Dublin and let the people there know how many thousand boxes would be taken by rail to Dublin and then the necessary arrangements for shipping could be made and the whole thing could be smoothly arranged.  For the past two years these companies have refused to handle any fish reaching Kingsbridge after 6.30 o'clock in the evening.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say that it is the intention to introduce legislation to deal with inland fisheries. I suggest that some effort should be made to limit the number of nets used at the mouths of rivers so that fish in reasonable numbers can travel to the upper reaches.  The Minister has power to take over weirs.  What is the use of possessing such power if he does not avail of it?  There is a weir in Waterville which prevents fish going into the lake there.  The owner should <Col N="944" /> get a reasonable sum by way of compensation, and I believe it would be a great advantage to the tourist trade in Waterville if that weir were removed.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the poisoning of rivers, a practice which is on the increase in South Kerry.  I hope in the legislation which the Minister intends to introduce he will impose very severe penalties in relation to the poisoning of rivers, and it is to be hoped that people who are caught committing that offence will be severely dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister's opening statement contained some satisfactory points, it also contained some very disappointing features.  The most disappointing feature is that the outbreak of peace appears to have caught the Minister's Department not fully prepared.  The Minister mentioned that he proposes to adopt certain plans, to introduce certain legislation with regard to post-war development. The great danger is that it might take too long to get this work under way.  The industry has apparently passed through a few prosperous years, and it would be disastrous if a slack period were allowed to intervene which would bring about depression and a decline in the industry.  I know very little about sea fishing, but so far as inland fishing is concerned I think everyone will agree that it is imperative that everything possible should be done to secure that our lakes and rivers are properly stocked, that the passage of fish from the sea into our lakes and rivers is not unduly interfered with and that fishing in our rivers will be allowed to develop to the fullest possible extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as inland fishing is concerned, it is linked up to a great extent with the tourist industry.  Our climatic conditions do not make for the encouragement of many types of holiday-making which might be popular in countries where there is a more steady climate. But inland fishing is an industry which is eminently suited to our climate.  A fisherman is not discouraged by summer showers or by any of the weather variations which we experience <Col N="945" /> here.  For that reason it is essential that we should provide in our rivers ample facilities for the fishing tourist.  It is satisfactory to learn that the Minister proposes, through his Department, to take over one river and study its problems fully.  That, I think, is a step in the right direction. I believe if an intensive study is made of the ways of sea fish, salmon, for instance, that plans can be laid to develop the fishing industry in our rivers and to guard against undue interference in the way of net fishing, weirs and illegal activities.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred briefly to the situation which has developed in the Liffey reservoir.  What happened there was very disappointing.  The disease which developed amongst the trout in that lake was a regrettable occurrence. It was a matter of intense gratification to everyone, in the first instance, when that lake became stocked with fish of very high quality.  Most people looked forward to a big tourist development on that lake.  It would be interesting to hear from the Minister what caused the disease which destroyed fish in the lake, whether it can be cured, whether the lake can be re-stocked in the near future, whether there is any danger of a similar disaster occurring again, and if it is likely to occur in other lakes or rivers.  It may be due to some peculiarity of that lake.  It is, of course, a peculiar lake in so far as it is a newly established one and it does not compare in any way with other lakes.</P>
    <P>There is another point connected with sea fishing that concerns my county to a certain extent and that is the statement of the Minister with regard to the provision of boats for inshore fishing.  I think the Minister should indicate whether orders are being placed right now for the construction of boats and whether facilities will be given to people engaged in that industry to go ahead.  Arklow has always been associated to a small extent with shipbuilding, and, I think, can fill many of the needs of the Sea Fisheries Association in this matter.</P>
    <P>Another matter which requires consideration&mdash;it was referred to by Deputy Healy&mdash;is the provision of <Col N="946" /> better facilities for the landing of fish. In common with other Wicklow Deputies, I have been concerned with the improvement of the dock facilities in Arklow, and we find in that connection that the Fishery Department have neither the power not the finance to develop these docks.  It is a matter for another Department, but as it is a matter which so vitally concerns the Fishery Department, I suggest that they should take power to develop these docks and landing places for fish, because otherwise there will be endless delay and certain ports may lose their trade as a result.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know if there is any provision in the Estimate for investigations with regard to the development of fisheries generally in other countries.  We all agree that there are other nations which are far ahead of us in the matter of sea fisheries, and in view of the Minister's statement that it is the intention to expand the industry, it might not be undesirable to send representatives to make investigations as to the plans to be put into operation in these countries. It would be a very desirable step before much expense is incurred here.  The big trouble in regard to fishing as in regard to agriculture, is the violent fluctuation in supply.  We have still the position that fish have to be thrown back into the sea from time to time.  That difficulty may be overcome by what the Minister has described as the cooling or cold storage of fish, and what Deputy Healy referred to as quick freezing.  Any measure which can be adopted to preserve fish until they are got on the market and distributed will tend to make the industry permanent and satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Finally, the inland distribution of fish must be speeded up.  It would appear that the most satisfactory way of getting fish to the market and to the consumer in the quickest possible way is by lorry.  Fast lorries could convey the fish to whatever centre it is required in, and that is one branch which will have to be dealt with&mdash;the rapid transport of fish by the most up-to-date method that can be devised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasCarter1921" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in a community of inland fishermen, and I want to ask the Minister what he intends to do with them.  Somebody has told me that the Electricity Supply Board has taken over the fishery rights on the upper reaches of the Shannon, from Lough Derg to Carrick-on-Shannon. In this area, there are about 50 families supported solely by eel fishing and I find that they break the law if they take any fish under half-a-pound weight.  Their contention is that they have no sale for the heavier fish, and that if they take an eel of half-a-pound weight off the hook and let him go he dies.  That, however, is a question for the experts in the fishery department of the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
      <P>What I am annoyed about is that these people have to pay a licence fee. The father of the family takes out that licence and if he is unable to go out to fish in the morning, and the young men go out instead, they are summoned and brought to court.  There are several cases pending at the moment and I want a pronouncement from the Minister as to what is to be done with these people.  They have a right, a prescriptive right, to fish on these lakes and rivers, and I hope that some day somebody will see that their rights are preserved, or, if they are not preserved, that they will get compensation. I have known inspectors&mdash;they call them bailiffs, but we have a grander name for them&mdash;to go down there and one morning they had a war. It was like the invasion of Normandy, and it was a miracle that somebody was not killed.  Some of the inspectors of the Department of Fisheries drew guns and the excuse they gave for doing so was that these people had knives.  The knives they were going to use were old knives which they use to cut the eels off the lines.</P>

They are good, honest, decent, hard-working people, who have fished there all their lives and made a living out of it, with <Col N="948" /> the two or three acres of land they have on a few of the islands in Lough Ree.  I want to see that they get fair play, and I want to see that if the old man takes out a licence and is unable to go out to fish, his son will be allowed to go out to fish instead.  When the licence goes to the house, the son should be allowed to fish instead of his father, if his father is unable to go out.  In cases where the father is an old age pensioner and is too old to go out fishing, the sons will not be allowed to fish.  I would appeal to the Minister to give his very kind consideration to these people.</P>

      <P>Since this Estimate was considered last year there does not appear to have been any improvement so far as the fishing industry is concerned. It may be that the war has interfered with any progress which the Minister had intended to make.  A number of Deputies have addressed themselves to the question of the provision of boats and gear for deep-sea fishing.  My experience of the Sea Fisheries Association is that it takes so long to deal with these matters that a man who is entitled to get gear or a boat gets entirely sick from waiting. I notice that in this year's Estimate the provision for boats and gears is down by the substantial sum of £3,400.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder what is the meaning of that?  One would imagine, now that the war is over, that more boats could be procured for the use of fishermen. The provision in last year's Estimate under this sub-head was £4,000, and this year it is down to £600.  I would ask the Minister to interest himself in the matter and get the Sea Fisheries Association to be more reasonable in their dealings with people who are in need of boats and gear.  I have two or three people in mind who have recently made application to the Sea Fisheries Association with a view to helping them to get boats.  One boat was examined and found to be satisfactory in every way.  In one case the association turned down the application altogether, and they have been playing with the other two applications for the last three or four months.  The Minister knows one of the men that I have in mind very well.  He is a seasoned <Col N="949" /> fisherman.  He is a man who knows his job and what a good boat should be.</P>
    <P>I do not know exactly what is meant by the provision for protection in the Estimate.  I presume it is protection for our deep-sea fishermen against foreign trawlers.  If that is so the provision is very small.  Last year it was £50 and this year it is only £30.  Now that the war is over, it is natural to expect that more foreign trawlers will be available, and that the provision under this sub-head should be increased rather than decreased.  I understand that already some of those foreign trawlers that have been released from war service are at work off the coast of Wexford.  There are great complaints in the Minister's constituency and in mine about the number of them that have been seen quite recently in the vicinity of Wexford.</P>
    <P>Deputy Healy spoke about the export of fish and of the lack of transport provided by the railway and shipping companies. I think it is time that the question of the marketing of fish was thoroughly examined.  We have the Gilbertian situation in the part of the country that I come from that despite the fact that Wexford is a seaport town, it is almost impossible to get fish there.  All the fish seem to be sent out of it to inland towns or to the City of Dublin.  Some arrangement should be made whereby supplies of fish would be allocated to large centres of population.  I agree with Deputy Healy that fishermen.  Who are engaged in a very precarious occupation are paid very low rates for the fish they catch.  One can realise that by comparing the prices they get and the preposterous charges that are made in shops for fish or in a restaurant, if you have fish for your lunch. Something should be done to regulate prices so far as the ordinary fisherman is concerned.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that if the fishing industry is to be properly developed something will have to be done in the way of providing facilities for the landing of the fish.  The Minister knows that his own constituency has a very long coast from the Tower of Hook to Arklow, and that it has very <Col N="950" /> few landing facilities.  With the exception of two or three places, no landing facilities are provided for the fishermen.  I think that recently the Minister's attention and my attention were drawn to the fact that the fishermen who operate in the Blackwater area have no landing facilities at all. You have a large number of people there who depend for their livelihood upon the fishing industry.  I would ask the Minister to see that something is done in the near future to remedy that situation.</P>
    <P>I was not in for the Minister's opening statement, but I infer from what other Deputies have said that he has in mind the provision of large fishing trawlers to be allocated to various areas.  I think that is a very desirable thing to do.  One, however, hopes that it will not interfere with the livelihood of those who are already fishing in certain waters and in certain areas.  I hope if any of those men are put out of commission that when the new boats are being manned first preference will be given to those who have been engaged in fishing in a particular area.  I suggest that would be the proper thing to do.  In conclusion, I hope the Minister will give his attention to the provision of landing facilities for those engaged in fishing, particularly in his own constituency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesKilroy" hpid="Mr. Kilroy Mr. Kilroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to make provision for the revival of the fishing industry along the western coast.  The local fishermen there have had a very lean time for a number of years, and it is to be feared that the fishing beds have been destroyed.  The fishermen there are without any large boats for fishing.  I appeal to the Minister to supply them with larger boats than the frail ones they have, and also to repair the slips and keep them in proper order.  One or two new piers are also badly needed along the west coast for the safety of the fishermen and the boats.  Owing to the war the trawlers have not been there for some time, but now that the war is over I suppose they will be back again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the war there used to be 20 and 30 trawlers along the west coast <Col N="951" /> every other day, every other week and month.  It is true to say that they used to take thousands of pounds' worth of fish to the British and foreign markets. Trawlers from Norway used to come there.  They would hardly come if it did not pay them well to do so.  I would ask the Government to try to revive the fishing industry along that coast.  It could be made one of our most valuable industries if it were properly looked after.  I think it is a mistake not to try to revive it and see that our fishermen get a chance.  The fishermen there have not any large boats, only small frail craft.  If they were provided with the larger boats there would be some chance of making the fishing along that coast the success it should be.</P>
    <P>Trawlers from foreign countries are coming in and taking fish from that area.  I do not think that very much has been done by either Governments for the fishing industry in the West of Ireland.  As far as I am aware they did not seem to be interested.  I do not know where the Sea Fisheries Association has done anything for west coast fishing.  I ask the Minister to see that the fishermen in that area are reorganised.  I believe there are as good fishing beds there as in any part of Ireland, and that they could be developed.  Between Killala Bay and Blacksod Bay the piers and slips require repairing as they are a source of danger in stormy weather.  If larger boats were built, and if fishermen were given the opportunity of buying them by instalments, I think there is a chance of developing the fishing industry.  It should now be possible to get money easily and at low rates of interest.  If the fishing industry was developed there is every prospect of a rich harvest.  I urge the Minister to see that more attention is given to the requirements of the western coast.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that if a Minister wants to assist the fishing industry it is necessary that he should serve his time as a fisherman and go out and get fish.  Certain Deputies referred to foreign trawlers fishing in Irish waters.  If my memory serves me <Col N="952" /> right, trawlers from Donegal that fish along Galway bay come within the category of &ldquo;foreign trawlers.&rdquo;  In other words, the Donegal men went out and caught fish.  I think Deputies should realise that fish cannot be regimented, and that they will not come in to meet boats manned by Irish fishermen.  Is it not a well-known fact that fishermen have to go after fish?  The Minister said that it was the intention of the Sea Fisheries Association to build boats large enough for deep-water fishing.  If Irish fishermen are enterprising enough to take advantage of that, well and good. If they do not, they have no cause for complaint.  Reference has been made to the hardship imposed on fishermen in being asked to pay 50 per cent. of the cost of providing fishing boats and nets.  As well as I remember, the chief difficulty of the Department has been to get any payment of that kind from fishermen who are assisted.  They want boats, they want nets, and when they have fish they want to put the money in their pockets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this debate during the last 15 or 16 years we have had the same old swan song.  It has been stated that we are not a fish-eating people.  People cannot be compelled to eat against their will.  We hear a good deal about extra catches of fish now and then, and because of that people are expected to see to it that the extra fish will not be lost.  We have always had that complaint about the fishing industry. With regard to this Estimate, my point is that if the Minister carries out the suggestions that have been made they are going to be very costly.  The Mercantile Marine cost a large amount of money without any great advantage accruing to the people as a whole. Despite the great attention bestowed to fishing by the Sea Fisheries Association, as far as the majority of people are concerned, fish seems to be unprocurable at a price that is within the reach of the purse of the average workingman.  If that is the case there is no use talking about developing fishing. If taxpayers have to pay large sums of money to foster an industry, and if they think they are not getting the advantages that they should get as a result of such expenditure, I can <Col N="953" /> see very little hope for the future of the industry.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that there has not been sufficient supervision of the rivers and that certain rivers were poisoned. I want to call the attention of the Deputy who made that assertion, and who asked the Minister and the Sea Fisheries Association to look into the question, to say, if people or neighbours were seen poisoning a river, how many would have the manliness to come forward and say so?  My experience has been that when poachers are brought to justice it is very hard to get people to come forward and give evidence that would convict them.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister about the position on the east coast as it affects in shore fishermen. They are very short of fishing gear, nets and material for making nets.  As far as the provision of boats is concerned, the old craftsmanship is still available to build boats to enable fishermen to pursue deep-sea fishing. The only difficulty is to find the timber. That is a difficulty which is not peculiar to the building of boats.  It applies to the building industry generally. The provision of timber is one of the big snags in regard to the building of boats at present.  If the Minister could do anything to facilitate the supply of the type of timber required for the building of boats, it would be very welcome to the fishermen of those districts.</P>
    <P>The next question that arises is that of the supply of nets.  One of the things the fishermen found it very difficult to procure was the necessary twine.  Formerly, those fishermen were able to buy their nets intact.  As often happens, necessity is the mother of invention, and those who were able to get twine during the emergency manufactured their own nets.  That took a considerable time, but they did it.  I think that the Minister did something last year to ease the situation with regard to the supply of twine, and I hope that his efforts will be even more successful this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred last year, and in his opening statement to-day, to certain experiments he intends to undertake respecting the preservation of shellfish.  I think that the Minister <Col N="954" /> is aware of the situation of the shellfish industry along the eastern coast as it affects those engaged in that industry.  In Kerry, a purification tank has been erected which enables those engaged in the industry to market mussels in such a condition as to satisfy the authorities on the other side and enable the fishermen to obtain a much higher price than they would receive if the mussels were sent straight from the beds, as formerly. That position does not obtain on the eastern coast.  Most of the fishermen whom I have in mind are engaged in the salmon fishing, which ends about September.  These men then engage in the gathering of shellfish, which gives employment at a time when employment is difficult to obtain.  Owing to the medical authorities on the other side having been obliged to impose certain conditions before shellfish could be imported, those men were prevented for some years from exporting any mussels.  During the past year or two, the conditions have been relaxed and they have been able to export large quantities of shellfish.  To put the industry on a sound basis and to guard against interference with exports of this particular type in future, it would be necessary to erect a purification tank which would cater for the industry along the eastern coast.  I would not ask the Minister to erect such a tank at the entrance to every harbour or to suit every half-dozen men engaged in the industry but I am sure a convenient site could be found which would meet the requirements of those engaged in the industry from, say, Carlingford Lough to Skerries or, possibly, Howth.  That would assure the market, as well as enabling the men concerned to receive a higher price than they have been receiving during the past few years.  I ask the Minister to consider those points in addition to any projects he may have for the improvement of the fishing industry in general.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind Deputies that the fishing industry is a very elusive type of industry.  It cannot be managed by the Minister in the same way as he manages his tillage policy. Some of the suggestions made by Deputies would give the impression that the Minister could do that.  One <Col N="955" /> cannot put fish in a strait-jacket and order them to go here or there to suit the convenience of the fishermen.  The fishermen have to follow them and do the best they can.  If, in some years, we do not do very well, we have to put up with it.  If the Minister proceeds with his programme this year, it may be possible in a few years to have a more continuous supply of fish here at prices which the people can afford to pay.  Everybody agrees that it has been impossible of late for a workman with a family to buy fish.  To buy Friday's dinner would require half a week's wages.  I am aware that 1/- was asked for mackerel and 1/6 or 2/- for a small place.  One can imagine how much would be required to provide a fish dinner for a family of eight or nine, particularly a family of young persons who would lower a fish as they would lower a sweet.  I hope that the Minister's efforts will meet with all possible success this year, especially in regard to the provision of trawlers to enable our fishermen to go further out to sea in pursuit of this very elusive article.  When the trawlers are at work, I trust it will be possible to have fish put on the market at a price which the people can afford to pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Our experience of the fishing industry for the past six years has been merely a repetition of that during the first war.  As the last speaker said, the fishing industry is a very unsteady and fluctuating one.  So far as this country is concerned, I think that the corner-stone of the industry is marketing.  It has often been said that we are not a fish-eating people.  In addition, we have not a steady supply of fish.  We have periods of glut and periods of scarcity and anything that the Department can do to keep back fish, by refrigeration or any other process, when there is a glut, will help to stabilise the industry.  Although refrigeration is very desirable, a great deal of progress has yet to be made and refrigeration will not solve the problem entirely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had the experience during the last six years that all the fishermen around the coast, whether they were members of the Sea Fisheries <Col N="956" /> Association or not, sent their fish up here to Dublin.  We had the experience, in the West, as in other places remote from Dublin, that fish, even though it was taken plentifully on the local coast, was not sold there, and even people who had marketing contracts with the local people simply ignored them and sent the fish on to private buyers.  The co-operative marketing idea, while a good one, is not, in my opinion, likely to produce the best results unless all the fishermen in the country are in it.  We have had cases of Grimsby fish passing down to Galway on one train, and Galway fish passing on another train up to Dublin. I know that these societies did not succeed because the people simply ignored their rules and went into the private market, but I think the Minister should regulate the price and make similar arrangements for the Galway men as was done in the case of the Arklow men for the Dublin market, and then a lot of this kind of thing would be cut out, and it should also be remembered that in the transport of this fish a lot of it sometimes goes bad.  I know that it would be something in the nature of unwarranted interference, but we know that the ordinary laws of supply and demand, as has been mentioned by many speakers, do not operate in connection with fish, that is, outside times of scarcity such as we had in the past six years.</P>
    <P>The association, of course, only caters for a fraction of the fishermen. In Galway, for instance, the Galway fishermen are not members of it at all, with the exception of a few.  For some reason or another the association has never been able to get them to come in and avail themselves of whatever privileges or advantages the association offers.  They want to market the fish in their own way and, apparently, the association has not been able to satisfy them that the prices would be as good as they would get by selling privately.  Even in the Aran Islands, where the association has been a great boon, in the last five years a number of these people have found private buyers here in Dublin.  Now, if the fish supply is to be controlled in such a way as not to have unnecessary <Col N="957" /> transportation and, therefore, to have something in the nature of regional marketing, it is absolutely necessary in my opinion that the Minister should regulate the price because, after all, if a fisherman can get once-and-a-half the price in Dublin that he can get in Galway, it is quite obvious that he will send the fish up to the Dublin market.</P>
    <P>With regard to boats, I was interested in the suggestion that large-sized trawlers and fishing boats be tried around the west coast.  I was a member of a committee of the association up to the outbreak of the war, and I wondered at the time whether they would be so needed in ordinary times as in times of emergency, and of course that was justified.  I know of people who could not put down £10 of a deposit at that time but, as a result of the war boom, we found that some of those people could come along and put down £100, £150 or £200 of a deposit.  That, of course, will happen, and people will try to get the best that the Government will give them.  As I say, the ordinary laws of supply and demand in this connection do not operate in times of peace here, and therefore the incentive is not there for the people to put money into it.</P>
    <P>I think it would be much better to put the industry on a business basis as in England, but I do not see much hope of that.  We have been treating the industry as more or less a social service but, on the other hand, I think that a fleet of 10 or 12 trawlers would supply us with the regular supply of fish required in this country, and that all others should be cut out.  As to whether that is a desirable thing to attempt or not, I should not like to offer an opinion, but when the fleets of British trawlers get going again we shall probably have the same experience as we had before and will only be able to sell our fish at sacrifice prices on the outside market.</P>
    <P>I should like to support my colleague, Deputy Kilroy, in pleading with the Minister on the question of protection.  I know that there is a three-mile limit, but I wonder if the Minister could make representations to the international organisation that has <Col N="958" /> a function in this matter of fishing with a view to seeing whether it would not be possible to extend the three-mile limit to a six-mile limit.  I think that with the improvement in trawling, and so on, the three-mile limit is insufficient to protect our fisheries, and spawning beds are being destroyed.  I think that it is not alone the foreign trawlers that are doing all the damage.  Some of our own trawlers are doing it, and if our fishermen had larger boats they could go out and spend a few days away out in the deep-sea fisheries and, accordingly, would not be tempted to scoop up the beds inside the three-mile limit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coburn referred to an incident that happened in Galway Bay.  It is not a very nice thing to see Galway Bay fishermen interfering with Donegal fishermen.  After all, they are not foreigners, but I am sure the Deputy will understand that those men who fish in Galway Bay are men whose fishing craft are limited mostly to sail, and they have not the same scope as the men supplied with power boats, and when they find that these men can come in it is quite easy to understand their resentment.  That is the explanation of the incident there.  I know it has been suggested that there was a scarcity of fish and that the men who came into Galway Bay were able to make more fish available for the community.</P>
    <P>That is quite true, and naturally we were all anxious to have as much fish as possible during the period of scarcity, but I should like to know what ideas the Minister has with regard to marketing in normal time&mdash; that period that we call normal in relation to anything else, but which, unfortunately, is most abnormal in connection with fishing.  On the question of refrigeration and fixing the price all around the coast for all Irish markets, the Minister might, be able to secure a better distribution and cut out a lot of this unnecessary transportation.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to know when the Minister intends to introduce the Bill he promised some time ago with regard to the boards of conservators. The general view is that it is most undemocratic, and you now have a <Col N="959" /> number of anglers associations with increasing memberships every year. These men will have a disinterested view of angling, and in my opinion they should have a better representation in the control and preservation of inland fishing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say at the outset that I have very little knowledge of fisheries, either sea or inland, but I have been listening to the debates on this Estimate here in this House for over 20 years, and I think I could safely say that the debate to-day, in the main, has been the very same as it was 20 years ago.  The things that have been said about Irish fisheries to-day have been said practically in the same words by members from all sides of this House over the past 20 years.  I think that the people of this country &mdash;that is the taxpayers&mdash;having dignified this industry by setting up for it a separate Department, with a Minister over it, and having paid the expenses of that Department for over 23 years, which run into a very large sum of money, are entitled to ask what return they are getting for it.</P>
      <P>Coming from an inland constituency, I am entitled to ask that on behalf of my constituents, because, so far as I can see, while we may talk about markets and about fishermen not being able to market fish, so far as three-fourths of our people are concerned the only fish they can get is fish out of a can.  We speak here and outside, quite properly if you like, of the home market being the right market for produce from the land.  Why do we not speak in the same way about what we bring out of the sea and the rivers? Why do we dignify with a Ministry this industry if it is not worth its salt, if it cannot prove itself, and give even a decent, livelihood to those who are engaged in it?  I think I would be fully justified in saying that the only time within the last 23 or 24 years in which the people engaged in the fishing industry have had a decent, consistent livelihood from it was the period of the last five years.  That was not due to any effort we were able to put forth; it was due simply to war conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="960" /> I think we ought to face up to this matter as realists.  I think we are entitled to say to ourselves that, if the industry is in the condition in which we are now told it is from all sides of the House, after 23 years under a native Minister, a period during which no money that was asked by the present or the previous Government for that Ministry was denied by the House, if we have made no progress at all, it is time there should be a serious examination of the whole position, and people should be told whether this industry can be developed, is worth being developed, and if so, how it can be done.  If it cannot be developed, then I think we ought to face up to that obvious fact.  I am perhaps blundering in, because, as I say&mdash;I admit it quite candidly&mdash;my knowledge of fishing, either sea fishing or inland fishing, is very small.  I do not think, however, I have not only the right, but the duty as a representative of people who have been supporting a separate Ministry for this industry, and who have contributed a large sum of money over the last 23 years, to ask what we are getting for it.  As I have already said, so far as the most of us are concerned, the only fish we can get at any price is fish out of a can.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House further but I suggest that we should now have reached a point, after 23 years, when we should seriously ask the Minister whether he is satisfied that it is worth carrying on in the way we have been carrying on for the last 23 years.  If he is not satisfied that we are getting anything like the results we should get, then I suggest the Minister and the Department should disclose to the House what steps they think should be taken to put this industry on a sound basis, which will enable those engaged in it to earn a decent livelihood.  I am sure if the Minister comes to the House with a scheme which will ensure that the House will not be in any way niggardly in voting the funds required to produce these results, but we ought not to go on fooling ourselves, if I might use the term without offence, that we have a very valuable industry, if it is giving results that none of us has any reason to be proud of.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just two matters to which I should like to refer briefly.  One is in connection with the experiment which was proposed by the Department in response to local representations some time ago in regard to a different type of boat for experimental fishing purposes at Kinsale, with a view to the utilisation of that type of boat in a wider sphere afterwards.  I should be glad if the Minister would say something as to the immediate prospects of that scheme. I entirely agree with Deputy Morrissey in regard to the shortage of fish in many areas where, I am convinced, some attempt could be made to get a reasonably good local market.  In the last few years I have seen individuals &mdash;and I am not trying to lay any blame at the door of the Minister or the Sea Fisheries Association in this matter&mdash;who were able to build up a fairly good trade in the sale of fish rapidly transported from places such as Bantry to other centres in West Cork.  More recently, however, I am afraid that sufficiently rapid transport has not been available.  I have had representations in the last few months from a few people who are willing to engage in that type of transport, to remove fish quickly to inland centres where it would have a ready sale, especially on Fridays.  I think I can say that a great many people would be very glad to use fish, even the less expensive types of fish, on days other than Fridays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister would use his influence with his colleague, the Minister for Supplies, with a view to seeing if, in the immediate future, further relief could be given to enable a certain number of selected people, <Col N="962" /> who could be tested in every way as to trustworthiness and capacity to do this work, to undertake the rapid transport of fish to various centres in West Cork from places where the fish is caught.  I suggest that arrangements might be made to give them a moderate allowance of petrol for that purpose.  These are the only two points I wish to make.  I hope the Minister will indicate, when concluding the debate, whether he can do anything in that connection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to ask the Minister if he can give some explanation of the very high price of fish in the City of Dublin.  I do not refer to the more expensive type of fish such as salmon and fish that one would see in high-class hotels.  I am talking about ordinary fish consumed by the ordinary people.  Within the last 12 months, the plainest type of fish was as dear as salmon.  I should like the Minister to give some indication as to the reason for these high prices.  Our trawlers go to sea as regularly as ever they did, yet no matter how good the catches are the price is still the same.  These high prices are beyond the means of the ordinary working-class.  On their behalf I ask the question: will the Minister explain why fish is so dear in the City of Dublin?</P>
