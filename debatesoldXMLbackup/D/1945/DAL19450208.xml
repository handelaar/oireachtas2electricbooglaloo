      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that in cases where dances and such functions are being organised for the funds of the Irish Red Cross, and where the supper materials and other elements are donated free by charitably disposed friends, such donations are not considered free, and are assessed at an arbitrary expense value by the Inland Revenue officers; that, as this assessment invariably brings the total expenses above 30 per cent. of the takings, it is impossible to bring these functions within sub-section (4) of Section 10 of the Finance Act, 1943; and, if so, if he will take steps to amend the instructions issued to his officers in such a manner as will enable this great national society to carry on its functions free from tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of supper-dances and similar functions, the net proceeds of which are devoted to philanthropic purposes, such as those of the Irish Red Cross, entertainments duty is only charged on such part of the payment for admission as represents the right of admission to the dance.  In assessing the duty, a due deduction is made in respect of the cost of the supper or other non-dutiable items.  As regards items donated free in respect of the dance itself, Section 10 of the Finance Act, 1943, provides that moneys expended in respect of any dutiable entertainment are to be <Col N="2314" /> regarded as expenses of the entertainment, irrespective of the person by whom, or the source from which they are provided.</P>
      <P>The majority of the entertainments promoted for the purpose of raising funds for the Irish Red Cross, in respect of which relief is sought, qualify for remission of duty.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will consider making arrangements whereby all Irish sailors on Irish ships will be exempt from income-tax on their bonus.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; to which the Deputy refers is the extra payment made to seamen on account of war risks.</P>
      <P>There is no provision in the law enabling any distinction to be drawn for income-tax purposes between this bonus and the ordinary earnings of seamen, both of which arise by virtue of their employment.  I have already considered the matter fully and I am not prepared to introduce amending legislation whereby war risk payments to seamen would be relieved from income-tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This bonus is paid to Irish seamen on Irish ships who are bringing the necessaries of life to this country.  The sailors have no objection to paying income-tax on their salaries but the bonus referred to is really danger money and Irish sailors on these ships have a great grievance in having to pay income-tax on that bonus.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider the question.</P>

      <P>The same scales of freight charges are applied by the public transport services for the conveyance of beet to the Carlow factory as to the other beet factories.  These scales have been investigated in my Department from time to time and I am satisfied that they are reasonable, having regard to all the circumstances of the traffic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that suppliers of sugar beet to the Carlow factory do not receive the same subsidy as suppliers to the other three factories?  In Tuam all freight charges over 5/- are paid by the company; in Mallow and Thurles all freight charges over 8/- are paid by the company.  The same subsidy does not apply in the case of the Carlow factory, and growers who reside a long distance from the factory are penalised.</P>

      <P>An extension of the law governing the allocation of grants for the reconstruction of farmers' dwellings is not contemplated.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Housing Acts with regard to the reconstruction of such houses apply to holdings with a valuation not exceeding £25.  The total number of holdings within this limit is over 300,000, or 80 per cent of the total number of agricultural holdings, and so far as I am aware, no case exists for increasing the present valuation limit of £25.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not realise that there is a case for at least a small increase, say, up to £35?  That would bring in a large number of farmers who are in rather difficult circumstances, and who occupy practically the same type of dwellinghouse as the people under £25 valuation, that would be the old mudwall houses, which do need to be reconstructed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount in the Hospitals Trust Fund at the 30th September last was approximately £8,000,000.  As regards the investment of the fund it has been pointed out on previous occasions in replies to Parliamentary questions that Ministers cannot be expected to furnish information with regard to matters for which a statutory board has full discretion and responsibility subject, of course, to any specific restrictions imposed by law.  As regards the latter part of the question it is assumed that the Deputy has in mind the application of portion of the fund to the establishment of sanatoria in accordance with the provisions of the Bill which is under consideration in the House.  I am unable to specify the amount likely to be expended for the purpose but it is hoped to confine the expenditure within a limit of £2,000,000.  No portion of the Hospitals Trust Fund could be legally applied in supplying comforts to patients in the hospitals throughout the country.  That is primarily a matter for the governing bodies of the hospitals concerned.</P>

It is not proposed to deprive any of the persons who received conditional Orders of the right of being reheard.  We are bringing in a section which provides for that, but that applies only to those cases which were in, say, up to the first of the present month.

      <P>It is clear from the Minister's reply that the intention of this legislation is to deprive those who were not directly associated with the legal proceedings of the benefits of the findings of the court.  I want to impress on the Minister and on the Government and on the Dáil that that is a very unwise and possibly a very dangerous proceeding.  It took some time to wean a great number of people in this country away from lawlessness, and back to a spirit of respect for the law and respect for the institutions of this State, including Parliament.  It took a very wearying amount of organisation and argument to convince a great number of people that they should place their faith in the courts and in the sense of justice of Parliament. Eventually the overwhelming majority of the people concerned decided to rely on the courts for justice, according to the law, and on Parliament for fair play.  They got justice from the courts, and they hope for fair play from Parliament.  This Bill proposes to deny the benefits of a court decision to hundreds and hundreds whose names were not associated with the conditional Order, but who were, in fact, subscribers to the idea of bringing cases before the courts, both in the bodily sense and in the financial sense.  The cases taken were merely test cases, and the proposed legislation, I say without hesitation, <Col N="2323" /> is an unwise attempt to cheat those people of their legal rights.  It is in the national sense dangerous; in the <Col N="2324" /> political sense it is unwise, and in the sense of honour it is unfair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill was under discussion last night, Sir, I moved to report progress.  I was then advising the Minister to retain in the existing section the provision whereby, when compensation falls to be paid to a person, whose property has been acquired or whose business has been interfered with as a result of the activities of the Electricity Supply Board, the amount of compensation should be calculated on a basis of 3 per cent. in interest.  The effect of Deputy Hughes's amendment is that the calculation of interest should be carried out at the rate of 6 per cent. It seems to me that to calculate on a basis of 6 per cent. compensation on <Col N="2325" /> money outstanding by the State is simply asking that this matter of compensation should be trowelled on the State which, as everybody knows, usually calculates these matters on a fairly generous basis.  Deputy Hughes said that in the case of a man whose property is compulsorily taken over in the interest of the State, that man might have to wait for a long period&mdash; possibly, two or three, or even more years&mdash;before he got compensation, or before he could get alternative accommodation, even after he had got compensation; and he held that in that case 3 per cent. interest was hardly fair.  It would seem to me, however, that that surely is a case against paying compensation immediately.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hughes's amendment might have some validity if he were asking that compensation should not be paid for two, three or more years after the award, so as to enable the man to get his money pending the time that he could get alternative premises, if that were necessary as a result of the acquisition of his property by the Electricity Supply Board.  I think, however, that compensation at the rate of 3 per cent. is equitable, in this year of 1945, when money can be got by this State at 3 per cent., and, in a neigh-bouring country, at substantially less than 3 per cent.  That, in my view, is treating those who may be affected by the Bill in a very reasonable way.  As the Minister rightly said, the Bill has been drawn with due advertence to the price that money is costing on the market to-day and the price at which the public is willing to lend money, and my strong advice is that the Minister should stand by the section in the Bill, as drawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me, Sir, that the argument put forward by Deputy Norton just now is rather specious.  It is not a question of giving the person concerned time to procure alternative premises.  The position is that, having regard to the fact that, whilst awaiting payment of his money he may be out of business or out of production, the amount of interest provided for in the section is too small, and that he should be given something over and above that in order to compensate <Col N="2326" /> him for the time during which he is not in a position to earn a livelihood.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The only question at issue here is the rate of interest which should be taken into account in determining the additional amount to be paid to a person, in excess of the amount of compensation, as a result of any delay in awarding compensation. There is no question here of the amount of the compensation, which, presumably, would be determined with due regard to the amount of disturbance caused to the person concerned. The question here is the matter of possible delay, but that delay might be due to a variety of causes.  It might, for instance, be due to the action of the person claiming compensation. If agreement cannot be reached, then the question of the amount has to be determined by arbitration.  It seems that arbitration proceedings can be instituted by the person claiming compensation, and it is, therefore, open to the individual concerned to take appropriate action to ensure that there will be no delay. Now, if we were to give more than the market rate, it appears to me that would be offering an inducement to people to delay the matter further.  I think that no inducement should be held out to people which might lead them to delay matters because they are offered a higher rate of interest than the ordinary market rate at the time, and, in that connection, I may say that all previous Bills have followed the same line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that what Deputy Coogan has said provides a classic example of this kind of thing. This Bill provides for payment of compensation to a person whose property has been acquired or whose business has been affected by the activities of the board.  Let us suppose that a man's property or business is taken over on a certain day in the week, and that the matter is decided on the following Monday.  The property or business concerned may be only a field or, possibly, a house which he has rented to somebody else, and it is the <Col N="2327" />&ldquo;somebody else&rdquo; who may be the sufferer; but if a man goes to court on, say, Monday, is awarded compensation, and his property is taken over on Tuesday, there is no case there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Electricity Supply Board, knowing the direction their lines will have to follow and knowing the routes which they will have to travel, will say that such-and-such a property must be acquired or that such-and-such a thing must be done and that, accordingly, they may settle the amount of compensation in advance, and before they actually reach the area to be affected by this. The persons concerned may not be very much affected at all.  It might be merely a question of the right to run wires through a field, or some such thing as that, which might not affect that person's business to any extent at all.  Yet, the proposal in the amendment is to put a premium of 6 per cent. on the payment of compensation.  I may say that I do not know where any person in this State to-day can get 6 per cent. interest, and it seems to me that the payment of 3 per cent. in the circumstances would meet the situation reasonably.</P>

      <P>The purpose of amendments Nos. 6 and 7, which appear in Deputy Hughes's name, is to extend the minimum period within which the board can take possession of land or a dwellinghouse.  I would ask that these amendments should not be pressed, because, if we were to extend the periods to the extent suggested here, it <Col N="2328" /> would seriously hamper or delay the rate at which the board could proceed. I can assure the House that the board will give as long a notice as possible to persons who may be disturbed in their property or business, and I think it is merely necessary to provide, as a safeguard for the individuals concerned, that the notice shall not be less than what is provided for in the Bill: namely, one month or three months in the case of lands or dwellings, respectively. To increase the period to six months or 12 months, I think, would mean that the immediate works which are in contemplation would be very seriously delayed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must know that there is a difference in the circumstances between this and the other case, and that it might be very difficult to get alternative accommodation in the space of a few months.  I can see the difficulty of providing a substantially higher minimum than that provided for in the section, but will the Minister give an undertaking on behalf of the board, that they will give sympathetic consideration in any case where the minimum set out here would cause hardship to those affected? Will the Minister undertake, on behalf of the board, that such cases will get sympathetic consideration?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can give that assurance.  In fact, it is not at all unlikely, in the circumstances now existing, that the board will meet with unusual delays in proceeding with the work and will give ample notice on that account owing to difficulties in proceeding with the work as rapidly as they would like, I can assure the Deputy that not only will notice be given longer than the minimum set out in the Bill but the longest possible notice will be given and due account taken of <Col N="2329" /> exceptional circumstances in individual cases.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Hughes, I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (4) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4)  In the case of a person who is compelled under the foregoing provisions of this section to vacate a dwellinghouse or a dwellinghouse and farm or surrenders such an area of land as to make the remainder of his holding uneconomic, the board shall either pay monetary compensation or if the individual so desires provide a dwellinghouse or a dwellinghouse and lands as the case may be economically equal in every way to the original property and subject to the arbitration provisions of Part IV of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister should favourably consider this amendment.  The most recent scheme under which people were dispossessed of holdings was the Liffey hydro-electric scheme, and while a fair number of people were dispossessed, because it was a water scheme, many were seriously inconvenienced and left without homes until compensation was paid.  Considerable delay did attend some cases, particularly where people were disturbed in holdings in which they had been allowed to remain for some time.  As the Minister appreciates, these people were moved from homes in which they had lived for generations, and while they might have got as economic or as good holdings of land, or as large houses as they had previously, there was something in the fact that these families had lived so long in the former places.  A number of farms were affected by the pipe-line connecting the Liffey scheme with County Wicklow, County Dublin and portion of Kildare. The owners were also adversely affected by large banks of mud left on the land when the scheme was completed. The compensation paid to many of these people did not take sufficient cognisance of that fact.  I presume people are always dissatisfied <Col N="2330" /> with the compensation they get and think they should get more, but I know cases where they were seriously inconvenienced by banks of mud that were left on their holdings, and that the compensation did not take cognisance of the deleterious effects of such material on the land.  Acceptance of this amendment would alleviate some of the hardships under which they suffered.</P>

      <P>So far as dwelling-houses are concerned, the board are given power in Section 29 to construct alternative dwellings for the persons concerned, if they so agree.  So far as a farm is concerned, the Deputy will appreciate the difficulty of putting on the board the obligation to provide another farm in the same locality or of the same character.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the Liffey scheme, the Land Commission did co-operate, by endeavouring to provide, for those whose lands were submerged in the area, alternative holdings in the same vicinity.  It is only the Land Commission could do that.  As it happened, there were some estates in the hands of the Land Commission in the locality which were available for that purpose.  Clearly, while that obligation could be put on the Land Commission, it could not be put on the Electricity Supply Board.  If the effect of the acquisition of part of a holding rendered the balance of the holding so uneconomic as seriously to interfere with its working, that factor would be taken into account in determining the amount of compensation payable.  I think that is as far as we could go in putting such an obligation on the Electricity Supply Board.  If it is a question of buildings, and if the person concerned agrees, the board will construct other buildings in lieu of compensation.  If it is a question of a farm, the board will, no doubt <i>ex gratia,</i> endeavour to meet the requirements of the land holder and solicit the co-operation of the Land Commission in that respect.  It is impracticable to extend the statutory <Col N="2331" /> obligation to pay adequate compensation, which will take into account not merely disturbance caused by acquisition of the land but the effect of that acquisition upon the working of the remainder of the holding, if only part of it is taken.  That is as far as we could go with the Electricity Supply Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act here, but I think its provisions are much more vague than the amendments.  Consider a case where portion of a farm is utilised, or may no longer be suitable for cultivation.  In such a case there may be buildings suitable for a larger holding than that now in possession of the owner and on which he will pay a larger valuation.  Would the Minister consider bringing in an amendment on the Report Stage or in the Seanad to reduce such valuations?  While compensation would be payable the owners would be saddled with higher valuations on smaller holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Anything of that kind will have to be done by an alteration under the Valuation Acts.  There is the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act which applies to cases where land is acquired for public purposes.  It would obviously be undesirable <Col N="2332" /> to effect any modification of the terms of that Act in the case of the Electricity Supply Board.  In so far as that Act offers a fair basis for assessing compensation, it applies in all cases where land is acquired, and the Electricity Supply Board should operate under that Act the same as any public organisation.</P>

      <P>With regard to the point the Minister made about the Acquisition of Land Act, I think that, as Deputy Cosgrave said, the Act is very vague.  I am not a lawyer, so I do not pretend to be able to give an exact reading of it, but it seems to me that the Act does not take into consideration at all such an eventuality as I foresee, of a farm of 100 acres, 50 acres of which will go.  The buildings on that farm were erected to suit a farm of 100 acres, but the owners will be left with 50 acres.  I am not, as I say, a lawyer, so I could not give any judgment on it, but, reading the Acquisition of Land Act, it struck me that such an eventuality is not covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be taken as expressing any opinion upon the Acquisition of Land (Compensation) Act, or the desirability of any modification or amendment of that Act.  The point I want to make is that the incorporation of that Act in this Bill is reasonable.  I see no reason why the Electricity Supply Board <Col N="2333" /> should be required to pay compensation on any basis other than the basis on which any other public authority acquiring land for its purposes has to pay compensation.  If land is acquired for a waterworks or for a rural housing undertaking by a public authority, it is that Act which applies in assessing the compensation in default of agreement.  I think the Electricity Supply Board should be subject to the same Act as these other authorities.  It may be that somebody could argue in favour of a modification of the terms of that Act.  On that I can express no opinion, but whatever modifications might at any time be made in the provisions of that Act should apply not merely to the Electricity Supply Board but to public authorities and other persons acquiring land under it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the Act has been applied in all this type of legislation since the State was established and that no real case of hardship has ever been shown is, I think, an indication that its provisions do give arbitrators full scope in assessing compensation.</P>

I understand that the procedure at present is to consult the Minister for Agriculture who is also Minister for Fisheries, but there are a number of boards throughout the country who do rather good work and who are very well informed as to an area's requirements, and I think that it might be no harm to bring in an amendment on Report Stage to make it obligatory on the board to consult those people and have their opinion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that an Independent Deputy is placed in a very awkward position by the Committee Stage of such a Bill as this coming to shortly after the Second Reading?  He has to rely on himself and has to deal with all Bills, whereas members of a Party can divide their labours.  I intended to put in an amendment to this section for the <Col N="2338" /> purpose of getting information, but I did not get it in in time.  Sub-section (1) of this section states that all works executed by the board shall be free from rates.  Then sub-section (3) states</P>

      <P>I should have thought, from sub-section (1), that any land acquired by the board would be subject to the assessment which it bore before the board acquired it, but sub-section (3) raises a certain doubt in my mind as to the intention of the Minister.  Is it the intention that, as soon as the board acquires any land or property, it will cease to be assessed to rates?</P>

If the board were to acquire my farm, so far as I can see, rates would still have to be paid on it as a farm.</P>

We have now, I think, succeeded in establishing that the property of the Electricity Supply Board used in connection with the generation or transmission of electricity should be exempt from local rates.

      <P>On behalf of Deputy McGilligan, I move amendment No. 12:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2342" /> To delete all words after the word &ldquo;fishery&rdquo; in line 7 down to and including the word &ldquo;Agriculture&rdquo; in line 8 and in lieu thereof to insert the following words: &ldquo;the board shall consult with the Minister for Agriculture and if the Minister for Agriculture&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The one point in the amendment is, who is the appropriate Minister to take action with regard to the fisheries?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not quite a question for any Minister.  The position that we are trying to provide against here did, in fact, arise in the Shannon.  The board was obliged by the Shannon Development Act to pay compensation to all persons whose fisheries were damaged or destroyed or to all persons who lost their livelihood because of the destruction of the fisheries there.  So many cases of dispute and argument arose that, when I became Minister for Industry and Commerce, I decided to endeavour to resolve the protracted disputes that had proceeded by giving the board power, in lieu of determining to pay compensation for damage, to acquire the fishery on the basis of what it had been worth before the works were constructed. Eventually, the Electricity Supply Board acquired all the fisheries in the Shannon and became itself the only owner and manager of the fisheries there.  Now, it is possible that on the Erne, or some other rivers that may be subsequently developed, a similar situation may arise in which the simplest and cleanest method of disposing of individual claims will be not to try to assess the damage done to the fishery which, as the Deputy will understand, may not be easily determinable&mdash;certainly not determinable for a number of years&mdash;but in lieu of paying compensation on the basis of damage, and to acquire the fishery for what it was undoubtedly worth before the works were begun.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem in assessing compensation in respect of damage to fisheries arises from the fact that it may be many years before even an expert will decide whether, and to what extent, <Col N="2343" /> damage has been done.  That is the problem that arose in the Shannon, and that is the problem that may arise elsewhere.  If there is that element of doubt, that impracticability of determining the compensation, then the board, in lieu of paying compensation, may acquire the fishery, in which case, in default of agreement, the arbitrator will only have to take into account what, in fact, the fishery was worth, having regard to the profits earned.  The purpose of the section is to give the board the right, in lieu of paying compensation, to acquire the fishery outright.  It is the board that, in fact, will take the decision.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment, I take it, is to provide that the board will not acquire the fishery without consulting the Minister for Agriculture. This is not altogether a fishery matter.  From the point of view of the Minister for Agriculture and his interests in fisheries, it does not much matter whether the fisheries are owned by one person or another, by a private individual or the board, he will have the same obligation in regard to the fisheries, namely, to protect them and further develop them.  In this matter we are really concerned with a very practical difficulty&mdash;determining the amount of compensation in individual cases.  We are, therefore, giving the board this power to acquire outright in lieu of assessing damage and paying compensation on the assessment.</P>

      <P>Suppose, for example, that a disease, such as that which affected fish in the Liffey, did not manifest itself for some time, would the board take into consideration the loss which the owners of the fishery rights had sustained?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a problem in the Shannon.  I think there were even cases where the board contended that the fishery, instead of being damaged, had been improved, but, naturally, the owner of the fishery who was suffering an immediate loss would not, perhaps, agree.  Again, it seemed to me that in such cases the fairest thing was to buy him out altogether.  The Liffey was a <Col N="2344" /> different problem altogether.  I think that for pleasure purposes fisheries on the upper reaches of the Liffey were substantially improved by the impounding of the waters.  It was due to accidental causes that this new disease, which affects the fisheries, developed there.  The Shannon and the Erne are important fisheries.  They are salmon fisheries and could be quite seriously interfered with by the impounding of the water.  In fact, the board hope to make the Shannon salmon fisheries more valuable in the future than they ever were in the past by reason of their unified control of them and power of development.  Possibly a similar situation will arise in the case of the Erne, but I could not attempt to forecast that.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Provided that the official arbitrator under the said Act shall, where an agricultural holding is reduced in size by the acquisition of part of it by the board so that the remaining portion is uneconomic or the farm buildings on it are disproportionate in size for its future use as an agricultural holding, make allowance for the deterioration in value of such remaining portion.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This point has been discussed already. When I came in I was quite hopeful about it, but the more the Minister was pressed the less hopeful it sounded to me.  I wonder if he could go back to the original position, so that a sympathetic view would be taken in such a matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour to have, by the Report Stage, an authoritative statement of the powers given to an arbitrator under the Acquisition of Lands Act, as it has been interpreted heretofore.  I am fairly satisfied in my own mind, from previous experience of the administration of that Act, that the arbitrator has power to take into account not merely the value of the property but also such items as the disturbance and the compensation which should be given in respect of disturbance or the diminution <Col N="2346" /> of the value of the property left in the hands of the owners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>They can only revalue the buildings.  All the commissioners can do is apportion between what is acquired and what is left.  The buildings can be revalued, but the basis of revaluation may not allow the Commissioners of Valuation to reduce the valuation.  The difficulty arises, from Deputy Sheldon's point of view, in that respect.  You may have large buildings left, the letting value of which would be determined by the valuation which the commissioners put on it.  They may not be entitled to alter or reduce the valuation.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Hughes, I move amendment No. 15:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) All claims for compensation not settled by agreement shall be brought to arbitration by the board within one year from the date such claims are made.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (1) lays down that all claims must be made within a year. The intention of the amendment, which is obvious, is that when the claim is put in, if there is no settlement of the claim or no agreement within a further year, it will be referred to arbitration.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Hughes did not appreciate that reference to arbitration may be undertaken on the initiative of the person claiming.  It is not merely a matter of the board referring the claims to arbitration. The individual himself can refer them if there is no agreement.  The effect of the amendment would be to leave in doubt the power of the board to pay compensation if arbitration proceedings were not started within a year.  I think the position is much better as it is.  The board will make an offer, the person whose property is acquired will negotiate with the board or accept their offer, and is fully free to initiate arbitration proceedings himself if he is satisfied there is no likelihood of agreement or there is a possibility of delay in arriving at an agreement.</P>

      <P>I would not say that that is desirable.  We are proposing to give the board power under this Bill, subject to getting the sanction required by the Bill to manufacture apparatus, machinery or equipment, or to promote a company in which it would have an interest for the purpose of undertaking such manufacture. It seems to me that there is no reason why the board, if it is given the power to manufacture itself or to promote a company to undertake the manufacture of apparatus, should not also have the power to acquire some existing undertaking which might be developed into a larger undertaking for the manufacture of a wider range of apparatus or equipment.</P>
      <P>Normally, I can say that the intention is that the board will not be authorised to commence manufacture where it is clear that some existing concern is doing the manufacture or is willing to do it or some private interest is prepared to undertake the manufacture on a satisfactory basis.  It may be necessary, in relation to certain classes of apparatus, where the board would be the only customer, for the board to do the work itself and that is the reason we give it this power.  In certain circumstances, it may facilitate the board to be able to acquire some existing concern which has a factory and equipment that could be adapted for this purpose, instead of putting the obligation on them in all cases to promote a new undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event, I think that if (b) were not there, the board could easily get around the point as, if it could not itself acquire the undertaking to do this work, it would only have to go through the procedure of promoting a company which would have the power <Col N="2349" /> to acquire any undertaking already there.</P>

      <P>They were only drafting amendments.  Perhaps I may ease any doubts in Deputy Sheldon's mind by saying that they could not be <Col N="2350" /> accepted.  There is a difference between a road and a bridge.  A bridge would presumably be entirely within the area of one local authority but a road might be in the area of more than one local authority.  That is why it is necessary to have different provisions for roads and bridges.  The Deputy appears to assume that one comprehensive section would cover both roads and bridges. Clearly there is a possibility of different conditions applying in the case of roads and bridges so we must have two separate sections.</P>

      <P>That is so.  I had to draft this amendment in a hurry and I could not find a better method of meeting the point I wished to meet. It was drafted rather roughly.  I can see the difficulty the Minister is in, but the difficulty I am in is that in paragraph (c) I wish to delete the words.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;where the board constructs a permanent road and such road is, in the opinion of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, substantially a reconstruction of a pre-existing road.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I cannot see why a local authority should be called upon at any time to bear any part of the cost of such reconstruction.  If the road was already there, and was presumably giving satisfactory service, and through the action of the board a new road has to be substituted for it, why should the local authority have to pay anything?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The board may, for example, construct a concrete road to replace an ordinary water macadam road.  That would release the local authority from considerable upkeep costs.

      <P>That is a debatable point.  I wonder would the Minister re-examine the wording &ldquo;substantially a reconstruction.&rdquo;  Could he not devise some better safeguard for the local authority?  Where a road is improved in classification, say that it is transformed from a water macadam road into a concrete road, I think the local authority should bear some portion of the cost, but that is not what is in the Bill.  It says &ldquo;substantially a reconstruction of a pre-existing road&rdquo;.  I would say that the local authority should have to pay only in a case where the new road was better than the old one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 19:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 22, before sub-section (3), to insert the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3) Whenever the board contract with any person for the execution by him of the whole or any part of such works as are mentioned in this section it shall be mandatory on the board to insert in the contract made with such person a provision requiring such person to pay rates of wages and observe conditions of employment not less favourable to the persons employed under the contract than the wages paid and conditions of employment prescribed under trade union agreements applicable to work of a similar kind or in the absence of such trade union agreements the wages paid and the conditions of employment observed by good employers in the district in which the work is carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a provision in this section of the Bill under which the board has power to employ contractors for the purpose of executing certain types of work which the board may desire to delegate to private contractors.  The contractors so employed by the board can exercise all the powers that have been conferred on the board by the provisions of the Act.  I have no doubt that the board, being a sensibly constituted board, and having now a pretty long record of service under trade union agreements, will wisely decide that it will for the purpose of carrying out its works enter into negotiations with trade unions and observe the conditions which result from these negotiations, but it is by no means certain that a private contractor will do the same.  The object of the amendment is to ensure that where the board enters into a contract with any person it shall be mandatory on the board to insert in the contract made with such person a provision requiring such person to pay rates of wages and observe conditions of employment not less favourable to the persons employed under the contract than the wages paid and conditions of <Col N="2354" /> employment prescribed under the trade union agreement applicable to work of a similar kind or, in the absence of such trade union agreement, the wages paid and the conditions of employment observed by good employers in the district in which the work is carried out.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that the early Shannon scheme had a rather unsavoury reputation from the point of view of wages paid and conditions of employment of most of the staff originally recruited.  The desire here is to ensure that in this very comprehensive scheme nothing like that should recur.  I hope, therefore, that the Minister, who I am sure accepts the principle of the amendment, will see that it is incorporated in the Bill so as to provide against the possibility that sub-contractors, by paying low rates of wages after they have received a contract from the board, may sully what would be otherwise known as a great national scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>All contracts entered into by the board contain a fair wages clause.  That has been the practice of the board in the past and it will be the practice in the future.  The Shannon works to which the Deputy refers were not constructed by the Electricity Supply Board or by any contractors of the board; they were constructed by a contractor of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only objection I have to inserting this provision in the Bill is the fact that it seeks to impose on the board a statutory obligation that does not attach to employers generally.  I can assure the Deputy that the board imposes a fair wages clause in connection with all contracts and will continue to do so, and that if they, for any reason, should be reluctant to do so, they can be required to continue the practice by administrative action and will be so required.  I have, however, an objection to imposing by statute this obligation upon one employer.  If there is a case for imposing this obligation upon employers by statute, then, of course, the board will be included.  I prefer to leave the situation as it is in which the board's adoption of the fair wages clause was <Col N="2355" /> due, not to a statutory obligation, but to its own decision; and that its maintenance of the use of that clause will be similarly due to its own decision. I think that it is only fair that the board should be given that sense of independence of statutory obligation in that matter and certainly should not be subject to an obligation that does not attach to any other employer or any other people doing construction work of a similar character.  The Government's position is quite clear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that the board is in somewhat a different position from ordinary employers.  This is a board into which the State or the community has poured a very considerable amount of capital and this Bill is for the purpose of giving the board further capital to discharge certain duties on behalf of the community.  I take it from the Minister's attitude, and particularly from his speech last night, that the Minister would desire in this field of national endeavour that there should be a decent rate of wages paid and reasonable conditions of employment observed. It is regrettable, of course, that you cannot get every employer to pay a good rate of wages or observe decent conditions of employment.  I think the case I am making is in tune with the Minister's mental make-up on this matter, but I think the State, when it pours money into an undertaking of this kind, ought to give some manifestation of its general desire that there should be decent wages paid and good conditions of employment observed by imposing this obligation on contractors carrying out the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section may, in fact, not be any more efficacious than the existing practice but, from the point of view of the State setting a headline and declaring its mind on the matter, it is desirable in a national undertaking of this kind that the Minister should say: &ldquo;Here is the State's headline under Article 45 of the Constitution.  This is what we desire.  We put it into legislation and that is the standard we set.&rdquo;  It may not be possible at present to compel all employers to do it, but I think the Minister will agree <Col N="2356" /> that it is an objective to be aimed at and if there is no substantial objection &mdash;and I gather from the Minister that there is not&mdash;I think the Minister ought to move, if necessary, gradually, towards the objective of setting a headline of that kind for other persons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an objection and the objection is this: that I want the position to continue in which the board adopts the fair wages clause in all contracts of its own decision and not because it is required to do so by law. I assure the Deputy that the board are not going to depart from that practice and would, in any event, find it impossible to depart from it in so far as they must get approval of their schemes from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I am resisting the amendment for the same reason that a similar amendment to the Arterial Drainage Bill was resisted.  Again, in connection with the Government Department concerned, it is the practice to stipulate a fair wages clause in all contracts and there is no intention to depart from that practice.  Because it has been established as a practice which was born of policy, we want to keep it on that plane rather than as a statutory obligation which people might be inclined to evade.  I think there is something to be said from the point of view of the board, in their dealings with employees and contractors generally, that they should be in the position that they are adopting this fair wages clause as their policy and not as something they are required to do by legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is also a similar obligation in respect of industries established under reserved commodities licences and other private persons who are getting some positive advantage from legislation.  Because these private persons were getting, from legislation, positive advantages of one kind or another, we imposed this obligation on them.  That is a reasonable thing to do and I would normally adopt that practice in any further legislation <Col N="2357" /> of a similar kind.  But we must regard the Electricity Supply Board, however, as being something of the same character as a Government Department. There is no likelihood that the policy which obtains will change and I think it ought to be kept on the basis of a policy and not upon the basis of a statutory obligation.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to fix the rate, with the object of preventing the Minister for Finance making a handsome profit out <Col N="2358" /> of any advances made to the board.  It would seem undesirable that the Minister should have the right to fix the rate on these advances when he may be able to find money at a very cheap rate.  We consider that the rate of interest charged on the advances should not be more than would enable him to cover administrative costs.  I take it that that was the purpose for which Deputy Hughes put down the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With that point of view I agree, but I do not think you will find it easy to provide for it in legislation. If Deputies want to question the method of lending followed by the Minister for Finance, I think they must do so on a finance measure.  In so far as this Bill is concerned, we can only provide that the money will be advanced at such a rate as may be prescribed by the Minister for Finance. We cannot prescribe the actual rate, as Deputy Sheldon suggests, without knowing at what rate, the Minister will be able to borrow, nor can we prescribe fixed conditions, such as are suggested by Deputy Hughes or Deputy McGilligan. In practice, the board gets advances from the Minister for Finance only as it requires the money.  It is clearly uneconomic for the board to get advanced to it, say, the total capital sum it expects to expend upon the Erne works until it has to pay out sums to contractors and providers of material, etc.  Therefore, it draws only from the Exchequer as it requires it and thus avoids having to pay an uneconomic interest or having the money lying idle.  The rate at which the Minister for Finance will borrow will vary from time to time.  Deputies spoke about the 5 per cent. which the board has paid upon past advances. But a great deal of money which was borrowed by the Minister for Finance and advanced to the board was borrowed by him at 5 per cent.  These various advances are made to the board out of different borrowings by the Exchequer at varying rates of interest which are determined by market conditions.  That is why it is not practicable to say in this Bill that all the money required by the Electricity Supply Board for these development <Col N="2359" /> works will be advanced either at a named rate of interest or at a rate which will have some relation to the prevailing market rate or which will not be more than a certain amount above the prevailing market rate, because the market rate changes from time to time.</P>
      <P>We are proposing to authorise the Electricity Supply Board to proceed forthwith with the construction of the works on the Erne, but we know that the future is so uncertain that it may be three, four, five, perhaps six or seven years, before the board will be in fact able to complete these works and will require the money from the Minister for Finance and during these three, four, or six years, there may be wide fluctuations in the market rate for money and borrowings by the Exchequer at different rates.  The function of the Minister for Finance is to advance the money to the Electricity Supply Board at such a rate as will recover for him the interest he himself has to pay plus the management expenses involved.  If Deputies want to question his calculation of management expenses in respect of advances of this kind or the rate of interest at which he borrows or should borrow, they must do it on a finance measure.  So far as this Bill is concerned, I do not think we can go further than to prescribe that the Minister for Finance can fix the rate.</P>
      <P>I would agree fully with the principle that the Exchequer should not try to make a profit out of the Electricity Supply Board by charging an excessively high rate of interest upon the advances made by it, but you cannot really protect the Electricity Supply Board against that by a provision here. You can only protect that by ensuring that the general policy of the Minister for Finance in respect of advances of this kind, whether to the Electricity Supply Board or the Local Loans Fund or any other purpose, is such as to avoid the possibility of a profit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>My reason for putting down my amendment is not quite the same as that of the other two Deputies. I know the amendment is somewhat clumsy.  I really wanted to raise a question which the Minister answered on the closing stages of the Second Reading.  Satisfactory as that reply in respect of how the fixed annual charge is arrived at may be to the expert, there are elements of confusion in it to the man in the street and the man on the country roads.  The Minister said on that occasion that to lower the rate of interest would not help the consumer but would save money to the Exchequer.  That may be, but I should like a more explicit statement from the Minister on the question of these fixed annual charges. According to the report of the Electricity Supply Board, the fixed annual charge must meet the annual cost of the network alone, because the charge for the generating stations, and so on, goes into the charge for current.  The Minister himself stated that.  He said the cost of supplying current arises under two headings&mdash;one a fixed charge, which represents the capital invested in providing the network.  I can quite see that, to get every consumer in the country linked up, a subsidy from the State is necessary, but I think that most people will confuse this subsidy and the rate of interest. If the rate of interest was lowered to 3 per cent. the figure of 12 per cent., on which the board's calculations were made, would be lowered to something less than 10 per cent., which would seem to bring that much nearer the figure at which the board calculated the trial areas would give a return somewhere in the region of 10 per cent. of the capital invested in those areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All that was calculated without any reference to the Minister's proposal in the Bill, that one-half of the moneys advanced for rural electrification will be a free gift.  I suggest that if the rate of interest is lowered, and a subsidy of half the capital outlay on the network is given, it should surely be possible to lower the fixed annual charges.  One of the things which <Col N="2361" /> affects the criterion ratio is the number of persons linked up in any district.  The fact that the board assumes that 20 per cent. of the rural population may not take electricity affects that figure, increasing it. Surely if the fixed annual charges could be lowered, the possibility of more people taking current would arise and it is possible that, financially, the thing would work out. I admit that there is an element of chance, but surely in a case like this we should leave nothing undone which would encourage the use of electricity. I am not clear as to the exact difficulties and I think the man in the street and the ordinary man throughout the country has the same difficulty in understanding why, if the rate of interest is lowered, he is not going to get electricity cheaper.  I think the Minister should explain it further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the Deputy that the Government had decided on a criterion ratio of 16, which means this &mdash;that every rural dwelling will be supplied with electricity provided that the capital cost of bringing the connection is not more than 16 times what the fixed charge will be.  That is the decision which has been made and it does not involve any assumption as to the rate of interest.  The actual cost of connecting the dwelling will depend, no doubt, upon the price of materials, wages and similar matters, but every dwelling will be connected if the capital cost of connecting it is not more than 16 times the fixed charge that is going to come.  We assumed that, on that basis, the board would not in fact recover sufficient money in fixed charges to meet its outgoings, taking into account not merely the interest charges the board will have to meet, but also the other administrative expenses that arise&mdash;the collection of the charges, the servicing of the line, and so forth.  In order to enable the board to get what it requires, namely, the full recovery of its costs, it was assumed that it would require to get one half the total capital free of interest in order to enable it to work on a 16 criterion ratio.  If, in fact, the rate of interest is lower than was taken into account in making that <Col N="2362" /> calculation, then the Board will not require one half the capital as a free gift.  If the other charges can be brought down, then similarly, the board will not require one half the capital as a free gift.</P>
      <P>We decided, upon the basis of the knowledge that is available to us now, to fix the first advance to the board on the basis of one-half the total capital, but that advance to the board will be substantially less than the total cost of the scheme.  We adopted that device to ensure that, before the scheme will be completed, the actual cost to the board of constructing the network and providing electricity in rural areas, the actual experience of the operation of the scheme, would enable a more accurate estimation to be made of the subsidy the board requires to work to a 16-criterion ratio.  It may, in fact, prove that the board will need as a free gift less than half the capital, in which case, they will get less than half the capital.  It is the taxpayer will be saved the contribution.  So far as the rural consumer is concerned, his charge will be based upon the assumption that it must be not less than one-sixteenth of the capital cost of tying him in.  We could not assume that the interest charge to the board will be 3 per cent.  It may be 3 per cent.; it may be less than 3 per cent.; in the past it was more than 3 per cent., but I think it would be foolish to tie ourselves to any one figure now in view of the tremendous uncertainty as to the cost of capital in the future, and the possible wide variations in the price of capital before the scheme is completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the amendment submitted by Deputy Hughes or that submitted by Deputy McGilligan ties the Minister to a fixed percentage on the money advanced to the board.  Deputy Hughes says: &ldquo;Well, you are going to advance money to the board.  If you do that, you ought to advance it at not more than a ¼ per cent. over the rate at which you borrow it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps not.  There is no difficulty in any case in getting the machine to work, if you want it to work.  I take it the Minister for Finance will know at what rate he borrows money, no matter how many times he borrows in the year.  He will know from time to time what is in the Exchequer, where it came from, and the various rates at which he borrowed the money.  It is quite possible for him, therefore, to say: &ldquo;This money came into the Exchequer.  It was raised at a certain rate.  Whatever is advanced to the board is at a ¼ per cent. over the amount paid for the money in the open market.&rdquo;  That is the objective sought by Deputy Hughes, and it seems to me to be making reasonable provision for such accountancy costs as might arise in the ordinary accountancy methods of crediting money to the board and keeping a record of such credits.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan goes further. He wants money advanced to the board at a rate not greater than that at which the money is borrowed. There again it is a very simple calculation. The Minister may say: &ldquo;I borrowed money during the year at 3 per cent.; I borrowed money at 3½ per cent.; I borrowed money at 4 per cent.  I am willing to make an average allocation from those three sources, and I am willing to give the money to the Electricity Supply Board at the average at which I borrowed during the year.&rdquo;  There is no difficulty in making that work.  The only thing is that the Minister may say: &ldquo;I am not going to let the Electricity Supply Board away at the same rate at which I borrowed, or at ¼ per cent. over the rate at which I borrowed.&rdquo; But, if he wants to, there is no reason why he cannot do it.  It is the very simple device of adding ¼ per cent. in respect of the borrowed money which he advances to the board, or of saying to the board: &ldquo;We got this money at such-and-such a rate, and we are giving it to you at such-and-such a rate,&rdquo; and, in any case, the cheaper you give the board money the less probably you will have to pay the board in respect of the 50 per cent. subsidisation of rural electrification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2364" /> I can, of course, see certain difficulty in inserting this provision in the Bill because of the fact that it is the Minister for Finance on whom the obligation to fix the rate of interest is placed. It may be difficult for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to assume, during a discussion on the Committee Stage of this Bill, a responsibility which properly devolves upon the Minister for Finance, but I think between now and the Report Stage of the Bill the Minister ought to consult his colleague with a view to getting some clarification of the State's attitude in respect of advancing money to the biggest undertaking we have in the country.  If it is not desired to put in the provisions recommended in these two amendments, it is possible to draft an amendment in such a way as will tie the Minister for Finance down to bearing in mind the fact that in advancing money to the board he ought not to charge a rate of interest substantially higher than the rate at which he borrowed the money for the purpose of that advance.</P>

We have the Central Fund into which go the proceeds of borrowing and taxation; into which also go repayments of past advances, and other non-tax revenues of various kinds.  It would not be possible to determine at any time the rate paid by the Minister for Finance upon the funds available to him from which advances can be made. He could endeavour to ensure that the rate he fixes is such as to recover the interest he himself has to pay, and the administrative charges on the average over a period of time.  He cannot just say to the board: &ldquo;This £500,000 you are getting now was borrowed by me at 3 per cent., and I will charge you 3¼ per cent.  This next £500,000 was borrowed by me at 3½ per cent., and I will charge you 3¾ per cent&rdquo;.  In fact, all the money he has under his control, whether it comes from borrowing, from taxation, or from non-tax revenue sources, goes into one fund, and from that one fund he makes his advances. That is the practical difficulty in determining what is the rate of interest at <Col N="2365" /> which the Minister for Finance has borrowed.  He knows the current market rate; he knows the rate of any recent loan; perhaps he can make a guess at what he will have to pay on the next loan; but at any rate he will fix his interest charge to the Electricity Supply Board upon some basis which on the average will not amount to more than the interest he has to pay.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Hughes's amendment would prevent the Minister for Finance from charging more than ¼ per cent. over the average.  I can quite see that the Minister does not get £1,000,000 for one purpose at one particular rate. It is all in one fund, as the Minister has pointed out, but he is able to get the average, and it is possible that he is able to assume what rate of interest he will pay for the next money he borrows.  Over and above that, surely ¼ per cent. ought to be sufficient.</P>

      <P>He must take into account the rate of interest which has been paid on past advances.  He borrowed £10,000,000 for the Shannon scheme, say, at 5 per cent.  He lent it to the board at 5 per cent.  I do not know whether the loans that were floated at that period have been repaid since, but the board is now repaying to him at 5 per cent.  Therefore, he is getting money into the Central Fund on a 5 per cent. basis.  That, you may say, enables him to lend money at a lower rate, if he can now borrow money at 3 per cent., but there are so many factors to be taken into account that no one can precisely say at any point at what rate he can lend without losing, or gaining a profit.  An opinion can be formed over a period of time, and, in fact, the practice up to the present has been to fix the rate of interest on advances to the board, and to maintain that rate for a number of years; then, if the general market conditions were improving, to fix a lower rate, a rate ½ per cent. or 1 per cent. lower, and to hold that rate for a number of years until the trend of the market can be more definitely interpreted.</P>

      <P>I should like to make a few remarks in connection with the practice of charging on the valuation basis.  Is the Minister satisfied that in respect of labourers' cottages the valuation basis is an equitable method of charging?  While a labourer's cottage, in certain circumstances, may be no bigger than a small farmhouse, there are in labourers' cottages at least two rooms and the floor space of a cottage is fairly large.  The charge is accordingly substantial and the rent and rates amount to 2/6, 3/- or 4/- a week.  I wonder would there be any more equitable method of charging in respect of a labourer's cottage?  Would it be possible to discriminate?</P>

      <P>It is possible.  In fact, I think the Deputy knows that the Dublin Corporation made an arrangement with the Electricity Supply Board under which electricity is provided to tenants in corporation flats on a basis which permits of the rent covering the cost of current.  That situation can be secured by an agreement between the local authority and the board.  What the board must get is a fixed revenue, independent of the amount of current consumed.  Whether it gets that by a floor-space charge on the individual <Col N="2368" /> dwelling, or by an arrangement with the local authority is of no great importance to the board.  An arrangement could be made.  It has been done in Dublin.</P>

      <P>The Chair intimated that I would be permitted to speak by way of explanation.  With all respect, I think a mistake has been made.  My amendment would not entail any charge on the Central Fund Section 40 provides that</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every sum advanced out of the Central Fund to the board under this Act (other than sums which are repayable to the Central Fund out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas) shall be repayable by the board...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 41 (3) sets out that half the total of the moneys advanced to the board shall be repaid to the Central Fund out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  It is not necessary to say anything about the other half, because that is provided for under Section 40.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two different sums, if the Deputy will look the matter up.  Section 40 relates to a sum of £7,500,000 which will be advanced to the board for the construction of generation works and distribution works.  Section 41 relates to another sum of £5,000,000 which will be advanced to the board for rural electrification. They are separate sums.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Every sum advanced out of the Central Fund to the board under this Act...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That refers to all sums advanced under the Act and not under any particular section, except the half of the £5,000,000 referred to in Section 41.  I take it the effect of sub-section (4) in that section would be that no repayment to the Central Fund could be <Col N="2369" /> made until the total amount was expended. I merely put down this amendment to draw attention to this matter and to see if some way out could be found.  Supposing it would take five years to deal with the £5,000,000, say there was £1,000,000 expended every year, would it not be preferable as each year's borrowing took place that half should be taken that year and not have to wait until all the money was expended?</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputies McGilligan and Hughes, I move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, at the end of Section 16, to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The accounts of the continuing company shall be submitted annually for audit to the Comptroller and Auditor-General and reported to the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that Deputy McGilligan fully appreciates that the accounts of these companies are, in fact, audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  The companies nominated the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and the nomination was approved by the Minister for Finance, and it is the Comptroller and Auditor-General who audits these accounts; but in the case of these companies the Comptroller and Auditor-General is doing that work as an ordinary commercial auditor would do it, and not as a representative of the Dáil; nor does he report to the Committee of Public Accounts in connection with such audits.  The audited accounts, however, are made available to the Dáil, and the Act requires that they shall be laid before the Dáil. Accordingly, while Deputy McGilligan probably has something more in mind <Col N="2372" /> than the existing legislation provides, the existing legislation does go a long way to meet that point.</P>
      <P>It is true that the decision to utilise the services of the Comptroller and Auditor-General was a decision of the companies, and one that could be changed.  In fact, the Comptroller and Auditor-General, himself, is doubtful of the wisdom of extending the scope of his office to cover the auditing of a large number of commercial undertakings in which the Government is interested, and in some respects he might not be a suitable auditor in the case of such companies where he would be only interested in the financial results of the company concerned, whereas an outside firm of auditors could give advice and suggestions as to the promotion of efficiency or the general working conditions of the concerns.  In the case of these companies, however, for the time being, and so long as they are working on the present basis, I think it is inevitable that the services of the Comptroller and Auditor-General should be retained.  Having been examined by him, the accounts are then submitted to the Dáil, in accordance with the provisions of the Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing is that I think that in a case like this, where public moneys are advanced by the Oireachtas, the accounts of these companies should be examined by the Committee of Public Accounts.  I think I also mentioned that the Comptroller and Auditor-General has two difficulties in dealing with this matter: first, that private companies would probably resent the Comptroller and Auditor-General going into their accounts, and dealing with other matters with which they were concerned and which they might regard as their own business; and, secondly, that while these accounts are to be laid on the Table of the House, the Comptroller and Auditor-General, at the same time, has not the same responsibility to the Dáil in connection with any objections or comments that he would like to make, such as he has to make in respect of any of the other Departments or services of State whose accounts he audits and which come before the Committee of Public <Col N="2373" /> Accounts.  I do not think it would be altering the Act very much, or interfering unduly with the affairs of the company, if the Minister would agree to amend this to the extent of allowing that the accounts of the continuing company shall be submitted annually for audit to the Comptroller and Auditor-General and reported to the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree with this proposal.  I think that the examining of the accounts of such a company as this and the examining of the accounts of a Department of State are entirely different matters.  The primary duty of the Comptroller and Auditor-General in relation to a Government Department is to see that the money voted for that Department by the Oireachtas is devoted to the precise object for which it was voted.  In the case of outside companies, capital advances have to be made for the general working of the company.  The company, for instance, may decide upon a particular method of working, or upon the acquirement of a certain type of apparatus, and so on, and they may seek capital advances for that purpose.  It may be found later on that their decision must be changed: that some other method of working must be adopted or that some other type of equipment, which would be more useful, must be acquired, and the company is fully entitled to do that, or even to abandon the original plan for which it had received approval.  That, of course, would not necessarily mean that the company had done anything wrong, but it would be entirely wrong for the accounting officer of a Department of State to approve of the use of money for one purpose, when the money had been voted for another purpose, even though it was well within the amount of the Estimate.  It is an entirely different matter in the case of a private company. A private company must have regard, practically from day to day, to its organisation, its staff, various kinds of changing conditions and so on, and if the company had to face such an investigation as has to be faced by Government Departments before the Committee <Col N="2374" /> of Public Accounts, then it must keep records similar to those kept by Government Departments and must be prepared to answer for them.</P>
      <P>Now, one of the reasons why private companies should not be expected to keep the same kind of records as Government Departments must keep, is that Government Departments have to keep elaborate records in regard to every matter, as Deputies may raise a question about any particular item, and that question must be answered in full, and every item must be fully documented.  No private company could function properly if it were to be subject to such conditions, and that is why we must have those commercial activities undertaken, in the main, by bodies that are not subject to the same conditions or obligations as Government Departments.  I know that it is quite common to call that type of record-keeping by Government Departments by the name of &ldquo;red tape,&rdquo; but in fact it is essential if the control of the Dáil over each Department and its expenditure is to be properly exercisable, but we do not want the same type of control in connection with companies set up for commercial purposes.  We merely want to be sure that they will not undertake activities that would be in conflict with the purpose for which they were set up, that their concerns will be carried out in a proper way and with proper economy, and that due regard will be had to the proper expenditure of the money put in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose is to ensure that there is a more complete link between these companies and the Government than would normally exist in the case of other companies.  In the present circumstances, I think there is good reason for retaining the control of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and I think it is unlikely that the Minister for Finance would approve of anybody else, even though the same, or even a better, audit might be given by a first-class commercial auditor.  In any case, I think it would be unwise, and unusual, to say the least, to have the type of queries addressed to the Committee of Public Accounts, in relation <Col N="2375" /> to these companies, that are addressed in connection with Government Departments.  I think it would be much better to abolish these companies altogether and do the work through the medium of a section of the Department than to follow out that procedure. I would always be strongly against commercial organisations being expected to work in that way, and I think it would never be satisfactory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, the Minister should make a distinction between the normal enterprises carried on by a company on moneys subscribed by the community and a company, which really is only fictitiously a private company, set up by the Government.  Is it not essential that there should be some accounting to this House for the moneys advanced?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>If in the meantime the moneys advanced go down the sink we have no control over the operation of these companies.  There is a feeling abroad that some of these companies, to say the least of it, are not too expert in connection with business enterprises which they undertake, and that these are of a speculative nature.

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>When progress was reported last evening I was dealing with an amendment moved by Deputy Cosgrave, the effect of which would be to limit expenditure on the provision of sanatoria to £1,500,000.  I think it would be a mistake on the part of the House to debate this amendment as fully as it might be debated, because it opens up very wide possibilities. If we are to justify encroachment on the Hospitals Trust Funds to the extent of £1,500,000, and discuss the position that may arise regarding the payment of deficits of voluntary hospitals as a result of such encroachment, and how these deficits were brought about, as well as the alternative steps ought to be taken to reduce them, we will enter on a very wide field.  I feel sure Deputy Cosgrave will agree that it is scarcely desirable on this issue to enter upon such a debate.  I believe I interpret the mind of the House correctly when I say regardless of what the possible effects may be, or how far we may find it necessary, in order to make <Col N="2377" /> effective the plan I outlined to the House that this job ought to be done and that I should not be restricted in doing it.  Common sense will show any Deputy who considers the matter that the restriction proposed would, in all probability, render it impossible for me in the difficult times in which we are living to give effect to my plans. Deputies will recollect that I was urged very strongly from all sides of the House not to stop at 4,000 beds; that the 2,100 beds it is proposed to provide in the shortest possible time would be entirely inadequate to meet the situation.  It is quite likely that 2,100 beds will be inadequate.  I assured the House more than once since this question came up for discussion that while I aimed at 2,100 beds as an immediate target, if experience showed that the additional 2,100 beds were not sufficient, I would proceed to secure whatever further number of beds might be necessary, when I was put in a position to deal with the problem in a rational way.</P>
      <P>I was urged to provide, not the three sanatoria I suggested, but six sanatoria. Regardless of the number of beds to be provided the amendment would restrict expenditure to £1,500,000.  Supposing we take it that it was necessary to provide 7,000 beds ultimately, or an additional 4,000 instead of 2,100 beds. The cost per bed within the limit of £1,500,000 reduces that proposition to an absurdity.  I suggest to the House, and to Deputy Cosgrave in particular, that we should try to get back to the atmosphere which prevailed as short a time ago as last week, when, as I have already said, every Deputy who spoke, with one or two exceptions which we need not seriously regard, urged me to proceed with this work with the greatest possible expedition and, in fact, to stop at nothing to make effective the plans I had outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt in the world that Deputy Cosgrave is as anxious to see these plans made operative as anybody else.  I do not suggest anything to the contrary, but I do suggest that we could very easily develop a line of discussion here at this stage which would be a source of grave disappointment and discouragement to thousands <Col N="2378" /> of people who expected something real from us in the development of the plans I have referred to.  I would prefer that we would not have much further discussion on this amendment.  I would prefer that Deputy Cosgrave would withdraw it but, while I say that, if it is to be debated from every aspect and examined from every angle, I am quite prepared to do it.  I think, however, that, taking the long view and particularly realising that thousands of people outside who cannot find institutional treatment are looking to us with hope and anxiety, Deputy Cosgrave should withdraw his amendment and give us this Bill as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>While Deputy Cosgrave's amendment is in very specific terms, I do not think he really intends in any way to tie the hands of the Parliamentary Secretary in the matter. I rather gathered, from the speech he made in moving his amendment, that the amendment was put down more for the purpose of discussion than for the purpose of obstructing any sensible plans in contemplation for dealing with tuberculosis.  The Parliamentary Secretary, when speaking on the Second Reading, told us that he estimated that the expenditure would be £1,500,000. Yesterday he told us that the amount would be, approximately, £2,200,000, on the basis of bringing the pre-war cost of beds, £1,500, up to date.  Then I gather that he made a notional subtraction from that amount and said: &ldquo;However, we do not intend to provide sanatoria of the same durability as that contemplated in the estimate and the total figure will not be much more than about £2,000,000.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That again is, of course, based on the Parliamentary Secretary's estimate that 2,100 would be sufficient to deal with the problem, these beds being in supplementation of the beds available to-day in the institutions throughout the country.  I gather that the sum available in the Hospitals Trust Fund is about £8,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right; approximately £8,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That sum is available, and it is not very likely that, until we <Col N="2379" /> return to normal conditions, it will be very much supplemented by the proceeds of sweeps on the staggeringly successful scale we knew in pre-war days.  It is likely that that will be the pool out of which hospitalisation will have to be financed for many a year to come.</P>
      <P>I feel sure that the Parliamentary Secretary realises that there are two problems, if not three, to be dealt with arising out of the availability of that money: (1) the provision of sufficient beds in sanatoria; (2) the provision of hospitals where they are needed and the reconstruction of existing unsatisfactory hospitals; and (3) provision for hospital deficits.  I gather that these deficits are increasing and have increased very substantially, and such cases as have come to my notice show that the tendency each year is upwards. If prices continue to remain high, or even to soar further, these deficits will amount to a very considerable sum ultimately.  I think it is pretty clear that the authorities of existing non-rate-aided institutions are quite incapable of raising anything like the sums necessary to make good the deficits and somebody has to come to their aid.  It is generally admitted that subscriptions to voluntary hospitals have fallen off considerably, because many people say: &ldquo;Are the sweep funds not at your disposal? What do you want subscriptions for?&rdquo; That attitude of mind is possibly understandable if sweep funds are at their disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ascertain from the Parliamentary Secretary whether he contemplates a continuance of the position in which the funds at the disposal of Hospitals Trust will continue to be available for making good these deficits, because if these deficits are not made good from the moneys available in the Hospitals Trust Fund, the hospitals could not carry on as at present.  They would have to reduce staff, to keep beds vacant, and generally would have to reduce such standard of comfort as is available to patients to-day.  Reductions in staff, reductions in the number of beds available or reductions in the standards <Col N="2380" /> of comfort which are at present available in hospitals are evils to be avoided at all cost, and I should like to get from the Parliamentary Secretary an assurance that, while he can go full steam ahead doing what is necessary and absolutely essential in respect of tuberculosis, provision will, at the same time, be made for meeting the deficits which have arisen and which are growing in respect of the voluntary hospitals and even in respect of some of the rate-aided hospitals as well.</P>
    <P>There is the problem then of the hospitals generally, of the reconstruction and the provision of new hospitals. Apparently the Parliamentary Secretary contemplates spending at the moment, or so long as his present plan holds the field, approximately £1,500,000 or £2,000,000.  It may, according to his statement this evening, exceed £2,000,000, and may reach £3,000,000.  If it does reach £3,000,000 or £4,000,000, there is still a sum of £4,000,000 left in the Hospitals Trust Fund.  That may then be made available for the erection of new hospitals or the reconstruction of existing hospitals, or for meeting the deficits of the hospitals; but I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us&mdash;he has told us already what his tuberculosis plans are&mdash;what the position is in respect of continuing to meet these deficits, and whether the moneys in the Hospitals Trust Fund are anticipated to be sufficient for that purpose, as well as for such early erection or reconstruction of hospitals as may be in contemplation in order to provide the immediate needs of a hospitalisation plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be taken as dissenting from the general desire of the House to deal with the tuberculosis problem.  Possibly a number of people reading an amendment such as mine, which limits the amount of money which may be spent out of Hospitals Trust Funds, would be under the impression that such was the case. It is true that the amendment sets out a specific amount but it is equally true that, last week, that was the Parliamentary Secretary's estimate of what would be required.  In discussing a <Col N="2381" /> matter like this, we must have some basis from which to start.  Some figure must be taken.  We have got into loose methods when talking of large sums of money.  As the Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out, he is not going to build very elaborate sanatoria or hospitals.  I understand that that is the opinion of experts&mdash;that it is unnecessary to build either elaborate sanatoria or sanatoria of a durable nature, that in America and certain other countries the problem of tuberculosis has been mastered in a comparatively short time and that, in many cases, structures little better than huts were sufficient to deal with it.  While this amendment might give the impression that it was sought to put a limit on the amount to be spent, we could spend the entire moneys of the Hospitals Trust in building one elaborate sanatorium and we would not have solved the problem of tuberculosis. Because we agreed to spend the full sum, many people would labour under the delusion that we were making a determined effort to solve the problem, whereas some people might say that, in putting down this amendment, I sought to limit the amount to be spent.  I do not wish to limit the amount.  As I said, I have put forward this amendment on a purely personal basis.  I have done so on the ground, in the first place, that the Parliamentary Secretary stated last week that £1,500,000 would be sufficient, while to-day, in reply to a Parliamentary question, he said that he thought £2,000,000 would be required.  It is a very big jump in a week from £1,500,000 to £2,000,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Let it cover as many institutions as the Parliamentary Secretary likes.  We ought to have some basis on which to go.  Last week, the Parliamentary Secretary referring to the amount of money in the fund, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The actual amount in the Hospitals Trust Fund is about £8,500,000. Deputies must not take this as a firm figure.  It is over £8,000,000 but not more than £8,500,000.  £250,000 in these large figures does not matter very much.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Here, we have a person with the responsibility of a Minister stating that a figure of £250,000 does not matter very much.  A sum of £250,000 would pay off a considerable number of the deficits in the case of the voluntary hospitals and would go some way towards solving the problem of providing beds in sanatoria&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not ask you to provide 7,000 beds.  I propose to make my own speech and the Parliamentary Secretary can make his.  I ask Deputies to note the complete disregard for large sums of money shown by the Parliamentary Secretary.  If £250,000 is to be thrown about as a sum of inconsiderable consequence, how are we to master the problem of hospitalisation, not alone in dealing with tuberculosis but in dealing with other disease problems? It is possible that, because we had this debate last week, we have over-accentuated the tuberculosis problem and that we may devote both time and money to treatment of tuberculosis while neglecting many other diseases and health disorders.  This is not one problem; it is a series of problems which the local authorities and the Oireachtas must consider.  If we disregard the other problems, confining ourselves entirely to one, we shall find that the other problems will be equally difficult to deal with and that money will have to be provided for the purpose either by borrowing or by direct <Col N="2384" /> taxation.  If we spend limitlessly, the Hospitals Trust Fund will soon be exhausted. The amount in the Hospitals Trust Fund is not unlimited and, as Deputy Norton wisely pointed out, we cannot hope, unless conditions return quickly to normal, to add very considerably to the amount.  We ought to get some reasonable estimate in connection with this matter.</P>
      <P>I know that costs have risen very steeply.  They are rising every day. They are rising for the voluntary hospitals as well as for the rate-aided hospitals.  If, after this money has been spent on the sanatoria which the Parliamentary Secretary proposes to erect, the scheme is not completed and he has to come back here and ask for the rest of the money, there will be no further moneys available from the Hospitals Trust Fund for the hospitals.</P>

      <P>A person listening to the debate last week and coming into the House to-day would wonder if he had not landed on a new planet.  Last week, from Deputy Cosgrave's Front Bench and from Deputy Norton's Front Bench, bouquets were thrown at the Parliamentary Secretary.  He was told to go full steam ahead.  Deputies on the other side blessed him and prayed for him and wished him well. He was told that whatever money he required would be forthcoming to fight this disease, and to get on with the job and make it a good one.  After eight days, Deputies of the Fine Gael Party and the Leader of the Labour Party have struck a different note.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been discovered by Deputy Cosgrave that the Hospitals Trust Fund has £250,000 more in it than the Parliamentary Secretary told him was in it last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that there was £250,000 more in the Fund. I said that the Parliamentary Secretary's actual words were &ldquo;£250,000 in these large figures does not matter very much&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary was asked a question as to the <Col N="2385" /> amount, in the course of the debate, and he gave an approximate figure. He said that a small amount up or down did not matter.  I happened to be here at the time.  Now, it is thought that only a limited portion of the Hospitals Trust Fund money should be used for the purpose of building these sanatoria.  That, surely, would strike Deputies from country areas as being altogether wrong.  If the money needed to build a 1,000-bed sanatorium in Dublin is not provided out of the Hospitals Trust Fund, then I take it the ratepayers of Dublin will raise the money.  That is the alternative put forward by Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Norton.</P>

      <P>The alternative suggested by Deputy Cosgrave and others is that the Parliamentary Secretary should advise the public assistance authorities in Dublin to go to the Local Loans Fund or take some other means of raising the £1,000,000 needed for the erection of this sanatorium, and that they should also make provision for the payment of interest and sinking fund on the loan so raised.  It is agreed on all sides of the House, as well as by the local authorities, that these sanatoria are absolutely needed.  The Parliamentary Secretary and the Government have been abused and bally-ragged by Deputy McGilligan and others outside for not providing these sanatoria earlier.  Last week, on the Second Reading of the Bill, the Parliamentary Secretary was asked to provide them at once, and yet when he proposes to do so he is told that he should only touch a limited amount of the money held in the Hospitals Trust <Col N="2386" /> Fund.  He is asked, what is going to happen to the poor voluntary hospitals in Dublin, and to the building of such hospitals in the future, if a substantial portion of this £8,000,000 is used up now under this Bill.  That is the cry eight days after the Parliamentary Secretary was told to go full steam ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another peculiar feature of this to which I would like to refer.  I am sure Deputy Cosgrave and all of us would like to see good new hospitals in Dublin.  In the country areas the ratepayers have to provide their own hospitals out of the rates. For many years, Dublin has enjoyed a great advantage by reason of the fact that it has free hospitals towards the maintenance of which the ratepayers of Dublin have never contributed one penny.  We have been told about the mounting deficits which are associated with the Dublin voluntary hospitals, but so far as we know the ratepayers of Dublin have never volunteered to pay as much as a shilling towards the liquidation of those deficits.</P>

    <P>The position over the rest of the country is that the ratepayers&mdash;the man who owns land as well as the man who lives in a cabin on the roadside&mdash; all contribute to the maintenance of their local hospitals.  But the ratepayers of Dublin, rich or poor, have never contributed one &ldquo;bob&rdquo; as ratepayers to the maintenance of the Dublin hospitals.  Their patients are entitled, under the Medical Charities Acts, to free medical attention, and surely it is their duty, as it is of the ratepayers down the country, to make provision for the maintenance of their patients in their own institutions.  If a local authority in Kerry, Galway, Wexford, Waterford or any other county sends up a patient to a voluntary hospital in Dublin, the board of health authority in that county is charged the full cost of that patient's maintenance, and no patient can be sent up by a board of health authority unless it is prepared to do that.  I <Col N="2387" /> would not have raised this question at all but for the attitude taken by Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Norton. The suggestion behind their speeches was that if any portion of the Hospitals Trust Fund money is used up for the building of sanatoria to serve Dublin, or any other part of the country, the voluntary hospitals in Dublin, with their increasing deficits, will not be able to maintain themselves.  The way out of that difficulty, I suggest, is for the ratepayers of Dublin to shoulder their responsibilities in the future just as the ratepayers in other parts of Ireland are doing and have been doing for years.</P>

      <P>Deputy Allen made one statement which I would like to correct.  He said one thing which, of course, was correct, that the local authorities pay the voluntary hospitals in Dublin for the maintenance of the patients they send up.  It was incorrect for him to say that they pay the full cost of a patient's maintenance. People in touch with the Dublin voluntary hospitals are aware that the Deputy's statement on that was incorrect. Actually, what happens is that the local authorities pay a proportion of the cost of the patient's maintenance. I think that at present they pay about two guineas a week for a patient's maintenance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a little more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is £2 12s. 6d., but the minimum cost per bed in most Dublin hospitals is between £3 10s. 0d. and £4 per week, and even that is a conservative estimate. In some hospitals the cost is higher.  I am not going to argue that the local authorities should pay more. I think it is self-evident that they should.  I want, however, to correct the idea that local authorities through the country are paying the full cost of the maintenance of the patients they send up to the Dublin voluntary hospitals. In the past, the difference between the amount they paid and the actual cost of the patient's maintenance was made up by voluntary subscriptions and the contributions received <Col N="2388" /> out of the moneys raised by the sweepstakes.  Deputy Allen also tried to make out that there was a lack of sympathy on the part of Deputy Cosgrave and other Deputies for the tuberculosis problem.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>He represented that as a change of heart as between what was said here last week and this week.  That, however, is absolute nonsense. Deputy Cosgrave's amendment boils down to this, that while taking care to look after tuberculosis one should not forget the many other ills that human beings suffer from. No one, I suggest, is lacking in sympathy for tuberculous patients, because tuberculosis is one of the most terrible diseases that we have at present.  People die from many diseases, and if a man dies from one disease rather than another, our sympathy should not necessarily be any greater by reason of that. Unfortunately, there are many diseases which kill human beings.  We have to be careful not to take all the money for the treatment of tuberculosis, although a great deal of our sympathy goes out to those who suffer and die from that dread disease.</P>

      <P>It was said somewhere at one time that death has 10,000 doors by which it enters.  Perhaps something should be said to try to get this debate into proper perspective.  I think it has gone slightly off the track. I understood Deputy Cosgrave's object in putting down this amendment to be this: that he wanted to bring to the notice of the House the possibility that we are over-accentuating the problem of tuberculosis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I put it myself on the Second <Col N="2389" /> Stage, there is a danger that, because of certain propaganda that is rife at the moment, we may over-accentuate this problem.  Only as recently as to-day, vital statistics were published showing that in 1943 the deaths from cancer were 9.3 per cent. of the total deaths, whereas the deaths from tuberculosis were 9.9 per cent.  I mention these facts merely that we may get down to realities.  The intention in suggesting a limit was, I take it, to ensure that in allocating moneys to the erection of sanatoria, we will not forget the other very essential problems for which the Hospitals Trust Fund was established.  There are many other problems requiring urgent attention and the one I mention, cancer, is equally as acute as tuberculosis.  It is to ensure that all our moneys in the fund will not be devoted to one particular problem that we raise this matter.</P>
    <P>I deprecate, therefore, any misrepresentation that we are departing from the attitude which we took up here on the Second Stage.  We are not.  We are still moved by the same spirit of co-operation and we intend to give the Parliamentary Secretary every assistance in implementing this Bill.  We do think it essential, however, to put the tuberculosis problem in its proper perspective in relation to other problems. There is something like £6,000,000 tied up to provide revenue to cover the deficits on the voluntary hospitals.  That is a serious financial problem which the Parliamentary Secretary and this House has to face.  It is undoubtedly a fact that these deficits are showing a tendency to increase.  That may be due partly to the war situation, to rising prices and so on, but it also may be due to the fact that these people have got it into their heads that they may call on the milch cow as often as they like.  If that tendency continues, the House will have to decide whether these hospitals should continue on a voluntary basis or be compelled to look to the rates for some support.</P>
    <P>I would not like to see the voluntary system in Dublin interfered with.  It has served during the centuries a very vital need, not only to the population of Dublin but to the entire country.  It <Col N="2390" /> is a system which has given us our specialists and schools of medicine, second to none in the world.  There is a danger that, if these hospitals were ever put on the rates and under local authorities, public control would not succeed in giving us the same progress in these directions.  For that reason I would deprecate it, but I do not want to go into that now.  I am merely trying to reject the misrepresentation.</P>
    <P>There is another problem, which affects certain constituencies, including my own and Deputy Allen's.  Our patients are, I understand, to go into Peamount, Crooksling and other institutions. I want to be assured that, in allocating moneys under this Bill, the patients from those areas will at least get the same treatment and have the same facilities in housing accommodation and mechanical apparatus as will be provided in the new sanatoria to be erected under the Bill.</P>

      <P>That is just as absurd as some other statements the Deputy made.  Here is a Bill, the Tuberculosis (Establishment of Sanatoria) Bill. With the exception of two amendments submitted by Deputy Cosgrave, no amendment has been submitted.  Does that not clearly indicate that, so far as the House is concerned, it is in sympathy with the provisions of the Bill? Deputy Cosgrave, as he explained himself, submitted two amendments, one of which is to Section 5. My contention in the matter is, as I have said already, that I want the Parliamentary Secretary to get on with the job of providing the necessary sanatoria for the treatment of tuberculosis, and that I want to see every penny necessary raised for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Of course, I will oppose this amendment and will vote against it if there is a division.  There is no doubt in the world about that. But I want the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us, when he is dealing with the allocation of moneys from the Hospitals Trust Fund, not merely what it is going to cost, roughly speaking, to provide sanatoria now, but what will be available then to deal with hospital deficits, so far as the fund is concerned, and what will be available for the provision of new hospitals or the reconstruction of existing hospitals.  I merely want him to reveal his mind on the disposal of these moneys.  Is the whole £8,000,000 to go to sanatoria?  If it is to go to sanatoria, well and good; it will clear up a serious problem and, if we have to spend money on it, we must put up with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2392" /> On the other hand, if the sanatoria are going to use only £3,000,000 or £4,000,000, will the Parliamentary Secretary tell us what will happen the remainder in the fund?  Is that to be utilised to meet deficits, to build new hospitals or to reconstruct existing hospitals?  I seek information from the Parliamentary Secretary on that matter, as he is to control the administration of the whole fund in future.  I would like him to tell us, while we are discussing this matter, in what way his mind is travelling, so that we may have some picture of what is to be done with such funds at present at his disposal for the provision of sanatoria and hospitals throughout the country.  That is my objective&mdash;and my sole objective&mdash; in discussing this section.</P>

      <P>Let us get the broad general figures, and if I am £10, £20, £30 or £100 out in these figures, do not hold me up to ransom.  It is not that I have a disregard for the value of money or that I do not think as much of £100,000 as a man who might have that sum in his own money.  I think the Deputy understood me well.  I was giving a provisional estimate, speaking from memory.  I said that £250,000 does not matter here or there as to the actual amount that is in the Hospitals Trust Fund.  The approximate amount raised for hospital purposes out of sweepstake funds was £16,507,000 odd.  We had some discussion yesterday on this matter but the debate has not taken exactly the same lines to-day.  There was considerable reference made last evening to the equity of the distribution of one-third to local authority institutions and two-thirds to the voluntary hospitals.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned last evening, under the 1931 Act such distribution was provided for.  Under the 1933 Act, that method of allocation was completely abandoned by deliberate action of the Oireachtas and the Hospitals Trust Fund became one fund.  The Minister for Local Government was given unrestricted discretion in the allocation of moneys out of that fund.  While I say that, the actual fact of the matter is that, of the total funds made available from sweepstake sources, the local authorities have not got one-third. One-third of the £16,500,000 odd would amount to £5,502,000 odd.  The local authorities to date have got £3,115,686, so if we had adhered to the basis of one-third and two-thirds as between the local authority institutions and the voluntary hospitals, there would still be due to the local authority institutions £2,386,000 odd, before they would have got one-third of the entire proceeds. I do not wish to make any point at all of that because I do wish the House to understand that there were not any restrictions, that I am not accepting any restrictions and that, when acting in a ministerial capacity, I shall continue to exercise my own judgment as to the purpose to which these funds should be applied subject, of course, to the Dáil here, by which I can at any time be held accountable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2394" /> I might mention that in the matter of the provision for the treatment of tuberculosis, expenditure is not confined to local authority institutions. Expenditure under this Bill will be confined.  We are providing sanatoria and we shall be under a statutory obligation, having built and equipped these sanatoria, to hand them over to the local authorities.  There are other voluntary institutions providing for the treatment and institutional care of tuberculosis patients, which, as voluntary institutions, would presumably be entitled to the same financial consideration that voluntary institutions are given to provide for other types of illness.  There is a provision in the Bill that in so far as we provide institutions for the treatment of tuberculosis and hand them over to local authorities, the local authorities may be called upon to refund to the Hospitals Trust Fund one-third of the cost.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton asked about deficits. I presume the House would like to know how these deficits have been mounting, if we have to discuss them. In 1933, the deficits amounted to £50,273.  In 1939&mdash;I am taking the prewar figures in order that we can get a clear conception of the trend of the finances of the voluntary institutions&mdash; the figure had increased to £156,625. The capital sum, calculated at 3 per cent., required to pay the deficits in 1933 was £1,675,766.  In 1939, again calculated at 3 per cent., the figure would be £5,220,833.  Largely due to emergency conditions, the deficits continued to rise to a peak figure in 1942 of £210,259.  Again calculating at 3 per cent., a capital sum of over £7,000,000 would be required to bring in that amount.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton expressed anxiety that, if we did not continue to provide for the payment of these rising deficits, there might be reductions in staffs, in beds, and in standards of treatment. I do not see any reason why any of these things should happen.  I have had quite a long discussion with representatives of the associated hospitals. I am quite sure that Deputies on the opposite side are aware of that because I assume they were in contact with the representatives of the voluntary hospitals <Col N="2395" /> before this debate was precipitated on the House.  I made the position perfectly clear for these representatives in order that there might be no misunderstanding whatever.  This was some months ago.  I sent a minute of the discussion that took place&mdash;a discussion lasting a couple of hours&mdash; to the voluntary hospitals so that they could have the record for future reference.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy requires that, I can get it for him.  The solution of the problem of the voluntary hospitals does not present any mystery to me.  I fully agree with the viewpoint expressed by Deputy Allen.  The local authorities throughout the provinces have to make full institutional provision for the hospital treatment of the poor and, if they send a patient up to Dublin for specialised treatment or to any other specialised area where there are voluntary hospitals, they pay.  Deputy Dockrell says that they do not pay the full cost; perhaps they do not. They pay £2 12s. 6d. per week minimum, and they pay for various other specialised services, radiological services and others, in addition to the £2 12s. 6d.  But the vast majority of the poor patients from the City of Dublin who are treated in the voluntary hospitals are not paid for by anybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the position of the voluntary hospitals in the City of Dublin, we all wish to see them continued; we all desire that they should prosper.  They are an essential part of any hospital scheme that any reasonable man would envisage in the future. But the time has come when they must take up with the local authorities this question of financial responsibility for the maintenance and treatment of patients.  The proposition is put to me that £2 12s. 6d. is not sufficient for the maintenance and treatment of patients from Monaghan, Cavan, Donegal, Leix, Offaly, or anywhere else.  I admit at once that it may not be; but my answer is that you should charge £2 12s. 6d. for all the patients that you are maintaining before you ask me to make it impossible for people in the provinces to send persons up here for specialised treatment.  It was never intended that the Hospitals Trust Fund should be utilised for the sole benefit of the people of Dublin.  I do not think anybody ever intended that it should. My aim is, and it is very understandable, I think, to distribute throughout the whole of the State, to all the poor in the State, the same benefits from the Hospitals Trust Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the ideal position would be this.  If we can maintain a certain sum&mdash;the larger the better&mdash;for the purpose of bringing in an income for paying the deficits, if we can maintain that position, it is all to the good. But to such an extent as we do maintain that position, we ought to aim at an even and equitable distribution of the benefits throughout the whole of the State.  If we reach the stage where institutional accommodation becomes an urgent problem for the purpose of treating tuberculosis, or any other disease, then we must provide the institutional accommodation, and we must say to the ratepaying community: &ldquo;You will have to maintain your patients in these institutions.&rdquo; That is the position.  It seems <Col N="2397" /> to me to be simple and logical enough and to be quite sound.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary say whether the hospital authorities were advised to take the matter up with the local authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I advised them and I undertook to give them my full moral support in any negotiations that they may open up with the local authorities.  It may be all to the good that we have had this discussion, because I think we have a better understanding as a result of it.  Deputy Dockrell suggests that one fatal disease is much the same as another. There seems to be a danger anticipated by certain Deputies that we might go too far, go too rapidly, in our attack on tuberculosis.  That is a new viewpoint.  I think it will be time enough to raise it later on.  But I would ask Deputies, lay-Deputies particularly, who have no scientific knowledge of these matters, to realise that there is a difference between tuberculosis and other diseases.  There is the difference that tuberculosis is an infectious disease.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coogan mentions that we have a high death rate, 3,000 per year or something like that, from cancer. He is wondering if it is wise to concentrate so much on tuberculosis, and he has at the back of his mind that we should concentrate a little bit more on diseases such as cancer.  I suppose that, so far as possible, we ought to concentrate upon all of them.  But the point I want to make is that, for the same expenditure of money, we can reasonably hope to make much more headway in an attack upon tuberculosis, being an infectious disease, than we can hope to make upon cancer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other point I would emphasise in relation to that is, that the disease of tuberculosis is a danger to more than the unfortunate person who has it; it is a danger to his family; it is a danger to the community.  Many other diseases do not constitute that same public danger, so that there is little more in it than the actual loss of life to the individual who has contracted a fatal illness and, in that way, <Col N="2398" /> it is from every point of view the soundest of sound policy to put the attack on tuberculosis and the provision of institutions for the treatment of it right at the head of the priority list.</P>

      <P>As I have been guilty of starting the discussion, I should like to bring it to a conclusion.  I willingly accept the guilt of having started it, but I think the Parliamentary Secretary has said that it was timely in many respects.  I accept his figures, as it is possible that, having given the figures in full, we may have more money left than we otherwise anticipated. While tuberculosis should be first on the priority list, it is true that there will be other difficulties to be dealt with, not subsequently, but alongside the tuberculosis problem. While the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that it was never intended that Dublin alone should benefit from the Hospitals Trust Fund, I think that could be qualified by saying that only six promoting hospitals were responsible for initiating the scheme originally introduced here.  Then subsequently, by various amendments, other hospitals were added.  Finally, by an amending Act, the two-thirds and one-third proportion was introduced under which funds were to be given to the voluntary hospitals and to the local authorities.  But, it is strange that after so many years functioning, it is only now that the voluntary hospitals should be notified.  They were, of course, informed some time ago that they might look elsewhere for funds but in the Seanad, in 1933, the late Senator Dowdall showed some anxiety &mdash;Vol. 16, column 1953&mdash;and, in reply, the Parliamentary Secretary, Dr. Ward, at column 1959, said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The difficulty about the one-third and two-third proportions is this, that we have, through our technical advisers in the Local Government Department, many schemes ready for <Col N="2399" /> operation, that have had the necessary detailed examination, but we cannot operate them, and the local authorities cannot proceed, until we are able to say how much money we will be able to give them.  We could release these schemes to-morrow if we could lay our hands on a little more money.  I admit that, for the present, we will encroach beyond the one-third previously allocated to the Minister.  The problem of the local authorities is one that will be solved in the near future.  When it is solved, not only the two-thirds, but the entire fund will be available.  We have no anxiety whatever that voluntary hospitals will suffer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There has been a big change since that.</P>

      <P>There has been a war since then.  The war has added&mdash; I will admit&mdash;a substantial amount to the difficulty but, on the Parliamentary Secretary's own figures, in 1939, the local authorities at that time had not even been paid&mdash;I will not say they had not required&mdash;but they had not been paid the full amount of the one-third. It is equally true that the voluntary hospitals had not been paid the full amount of the two-thirds.  If, on the figures given, the local authorities are to be paid the balance of what is due, which would make up the total of one-third, a sum of £2,386,000 is still due to them.  After that there would still be sufficient to pay the deficits of the voluntary hospitals.</P>

      <P>I am glad that my inquisitiveness in this matter induced me to raise the question of what the amount of the present deficits is and what is the future hospitalisation programme, and I have endeavoured to get two matters looked at in relation to our programme for dealing with tuberculosis.  From the figures given by the Parliamentary Secretary, it is clear that the deficits for 1942 amount to £210,000 per year, locking up for <Col N="2402" /> investment purposes a sum of no less than £7,000,000 at 3 per cent.  If you are going to avoid deficits in the hospitals throughout the country, apparently, you have to invest £7,000,000, in order to provide dividends to the amount of £210,000, to balance the deficits on the existing hospitals.  I wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary has figures for any year later than 1942?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it can be further substantially reduced by economies in the running of institutions.  It can only be brought down now by increased payments in respect of patients maintained there.  The last figure is for 1943, £189,322&mdash;£6,613,000, at 3 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the picture we have from the Parliamentary Secretary of the position, in which £6½ million, approximately, are locked up to meet the deficits in existing hospitals.  The Parliamentary Secretary contemplates that that position will continue, that the deficits cannot be reduced by further economies, that they can only be reduced by an increase in the contributions at present paid by patients. That is a situation which is a very serious one from the point of view of a hospitalisation programme. Obviously, there is no purpose in allowing a situation of that kind to drift.  If these hospitals were able to balance their budget, that sum of £6½ million would be available for further hospitalisation treatment; it would be available to perfect our tuberculosis treatment, and to provide hospital treatment of certain specialised diseases and would enable us to extend hospitalisation generally throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2403" /> I wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary, who has given us a good deal of what I think is helpful information on this subject, would tell us what is his future programme in respect of these deficits.  Is it contemplated making the local authority, by legislation or executive action, meet the deficits in this case, or is it contemplated making the local authority pay portion of the deficits while keeping some of those invested funds to pay the remainder? Obviously, some decision is called for in connection with those deficits which lock up such a large amount of money.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary would be making a useful contribution to informed opinion on hospitalisation in this country if he would tell us what the Government's policy is in respect of those deficits.</P>

The section says that the Minister may direct the Hospitals Trust Board to make payments out of the Hospitals Trust Fund for the purpose of defraying the expenses of the establishment under the Act of a sanatorium, and the Hospitals Trust Board shall comply with such directions. That quite obviously relates back to Section 4, under which the Minister, where he is of opinion that a new sanatorium for the inhabitants in a particular area is required, may declare his intention to establish such sanatorium.  It is not at all clear from that that the Minister would be permitted to expend any money on the existing sanatoria which will serve those areas outside the three central sanatoria.

      <P>All disbursements under this Act shall be audited by an auditor appointed by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary realises that this is a rather unusual Bill.  It may be an unusual Bill to deal with a grave problem, but nevertheless, under any Act, either the Comptroller and Auditor-General examines the expenditure or, in certain cases, the Minister for Finance or the Minister directly responsible for the Act is responsible for appointing an auditor. This Bill, as far as I can see, permits the Minister to spend the entire money of the Hospitals Trust Fund without accounting to anyone for a penny of it. No one expects such a drastic expenditure but, while this money is not supplied by the Oireachtas or from the <Col N="2406" /> Central Fund, it is collected under the Act which authorised the running of sweepstakes, and some responsibility should be put on the Minister for Finance to see that the accounts are audited, and that the money is properly accounted for.  As far as I can see, under the Bill as it stands, a very loose system of accounting or no system at all might operate, and I think it is undesirable that legislation of that kind should go through.</P>

If at any time any member of the House has any doubt as to the manner in which this money is being expended, or the manner in which this Act or any other Act is being administered, we can be called to account here in the House.  I think that is the more appropriate way of doing it.  In any event, if any harm were being done, it would be done before the audit would be available.  I think the Deputy should not press the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose on any occasion on which money is being spent under the authority of the House, if it is being spent improperly, the harm is done before it is brought to the notice of the Comptroller and Auditor-General or, at any rate, to the <Col N="2407" /> notice of the House; but the advantage of having a Comptroller and Auditor-General is that subsequent defalcations or improper expenditure will not occur.  In this case there is no control whatever.  The Parliamentary Secretary says that any Deputy can bring the matter up in the House. But he has to bring it up by way of motion.  In this Bill there is not even the usual statutory Order that an account of payments made or expenditure incurred will be placed on the Table of the House.  I would be prepared to meet the Parliamentary Secretary if he brings in an amendment on the Report Stage to that effect.  Even in the case of a small company, such as the one we were discussing earlier this evening, the Minerals Company&mdash;there is, of course, the difference that that money is voted from the Central Fund&mdash;an auditor is appointed by the Minister for Finance. He is not subject to the Committee of Public Accounts, but at least the public have the satisfaction of knowing that Acts which are passed by the Oireachtas make it obligatory on people to keep proper accounts.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £300 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1945, for the Salaries and Expenses of the State Laboratory.</P>
      <P>The sum sought is required to meet the cost of additional temporary staff and extra expenditure in respect of cost-of-living bonus and emergency bonus.</P>
      <P>During the year it was necessary to recruit&mdash;and pay from the Vote for the State laboratory&mdash;a temporary chemist at £5, inclusive, and emergency bonus, a week to replace a customs and excise officer who had been on loan to the laboratory, his salary being borne on the Vote for Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  It was also necessary to employ for three months two further temporary chemists at the above rate, and a temporary laboratory attendant at 27/-, plus bonus, a week on the analysis of samples of kelp.  There was no provision in the original Estimate for the State laboratory for any of these four officers.  As indicated in Part III of the Supplementary Estimate, the additional cost will be approximately £320.</P>
      <P>The decision of the Government to increase as from the 1st January, 1945, the Civil Service cost-of-living bonus and emergency bonus involves further extra expenditure of about £180.  The gross additional expenditure is thus £500, of which £200 is offset by savings on the Vote, leaving £300 as the net extra amount required.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £8,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1945, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Attorney-General, etc., and for the Expenses of Criminal Prosecutions and other Law Charges, including a Grant in Relief of certain Expenses payable by Statute out of Local Rates.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the original provision for the year&mdash;£11,000&mdash;will be substantially exceeded and that £16,500 will be required to meet charges in respect of fees to counsel.  Expenditure incurred during the first nine months of the present financial year&mdash; i.e., to the 31st December, 1944&mdash;was £12,200.  The expenditure is largely outside administrative control, depending as it does on the number and magnitude of cases in which counsel have to be retained.  When the original Estimate was being framed it was not anticipated that the number of criminal cases of a major kind would continue at the high level which obtained in 1943-44.  Actually, however, the number of murder trials has increased and there has not been any appreciable abatement in the number of other types of criminal cases, particularly those arising out of the prevailing emergency conditions, coming before the courts.  It was, in fact, found necessary to have an additional judge of the circuit court sitting in Dublin for portion of the year to deal with the unprecedentedly heavy list of criminal cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2415" /> It is estimated that a further sum of £2,500, in addition to the £6,500 originally provided, will be required to meet these expenses.  This excess is due mainly to the following factors: (1) The increase in the number of lengthy murder trials; (2) the considerable number of prosecutions brought under Emergency Powers Orders&mdash; those taken at the instance of the Minister for Supplies numbered 2,350 in 1944; and (3) a heavy increase in the amount of costs awarded against the State.</P>
    <P>Those, Sir, are the particulars in regard to this sum of £8,000 for which we are asking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It would strike one, Sir, that the fact that we are being asked for this very large sum by way of a Supplementary Estimate shows something very faulty in the manner of estimation of expenses.  It may be that the explanation for the large sum asked for is partly due, as would appear from the Minister's statement, to the fact that we had an unusually large number of lengthy trials for major crimes, mainly murder cases, but I think that the general public is somewhat disturbed at the number of cases in which verdicts of the courts have been subsequently upset.  It is rather disturbing to think that a man is tried for his life, found guilty, and that then the verdict is quashed.  I think there should be some tightening up of the whole court procedure rather than have, at this stage in our history, major flaws in the procedure, when a man's life is at stake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, granting that portion of the sum can be explained on the grounds that a number of these major cases could not have been anticipated except that we knew what was in a murderer's mind, the other explanation given by the Minister was the number of cases in contravention of the Emergency Orders.  I understand that there is a very great number of such cases, but those have been outstanding for years. The Minister for Supplies has told us here, time and again, when we asked him about delays in having certain cases brought to trial, that there was a regular procession of those cases and <Col N="2416" /> that the courts were dealing with them as quickly as they could.  Now, if that is the case, there should have been no under-estimation, since the cases were already lined up when the estimate was being prepared.  I suggest that it is not satisfactory to have a full-dress debate annually in this House on the Estimates, following on the Budget, as to the cost of the machinery of State for the coming year.  I have said that on previous occasions, and I think we should be put in a position of entering into such a debate with the knowledge that the full figure was there and that there would not be a single head of expenditure in connection with which a Minister would have to come back, within the financial year, to ask for a Supplementary Vote.  I should like to see a tightening up on both sides in regard to this matter, but I have no objection to giving the Minister what he wants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>It used to be the case that in connection with almost every Estimate in the Book of Estimates there was over-estimation.  Indeed, over a number of years, it was the practice of the Minister for Finance to take account in his Budget for a not inconsiderable sum of over-estimation, in previous years.  I think that, in connection with certain Estimates, that practice goes on to a certain extent even still.  I do not like it, and since I became Minister for Finance I have been trying to tighten up, to put on the screw, and cut to the bone everywhere, because if there is, say, £1,000,000 of over-estimation in the Book of Estimates and, therefore, in the Budget for the year, it means that you have to provide in taxation for that sum.  I do not say that I should prefer to see under-estimation rather than over-estimation.  I do not think that, from the point of view of satisfactory accountancy, either one or the other is very good.  We have to get as near as we can to the actual sum required.  Luckily, that is done in some cases, but probably&mdash;I cannot say for certain at the moment&mdash;when the Vote for Law Charges came up to the Department of Finance last year, the sum asked for, being in excess of the previous year, an effort was made to cut <Col N="2417" /> them down and to say: &ldquo;Oh, well, the war will be over and there will not be so many of these charges in connection with the Department of Supplies, and we might as well take a chance&rdquo;.  Possibly, that is what happened&mdash;I do not say that it did happen&mdash;and that we cut down too much, and afterwards found that the number of prosecutions in connection with the Department of Supplies had increased instead of decreasing.</P>
      <P>In addition, the matter, to which Deputy O'Higgins referred, also arose, where you had cases of a major kind&mdash; of the most important kind, such as murder&mdash;in the Criminal Courts, and where verdicts of guilty had been found and afterwards there were appeals to the Court of Criminal Appeal which resulted in the setting aside of those verdicts.  I agree with the Deputy that that is entirely unsatisfactory and has given rise to a great deal of criticism.  Where responsibility lies I cannot say.  May be, even if I were a lawyer, I could not say.  It is not a very satisfactory position from any point of view.  It is not very satisfactory from the point of view of the Minister for Finance and, least of all, for a person in the dock.  There are the facts.  I do not know if any tightening up that might be done in this House could change the position.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it would be wiser if I kept my protest against what would appear to be slack estimating for this particular Supplementary Estimate. Here we have an error in the Estimate of an old established Department under the heading of &ldquo;Travelling and Incidental Expenses&rdquo;, amounting to nearly 25 per cent.  One could understand, with new State Department, with new activities, or with an inexperienced Department, an error of 5 per cent. or 10 per cent., but an error amounting practically to one quarter of the total expenditure definitely shows a degree of casual attention to figures presented to this House and incorporated in the Book of Estimates.  Any private person, or any local official if it comes to that, has got to be able to make a firm estimate of expenditure at the beginning of the year, get the money to meet it, and, if it is exceeded, go without it and be out of pocket.  I do not know that a Government Department would tolerate from a local body down the country the kind of slackness we are asked to tolerate.  If various bodies operating under the Minister were to <Col N="2419" /> present their figures on a margin of error amounting to 25 per cent. in a comparatively small figure for fixed routine duties, some people would probably lose their appointments.  It may be because this House is and has been over-tolerant and over-generous in a casual kind of manner on matters such as this, where there should not be mistakes, that on this Supplementary Estimate we can get a reasonable explanation, and that unforeseen circumstances have forced the Minister to give not comparatively small sums, but a big sum.  Here, for &ldquo;Incidental and Travelling Expenses&rdquo;, we are asked for approximately 22 per cent. or 23 per cent. more than the Departmental figures that were placed before us. Having protested in that manner, I hope there will be a more accurate and a more energetic estimation within the Minister's Department in the future.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy realises that, so far as outdoor officers of Government Departments, such as school inspectors and Land Commission inspectors, are concerned, their activities were seriously curtailed owing to the emergency restrictions on transport.  During the present year the position has been that there has been some improvement in such facilities and an increase in the cost of hirage of cars.  School inspectors have a very large amount of travelling to do, and I think it is quite possible that they had arrears of work to attend to, and when it is considered that the ordinary national school inspector has about 120 schools to look after.  As he is expected to make a visit of shorter or longer duration to practically every school in his district he has not very much time to spare.  In any event, apart from the fact that there were greater facilities available last year than the present year, and that the inspectors were able to travel more, and to engage hackney cars to a greater extent than previously, it also happened that we had a somewhat larger number of officers on outdoor work than at the beginning of the year, owing to the filling of vacancies, some of which were of long standing.  We <Col N="2420" /> have also for the first time since the war carried out periodic changes in the inspectors and have transferred a fairly substantial number from centres in which they were engaged for the past five years or longer.  We decided to make the change because circumstances had sufficiently ameliorated to enable us to carry out transfers which, I considered, were overdue, and which would have been carried out perhaps some years ago were it not for the emergency.  These were the circumstances that gave rise to the increase. This is a branch of the public service in which there is a great deal of travelling. It is possible that if the Government had not decided substantially to increase the remuneration of civil servants by altering the cost-of-living figure upon which the bonus and the cost of living is based, thereby throwing heavy additional burdens on sub-heads in the Vote dealing with salaries and expenses, it might have been possible to account for the additional expenditure on travelling by savings under the sub-heads for salaries, but owing to the increase in the cost-of-living bonus during the period, the provision made for salaries has been totally absorbed.  There was no room for the transfer of savings to the sub-heads for travelling and therefore I was compelled to bring in this Supplementary Estimate.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister should be able to estimate sufficiently correctly not to bank on a big saving out of such a sub-head.  To balance the sub-head for travelling by a transfer from the salary sub-head would scarcely justify a piece of slack estimation.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1945, for salaries and expenses in connection with forestry (9 and 10 Geo. 5, c, 58, and No. 34 of 1928), including certain Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2421" /> The additional sum which the Dáil is asked to provide is in respect of sub-head C (2), which deals with the planting of forest lands, the upkeep of plantations and the repair of roads.  The excess of £26,000 on the original gross Estimate is due to the fact that considerably more work was carried out on the production of fuel than was anticipated.  A number of roads have had to be repaired owing to damage caused by the extraction of heavy timber and cartage costs have increased considerably since last year. A token Vote only will be required, as savings and increased receipts will account for a sum which can be offset against the increased expenditure.  In an effort to meet as far as possible the demand for commercial timber for essential industrial purposes, the Department has found it necessary to place on the market during 1944-45 greater quantities of mature timber than was intended when the original Estimate for Forestry for the year was being prepared.  Receipts under the emergency fuel schemes were also greater than was anticipated.  The extra receipts, together with small savings on other sub-heads will, it is anticipated, account for a sum of £25,590, so that the net additional amount the Dáil is asked to provide is £10.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,950 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1945, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Marine Service (Merchant Shipping Acts, 1894 to 1939, and the Foreshore Act, 1933 (No. 12 of 1933)); for certain payments in respect of Compensation, including extra wages of seamen and the cost of medical treatment; <Col N="2422" /> and for payments in respect of the provision of certain Protective Equipment for Ships.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate arises by reason of deficiencies in certain sub-heads: sub-head F of the Vote, relating to wreck and salvage; sub-head I, relating to war compensation for seamen; and sub-head J, relating to the protection of ships against magnetic mines.  The preparation of an Estimate in respect of wreck and salvage, as Deputies will appreciate, is a matter of considerable difficulty.  In fact the quantity of wreck which came ashore, or was brought ashore from the sea, was substantially more than was anticipated, involving the payment of increased sums to the salvers and involving incidentally an increase in the Appropriations-in-Aid of the Vote arising out of the disposal of the wreckage.</P>
    <P>As the Dáil is aware, the Government has undertaken the obligation of paying compensation in respect of seamen who lose their lives upon Irish vessels by reason of any cause attributable to the war.  The provision made in that respect for the year proved inadequate, due to a decision made in May last to increase the rates of pensions and allowances.  Furthermore, the position with regard to an Irish vessel, the <i>Ardmore,</i> which was lost on a voyage from Cork, was that a decision as to the cause of the loss had not been arrived at when the Estimate was prepared.  The Shipping Federation was making provisional payments to the widows and children of the crew, but it was only during the course of the year that it was decided to accept the loss of the vessel as due to warfare and to recoup to the Shipping Federation the amount paid in pensions to the widows of the crew.</P>
    <P>The only other item is that in respect of the protection of vessels against magnetic mines.  The work, which is paid for by the Government, was completed on all our vessels some time ago, but one shipping company was unable to present the account for the equipment until this financial year and the recoupment to that company of the cost of the equipment was not possible until <Col N="2423" /> the account was presented.  These are the three items in respect of which a deficiency has arisen and for which the supplementary sum is required.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That, having regard to the continuous increase in the cost of food, clothing and footwear, especially in relation to children, and the consequent hardship on many of our citizens, Dáil Eireann requests the Government to undertake an early survey of poverty prevailing amongst the unemployed, especially those who are unemployable as a result of age or disability, and also amongst the employed in receipt of low wages; that Dáil Eireann further requests the Government, following upon such survey, to promote a higher standard of living amongst such citizens by making adequate provision of the necessaries of life through increased unemployment benefits and unemployment assistance, and also through relief administered by the various boards of assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was induced to put down this motion by the failure of many thousands of our people to find permanent employment at decent wages, and I was aware that there were thousands existing on the borderline of starvation on inadequate allowances, allowances from national health and unemployment assistance, and the few half-crowns thrown at them by boards of assistance, with a rigidly enforced means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of failure to get that help, they and their children are suffering very grave hardships.  During the year, I and members of other Parties drew the attention of the Government <Col N="2424" /> to the hundreds, if not thousands, of children in this city who were going around barefooted.  I pressed hard to get the Government to realise the danger to the health of those children and to induce them to give them boots. To give the Government their due, they did that and I have already said: &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo;.  It was stated that people on poor law relief would get the boots free of charge.  Only yesterday, I met half a dozen women in Gardiner Street, who told me that, though they were on poor law relief, they would have to pay 7/6 per pair for those boots that are called &ldquo;free boots&rdquo;, which they could not afford to do.  I think that that matter is being inquired into and, probably, something will be done.  I had thought that the Government would go further, in view of the recommendations of the school attendance committees and charitable organisations, in the way of providing clothing for the children of people of moderate means or in receipt of relief or unemployment assistance.  One has only to go a few yards from the Gresham Hotel to see boys and girls wearing washed-out rags that are letting in the cold and making them easy victims of tuberculosis and other diseases.  Again, I should say &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; if the Government would see that the children to whom they give boots would also be given free clothing or clothing at a price which their parents could afford to pay.  I suggested that £100,000 should be devoted to this question of clothing and let the parents of those children pay 1/- a week and clothe them.</P>
    <P>As I said before, the second portion of the motion asking for increases in all these benefits, so that people would not continue to suffer, was put down only as an alternative to permanent employment at remunerative wages. It is not a solution; it is only a temporary measure.  The Minister made a long statement.  One would think that the speech he made was one he had thought out for the Federation of Industries.  He explained all the Government had done, how industries had prospered and how much increased benefits of this kind would do to injure industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2425" /> He forced Deputy Cogan, of the Farmers' Party, to stand up and protest against the apparent effort made to show that the farmers were the only people who benefited to any considerable extent during the emergency.  He made it appear that the farmers were a very prosperous community, indeed. Deputy Cogan had to rise in his place and state that that was not so.  The Minister, in his reply, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is not true that the cost of living has been continuously rising for the past 18 months.  From the middle of 1943, prices have been stabilised.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I made inquiries to-day and I found that, in 1943, the highest price charged for potatoes to the working people of the city was 1/10 per stone.  Last week, potatoes&mdash;one of the principal foods of the working classes&mdash;were 2/6 per stone, and people had to travel long distances to get them.  In that item alone there is an increase in price. Prices have not been stabilised so far as food has been concerned.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If a survey of poverty was to be taken now, it would show no good results....  The idea of a social survey has been considered.  I think Deputies who have spoken about it, however, do not appreciate that any such survey, to be of value, would necessarily be protracted....  To get a survey upon which we could afford to take the chance of basing future policy, there would have to be an examination of conditions over a period, and, inevitably, if that examination was to be thorough and conducted in all parts of the country, it might be years before the results could be tabulated and made available. This is the wrong time to undertake such a survey.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the Government thought it was desirable to have a survey but, because of its protracted nature, now was not the time to undertake it.  When will the right time come?  Is it after the people on small wages and inadequate allowances have suffered that the survey will take place?  I think that the Government would be well advised to follow the example of the Pilgrim Trust people <Col N="2426" /> in England, who have taken a survey and have tabulated the details.  They are getting ready now and not waiting until after the war to give the people who are in need some kind of social security and relieve them of hardship. The Minister said that the cost of living had been stabilised.  Does he know that Dublin Corporation are condemning and knocking down a large number of old tenement houses which were falling in on the people and that the rents in those cases were 4/- and 5/- per week?</P>
    <P>The remedy adopted by the corporation is to take the people out of those conditions and send them to live in cottages which are rented at 10/- and 14/- a week.  Therefore, the cost of living in the case of people living in Gloucester Street, Seán McDermott Street, Longford Street, and Bridge Street, where the houses are falling down, is increased by the fact that not only are their rents doubled but that they have to pay what is the equivalent of another rent in transport charges to get to their work.  I am hearing about their grievance every other day.  The people cannot exist on the small wages they are in receipt of or on the unemployment benefits they receive.  The Dublin T.D.s and the members of the Dublin Corporation are aware of the clamour there is amongst those people to get back from the areas to which they had been transferred to a back room in any part of the city.  Due to the rents and transport charges they have to meet a number of loaves are taken off their tables.  The Government have not taken that into consideration. I am not finding fault with the Government, but I am asking that they should go ahead with their survey so that something may be done to relieve those people from the burdens they are bearing.  At present they are not able to buy the necessaries of life. They are existing on the absolute minimum to keep them alive.  Those engaged in the hospitals examining patients will tell one that malnutrition is the cause of half the disease and trouble that we have in this city.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Government to continue the good work they started last Christmas when they decided to provide <Col N="2427" /> the children with footwear.  I would now ask that they should be provided with clothing.  The Minister should approach the board of assistance and tell them not to be giving the people half crowns or four shillings when four times these amounts are necessary to keep them in good health.  Something should be done to relieve the tubercular patient in a sanatorium who is worrying himself to death thinking of his family trying to exist on a miserable allowance and afraid that the landlord will serve a notice to quit and evict his family.  I can assure the Minister that such things have happened in Dublin within the last month or two.  The Dublin T.D.s are aware that notices to quit have been served on people because of their failure to pay rent.  They are unable to pay their rents because of the inadequate allowances they are receiving. These notices to quit have put terror into the hearts of the wives of unemployed men and of the wives of men who are in a sanatorium.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said that the Government had given consideration to this question of a survey, but because of the time it would take years would elapse before benefit would accrue from it.  I suggest that the sooner a start is made on it the better. The Minister said that the Government had considered the practicability of such a social survey some time ago and had decided deliberately that it was undesirable to undertake it now.  I would like to ask him, if it was thought desirable to consider the matter at all, what has broken that desire?  No matter what the Minister may say the cost of living is going up.  Take the position of newly-married people who buy furniture on the hire-purchase system.  I have seen in the book of a young married pair where they had to pay £24 on the hire-purchase system for a small article of furniture.  I saw the same article for sale at eight guineas for cash.  I hope and believe that the Minister will undertake the survey at an early date, and that he will see that all these grievances are brought to an end.</P>

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business. - Demonstration Farms&mdash;Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Eireann is of opinion that demonstration farms of various sizes and of different degrees of fertility should be established by the Department of Agriculture in each county for the purpose of demonstrating (a) the most efficient methods of tillage and live stock improvement, and (b) the costings in each branch of the industry.</P>
      <P>I was not expecting that this motion would be taken to-night, so I am at a disadvantage and, possibly, the Minister is at a similar disadvantage.  The issues raised in this motion are very clear and very simple.  All that we ask is that the Department of Agriculture, which sets out to teach and advise farmers in the business of carrying on their industry, should undertake to demonstrate, in the most effective manner possible, the effectiveness of that teaching.  There is an old saying in this country: &ldquo;Do what I tell you, not what you see me doing.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to agriculture, we have had this Department in operation for years.  It has set out to advise the farmer, and a great deal of the advice given by it has been sound and reasonable. <Col N="2430" /> We should honestly admit, first of all, that there is a wide gap between the science of agriculture as known to the Department and agriculture as practised throughout the country.  The Department has acquired a very advanced knowledge of the science of agriculture, and compares favourably with any similar Department in any other country; yet we have complaints &mdash;very justifiable complaints&mdash;that all that knowledge has not been translated into practice.</P>
    <P>I cannot imagine a more effective means of putting across to the farming community the information which the Department possesses than that of establishing in each county a farm run directly by the Department.  It might be asked what exactly is the type of experiment envisaged in this motion. What we envisage is that the Department, through its county committees, would acquire in each county, at least one, but better still, two farms.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that one of these farms be fairly large and typical of the fairly large farms in that county&mdash; particularly if it is a county in which there are many such farms; the other would be a small farm typical of the small farms in the county.  These two farms would be run under the supervision of the local agricultural officer who, of course, would need to appoint a manager in charge of each farm to carry out the operating work.</P>
    <P>It might be asked what type of manager is suggested.  I would suggest that the best type of manager would be a young man, a man who has been trained in various agricultural colleges or schools.  I know there are many such young men, farmers' sons, who have gone through various agricultural schools, and who are seeking work at the present time.  Every vacancy for a tillage inspector or farm improvement inspector results in an inundation of applications from this type of applicant.  Now, those young men would take over the management, under the supervision of the agricultural officer, and their job would be to demonstrate to all the public, and to the farmers in particular, that the teaching of the Department is sound.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2431" /> If those farms are established, we can easily understand the amount of attention that would be given to them by the farmers in each county where they are in operation.  We can easily imagine that, practically every Sunday of the year, young men from all parts of the county would visit these farms to see how they were being operated. Of course, it would be absolutely necessary, in connection with such demonstration farms, to have very complete accounts and balance sheets published in the local Press, showing every item of expenditure and income on the farms and the amount of profit made.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any reason why the Minister should reject a proposal of this kind, when everything seems to be in its favour.  If the Minister should decide to reject it, it seems that he would have only one ground for doing so&mdash;that he is afraid the farm would not pay.  If that is the position he intends to take up, that the Department of Agriculture cannot make a farm of this kind pay, he will have some difficulty in defending his position.</P>
    <P>If those farms did not pay it would be for either of two reasons, the first being that the Department of Agriculture is so inefficient that it is incapable of running a demonstration farm on ordinary lines.  In this connection I might point out, as I am unfortunately speaking without notes, that I intended to make the point also that in connection with those farms it is necessary that the type of farming carried on should be the ordinary commercial type of farming and that the Department should not go in for any specialised lines such as the raising of pedigree stock or any business of that kind which would not be open to every farmer in the country.  Naturally, if you are going to have a demonstration farm you must demonstrate the system of farming which any farmer in the county could undertake and you must rule out specialised lines such as the breeding of specialised seeds, plants or stock.  If the Minister is going to take up the position that he is afraid these farms would not pay, he has a choice of two horns of the dilemma upon either of which he can impale himself. <Col N="2432" /> He must either admit that the Department of Agriculture is not sufficiently efficient to run a demonstration farm or, alternatively, he must admit that the margin of profit in agriculture&mdash; that is the difference between agricultural prices and agricultural costs of production&mdash;is so narrow that it would be absolutely impossible for the Department to make such a farm pay.</P>
    <P>I shall deal first of all with the assumption that the Minister takes up the position that the Department could not manage such a farm efficiently.  The Department have behind them 50 years of experience in studying every branch of farming.  The Minister may say: &ldquo;Well, that is all right but we have not the same tradition of farming as the ordinary peasant proprietor, and we might not be able to compete with the ordinary peasant proprietor for that reason&rdquo;.  He might also take up the position that the State, as a rule, cannot make its operations pay as well as a private individual.</P>
    <P>Let us contrast the position as between the two.  First of all, there will be only one or two of these demonstration farms in each county.  That means that there will be only a very limited number, and for those farms the Minister has a very wide choice from which to select proper managers.  He can select the most efficient farmer's son in the country and appoint him to manage one of these farms.  Contrast that with the position of the ordinary farmer. Farms, as we know, generally pass from parents to children.  We know that, in the ordinary course of events, you have many farms owned by people who are handicapped by some physical or mental deficiency.  Again, the management of some farms is very seriously affected by the fact that there is a large family living together and perhaps not agreeing too well.  If you deduct the number of farms on which management is obstructed or interfered with for some reason of that kind from the total number, you will find that there is a serious diminution so far as the average efficiency of farming is concerned.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, in the case of those farms which I suggest should be <Col N="2433" /> carried on by the Department, you will have one thing certain, namely, you will have the most efficient manager appointed, and if he is not satisfactory the local agricultural officer can remove him at a week's notice.  That is one advantage which the Departmental farm will have over the ordinary farm, and it outweighs or offsets whatever advantage the ordinary farmer might have arising from a sense of ownership or the freedom which the ordinary farmer enjoys.  For that reason I think the Minister cannot dare to put the plea that it is impossible for his Department to run a farm as efficiently as the ordinary farmer.  He has therefore only the other means of escape, namely, to claim that the margin of profit in agriculture is so low that he cannot make these farms pay.  If the Minister takes up that attitude, he is publicly admitting that he and his Department have failed ignominiously in their duty because it is the first duty of the State, acting through the Minister and his Department, to ensure that the margin of profit in agriculture is sufficient to enable every farmer to make a profit.  If he admits that his Department cannot make these demonstration farms pay, he is admitting that he is imposing what can only be described as a criminal injustice on the farming community.</P>
    <P>Let us bear this fact in mind.  The fundamental principle which ought to govern agricultural policy is that there is a duty on the farmer to secure from his land the highest possible annual output and that there is at the same time a duty on the State to ensure that the primary producer on the land is adequately rewarded for his labour and risk.  If the Minister accepts these two fundamental principles he must accept this motion because the motion, first of all, will ensure that the most efficient method of farming will be put into operation and that a real effort will be made to secure that the maximum output will be obtained from the land.</P>
    <P>This motion will also be the first step to ensure that the margin of profit in agriculture is sufficient to enable the industry to continue, because it would be absolutely impossible for any Government, the Minister or his Department <Col N="2434" /> to fix what is an adequate reward for the farmer unless they, first of all, take the necessary steps to find out what are the costings of production in agriculture.  This motion will enable the Minister to find out exactly what are the farmer's costs of production. We know that whenever the question of the price of an agricultural commodity is raised in this House, there is always a dispute about what it costs to produce a given commodity whether it be wheat, beet or anything else.  We know that the farmers, through their various organisations, will put up one set of figures as the costs of production.  The Minister will usually dispute these figures, but there has never been any effective official investigation of costs of production. During the last war an attempt was made by the Department of Agriculture to find out the cost of production in regard to various agricultural activities on various farms.  But that system of investigating costings was only continued until 1922, I think, when agricultural prices fell.  The Department then decided that it would not be wise to continue investigating costings in agriculture because their figures would show a very substantial loss.  I believe that this motion, particularly if it is considered with one eye on another motion further down on the Order Paper advocating a long-term policy in regard to price fixing, will go a long way towards putting agriculture in a sound position.  Once we can induce the Department of Agriculture to take up and work those farms in each county, I think we will have set our feet on the road that will lead to inducing or compelling the Department to see that the margin of profit in agriculture is never allowed to dwindle to vanishing point, as happened in recent years.</P>
    <P>It may be asked what would be the net result of these demonstration farms in regard to agriculture.  One result, of course, would be, as I have pointed out, that farmers would take a keen and active interest in what was being done and would learn probably more from these practical demonstrations than they would ever learn from lectures given by the various agricultural officers.  The fact that the local agricultural <Col N="2435" /> instructor would have such a farm under his control would give weight and punch to the arguments and suggestions that he would put before farmers.  The local agricultural instructor could stand up at any meeting and say: &ldquo;Such and such is the best policy.  If you dispute my words, you can go and see that policy in practice on the farm which I am running in this county and which is within easy reach of you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister may at some time or another have heard of a person named Will Hay.  Will Hay achieved fame for his portrayal of an absolutely illiterate professor running a very high-class school.  Let the Minister for Agriculture be careful that his Department will not be described as a Will Hay Department, a Department that is endeavouring to teach what it does not know.  No matter how much the Department of Agriculture, through their officers, may learn from experiments and from the study of the theory and practice of farming, they will never be able to speak with authority on agriculture until they are able to say: &ldquo;We have run farms exactly similar to the average farm in the country and have made them pay.&rdquo; We of the Farmers' Party in this motion are issuing a challenge to the Department of Agriculture to come down off the fence.  The hurler on the ditch may claim to be a better hurler than the hurlers on the field, but he will never convince anybody of that until he gets down into the arena and shows that he is able to do the work as well as the players on the field.  I recommend this motion very strongly to the House and I feel that the Minister cannot reject it.</P>

      <P>I am not quite clear as to what Deputy Cogan means by a profitable demonstration.  I think that if he had stated that there should be State-owned farms it would be much clearer.  If demonstration farms were to show profits, I am afraid there would be very little progress made, <Col N="2436" /> because the committee of agriculture, in looking after the demonstration farms, would be extremely careful only to do what was profitable.  The Department of Agriculture for many years made efforts to demonstrate certain types of production.  Having made those demonstrations they could not possibly be expected to make profits, because sometimes there would have been failures and sometimes losses in connection with those experiments. On the other hand, if the Deputy stated that we should have State-owned farms, and that they should be profitable, I am afraid that the farmer would come to the conclusion that they were profitable, because the Government had plenty of capital and plenty of credit, and I do not believe that any progress would be made in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as demonstration plots are concerned, we have quite a number of them in each county.  Each county committee of agriculture has several demonstration plots, some on small farms, some on large farms, and some with cottiers, all of which must be run by the owners at a profit, if possible. These plots are intended to demonstrate the value of manures sometimes, and sometimes of certain types of seed. Most of the vocational committees also have some land on which there are demonstration plots.  Therefore, we have a large number of demonstration plots.  Whether all these show a profit or not cannot easily be demonstrated. It is for the farmers in general to get experience and to profit by the methods adopted, and so improve production generally.  Nobody can say, therefore, that there are not ample opportunities for instruction so far as theory is concerned.  The Department of Agriculture never believed that these plots were for any other purpose than demonstrating the theory of farming. If Deputy Cogan says there is something wrong with agriculture, I do not think that this is the remedy.  I do not say that agriculture is all that it should be.  I do not say that agriculture has been for some years past a profitable undertaking.  But I think that, if Deputy Cogan and the Farmers' Party devoted their attention to other matters affecting agriculture, <Col N="2437" /> they would be doing a better day's work for the farmers than by misleading them to some extent in this way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  I am advising the Farmers' Party to try to discover some ways and means of helping the farmer, which would be of more assistance to him.  I think that if attention was devoted to other matters connected with agriculture we might get a far better result than in this way, because I cannot understand how these farms could be operated except as State-owned farms.  They would have to be completely State-owned and, I am sure that, however hard the times may be, a State-owned farm would show a profit.  I believe they could show a profit because they would not have the liabilities that farmers have to meet.  They would have the most up-to-date machinery and special management and, above all, they would have special methods of bookkeeping. I do not think such a system would do any good.  I do agree with Deputy Cogan in the other part of his motion, dealing with agricultural costings. I believe there is a great deal of confusion caused and quite an amount of harm done as far as agricultural costings are concerned.  I have had some little experience from time to time of this.  I refer especially to agricultural costings as laid down by the Department of Industry and Commerce. I think they certainly would need a great deal of reconsideration and that they are generally unfair to the farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industrial side of our economy is quite new.  There are a few industries of long standing, such as Guinness and Jacobs, but a number of new industries has been established.  They are quite competent and are able to present their costings in perfect order.  At times they are able to get around the Department and sometimes their costings are higher than they really should be.  I suppose, under our system, that is what they call genuine efficiency.  Farmers are not like that.  They are of different types; there is no great agreement amongst them; they have not formed <Col N="2438" /> a company.  Consequently, they cannot put in a manager and sack him if he does not do the right thing.  They are not liable to audit.  There is nothing to spur them on.  The result is that I do not believe that the costings as set down for agriculture are at all fair and there follows a degree of slavery in agriculture.  If we cannot eliminate that, if we cannot improve the standard of the people on the land, I believe the farmer and his workers are going to leave the land.</P>
    <P>It may be that we have too many people on the land.  That could happen. Possibly, if we were highly mechanised, there would be too many on the land.  It may be that we will not be successful until we become mechanised.  It is possible that with mechanisation costings will become fairer than they are to-day and more favourable to the farmer.  In such conditions the farmer could realise his commitments.</P>
    <P>I do not know what proportion of, say, industrial workers' holidays are paid for by the farmer.  I throw that out as a line of thought that the Farmers' Party might pursue.  These are very important matters that affect the farmer in his standards of comfort and of living.  What will the average farmer and his labourer purchase in the City of Dublin in exchange for what he produces?  The product of his labour is his means of purchasing his needs.  All his expenses are increased, whether by the transport system, or the numerous auctioneers and agents in the vegetable market.  Expenses are increased; wages are increased, thereby making the goods that the agricultural workers purchase entirely too dear.  In other words they demand an undue proportion of his products. I think it would be wiser to treat the subject on those lines.  I think it would be more profitable for the farming industry than to pursue the lines of this motion which only a few years ago was under discussion in the House.  I do not think there is anything in it apart from the question of costings.</P>
    <P>Agriculture, for a number of years, has been depressed.  That is not because agriculture is not highly organised <Col N="2439" /> in some of its branches.  I do not think there is any modern industry that is as highly organised as the cattle trade in this country is.  The reason why it is so highly organised is that the people concerned are running the business.  It is not the job of Departments to organise industry or agriculture.  It is the job of the people concerned in those industries.  It is the job of Departments to train them technically and to lead them technically, especially in such an industry as agriculture.  I do not think the industrial section of this community demand demonstrations.  There may be an odd vocational class to give instruction in metal work and technical matters of that kind.  Industry seems to be able to get on quite well without such demonstrations. I do not believe that this motion, even if it were accepted by the House, would do any good to anybody, even the Farmers' Party.</P>

      <P>Procedure is not a strong point of mine.  I do not know whether I rise more in sorrow than in anger.  Deputy Cogan proposed a motion and asked the Government to show us how the thing is done.  I am one of the few farmers in the House who have had experience of serving an apprenticeship to a business in this city.  I ran a business in this city and I believe that the beginning of business is to know the difference between profit and loss.  I returned to the country to carry on the farm.  Farming is a thing on which I am very keen. It is for me a sentimental business rather than anything else.  Sometimes I wish I had remained in the city. Sometimes I think I did the right thing in leaving it.  I tried to carry on the farm on business methods for about four years, keeping books and having audited accounts.  Had I continued, I would have been put in a mental home. Deputy Cogan wants the Department to demonstrate the obvious to us.  He wants the farm worked on business lines.  Deputy O'Reilly says the whole thing is wrong, that it cannot be worked on business lines.  I believe Deputy O'Reilly is right, because he is wrong.  It reminds me of the <i>Gondoliers</i><Col N="2440" /> or the <i>Mikado</i>&mdash;&ldquo;You are right and I am right and we are all as right as right can be&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There was a farm at Ardfinnan near my native place.  I do not remember it, but it is still called &ldquo;The model farm.&rdquo;  It was a demonstration plot, about eight miles from Clonmel and four miles from Cahir.  I understand there were a couple of them in each province.  They were known as model farms, and they picked out the cleverest of the young men in Marlborough Street Training College, who had a penchant for farming as well, and they put them into those model farms, as the natives said, &ldquo;to teach the farmers what to do.&rdquo;  This particular man, who has left many happy memories in Ardfinnan, was a classical teacher; the old national teachers were all great men.  He failed; the balance sheet went wrong, and the poor man nearly went out of his mind.  The lad who remains on the farm is always supposed to be the fool of the family. That is another Abbey Theatre joke, with their Micheál Paidín and all the rest of them.  It is painful to see all this so-called theatrical crowd looking on at that kind of tripe.  The poor unfortunate fellow who is kept at home on the farm is generally the eldest son.  He is not picked because he is an imbecile; he is picked because of necessity he has to remain there.  He has to work the farm, and perhaps the second or third son is going on for a profession.  In any case, they took the farm out of this poor teacher's hands, and the poor man was nearly off his head.  I should have said that those lads who were taken out of Marlborough Street Training College were put into the Glasnevin farm for two years.  This teacher had 200 or 300 boys who intended going on for the Church, or for medicine or chemistry.  He was teaching them, and they went into Waterford College or Maynooth afterwards.  There was no secondary school there at that time. They went ahead very quickly, and the lads at home were doing the work on the demonstration farm.  They were not showing a profit on the farm, only putting in long, dreary hours of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under your Agricultural Wages Bill, <Col N="2441" /> the hours of work on the farm are from 8 o'clock in the morning until 6 o'clock in the evening.  The cows come in at 8 o'clock in the morning to be milked, and you have to milk them at 5 o'clock in the evening in order to let the men off.  That means nine hours one way, and 15 the other, and the result is mastitis, abortion, and all the other evils that soon put an end to the cows.  That is the root cause of the loss of the butter trade.  Twelve months ago we asked for 1/- a gallon for milk, but we would not get it.  I know something about farming, although I spent a lot of time away from it.  I was reared on a 35 acre farm. Through the death of an uncle, I got 85 acres.  I now have a 125 acre farm, and I know all the joys and sorrows of the 35 acres, the 85 acres and the 125 acres, as well as any man in Ireland. At one time I milked 32 cows.  Then I got down as far as 16, and I have now got back to 22.  Twelve months ago here, when my Party asked for 1/-a gallon for milk in the summer, I said to Dr. Ryan, the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;my words will be found in the Official Debates&mdash;that he would not get milk or butter to meet the requirements of the country at 1/3 or even at 1/4.  Am I a false prophet?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish they would show us how to farm at a profit.  It cannot be done, because the prices for agricultural produce are too low.  Beet is in the very same category.  When we take the mud off it and pay carriage, it costs 99/3 a ton.  Let them show us how to make a profit out of milk at the present price of 10½d. a gallon, or on beet for which we get £3 5s. or £3 6s.  I should like to see them running demonstration plots to show how that is done.  Our men are working from 12 to 15 hours a day from the time the hay comes or until the last blade of corn is threshed.  If you want to see men working, go down to Tipperary, Wexford, Kilkenny, or <Col N="2442" /> Limerick and see the boys working at the threshing.  That is where you will see work done.  Those are the boys who keep the country alive.  We are told to grow this and grow that&mdash; penny-book stuff; you can read it in any weekly paper.  Let them show us how we can make a profit out of it.</P>
      <P>In any business, your profit is the difference between cost and selling price.  There are lads working on our farms who could not learn anything in agricultural schools.  Some of them would beat any of the Department's trained men.  There are no new developments in farming&mdash;every farmer can work the reaper and binder and tractor.  We know what beet costs to produce; show us how to make a profit on it.  We are short of butter and milk, and to that shortage malnutrition is primarily due.  Let them come along and give us demonstrations to show how those commodities can be profitably produced.  We are nation lovers; we have as much, or more, stake in the country as any other section of the community.  We know how to do the work.  Our lads are well trained.  They attend the lectures given by the Department. Show us how to make a profit.  Put up to us a business-like proposition, on the lines on which, say, the Sunbeam Factory is run by Deputy Dwyer.  Show us how things can be done in a business-like way.  We want those demonstration plots to show us how a profit can be made.  We cannot see how it can be achieved while agricultural prices are at their present low level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see that any useful purpose can be served by setting up demonstration farms, and the best case against the setting up of such farms has been made by the last speaker, a Deputy of the Farmers' Party.  He tells us that he knows the practical side of farming, that the Farmers' Party know the practical side of it, and that it would be more or less presumption on the part of the Minister or the Department even to attempt to run a farm in a practical way.  That is not the first time we have had that type of argument from the Farmers' <Col N="2443" /> Benches.  As a matter of fact, over the last few years we have been listening to propaganda from the Farmers' Party telling the farming community that they have been robbed through the policy of the Department of Agriculture, that they should be annoyed by the interference of the officials of the Department, that they should not tolerate the interference of the Department in their business.  They told the farmers that although they were paying well for it all, everything was not going well for the farming community.</P>
      <P>One strange thing emerges, according to the Farmers' Party, and that is, that the land is breaking everybody connected with it, the land is bankrupting the people who are compelled to live on it, yet, if we are to believe the Deputies who have spoken on this motion, quite the contrary seems to be the fact.  We are told that land is soaring in price throughout the length and breadth of the State.  It is one of those things we find it very difficult to understand, that in a business which, according to the people who claim they are official spokesmen, is bankrupt and has been for years, there are still people who are clamouring to get more land and there are members of the farming community prepared to pay extraordinary prices for land.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. I merely wish to point out that if the Department of Agriculture has been so ineffectual in its policy concerning agriculture, and if its policy has had such a bad effect on the farming community, it is very difficult to reconcile practical farmers wanting to get more land and being prepared to pay enhanced prices for it.  We are told by the Farmers' representatives that farming is in a bad way and that the people who are living on the land are bankrupt, although they cultivate it to the best of their ability.  What can the Department of Agriculture do if these demonstration farms are established?  In my own county we have demonstration <Col N="2444" /> plots established by the county committee of agriculture and there are demonstrations every year, covering every aspect of the farmer's business. We have classes established throughout the country under various committees of agriculture in which the technical side of farming is taught to those farmers who are progressive and interested enough to attend them and acquire the knowledge the Departmental officials have gained through experience.  In these classes, even in the most backward areas, farmers can get all the information they require to enable them to use their land to the best possible advantage.  They are in a position to get the best technical advice through the county committees of agriculture.</P>
      <P>We have had a considerable amount of soil-testing, and valuable information in that connection is available if the people are sufficiently interested to avail of it.  In addition, practical demonstrations are carried out constantly under the supervision of the Department's officials.  Is there anything else necessary, or would any better results be achieved if we had the State setting up in business along farming lines, taking in every branch of the industry?  The cry from every industrialist, no matter what branch he may be in, is to keep the State from interfering.  Everybody seems to be complaining that there is too much State interference, yet we have the Farmers' Party now asking the State to enter the business of farming.</P>
      <P>I cannot see the sense of asking the Minister for Agriculture to set up a demonstration farm in my county, to employ a host of civil servants or other officials to work it, to take over land we so badly need there.  That there are some such farms necessary we all agree, but I cannot see what further results will be achieved by establishing such farms as are suggested in this motion.  I cannot see what useful purpose would be served by establishing these farms.  The necessary information and technical skill are already available in the State.  Possibly at some other time it might be possible to have plots made available at schools. Already there are such plots in existence and they are very useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2445" /> If we want the State to run farms you might as well suggest that every branch of industry should ask the State to run a demonstration factory. For instance, if we are to manufacture ploughs, in order to show the companies how to manufacture them the State must start a plough factory, and the same might equally apply to any other form of industry&mdash;asking the State to set a headline.  I think the idea is absurd and this proposal will not have any practical results, even if the House were foolish enough to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe the farming community is burst, or that the farmers are not competent to do their work.  I believe the farmers need more fixed markets.  The farmers know their job well, and I do not believe they want a lead from the State as to how to carry out their work.  Our farms have been worked successfully for hundreds of years, and there is nothing from A to Z that the farmers do not know about agriculture. What agriculturists need is a fixed price for their produce.  We have no co-operation, and until there is a definite agreement between Britain and this country I do not think you will have a successful agricultural policy. That is really what is wrong, and until something like that takes place&mdash;and perhaps it may be a long time&mdash;we need not talk about making agriculture a really paying proposition, because it will not happen.</P>
      <P>I do not say that agriculture does not pay.  There is no use in talking nonsense.  If agriculture does not pay in some way, then there would be no such thing as agriculture.  I know farmers in my own county and in neighbouring counties who occupy the lands that their fathers, grandfathers and even great-grandfathers occupied, 30, 40 and 50-acre farms, and they are able to hold their heads above water. Those men are able to make that land pay.  I think the thrifty, middle class farmer who works from morning to night is able to weather the storm in good and bad times.  He is always able to pay 20/- in the £, and he does pay it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2446" /> I am afraid we are too individualistic; as regards agriculture, the farmer is too much of an individualist. Each farmer tries to work out on his own.  Until you have co-operative farming you will make very little progress. I should like to see eight or ten or 12 farmers co-operating so that they would be able to purchase suitable machinery and help one another. A farmer on a 40-acre farm cannot purchase tractors or reapers and binders, but if you get ten or 12 fairly progressive men working together, they can buy threshing machines, reapers and binders and other suitable farming machinery and they can put their farming on a sound basis.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>Yesterday, I asked a question concerning the proposals or scheme which the Government intend to operate as to the demobilisation of the Army.  The Minister, in his reply, said that proposals were under active consideration, but that he was not in a position at the moment to announce the terms of the scheme.  I do not want to embarrass the Minister in any way or to stampede him into announcing, prematurely, proposals before they have been given full and careful consideration, but I have had considerable contact with soldiers, both officers and men.  Practically every week, and sometimes more frequently, one meets a private soldier, a non-commissioned officer or an officer, and if you are talking to him for any length of time, he will invariably say: &ldquo;What are you going to do about the Army?  What proposals have the Government for resettling us in life, or what provisions will they make to enable us to get back into business or to get a start on our own, or to replace us in the jobs in which we were previous to joining the Army?&rdquo;  As a result, Deputies are in the awkward position that they have to say: &ldquo;I am afraid I do not know&rdquo;. So far, the Government have given no indication, with the exception of a <Col N="2447" /> rather scare speech by the Taoiseach in Clare last August.  Since then, nothing further has been heard, and as to whether the proposals which were outlined then are to be operated or not, the Army, this House and the public are without any information upon it.</P>
      <P>I should like to impress upon the Minister that, whether the war lasts long or short, it is five years shorter than it originally was and that those people, in June next, will be five years older.  They will be five years away from civilian employment, in the case of those who were previously employed; and in the case of those who joined the Army, after having left school or who had just started apprenticeship to a trade or profession, there has been a serious interruption in their lives.  That interruption occurred at a time when, in the ordinary course of events, they would be learning a trade or acquiring knowledge of a profession, passing examinations, and so on.  The position is that all these men are now five years older, and I am sure it will be realised that an apprentice of 18 years of age is far more adaptable than a man of 23 or 24, who has lost contact with study or has not the same inclination which he previously had for acquiring knowledge of either a trade or profession.  Coupled with that, a large number of these men have since got married, on the strength of Army promotion and the pay they received.  A double problem arises there.  Not only is the man faced with the necessity of maintaining himself, but with the necessity of maintaining a wife, and, possibly, children.  That man is faced with demobilisation sooner or later, and a return to civilian life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite sure that the Government do not propose to terminate suddenly the services of the members of the Defence Forces, but I should like the Minister and the Government to realise that all these men are living under perpetual anxiety, smaller or greater according to the amount of responsibility which each man has.  I am quite sure that Deputies and the Minister have frequent contact with men who either are anxious to get <Col N="2448" /> back to civilian life or to have an opportunity of securing civilian employment, and their whole anxiety is to be transferred as quickly as possible to the reserve in order that they may have an opportunity of fitting themselves in, because they feel that if they are not in a position to avail of such an opportunity, somebody else will.</P>
    <P>I think the House will realise that the people of this country owe a debt of gratitude, which cannot be repaid merely in words or fine sentiments expressed at public Party meetings or at Army demonstrations, to the men who, five years ago, when this country considered that its independence might be violated, came forward to the defence of the country.  These men were recruited, the youth of the country made a magnificent response and, having made that response, while they do not expect to be pensioned or to be maintained by the State free of some contribution, nevertheless they feel that this serious interruption in their lives entitles them to the real gratitude of the people, and to the gratitude of the people in a real way.</P>
    <P>When I say a real way, I mean that adequate notice will be given that the Government propose to demobilise them or that the Government propose to demobilise a certain number of them; and, secondly, I mean that employers will be required, where necessary, by legislation or by force, to reinstate all employees who formerly held civilian employment.  Along with seeing that those who formerly held civilian employment shall be reinstated, I think that the least the country might do, and the least the members of this House should endeavour to secure for the soldiers, is to see that those who have suffered this serious interruption in their lives shall have some monetary assistance, some financial aid, to help them to reinstate themselves or set themselves up in business, or at any rate to enable them to tide over a period which would probably be a drain on their finances while they resettle themselves in civilian life.</P>
    <P>I do not want to compare the <Col N="2449" /> gratuities or allowances which were recently announced in Great Britain for the members of the Defence Forces there with the position here.  In Great Britain they have a far bigger problem and far bigger resources.  Every individual there in one capacity or another has contributed to the machine, just as the people of other belligerent countries, in their own way, have had to make their contribution, and I presume they will make whatever plans they can to resettle themselves in civilian life. While we were not actually in this war, we were faced with a serious threat, a threat which convinced every citizen and every family that it was possible, but for wholehearted determination, the voluntary enlistment in the Defence Forces, including the L.D.F., that we might be actually involved in it.  It is time that the Government declared its policy, and gave an assurance to members of the Defence Forces that it intends to ensure that they will be adequately provided for; that there will be a plan and that individuals will be given sufficient financial aid; and that where necessary those whose careers either as tradesmen or as professional men were interrupted, will be assisted financially, either by training or with equipment and lectures, so that they will be able to resume their careers, and that, in the meantime, provision will be made so that they and their families will not suffer unduly.</P>

      <P>In the period immediately before demobilisation I suggest that if at all possible soldiers should be moved near their home districts so that they would have a chance of getting employment there.  I believe that course would help considerably when the demobilisation came about. Without placing too great a burden on the Exchequer, I should like to see some scheme of gratuities announced&mdash; I do not mean a pension scheme&mdash;to enable soldiers to tide over the period between demobilisation and the securing of employment or the taking up of some occupation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave prefaced his remarks by saying that he did not want to embarrass <Col N="2450" /> the Minister or to stampede him into making some statement he might not be prepared to make.  I suggest that the raising of this question sounds suspiciously like as if that were the Deputy's intention.  Heretofore the criticism levelled at the Government was that we have rushed various types of legislation that it was found necessary to bring in from time to time; and that such legislation suffered by being ill-prepared and ill-considered. I suggest to Deputy Cosgrave that the subject of our discussion this evening is a very important one, one which requires the absolute maximum of consideration if we are to do the right thing at the right time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Cosgrave raised this question some time before the last Recess, I told him that I was examining a scheme at that period, and that it had only just then come to me.  It had been under examination and preparation by the Army chiefs, the most expert people we could get on the task.  It had also to be examined by the civil heads, and at the time that it was raised by Deputy Cosgrave it had reached me, and I was examining it. I have to examine anything I am prepared to submit to the Government with very great care.  I must be satisfied that whatever I submit is in as finished a state as it is possible to have it.  In the very limited time which I have at my disposal&mdash;because it is limited&mdash;I have very many other tasks to perform, and I can only give a percentage of my time to a particular type of work.  I had to go over the scheme carefully for a considerable time, and I made certain changes.  These changes had to be sent back, and those who had been dealing with it heretofore had then to make something in the nature of a final draft.  When I was satisfied that I could produce it to the Government I did so.  The Government are in a similar position to that of a Minister, as members of the Government have only a limited time at their disposal. A particular item must take its place on the agenda.  It cannot just be produced and discussed there and then, unless it is very urgent and very important. This question was not in that category, from the point of view of <Col N="2451" /> being urgent.  While the emergency situation, as we can see it, may be coming to a close, it has not at present reached such a stage that it is likely to affect the Army or the State for a considerable time.  If, by any chance, it was necessary to operate a scheme of demobilisation we could do it at short notice.  We would not be caught on the wrong foot anyway.  This scheme is a very important one and it embraces the financial point raised by Deputy Blowick.  That is part of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Whatever scheme we eventually produce will have to be within the means of the people of this nation.  It would be undesirable to <Col N="2452" /> make a comparison between what we can do and what some other nation can do.  What we do will, I presume, be done in the most generous terms within our means.  That is all I can say on that.  I can say nothing in respect to the scheme at the moment, and can give no details in that regard.  From that point of view, the position, as far as my reply to Deputy Cosgrave is concerned, is that the matter is still under active consideration, and whenever it is prepared, I presume the method will be to lay it on the Table, when it will be available to every Deputy for examination.  I do not think I can add anything further at present.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.20 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Friday, February 9th, 1945.</P>
