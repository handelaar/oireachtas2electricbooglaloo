      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>From a consideration of representations made at the public inquiry it became necessary to consider, not alone the specific <Col N="568" /> applications in respect of individual parcels of land, but also whether the scheme of road widening on which the Preliminary Orders are based would be satisfactory.  The alignment of the road as proposed to be widened was open to objection from a traffic point of view and a new alignment had to be considered.  To do so a further survey had to be obtained from the local authority.  That survey and the consequential legal questions that are involved are under consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if, in view of the diminished traffic on the roads for the past five years and the consequent loss of traffic sense amongst all sections of the community, especially children, he will consider introducing new rules of the road, driving tests, etc., to prevent the loss of life which will otherwise inevitably ensue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The general by-laws for the control of road traffic which were made in 1937 provide a well considered code of rules of the main road and in view of the resumption of motor traffic such revision as may be required is under examination.  Press and radio propaganda will be necessary to bring the code of rules and regulations directly to the attention of each group of road users, pedestrians, cyclists and drivers of vehicles as traffic increases. This aspect of the matter is receiving consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilBlanel" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that there are large numbers of escallop and mussel to be found in Mulroy Bay, County Donegal; and, if it is properly developed, it should provide a profitable industry, and become an asset to <Col N="569" /> the country; and, if so, if he will consider the question of having a survey of the bay carried out by inspectors of the Sea Fisheries Association, with a view to developing the escallop and mussel shell-fish industry here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Official statistics show that the landings of escallops and mussels in the area mentioned have been negligible. If, as suggested in the question, there are large numbers of these shellfish in the area there is no apparent reason why the industry should not be developed by local residents in the first place.  The advice of the fisheries staff of my Department would, of course, be always available on any aspect of the matter which may present difficulty.</P>
      <P>The Sea Fisheries Association would also, no doubt, be prepared to consider giving such help as may be necessary and practicable on receipt of representations explaining precisely what difficulties are being experienced in exploiting these fishing grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilBlanel" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider that the expert knowledge at the disposal of the Sea Fisheries Association could be made available for a survey of the bay?  Local knowledge could not be expected to be as expert as the knowledge that inspectors of the Sea Fisheries Association would have.  Would the Minister, therefore, reconsider the question of having the survey carried out by the Sea Fisheries Association?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

I have come to the conclusion, however, that deserters of the emergency and reserve classes are, at this stage, not worth the trouble which dealing with them as they deserve would involve for the Army and Gárda Siochána authorities.  I propose, therefore, if the Government agree, to introduce legislation which will have the effect that the Deputy desires but will also deprive a deserter of any rights he may have had as a member of the Defence Forces as well as of any right, for a long time to come, to employment remunerated out of public funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I happen to represent a constituency where there was a very tragic railway accident not so long ago, a few miles from Portlaoighise. A few hours after that serious accident, members of the post office staff at Portlaoighise were on the scene, and with the least possible delay established a splendid telephone service between the scene of the accident, the town of Portlaoighise and the City of Dublin.  In view of the very special circumstances, and of the great services that the officers concerned rendered on that occasion, I think the Minister would be well advised to have this matter examined for the purpose of giving them some gratuity or remuneration, or having them placed for promotion when a suitable opportunity arises.  I am absolutely convinced that had that accident occurred in any other part of Ireland there would not have been available a post office staff as capable or as efficient as the staff that came <Col N="572" /> out from Portlaoighise to do that very essential work on that occasion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon made a reference here last night to small post offices in country districts which have shops attached.  I think it is about time the Minister took some action about those shops.  They should be either shops or post offices.  The sub-master should be given a sufficient salary to be able to live without having a small shop in the post office as well.  I remember passing through Cloneygowan some time ago, and I wanted to make a very urgent telephone call, but when I arrived at 2 o'clock, I was told that the post office was closed for a half day.  Who ever heard of a post office with a half day?  I thought the post office had to be open for the convenience of the general public until a certain hour at night.  Assuming that the owners of those shops have not a sufficient staff to carry on, I think that, with the approval of the Minister, they should employ somebody to carry on at least the post office side for the convenience of the general public.  I also have a very great objection to having a telephone kiosk in the centre of a shop.  I heard the parish priest making a telephone call some time ago, and it was discussed at the four ends of the parish, because it was made in this post office which has a shop atached.  I wrote to the Minister calling attention to those conditions in the Cloneygowan post office, and he said you could hear absolutely nothing out <Col N="573" /> of the box, but I can assure him that every word can be heard at the corner 150 yards away, and you need not shout.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is more of a broadcasting station than a post office.  As far as the Department is concerned, I have no axe to grind, but I should be very glad if something could be done about those shops.  I would also strongly recommend to the Minister that in cases where men are carrying out temporary duties as postmen they should be given first preference for employment.  I know a case in my own town where the postmaster hired a messenger because the Department of Posts and Telegraphs cut off the messenger for that town, the town of Mountmellick.  The Department stated that the volume of telegraph traffic was not sufficient to warrant the appointment of a telegraph messenger. There are some crazy notions about saving expenditure.  The postmaster hired a local boy to deliver telegrams, and he worked there for many years. When he got too old for that position as telegraph messenger he was always called upon to carry out any relief work during Christmas and Easter or when the ordinary postmen were on holidays.  The Minister very carefully examined this particular file, but nothing was done to have that man's case sympathetically considered when a suitable vacancy did arise in the district.  I think the Minister should have sympathetically considered his case in view of his years of experience, and in view of the very strong recommendations which the postmaster gave him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other Deputies, I should be glad if something were done by the Department to speed up trunk calls. One day a few weeks ago I received a very important telegram from Kilbeggan, County Westmeath.  It was handed in at 2.30.  I live about 21 or 22 miles from Kilbeggan, and I received the telegram at 5.25.  The telegram asked me to go to pick up a friend in Kilbeggan, but he had left on his bicycle before I got there.  There <Col N="574" /> must have been unnecessary delay in sending that telegram from Kilbeggan Post Office on 3rd April, 1945.  On another occasion, I made a telephone call from Moate Post Office.  I got Dublin in ten minutes, and it took me an hour and three-quarters to get Mountmellick, which is only a few miles away.  It is up to the Minister's Department to have those delays investigated, in order to avoid inconvenience to the general public.</P>
    <P>I would again ask the Minister, in regard to those shops attached to post offices, to see that those people get a sufficient salary to enable them to live. They should either have the shop or have the post office.  The vast majority of them have to have shops because they are unable to live on what they receive from the post office.  The people should get a good service for what they are paying and the Minister ought to consider sympathetically the question of paying these people a decent wage so that they will be able to live up to their duties in the service of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw attention to the inadequate pensions paid to officials of the post office who retired in pre-war days and who have now to meet the high cost of living due to the war without any increase in their pensions. They are suffering very grave hardships after their long years of service to the State.  This matter was referred to last year when the Estimate was before the House and we thought the Minister would do something for these retired servants of his Department who, as I say, are undergoing very grave hardships.  Then there is the position of temporary postmen.  The wages paid to them are not a credit to the Government or to the Minister's Department and something ought to be done to increase their pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also notice that the Estimate for the carrying of letters by air is down by £14,000 this year.  Some explanation is required for such an enormous reduction in that Estimate, especially at a time when business people are hoping for a revival of trade with foreign countries.  Other Deputies have drawn attention to the failure of the <Col N="575" /> Department to supply business people with telephones in their business premises and also in their homes, so that they can transact some of their business in their homes.  I hope the Minister will be able to tell us that the difficulty of getting materials for the installation of telephones has been overcome and that those people who are waiting for telephones will get them at a very early date.</P>
    <P>I am not an art critic, but some people have drawn my attention to the fact that the designs of our stamps are not giving satisfaction.  It is thought that there should be better designs and a better quality of paper.  Now that we are looking forward to a development of our tourist industry we could utilise our stamps for helping in that development if they were better produced. I would also make the suggestion that in the coming years we should pay some tribute to our A.R.P. services by means of our stamps, something that would indicate what these services have done for the past few years.  We know what was done by those services in connection with the North Strand bombing and some tribute should be paid to them, apart from the practical tribute that we hope will be paid to them when they are being disbanded.  In fact what has been done by all our services, the A.R.P. services, the L.S.F., the L.D.F., the Army and our sailors should be commemorated by an issue of stamps.  Do not think for a moment that I would be satisfied that that would be in any way an adequate tribute to these services or that it should be used as an excuse to deprive them of some more practical tribute. One hears that when men are discharged from the Army their overcoats will be taken from them.</P>

      <P>I should like to appeal to the Minister to give consideration to the question of the wages paid to girls who are recruited for sub-post offices in the rural districts.  I understand that these girls come in as learners for a period.  I find that they work from 8 o'clock in the morning until 6 o'clock in the evening and that they receive the large sum of 10/- per week in wages.  I am open to contradiction by the Minister, but that is what I am led to believe.  I think that is very wrong.  I have no complaint to make so far as the working of the service is concerned. During the emergency we had to tighten up in many ways and I think things worked out very well.  I do not agree with Deputy Flanagan that we should prevent people who carry on a sub-post office at country crossroads from having a little shop as well.  That has been the practice since sub-post offices were established, and I think it has been working fairly well.  I have heard no complaint with regard to it, and I travel round a good deal.  I should like to have Deputy Flanagan's opinion privately on the matter.  He must have found something wrong or he would not complain in the way he did.  I hope the Minister will consider the question of these girls in the sub-post offices to whom I have referred who are recruited from the farming community and the labouring community and are paid only 10/- a week.  Probably they are boarded in these places.</P>

It is hardly fair that they should be expected to toil from 8 o'clock in the morning to 6 o'clock in the evening for a paltry sum of 10/- a week.  I congratulate the Minister <Col N="577" /> on the working of his Department.  I know that he has been working hard and conscientiously, but I hope he will give consideration to the appeal I have made to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>A good deal has been said in connection with delays in telephone trunk calls, and I want to add my voice to the complaints that were made.  Speaking yesterday evening, Deputy Dillon mentioned a call he made from Ballaghaderreen to Dublin City and he said it took 40 minutes before the call came through.  I would like to point out to the Minister that in many cases it takes two hours before a trunk call can be made from Wexford to Dublin.  I think that is absolutely disgraceful.  I have been told there is no direct line between Dublin and Wexford, that the call goes through Kilkenny or Waterford, and that may be responsible for the delay. There are many big businesses in Wexford County; there are many manufacturers there, notably the firm supplying the country with agricultural implements, and I think there should be better telephonic communication between Wexford and Dublin.  It is my experience that invariably it takes two hours to get a telephone call through from Wexford to Dublin or from Enniscorthy or New Ross to Dublin. If it is a fact that the line goes through Kilkenny or Waterford, I think the Minister will admit that that is not fair treatment for Wexford. The people there should have a direct line to the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago I drew attention to the fact that Wexford Post Office is understaffed.  Immediately after that there was an improvement and an additional person was sent there.  But the Wexford Post Office is still understaffed and, coupled with that, the accommodation there is not at all sufficient. The staff in Wexford Post Office are working very hard, but they are unable, on certain days and at certain times in the day, to cope with the amount of business offered.  It must be remembered that in recently years the post office deals with certain new social services, such as children's allowances and coupons, and within the last four or five years a good deal of English <Col N="578" /> money has been passing through the offices.  That takes up a good deal of the time of the post office employees. I should like the Minister to examine the situation in Wexford again.  The staff there are certainly overworked.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said about the payments given to auxiliary postmen. Here also I want to add my voice to what has been said.  Yesterday evening Deputy Dillon stated that, so far as he knew, the reason was that these people were not subject to being transferred from one place to another.  I do not know if that is the reason, but admitting it to be the case, I suggest that the difference between a permanent and an auxiliary postman is altogether too great.  These men have to work very hard.  In most cases, perhaps not in all cases, they have to use bicycles.  During the emergency it was extremely difficult to get parts for bicycles.  It has been most difficult to get tyres and the probability is that some had to pay more for a tyre than they should have paid&mdash;more than the permitted price of the article.  Something should be done to relieve the burden on those people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton dealt with the gratuities paid to auxiliary postmen.  I understand the position is that only in certain cases is there a gratuity paid when an auxiliary postman leaves the service.  The gratuity or pension is not given unless the Minister is satisfied that there are necessitous circumstances.  If there is a certain amount of money going into the house the Minister, in his wisdom or otherwise, decides that the retiring auxiliary postman will not get a gratuity. I do not think that is fair.  I think a man who has given service over a long period of years should get sympathetic consideration.  All these men should be treated alike.  It might be that at the time a man leaves the service the Minister would intervene and prevent that man from getting a gratuity or pension, but three weeks later the man's position might have disimproved considerably.  I think that every auxiliary postman who has given definite service should be treated reasonably.  I should like to have the Minister's views on that matter. Perhaps he will pay special attention <Col N="579" /> to the desirability of a direct telephone line from Wexford to Dublin and deal also with the understaffing in Wexford Post Office and the lack of accommodation there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to postal deliveries in Mayo.  No doubt he is aware, through the representations that I have made to his secretary, that many areas in North and South Mayo have only three deliveries in the week.  From my own experience I can say that there is a delivery on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.  There are no deliveries on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.  Friday being the last delivery day of the week, the people have to go without deliveries on Saturday and Sunday and, if Monday is a bank holiday, there is no delivery that day either.  Tuesday is also a nondelivery day and so the people in Mayo have to wait for the delivery of their mail until Wednesday.  That means that for four days there are no postal deliveries.</P>
      <P>The people who live in the rural areas are just as much entitled to a daily delivery as are the people who live in large town or cities.  They are citizens, they are paying rates and taxes, and they are certainly entitled to consideration.  Admittedly it will cost more to give them a six-day service, but we must not look at the cost; we must look at the fact that all the people there are ratepayers and taxpayers and they are entitled to an equal service with other sections of the community so far as postal deliveries are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another factor in support of this point is that in the Swinford area a large proportion of young and middle-aged men travel to England to work there from May till September, During that period there is a very heavy mail in that area and many telegrams and money orders pass through and the postal services are not sufficient to meet the requirements of the people. Perhaps the Minister will inquire into this matter and see if something can be done.  I know there are difficulties in the way and it means increased expenditure, but if there is any possible <Col N="580" /> way in which to solve the problem it ought to be solved and I ask the Minister seriously to consider the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan and Deputy Carter referred to sub-post offices and inefficiency in the postal services.  There is a certain amount of inefficiency in some sub-offices in County Mayo. While I do not object to the selling of tea, sugar, tobacco, candles and other articles which may help the owner, I do suggest that, now that many changes are taking place and new hands are taking over the administration of these sub-offices, the Department should be very careful to see that the persons appointed are equipped with a certain amount of knowledge and understand the post office business fully.  I know places where there was complete disorganisation, where it was not surprising to see registered letters thrown on the ground, 5/- or 6/- worth of stamps stuck to the bottom of the official's shoes, money orders scattered about and everything completely upset, with the telephone ringing and nobody to answer it or capable of answering it.  I do not blame the Minister, as Deputies and other influential people are constantly approached and asked to make representations to the Minister on behalf of certain persons and they, being weaklings, go to the Minister and try to get him to consider certain persons, never taking into account their ability to administer a sub-post office.</P>
    <P>When there is a change-over and a new person is appointed, the Minister should send down one of his servants from Dublin who understands the administration of sub-offices, to ensure that the person who takes over is quite capable, so that in a case of emergency, when the girl or boy he or she employs leaves without notice, or with short notice, he will be able to step in and continue the business until someone else is obtained. Through pressure from Deputies and others, the Minister may be tempted not to consider the ability of applicants and it may be pointed out to him that he can get so-and-so to carry out the administration.  That may be all very well at first, but the day may <Col N="581" /> come when that person walks out and the whole post office business is left with no one to look after it, while people are queuing up for pensions and the official is all excited, with the telephone ringing and people in a state of nerves and wondering if the inspector is going to walk in.  I am not suggesting that there is political influence, but apart from any political influence in any quarter of this House I ask the Minister to insist on efficiency.  I do not expect him to go down himself, but he has a staff that can make careful investigations.</P>
    <P>I understand there will be some changes in certain sub-offices in Mayo in the near future, and I know that I and other members from the county I have the honour to represent have made representations by letter.  But let that not interfere in any way with the Minister's appointments.  Let him take into consideration the efficiency and knowledge of the applicant in the administration of a post office.</P>
    <P>Regarding the delivery of telegrams, in the little town close to which I live there is no one to deliver a telegram. There is an old man of between 60 and 70 years of age, who starts out in the morning and who stands for a conversation with everyone he meets on the road.  If he is asked in for a cup of tea, he goes, and it may be later in the afternoon or even up to 12 midnight before the telegram is delivered. Be it urgent or otherwise, it makes no difference, as the man does not even know what a telegram means, the importance attached to it, or the difference between it and a letter.  That is the type of man employed for the delivery of telegrams.</P>
    <P>Regarding the postmen, I understand that certain postmen are not supplied with State bicycles for their work, but use their own ones in the delivery of the post.  Sometimes, when a man falls sick, a temporary man is selected in his place for a week or two.  That man may have no bicycle or no tyres.  I have received information that, in some cases, the auxiliary postman who is sick has been requested to place at the disposal of the temporary man the bicycle which <Col N="582" /> is his own property.  I do not know if there is any regulation providing for that, and I cannot imagine there would be, but I would consider it very unfair if an auxiliary postman who fell sick and who had purchased his own bicycle should be asked to hand it over to some Johnny or Jimmy who was taking his place for a few days or a week or two and who may abuse it, take it to his home, let his son use it to visit dance-halls two or three times in the week and, perhaps, let it be stolen.  I do not blame the Minister or his staff.  Certain pressure was brought to bear on a postman in my area and it was only when it was threatened that representations would be made to the union that the pressure was relieved and the bicycle, which had been handed over to the temporary man, was taken off him again after a day or two.</P>
    <P>In regard to winter clothing for postmen, I know there are difficulties due to the war, but now that hostilities have ceased I hope the Minister will make every effort to fit out the postmen properly for the coming winter with the necessary protection, so that they will not be in danger of losing their health.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputies complaining about the telephone service.  There is reason for that complaint.  On a few occasions, I have called the City of Dublin and, instead of waiting for the 40 minutes that Deputy Dillon mentioned, I have on occasions to wait for an hour and a half, or even two hours, and on some occasions I have had to cancel the call owing to the long delay. The same applies to short calls.  The town of Swinford is only seven miles from where I live, but I have often waited for an hour for a call and sometimes have had to give it up, as I would have cycled there and back in the time.  Whether it is the exchange that is at fault or not I do not know, but I would ask that the matter be examined, so that we may get a better service in the post-war period.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would ask the Minister, in all sincerity, to give careful attention to the postal deliveries and see if it would be possible to have a six-day delivery for our rural areas.  I <Col N="583" /> know it is a point that has been raised before, but it is my duty to keep pressing it and begging for it, in the hope that we may achieve what we believe is our just right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the emergency is rapidly passing, a lot of us look forward to many improvements. In regard to delays in telephone calls, I can quite understand the difficulty. The use of the telephone is increasing year after year and, naturally, during the emergency there was not sufficient equipment to provide extra lines to meet those growing demands.  I would like to see established, as soon as the equipment and material become available, when the emergency has passed, an extension of telephones to rural districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that I, and others before me, have brought to the attention of the Minister's Department that there should be an extension of the telephone service in connection with areas which are ten or 12 miles away from the nearest telephone office.  I hope that that situation will be remedied, because in some of the backward areas in the country&mdash;I can certainly speak for my own constituency&mdash;people have suffered great loss from the lack of a telephone service.  Some of these people have come to realise the great advantage of such a service because, during the emergency period, telephone services were established in the Gárda Síochána barracks to which the people could go, and they have come to realise the necessity for such a service, such as in the case of a call for a doctor where, if they had not been provided with such facilities, it might have resulted in death.  Apart from that, however, there are many other uses for a telephone service in the rural areas, and I would press on the Minister that, the moment the emergency has passed, telephone services should be provided in the rural areas and provision made for a linking-up of such services.  I would also suggest that where post offices in rural areas are four or five miles apart, a roadside kiosk should be set up midway between these post offices.  I do not think that would involve a great deal <Col N="584" /> of expense, particularly where telephone lines already exist, and I am sure that it would pay for itself in a short space of time.</P>
    <P>There is only one other point to which I wish to draw attention, and that is that rural or auxiliary postmen do not receive any kind of gratuity or pension when they retire. These people endure a very rough kind of life.  They have to walk or cycle many miles a day, and spend many years in the service, and the only gratuity or pension they receive when they retire is the old age pension.  It may be said, of course, that many of these people have some other means of livelihood, but I think it will be admitted that in the case of most of these people they cannot pay very much attention to their other business, whether it may be a little shop or a small farm, so long as they are attending to the business of the post office.  Such a man can pay very little attention to his business while he is attending to his duties as a postman, and I think it is unfair that, after he has rendered a lifetime of service to the community, he should not get some form of pension or gratuity when he reaches the age of retirement.</P>
    <P>The same applies to sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses all over the country.  They have a pretty exacting and even a nerve-racking life, if you like.  I know that they finish up at a certain hour of the day, but very often they have to work far into the night making up their accounts, and, for that reason, I think that such people should be more fairly dealt with than they have been up to this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a matter of common knowledge that the salaries of Post Office officials, which were scandalously low, have been improved as a result of the activities of the trade unions and, I admit, of the Minister, and that there has been some improvement in that regard.  As a result of such activities, I think that part-time employment amongst Post Office officials has been abolished in the City of Dublin and in other parts of the country as well.  I presume that <Col N="585" /> the Minister, in speaking of this, is addressing himself to other parts of the country, but there is one aspect of this question in which I am particularly interested, and that is the scandalously low rate of pay so far as certain grades and categories are concerned in the matter of incremental increases.  I think the Minister will agree that, in the case of some of the officials, the increments are at the rate of 1/- or 2/- a week, and that it would take them more than ten years before they reached their maximum, and I am sure he will also realise that an increase of 1/- or 2/- a week bears no relation to the present cost or conditions of living.  The amount which the official concerned receives each year, by way of an increase, is infinitesimal, and it certainly is no inducement to that officer to give the best service that he can.  I would urge the Minister to remove this disability, since it is a cause of disaffection and, obviously, is no incentive to the individual concerned to do his work in a proper way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection, I might mention what has been done by another body of which I am a member and which might be regarded as a commercial concern.  I am referring to the Port and Docks Board.  They have taken certain action in the case of young men who have reached the age of 26 and who might be presumed to be contemplating marriage.  I am glad to say that the Port and Docks Board, a few years ago, to deal with this matter of the scales of salary and increments in a different way from what had operated in previous years, from the point of view of marriage.  The yearly scale of increments had been £10 a year, but they considered that a young man, bringing upon himself the responsibilities of marriage, should be in a position, because of his employment, to undertake these responsibilities, and they actually stepped-up the increments so far as that individual was concerned from £10 to £25 for five years.  That meant that these men got £140 where, previously, they only got £40.  I am just putting this forward as a headline in this respect.  That is the only point I want to make so far as wages and salaries are concerned, <Col N="586" /> because it is important so far as the lower-paid people are concerned.</P>
    <P>With regard to telephones, I am glad to see that the telephone is expanding in the way it is, because I think it is one of the most important of the functions of the post office, but I should like to draw attention to the inadequacy of that service in the country and particularly in the Dublin area.  In this respect I want to plead with him for an extension of the kiosk system.  Up to now the Minister has explained that it was not possible because of lack of certain materials. I do not know whether that material is cable or coin boxes.</P>

      <P>I understand that these coin boxes are manufactured outside this country, and I wonder if he has explored the possibility of having them produced in this country, but in any case he and his officers, I am sure, are aware that to get into any of these kiosks in the central city area at almost any hour up to midnight, it is necessary to get into a queue.  It even extends to the suburban areas. The extension of the kiosk system in Dublin is urgent, and while the full complement of apparatus may not be available, in view of the fact that the kiosk is a simple construction, he should at least give an indication of his post-emergency plans by setting up these kiosks.  They are, as I say, simple constructions and the materials for building them are available here. Advance planning in that respect would give a considerable amount of employment which would greatly be appreciated in the city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The points I intended to raise have been more or less dealt with by other Deputies.  One is the position in outlying mountainous districts such as those in my constituency. There are certain areas which are anything from five to seven miles distant from a post office with telephone facilities, and the Minister can visualise cases arising from time to time in which the services of the local clergy, priest or minister, and the local medical officer are urgently required.  If <Col N="587" /> people are lucky enough to have bicycles with tyres, they can cycle&mdash; they surely have no cars&mdash;but generally they have to drive in a horse and car to the point at which they can contact a clergyman or a medical officer.  I have in mind two or three districts in my constituency where such a position obtains at the moment.  I have been in correspondence with the Minister in regard to them, and I take this opportunity of thanking him for his promise that, when materials become available, he will look into the matter.</P>
      <P>The second matter is the time involved in getting calls through to Dublin from certain rural areas.  In the small village in which I reside, not occasionally but generally, I have to wait and hour and a half to an hour and threequarters to get a call through to Dublin, and on a few occasions it has happened that, having waited so long, having waited until two or three minutes to 1 o'clock in the hope of getting the call through before the lunch hour, I have had to cancel the call and lose an hour and a half of my time.  In addition, it is not pleasant to have to stand around waiting in this fashion during the winter.  I made inquiries as to the reason and have been informed that it is due to the fact that there is only a single line available.</P>
      <P>When telephonic communication was established in the first instance in that village, that single line was probably able to carry all the traffic, but since the emergency arose it has certainly not been able to carry the traffic.  A number of people in the area have had telephones installed and, in addition, the L.D.F. headquarters are in the village, and the Minister has evidence in his finances of the number of calls put through by the L.D.F.  Further, there is a particular business concern &mdash;I hope I am right in saying this&mdash; which, I understand, has a monopoly of the 'phone calls from that village, due to the fact that they put through a number of calls early in the morning. I am delighted to see such a business concern in the village, but I think the public should be considered and that we should all get a fair deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to take <Col N="588" /> steps, immediately, supplies become available, to have the necessary changes made in that telephone line &mdash;presumably two lines would be required&mdash;and thereby relieve the public of the necessity of standing for an hour or an hour and a half in a small post office waiting to get a call through and perhaps, after waiting, having to cancel the call.  Deputy M. O'Sullivan drew the Minister's attention to the inadequacy of telephone facilities in the city and made a special appeal to the Minister to provide better facilities when supplies become available.  I do not know whether he used the word &ldquo;priority&rdquo;, but I suggest to the Minister that he should give the citizens of Dublin the go-by for the time being and provide the necessary facilities for the people in rural districts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in his opening statement, referred to the fact that on the telegraph service there had been a deficit.  I want to refer now to what has become a hardy annual on this Estimate, and that is the cost of the delivery of telegrams in rural areas.  In this modern age the people who, as Deputy Brennan said, live in out of the way rural districts are certainly entitled to the same consideration as those who live in the big centres of population.  In many rural districts there is a postal delivery only two or three days a week, so that it frequently happens, when their business or other friends are obliged to send them telegrams, a porterage fee has to be paid by people in rural areas on the delivery of the telegrams at their houses.  My point is that, if there is a credit balance on the telephone and postal services, there should be a pooling of the income and all citizens should be treated alike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, surely, unfair that people living in remote rural districts who are helping to maintain the State by the payment of rates and taxes just in the same way as the people in the cities, should be denied the privileges which those who live in cities enjoy.  The same services should be provided for all the citizens.  It is an obsolete arrangement to make a porterage charge on a person in a rural area who <Col N="589" /> happens to live a mile outside the post office limit when a telegram is delivered to him.  The charge, I admit, is only 3d. a mile for every mile outside the limit, but still it can be a fairly substantial amount when the receiver of the telegram resides seven, eight or ten miles from the nearest post office.  This porterage charge, so far as it applies in the rural districts, should be wiped out, and whatever deficit arises on that end of the service should be met out of the excess of income on other branches of the service.  It is time that something was done to remedy that situation.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have referred to the delays that take place in the case of trunk calls in the country.  I hope that the Minister and his Department are planning for the future on the basis that, so far as the country is concerned, the trunk telephone services are not only obsolete but incapable of carrying the amount of business that is there at the moment, not to speak of the added business that will be offered when the emergency is over and supplies become available.  Judging by present trends, there is not a house in the rural areas that will not have the telephone installed within the next 12 years.  That, in my opinion, is the tendency, and the post office should plan to meet that situation.  In every small and large town in the County Wexford complaints are continually being made about the delays that take place in connection with telephone calls, due to crowding in the amount of business to be done, and the inadequacy of the service.  So far as the post office officials are concerned, I want to pay a tribute to them for their courtesy to the public. I know, of course, that irate callers are abusing them day in and day out. They do that when they have to wait an hour or an hour and a half before they can put calls through.  But, so far as the officials are concerned, they show great patience and it is my desire to pay a tribute to them for their courtesy.  They have got a good training and they belong to a good service.  I hope that, when the emergency is over and supplies of materials become available, the Minister and his Department will take steps to provide <Col N="590" /> an adequate telephone service, and thereby obviate the making of complaints.</P>
    <P>With regard to the position of sub-postmistresses in small offices through the country, I suggest to the Minister that he should change his policy.  I understand the position to be somewhat like this.  There is a certain salary or income allowed to a sub-postmistress. If she happens to die, a reduced income is paid by the Department to her successor.  Why that is done I do not know.  It seems both unfair and unreasonable because, as we all know, the business in these sub-post offices has increased in late years and is increasing.  The number of letters to be dealt with is increasing and the same applies to telephone calls and the amount of money order business to be done.  Therefore, I submit to the Minister that the incomes of sub-postmistresses should be increased and not reduced.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his opening statement, indicated that it is proposed to extend the telephone service everywhere there is a post office.  I hope, so far as the rural areas are concerned, that will be one of the first works undertaken by the Department when supplies of material become available. We all know that the telephone service in the City of Dublin is perfect.  There is never a delay of more than two or three minutes, but the telephone service in the country is at least 100 years behind when compared with Dublin. The policy of the Department, so far as the future is concerned, should be to cater for the rural areas, so that every house in the country can be linked up with the telephone service. Unless the Department does that it will not be giving to the rural community the services that the people are entitled to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister able to tell the House what are the prospects during the next 12 months with regard to supplies becoming available? His Estimate does not give any hope of substantial supplies being forthcoming within the next 12 months. We all know that there are many people waiting to install the telephone. It would save Deputies a lot of trouble <Col N="591" /> if the Minister were able to tell the House now what the position is likely to be, and whether there is any hope of people being able to get the telephone installed, except in very particular cases.  The complaints made about long delays in getting telephone calls through in the rural areas are, to my knowledge, well founded.  It seems to me that the explanation for that is that during the emergency period the services&mdash;the Army, coast-watching stations, etc.&mdash;had a priority claim with regard to the use of the telephone lines.  Now that the emergency has disappeared, I suggest to the Minister that the appropriate authority should at once issue an instruction to the effect that these priority rights should also disappear. My reason for saying that is that when I go to the country I find that great delays occur, for example, in getting an ambulance to take an urgent case to a district hospital.  Take, for example, a county where you have two or three district hospitals.  The ambulance is at one of them.  It may happen that it is required at one of the other district hospitals, which may be 20 or 30 miles distant, to take an urgent case to hospital.  It often happens that a delay of from one to three hours may occur before the call for the ambulance can be put through.  I think it is shocking, especially when there was no immediate danger to the country, when there was no invasion and no attempt at invasion, and when calls were being made for an ambulance to take people to hospital, that the services I have referred to should have priority rights over the telephone lines. It is bad enough for the layman to have to wait an hour or an hour and a half before he can get a call through, but that delays should occur in getting an ambulance is, as I have said, shocking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good deal of wire and instruments were laid on to huts for the coast-watching services.  I think there is a huge lot of that material around.  I suggest that the Minister should dismantle these huts immediately, and utilise the wire and instruments to meet some of the many applications <Col N="592" /> lodged for the installation of the telephone service to private houses.  I take it that the wire and instruments are modern enough to be used for such a purpose.  I do not want to be complaining. There is no use in decrying what has happened.  There should be exceptions in certain cases in respect of these priority calls.  We should not have this stone-wall obstruction on the ground of priority when there was really no necessity for priority. However, that is past now.</P>
    <P>For reasons of which I am not aware, a very early dispatch of mails was introduced, so far as the rural areas were concerned, during last winter.  Apparently, the instructions were that, as soon as the mails arrived at a village or town, the Post Office officials and postmen were to have them delivered throughout the country districts.  Postmen were going to out-of-the-way places at 7 o'clock in the morning when there was not a Christian about, while, here in Dublin, our letters were not delivered until 9 o'clock.  I wrote the Minister about the matter some time during the winter and got an acknowledgment, stating that the matter would be inquired into, but I heard no more about it since.  If, for transport reasons, letters have to be sent out early, it should be easy to adjust matters to meet the convenience of the public.  When the letters are delivered at the post office, they should be allowed to lie until 9 o'clock or such time as the small shop which serves as the post office opens.  They could then be sorted and delivered.</P>
    <P>I have frequently referred to the payment of sub-postmasters and I do not believe in flogging a dead horse. Apparently, it is utterly impossible to imbue the Minister with any sympathy in respect of these officials.  In every walk of life and in every kind of employment, when people render good service, they should get reasonable remuneration.  That is sound policy and policy which pays.  I leave the matter there for the time being.</P>
    <P>Complaints were made here as to the character of the buildings and the equipment of the post offices.  Perhaps <Col N="593" /> some of those complaints were overstated but there was a good deal of substance in others.  A great campaign against tuberculosis is being waged at present and it is hoped, by the means adopted, to mitigate the disease.  But, when you enter a post office to buy a few stamps, they are thrown down on the counter where goods have been resting, where baskets have been placed, perhaps having previously been left on the ground on the way into the post office, and the customer has got to lick those stamps and attach them to the letters. That is an abominable practice.  It is a mere detail but it is very important. When we are endeavouring to deal with an evil, we should regard it as a whole and not have one portion of our effort destroying another.  The Minister should, as soon as possible, procure a supply of sponges in containers, send them to each post office and insist that they be available to customers and not hidden away in some corner. There is nothing more repellent than the present practice of throwing stamps on a counter on which eggs, butter, scraps of paper and other things have been previously placed.</P>
    <P>A very important duty devolves on the Minister with regard to the extension of the telephone.  That is a matter on which a broad view should be taken when material becomes available. The material may be dear for the first year or two and thousands of people may be waiting for telephone installations.  I suggest to the Minister that, instead of charging the increased cost of the materials to the early applicants, he should work out the probable cost during about five years after the war and charge the applicants during the first year only the average amount.  It would be rather unjust to people whose names have been in for a couple of years if they were to be charged the full cost of materials during the first year when that cost may be very high.  As regards the complaints that have been made about telephone delay, the Minister would be well advised to put his ear to the ground and see if he can tighten up things.  He should see that priority calls now disappear and that other delays be avoided.  If these <Col N="594" /> delays become chronic, it will operate against the popularity of the telephone service.  People will not go to the post office to make a call if they know that there will be a long delay.  That is bound to react on the development of the service.  As the telephone is now being universally used elsewhere, it would be a bad thing if our people were to be discouraged by these long delays.  There is nothing more irritating than to have to stand in a small shop for an hour or an hour-and-a-half waiting for a call while everybody who comes in gapes at you and wonders what you are doing there. A delay of one-and-a-half hours is not unusual, and the Minister should look into the matter and see if things could not be improved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Little)</NameTxt>
      <P>Several speeches which have been made would not, perhaps, have been made if Deputies had either heard or read the statement with which I introduced the Vote.  I am wondering whether it would not be better to make my statement at the end of the debate and let Deputies say what they want to say.  It does not seem to be of much use to give Deputies information at the opening of the debate.  As to the remuneration of sub-postmasters and the small amount of increments and pensions, all these matters involve heavy expenditure.  It is a mistake to think that there is a big surplus in the Post Office.  For the year 1943-44 there was a net surplus of £288,639.  It is estimated that for the financial year 1944-45&mdash;of course our commercial accounts are not completed yet&mdash;that the surplus will be only £89,000.  It should be remembered that the Government services provide about one-fifth of the postal revenue, one-eight of the telegraph revenue and one-seventh of the telephone revenue. That roughly would take away the surplus.  Any one of the increases which were asked for would have then made a deficit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering what policy we should adopt with reference to the whole postal service, we shall have to decide whether we are going to impose taxation to give a better service because that is really the issue.  I <Col N="595" /> have an open mind on the subject but at least the public should face the realities of the situation and realise that any reduction in the surplus will have to be paid out of taxation of some form or another.  I have a great deal of sympathy with the demands made.  I have received a deputation of sub-postmasters which was introduced by Deputy O'Reilly.  I went into the question very carefully and I have it still under examination.  There are these other questions which have been raised as well but we must have regard to the fact that there is a standstill Order which makes it very difficult to lift the lid on any of these demands because if we do, it will lead to a spate of demands and create a condition of economic disorder which will leave us the victims of a vicious circle.</P>

If I had to consider only my own Department I might adopt a certain attitude but I am also a member of the Government and I have to look at the difficulties which the Government are up against.  I am in great hopes that with a decrease in expenditure in other Departments we may be able to deal with the three questions which have been raised&mdash;sub-postmasters, the question of increments raised by Deputy Martin O'Sullivan and the question of the possibility of paying pensions.  That is a matter which I shall take up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is going to be a <Col N="596" /> very difficult matter because it involves, as the Deputy knows, all the classes of unestablished officers.  It will be a colossal problem to solve but, at least, we shall examine it and see if anything can be done, but I make no promise as to whether it will be done.  Deputy Allen, and Deputy Dockrell also, paid a tribute to the courtesy of the postal staff who are acting under very great difficulties at present.  As I pointed out in my opening statement, the position with regard to telephones is that there is a real glut.  We increased the services and made them much more efficient than they had been.  With our new exchange at Exchequer Street, the installation of our automatic exchanges at Crown Alley, Ship Street, Merrion Street, Rathmines, Dun Laoghaire and the experimental rural automatic telephones in Malahide, Rush and one or two other places, we seem to have increased the popularity of the telephone to such an extent that the number of calls has gone up by 2,600,000.  Of course that has created a glut over again.  We have plans made to increase enormously all our telephone services after the war and we hope to double or treble the number of telephones in the country.  These are matters with which I have already dealt.  I do not think I need go over them again, because they were referred to in my opening statements.  As I say, Deputy Allen and Deputy Dockrell paid tribute to the patience and courtesy of our officials and I think it is very much due to them.  I hope that they will remember that they are doing a great national service because you get a reputation, not only throughout this country, but amongst all other countries, if you are able to maintain that standard of courtesy and patience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton raised the question of building not keeping pace with requirements. Of course, that is true.  The increase of business in the Post Office has been enormous.  I think it was Deputy Corish referred to that aspect. If one takes the business carried on in the Post Office ten or 20 years ago and considers the number of new services which have since been added&mdash; children's allowances, various classes of pensions and social services&mdash;it will <Col N="597" /> be realised that they have increased the work to a tremendous extent.  The result is that we have to keep a very close eye, for instance, on the big post offices.  Deputy Dillon referred, in his own extravagant manner, to what we should do in the G.P.O. here in Dublin. As a matter of fact, we keep the G.P.O. in Dublin under very close observation.  Whenever there is a glut of business, at peak hours, we have additional staff ready to take on and we take them away when not required. That situation is watched so closely that we are able to tell how long people have to wait in queues.  A recent observation showed that no one had to wait longer than 2½ minutes. The position, therefore, is not as bad as Deputy Dillon contends.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton asked me about St. Andrew Street Post Office.  The plans for that are being prepared and there will be no difficulty about the plant for that particular office.  The building there is to get priority.  The Exchequer Street position will be improved now because we have removed the cross-channel lines to Crown Alley.  Deputy Norton could not get off Pearse Street Post Office.</P>

      <P>A question was also raised about kiosks, and what we were doing about that matter.  There, again, there is the question of materials and supplies being available, and we are waiting until supplies become available.  The question of the Howth Post Office was also raised, but, as that is a question of an increase in wages, the standstill Order will hold that up.  Again, however, we are examining that question very closely.  The Deputy, probably, has received a letter from my Department with regard to sick pay for Post Office <Col N="599" /> departmental temporary classes.  I am afraid he has stolen my thunder in that regard, but since he has been already communicated with on that matter, and may not yet have received the letter perhaps I may give him the benefit of the letter that he should have already received, which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Temporary full-time classes, who in practice have had no sick pay privileges up to now, will be eligible in the indoor grades &mdash; Post Office clerks, etc.&mdash;for full pay up to a maximum of ten weeks in one year, if over 18 years of age, and for a lesser number of weeks at lower age points.  The subordinate grades &mdash; postmen, etc.&mdash;21 years of age and over, will get two-thirds pay up to a maximum of six weeks in one year.</P>
      <P>(2)  The indoor, unestablished classes, whose existing sick-pay privileges are two-thirds pay up to three months in one year will, in future, be eligible for full pay up to ten weeks, if over 18 years, with a reduced period at the lower age points.</P>
      <P>(3)  The qualifying period of eligibility for sick pay for adult workmen &mdash;skilled workmen, quasi-permanent labourers, packers and porters, etc. &mdash;in the engineering and stores branches will be reduced from two years to one year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Deputy also raised the question of night telephonists.  We are, as the Deputy knows, very strongly opposed to that kind of part-time work and are anxious to get over the problem if it is at all possible to do so, and we would welcome any suggestions from the Deputy if he has any solution that could be made, within reason, for that problem.  Undoubtedly, the difficulty there results from the fact that there is a rush of business at one time and then, later on, little or nothing to do, and we would welcome any suggestion from the Deputy to deal with that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Everett raised the question of the engineer labourers at Dun Laoghaire.  Those people are paid on a consolidated basis and are not entitled to other than an emergency <Col N="600" /> bonus.  That is the practice in the service generally, and Post Office officials cannot be treated exceptionally. The Deputy also raised the question of the use of motor cycles for linesmen going on emergency work. As soon as the emergency is over, the practice of using motor cycles will be adopted again.  The Deputy was quite wrong when he said that night telephonists are asked to sacrifice their rest hours.  That has been stopped altogether.  They are not being asked to sacrifice their night hours of rest.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, we shall look into that matter.  Of course, the Deputy will realise that there may be exceptional circumstances, and that it might be necessary to ask these people to do that work in special circumstances, but, as a general rule, it will not be done, and we should like to have the co-operation of Deputies in regard to that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we are <Col N="601" /> always trying to do.  So many of the points that have been raised have been repeated that I think it is hardly necessary to deal at all with them.  Deputy Hughes mentioned the question of porterage charges on telegrams. He pointed out that these charges are very heavy, in the case of funerals, and so on.  It would be better for the postmaster to keep them and send them out all together.  The fact that the telegraph service is losing money makes it extremely difficult for us to do so, because it means, really, putting a charge on the taxpayer once you get beyond a certain point. Deputy Allen also mentioned that point, but Deputy Allen should remember that the people in the City of Dublin pay very high rates for the services they get.  Deputy Allen does not have to pay 25/- in the £.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is for social services, and not for telephones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I do not want to argue that point with the Deputy. The Government, as the Deputy knows, are very strongly in favour of a policy of decentralisation and are providing such services as they can to rural areas.  But the process will have to be a gradual one and it will have to be carried out in relation to expenditure and taxation.  That is all I can say, but I do not think there is a great deal to be said, because the telegraph service is undoubtedly a service which is decreasing, and perhaps we will get over many of these difficulties when we have a telephone in every post office in the country.  That will probably relieve the situation considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is discrimination against the rural dweller.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  Deputy Bartley raised a question of laying cable to the islands in the west instead of using wireless.  The traffic is very small indeed; it is almost negligible and cable is extremely expensive.  If it were not for the wireless, I do not think we would be able to have any service there at all, so I think we are very lucky to have that service for the <Col N="602" /> islanders.  It is there in case of any real urgent necessity.  Deputy Anthony raised the question of reducing telephone rentals.  That is a very big question and it is one which we are examining very closely.  There again, without making any promises, we intend to go into the matter very carefully in our post-war planning.  Deputy Anthony also mentioned the Cork Post Office.  I have had an opportunity of visiting the post office recently and I saw the conditions there.  We had plans for extending the premises but they were held up by the war and as soon as the opportunity arises we will extend our premises there and we are actually increasing the staff at the counter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Pattison referred to Kilkenny. There too we are actually going to carry out his own suggestion of taking over the premises which are at present occupied by the postmaster. He will be retiring very soon and we will make other arrangements.  In the meantime I would suggest that the public in Kilkenny should use the stamp machines as much as possible for purchasing stamps.  That would give a certain amount of relief to the work at the counter.  The Deputy also raised the question of the protection of parcels of eggs, etc.  We are inquiring into that.  If he would give us the details, we will have the matter examined.  There are certain types of matters raised on this Estimate which it would be better to raise with the officials because in that way they would be much more satisfactorily dealt with.  Deputy Dillon raised a few questions of that sort, which he might have raised privately and he would have got satisfactory answers from the Department.  I do not know what is the matter with the particular telephone that he says keeps on ringing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  Deputy Dillon has a way of not coming in for the statement.  One year he came in for the statement and did not wait for my reply and I felt very annoyed about it because he attacked my officials for not having sufficient supplies, whereas, <Col N="603" /> as a matter of fact, we were extraordinarily good in getting supplies and we have been able, from the beginning of the emergency right through, to have sufficient supplies to carry us through to the end.  The Deputy charged us with all sorts of neglect and stupidity and then he did not wait to hear the answer.  On this Estimate he did not come in for the statement but he came in afterwards and made a lot of points, such as that one about the telephone ringing continuously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>No, except that it is probably due to the storm and to interference in the wires outside but, as the Deputy has not told us where it is and as there is a great deal of repairs always on hand, I cannot locate the particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity he should waste the time of the House on a matter of that sort at all.  Deputy Cafferky raised the question of postal services.  Three-fourths of the postal services are six-day services and all the others are losing services, so there again you are up against spending money on a service which does not bring in any return and which is already a losing service, where there are three-day and two-day posts.  He also raised a question with reference to an individual post office and gave us an amazing picture of stamps on the floor, and that sort of thing.  What he should do, as a good citizen, is to report that immediately so that the matter could be corrected.  If anybody persisted in carrying out the work of a post office badly we would dismiss them and get somebody else, but generally if mistakes are made they can be corrected by drawing the attention of the authorities at once.  The greatest care is taken by the staff, from the local postmaster, who is over <Col N="604" /> the sub-post office, up to headquarters, in examining the credentials or qualifications of the particular person before any post office is filled and we take the greatest care to make sure that the person who gets a post office is competent to carry out the work.  I suppose there are times when one does not get as satisfactory service as one should, but on these occasions, if people will report to us, we will do the best we can to remedy the defect.</P>

      <P>Most of the points are really disposed of on the basis of expenditure.  It is a demand for increased expenditure and there is nothing a Minister would like more than to be able to hand out the money with two hands and to do everything that he is asked to do but the taxpayer has to be considered in measuring these things up, especially at a time when there is such tremendous change from <Col N="605" /> one condition to another, so that all we can do is to promise that we will examine all these applications and go as far as we consider is reasonable.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Vote 62&mdash;Wireless Broadcasting.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £57,063 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1946, for Salaries and other Expenses in connection with Wireless Broadcasting (No. 45 of 1926), including Public Concerts.</P>
      <P>The Estimate for the broadcasting service for the current financial year 1945/46 is £85,663, an increase of £4,970 on the provision for last year.  The main increases are under sub-heads A and F which are up by £2,890 and £1,585 respectively.  The increase under sub-head A is due mainly to the definitive transfer of certain officers to the broadcasting service whose salaries were formerly borne on the Vote for their parent Departments as they were only on loan to broadcasting; to increased bonus payments and additions to the staff.  Under sub-head F an additional sum is provided for engineering equipment of which it is expected that it will be possible to obtain supplies this year.  An increase of £400 under sub-head B is due mainly to increased payments of performing right fees.  Variations under the other sub-heads are of a minor nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Revenue from wireless licences for the financial year ended 31st March <Col N="606" /> last amounted to approximately £107,000 and from advertisements to approximately £3,700&mdash;a total of £110,700.  This represents a decrease of about £600 on the revenue for the previous year, due mainly to a slight falling off in the number of licences held by listeners.</P>
    <P>I estimate that revenue for the current year will be £110,200.  The total expenditure, including expenditure by other Departments on services rendered to broadcasting, is estimated at £114,038.  There is, therefore, a small estimated deficit of £3,838.</P>
    <P>The total number of licences current on 31st March, 1945, was 170,514, which represents a decrease of 1,528 on the figure for the corresponding date in 1944.  With the prospect that more plentiful supplies of batteries and, possibly, wireless sets and parts will become available this year it is likely that the number of licences will shortly be again on the upgrade.</P>
    <P>The Broadcasting Advisory Committee, which was reconstituted early in 1944 has given very valuable assistance and advice in regard to the many questions which have come before it and I am indebted to the members for the great interest they have shown in the work of the committee and the time they have devoted to it.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the Radio Éireann Orchestra, which is the mainstay of our musical programmes, continues to win high approval for its performance of a very wide range of musical works.  The public symphony concerts are proving more popular than ever.  Some years ago, when the concerts were first contemplated, it was believed that an audience of about 600 people was the most that could be expected.  Now we have reached the stage where we have an attendance of 1,800 people at most of the concerts. This continuing and growing interest in symphonic music shows that public taste is on a much higher level than many would have had us believe.  To the conductor and orchestra is due a special tribute for the excellence of their performances which has made the concerts so successful.</P>
    <P>The Radio Éireann Choir of 24 singers, which was established in 1943, is making steady progress and extending <Col N="607" /> its repertoire.  A programme of songs in Irish and English was given monthly last year, and the choir collaborated with the orchestra in a notable performance of the &ldquo;Mozart Twelfth Mass&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Radio Éireann is, as heretofore, doing a great deal to assist and encourage musical organisations outside Dublin and throughout the country.  Where a committee is willing to organise a first-class concert and to engage the best artists available Radio Éireann relays portion of the concert at a specially high fee.  In this way the public in towns outside Dublin are enabled to hear excellent concerts which otherwise could not be provided.</P>
    <P>Special attention is being given to the fostering of Irish music and composers are commissioned to prepare arrangements of traditional Irish airs, etc.</P>
    <P>The more important concerts given in the country during the year were relayed and we hope to continue and extend this practice.</P>
    <P>Our running commentaries on football, hurling, racing and other sports have been continued as usual and have a very large and wide popularity.  The director has been keeping in close touch with the controlling authorities of the Gaelic Athletic Association, of racing and of sports generally, and we hope in the future to be able to arrange for an increase in the number of these broadcasts.</P>
    <P>Our news department has for some time past been at a disadvantage owing to vacancies occurring on the reporting staff which we have not yet found it possible to fill.  A complete reorganisation of our news staff has recently been approved and the Civil Service Commission is making arrangements for the filling of the approved posts.  It is expected that the new staffing arrangements will be completed at an early date.</P>
    <P>As regards the Irish language, our policy prior to last year had been to put before listeners programmes in Irish as interesting and as well produced as the programmes in English &mdash;but not to broadcast formal lessons. <Col N="608" /> For listeners whose Irish was not fluent, special features, including short stories in simple Irish, were provided, and a weekly programme entitled &ldquo;Is Your Irish Rusty?&rdquo; continues to cater for this class.  It consists of the slow reading and translation of passages from short stories and sketches from a set book, an explanation being given of difficult words and phrases.</P>
    <P>During last year much thought was given to the question of making the utmost possible use of radio in the drive for the revival of Irish.  Representatives of most of the bodies directly concerned with the movement had frequent consultations with the Director and staff of Radio Éireann and, after full discussion by the Broadcasting Advisory Committee, it was decided to broadcast a series of direct lessons for beginners or for those with little knowledge of Irish.  The teaching of a language by radio is, of course, no easy task and in preparation for this particular series, the Broadcasting Advisory Committee and the Department of Education collaborated with the station in determining the form of the instruction.  The lessons called &ldquo;Listen and Learn&rdquo; began on Friday, 2nd March, 1945, and have been an outstanding success from the outset.  We have evidence that they are being listened to with close attention all over the country by all classes of people and are, indeed, competing with &ldquo;Question Time&rdquo; for the position of the most popular programme from Radio Éireann.  I am confident that the lessons will greatly assist many people to learn Irish who, for one reason or another, had not had an opportunity of doing so and were reluctant to attend formal classes.  I might repeat, however, that the teaching or the learning of a language over the radio is a most difficult task and suggest that, where classes are available, listeners should supplement the broadcast lessons by attending them.</P>
    <P>The principal regular features of Radio Éireann&mdash;&ldquo;Question Time,&rdquo;&ldquo;Information Please,&rdquo;&ldquo;Radio Digest,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Round the Fire&rdquo;&mdash;continue to earn wide approval.  Among programmes in Irish, &ldquo;An Treimhseachan Teann,&rdquo; which is the counterpart of the <Col N="609" />&ldquo;Radio Digest&rdquo;, is specially popular, while the recently started &ldquo;Ceist agam ort,&rdquo; a programme resembling &ldquo;Information Please,&rdquo; appears to be going very well.</P>
    <P>The plays broadcast in 1944 included works by representative Irish dramatists as well as some by foreign authors. The Abbey and Longford Players again presented a number of plays on Sunday evenings which were much appreciated by listeners.  There were numerous dramatisations of the lives of outstanding figures in Irish history including Edmund Ignatius Rice, Patrick Pearse, Jonathan Swift and one to mark the third centenary of The Four Masters.</P>
    <P>In introducing the Broadcasting Estimate last year I remarked on the number of helpful letters received by the Director of Broadcasting from listeners who had constructive criticism and suggestions to offer.  The number of such letters is growing and they are of great assistance to the Director and Programme Officers in assessing public interest in various types of programmes. The director welcomes such letters and every criticism and suggestion put forward in them receives careful consideration.</P>
    <P>It is obviously impossible to discuss programme features here in any detail and I would ask Deputies, therefore, with a view to a constructive debate, to confine their remarks, so far as possible, to the broad principles which Radio Éireann is following.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not very much to say on this Vote.  There are just one or two points to which I should like to call the Minister's attention. I think it can be said that, in certain respects, the programme from Radio Éireann has improved and is continuing to improve.  I agree with the Minister that the concerts, and I would say in particular, the plays are excellent. The music is occasionally good too.  I should like if the Minister would tell the House exactly how the news items are obtained.  The Minister told us that there are difficulties at the moment owing to vacancies on the reporting staff.  It appears to me that the news we get is merely a repetition of the B.B.C. to a very great extent. If we are paying reporters for news <Col N="610" /> items, I do not think they serve very much purpose because what we get is a repetition of the B.B.C.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing I want to draw the Minister's attention to is that there was a very useful item introduced five or six years ago into the programme here, namely, talks on agriculture.  When we bear in mind that our main activity in this country is agriculture and, particularly, when we appreciate the importance of expanding our production and the fact that the Minister for Supplies has directed our attention to the necessity of ensuring that we expand production and exports for exchange purposes, I think that the radio is an instrument that could be used from an educational point of view to a far greater extent.  No improvement has been effected in that particular item.  There are many eminent scientists and research workers here whom I have never heard speak over the wireless.  Some of the broadcasts on that particular item have not been very satisfactory.  I should like to say to the Minister that the people living in rural Ireland, especially during the winter period, have not many distractions so far as pictures and that kind of thing are concerned and, in catering for the agricultural community by way of agricultural talks, you are catering for a substantial percentage of the listeners and, nationally, you are doing very good work if talks on that all-important matter are properly prepared and the right type of people called to the microphone.  I want to say emphatically that there is room for very substantial improvement there.  I do not want to elaborate very much on the matter, and I am sure the Minister and the Government appreciate as much as I do that it ought to be used much more and that the subject matter ought to be presented in such a manner that it will be attractive and will be listened to.  I can assure the Minister that it would be listened to with great attention if the right people were brought in, men of authority and men who can give very useful and practical information and disseminate knowledge in a very simple way by the use of the radio.  As I said, certain items in the programme have improved substantially; they were very pleasant <Col N="611" /> to listen in to.  But in this particular respect there has not been any improvement. I believe there is room for improvement.  Certainly there is a great opportunity for utilising the radio more for the advantage of our primary industry.  I hope the Minister will pay personal attention to that matter, get a proper programme out and get the right people, people whose advice every one can accept without question.  As I said before, we have research workers and scientists who have kept abreast of the times, but I must say I have never heard them over the air.  I hope more attention will be paid to that and that a greater effort will be made to improve that particular item on the programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to congratulate the Minister on the improvement that has taken place in Radio Éireann in the last 12 months.  The Minister has referred at length to the presentation of symphony concerts.  They have certainly raised the tone of the station and given our people a taste for decent music.  I welcome the fact that they have cut out a lot of the jazz music from Continental countries and from America, because that was ruining our people's taste for music.  If that had been continued, certainly we would have had very few decent musicians or singers in this country within a very short period.  As I said, the symphony concerts are certainly very interesting, occurring as they do in the winter months when people are at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I want to refer to a matter that I have been referring to for a number of years, namely, the question of news, especially during the emergency. I want to emphasise what Deputy Hughes has said.  During the whole war period we have had nothing but a rehash of the English news on the war.  If we want to hear news of the war, we get it at 6 o'clock from the B.B.C.  At 6.40 we tune into Radio Éireann and get the very same news that we got from the English station 40 minutes before.  If there is any interesting Irish news, we have to wait <Col N="612" /> until the English news is sent through before we can hear the Irish news. Surely if it is necessary to let us have a rehash of what we heard from the British station, the least we might expect is that the Irish news should be given first.  I really think that that ought to be the policy of the Minister and that it ought not to be necessary for any Deputy to prompt the Minister to let us have the Irish news through the medium of our own station at the beginning of the news.  As a matter of fact, recently we have had no Irish news at all.  One wonders, when the war is completely over, including the Japanese War, what news we will get through the medium of Radio Éireann.  Surely there are some interesting items that could be given to the Irish people through the medium of our own radio.  Now that the war in Europe is over, what news are they going to give to the people here?</P>
    <P>Again referring to the question of news&mdash;I have referred to this every year for a considerable time&mdash;when we do get Irish news, almost invariably the first thing we hear on the radio is: An Taoiseach said this and An Taoiseach said that; or the Minister for Industry and Commerce said this, or the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that.  Surely it is not too much to ask that, when a Deputy puts a question to a Minister or to An Taoiseach in this House, that person's name should be given.  We hear it stated that the Minister for Agriculture made a statement with regard to so-and-so.  Nobody knows that that was in reply to a question asked by a Deputy.  That Deputy's constituents are entitled to know that he put a particular question to a Minister and that the Minister did not make the statement in the Dáil on his own.  I think it is only fair that the Minister should see that that is done in future.  I must say that within the last year Deputies have got a pretty fair show in the reports from Radio Éireann in so far as the proceedings of this House are concerned, but I would urge strongly that the Minister should see to it that, when a Deputy asks a question in the Dáil, he shall get the credit for asking that question and that all the kudos, <Col N="613" /> if there is any kudos in it, will not be given to the Minister who answers the question and who would not have made such a statement only for the fact that a Deputy asked the question.  I do not think there is anything unreasonable in asking that that should be done.</P>
    <P>For years I have been asking what will be done about the Wexford area. The Minister was good enough to send an inspector there on two occasions. On the last occasion he told me that nothing could be done.  The reception there is absolutely terrible, particularly on Sunday nights: &ldquo;Question Time&rdquo; is a feature in which everybody is interested.  It is an outstanding feature, so far as Radio Éireann is concerned, but it is absolutely impossible to get it in Wexford town on Sunday nights.  The Minister told me on other occasions that when the war was over something might be done. Now that the war is over I trust he will not forget his promise and that something will be done to enable Wexford people to get the worth of their money.  &ldquo;Question Time&rdquo; is interesting and we would like to hear it, but at the present time it is impossible to hear it.  I do not know why it is, but on Sunday nights the reception is worse than ever.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to what I might term a hardy annual.  There is at the head of Radio Éireann a Gaelic footballer, a good Gaelic footballer.  I have pressed time and again for a longer period than ten minutes to be given to Seán O Ceallacháin.  Anybody interested in Gaelic sports, in football and hurling, will notice that there is a terrible rush in the results given by Seán O Ceallacháin at 10.50 on Sunday nights and it is obvious that he is most anxious to make comments on the games played during the day. Owing to the short time at his disposal it is impossible for him to do so.  I know the people over the greater part of Ireland are interested in our national games and I think it is very unfair to confine Seán O Ceallacháin to ten minutes.  It is impossible in that short time to do justice to the games played that day.  Surely it is not too much to ask that during the Gaelic season, from Easter to the end of <Col N="614" /> September, a little more time should be given to Seán O Ceallacháin to give the results of Gaelic games and make comments on the play.  I expect the present Director, who was a great Gaelic player himself, will endeavour to secure that a good deal more time will be allowed in order to have comments on Gaelic games.</P>
    <P>While the station appears to be going on well, I notice that very low wages are paid to some of the people employed there.  I see that a skilled workman at the Cork station is paid 32/- a week.  I wonder what particular kind of skill that man has if he is worth only 32/- a week.  According to the information supplied us, that workman has increments which will bring him eventually to 42/-, but even that amount is an absolutely disgraceful wage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In what way is this man skilled?  A carpenter or a bricklayer at the present moment has very nearly £4 a week, without any bonus at all. When we talk about a bonus we usually visualise a time when the Government will endeavour to reduce that bonus.  I say that that skilled workman has an absolutely rotten wage.  Then, again, there is a messenger boy employed at 7/- a week. I think it is terrible for a Government to ask anybody to work for 7/- a week at the present time.  I do not know how the Minister could justify a wage of that kind.  Something should be done to remedy that position.  People will think very little of a Government Department that will pay a boy only 7/- a week.  I hope the Minister will deal with the points I have raised and in the near future will do something in order to adjust them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a disposition in this country to deride certain <Col N="615" /> of our national institutions.  I think I am correct in saying that the Broadcasting Station comes in for its due share of caustic criticism.  Perhaps one reason for that is that we are inclined to judge our Broadcasting Station <i>vis-a-vis</i> the British Broadcasting Corporation.  That is not entirely fair, having regard to the resources of the British Broadcasting Corporation.  I am not saying that our station is perfect.  It is far from that, but having regard to all the conditions that surround it, it is doing reasonably good work.</P>
      <P>One of the grievances that have been given expression to by Deputy Corish is one that I, too, had in mind. That is what could be described as an abuse of the radio, particularly on a Sunday evening, by the reading of the full text of a Minister's speech.  On Sunday evenings, as a rule, listeners like to enjoy radio entertainment in the quietness of their homes and they have little desire to hear Minister's speeches.  I can only describe it as a merciful relief when, during the past 12 months, the Taoiseach and his Ministers did not find an occasion to go down the country and subsequently subject radio listeners on a Sunday evening to the reading of the speech from the Broadcasting Station, some speeches lasting fully 20 minutes.  I cannot understand why that should be done.  It gives rise to the suggestion that there is some political bias so far as Radio Éireann is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with Deputy Corish in saying that there has been an undoubted improvement in the presentation of the reports of proceedings in this House. What we get over the radio at night is a fair summary of the speeches made here.  Deputy Corish made quite a good point with reference to questions put in the Dáil.  From my experience here, Question Time is perhaps one of the most important phases of the Dáil.  Over the wireless questions are not dealt with in the way Deputies would like, or in a manner that constituents would appreciate.  It should not cause very much trouble, so far as the station staff is concerned, to indicate the Deputy asking a particular <Col N="616" /> question here, and so have his name recorded.</P>
    <P>So far as radio is concerned, I get the major portion of my enjoyment from my own station.  There are some very excellent features there and, if I might mention one of them, it is &ldquo;Question Time.&rdquo;  Notwithstanding the run it has had for a number of years, it is still the favourite.  There are other excellent features, such as &ldquo;Radio Digest&rdquo; and there was recently introduced a delightful series of lessons in Irish known as &ldquo;Listen and Learn.&rdquo;  I think more has been done for the language by that delightful presentation than has been done for a good many years.  There are a number of items on the Radio Éireann programme that might be described as stodgy or of an uninteresting character.  Is the Minister making full use of the Advisory Council and is he having a continuous survey made of the programmes in order to ensure that the most enjoyable material is placed at the disposal of listeners?  With regard to the Advisory Council, I would like to know what is its personnel, what precisely does it do, and how often does it meet.  Is there a representative on that council of the artists, who should be primarily concerned, because they are the people who supply the entertainment?</P>
    <P>With regard to the station, I might say that I am amazed that it is possible for the staff to give the service that they do give with the existing equipment they have.  Anybody who has been over there will agree with me when I say that what they have is the equipment of a third-rate show and it is wholly unworthy of a national institution. I am not blaming the Minister and certainly not the Director or his staff.  To me the trouble would appear to originate in the fact that the station is under the strict control of the Minister for Finance and regulations are imposed by the Minister for Finance and his staff to such an extent as to slow down progress so far as the broadcasting station is concerned.  I am certain that that particularly applies to the rate of remuneration even of the artists themselves, which has been the subject of prolonged agitation and <Col N="617" /> complaint.  Deputy Corish has mentioned the fact that members of the staff work on low wages.  It was necessary to make a forceful protest here only last year, in regard to the news reporting staff, to ensure that reasonable conditions would apply in that particular category.</P>
    <P>So far as the presentation of news is concerned, the reply to Deputy Corish might be that, in relation to our war news, we must bear in mind that we were a neutral country and had to be exceedingly careful regarding the type of news put over to the public. Naturally, we had more than an Irish audience in that respect, and so there were other vital considerations.  I do plead that we should have a more abundant supply of local news in the future, now that the war news has been eliminated and there will be more time. We might be given news of the more interesting items occurring in the city or throughout the country and pronouncements which would be of interest to listeners generally.</P>
    <P>Might I congratulate the Minister on the appointment of the present chief announcer, who is not alone a credit to himself but to the station?  In that tribute, I would like to couple the new male voice there&mdash;I do not know his name&mdash;who has fitted in admirably to his duties, and the same applies to the young lady.  I think the announcing staff of Radio Éireann bears very favourable comparison with the best of the stations that were in existence throughout Europe up to now.  I suggest that the Minister should take his courage in his hands on this occasion, to alter the station in such a way as to give the artists an opportunity to make the best of their presentations and that the parsimonious arrangements in operation should cease, at least for the next 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with others in congratulating the Minister, and I am of the opinion that since we discussed this Estimate last year there has been a very marked improvement. There is no doubt that we are making satisfactory progress.  I would suggest to the Minister that there should be more personal appearances of our Irish artistes.  Whilst the special recordings <Col N="618" /> are well worth listening to and are magnificently selected, and whilst the programme is exceptionally good, I do not think the personal appearances of our own Irish artistes occur often enough.  The Minister may be able to make an improvement in that respect, so that they might come to the microphone personally and, when they do, we should be told that it is a personal appearance and not merely a record. We would appreciate that very much.</P>
      <P>I have a little comment to make on &ldquo;Question Time,&rdquo; an item in which we are all very much interested.  A few weeks ago, whilst we were enjoying one of the best Sunday nights ever, and people were answering questions and singing to their hearts' content&mdash; including a singer with a very rich Irish brogue&mdash;we were told that there was only a minute to go and the item was faded out, much to the disappointment, I am sure, of thousands of listeners.  I suggest that a minute or so would permit of the item being concluded and that that time could have been made up by knocking it off a record later on.  I admit that there should be a timekeeper and that one cannot allow one programme to cut into the minutes belonging to another, but minutes are not so precious that one or two extra could not have been allowed in order to enable listeners to hear the finish of the competition and get the results.  I think those in charge should have used a little more discretion in that matter.  The broadcast to which I refer was from Skibbereen, as far as I remember.</P>
      <P>One of the new features which has given great satisfaction is the &ldquo;Listen and Learn&rdquo; item in regard to Irish. Whoever is responsible for it is certainly doing the work very well.  Even an old hand like myself is listening and trying to learn, but I suppose failing miserably, though I am hopeful that some day I will be able to say: Conus tá tú, tá mé go maith, cionnus tá tú féin and suidh síos as well as the other little phrases we hear the children using every day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently I was reading some of the English and American scientific papers which are promising great things at a very early date for their people in <Col N="619" /> television.  That is part and parcel of broadcasting and there may be a very considerable revenue from it in the near future.  I would be glad to hear from the Minister that we are not behind other countries in our research work in connection with television and that there will be a development here. This country is no longer behind the times, nor is it to be considered as second-rate or third-rate in any of its services.  We can boast, very properly, of our aerodromes, which are the equal of any in any part of the world.  I merely mention that to show that our broadcasting station should be more up-to-date with equipment, as Deputy Martin O'Sullivan has said, and should not be allowed to become out-of-date. Sums of money should be spent on development in order to give our people pleasure.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I repeat my hope that the Minister will give me some answer regarding the prospect of television development, as I was writing a question to put to him some day next week and he may save both of us some trouble by giving us, in his reply, some review of the future in regard to that important matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be able to add my congratulations to those of other Deputies, and to say that there has been some improvement generally in this service.  I should like also to acknowledge the small mercies we received in certain parts of the country, by the removal of that irritating noise which in the past detracted considerably from the value of the programmes. We could do with further improvement in that respect but I desire to acknowledge the improvement effected during the past 12 months.  Some time ago, I listened with very great pleasure to a broadcast of a play, <i>The Lost Leader</i>, dealing with a subject that will always be of enthralling interest to our people. While I consider that the children of to-day know a good deal about the recent history of Ireland, and about our ancient history, there is an important period in recent history about which they seem to know very little, and on which many adults, too, seem <Col N="620" /> to be extremely hazy.  The history of the period I refer to seems to me not to have impressed itself on their minds, but it is a time about which radio listeners of advanced years would like to hear more.  The Minister told us on previous occasions when this Vote was before the House that he welcomed suggestions.  I ask him now to let us hear more about the stirring times when Parnell, Biggar, Davitt, Dillon, O'Brien, Healy and other leaders figured in our history.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly; I am glad to include them.  We would like to hear the story of the battles they took part in in the British House of Commons broadcast.  The Irish Party of those days left their mark on the history of this country, and on the history of the British Parliament where, although in a minority, they became a great power and wielded great influence.  In making this suggestion, I think I am voicing the views of a great many people who would like to hear more about those stirring days.  I shall not forget for a long time the pleasure I derived recently from reading the life of Archbishop Walsh, a great churchman, a very distinguished Irishman, and a fearless advocate of the rights of the people.  I am sure episodes from the life of Archbishop Walsh would be of very great interest to Irish radio listeners.  The development of features of that kind in reasonable proportions would, I believe, be interesting. I should also like to hear more about that noble Irishman, the late Canon Sheehan.  We could do with broadcasting items about the career of that distinguished man, as there are many people still living who knew him, not so much for his literary works because they are in evidence as can be seen by the tremendous demand for them.  I refer more to the man, a fine type of Irish parish priest, whose words carried to the ends of the earth, and whose books have been translated into many languages.  These are items that could be usefully included in the programmes with good results and with pleasure to listeners.  I am sorry <Col N="621" /> that the parsimonious policy of the Department in connection with the posts and telegraphs service and the shabby treatment meted out to some employees apparently permeates this Department.  I do not want to end on a jarring note, but I wish to associate myself with the remarks made by Deputy Corish in that connection. Now that the opportunity offers I hope new ground will be broken by the development of a wider and more far-reaching policy in our broadcasting policy.  There is an opportunity now for the Minister to divorce himself completely from the wretched policy of small wages, and from the penurious outlook that has been associated with certain arrangements in the Department. I know the Minister's interest in this country's progress, and I was glad to see him associating himself recently with the opening of a museum, which will be a reminder of a historic chapter in Irish history.  I feel that if the Minister would extend work of that kind it would give our people the opportunity to hear of chapters that will always remain an enduring feature of Ireland's past.</P>

    <P>I must congratulate the Minister and the Director of the Broadcasting Station on the policy they have decided on, especially with regard to making the programmes more Irish in every way, more representative of the life of the country, of the customs and history of its people, so that when people tune in to Radio Éireann they will know at once that we are a distinctive people, with our own culture high in the estimation not alone of our own people here but all those of our exiles who are scattered far and wide through the world and who like to keep up their contacts with their native land through hearing from the source of events of the days and years as they go by, the recollections and memories of those stirring things which have inspired past generations and have kept the Gaelic ideal to the forefront as an inspiration for the generations yet to come.</P>
    <P>In that regard I agree with the other speakers in saying that even with the great difficulties which have presented themselves during the period of the emergency, great progress has been made.  I welcome the &ldquo;Listen and Learn&rdquo; programme and I have heard people from various parts of Ireland speak very highly of it. Even though the speaker is a Muimhneach, a native Munsterman, the Gaels of Ulster have the highest appreciation <Col N="623" /> of the manner in which these lessons are conducted by him.  It is a feature which I hope will be preserved.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the new development we shall be able to have a station so powerful that its voice will extend to the ends of the earth, so that our people everywhere may keep in touch with the Irish race at home.  I agree with Deputy Corish that, especially during the busy time of the year, so far as Gaelic games are concerned, the ten minutes allotted to Seán O Ceallacháin on Sunday night is not at all sufficient and I hope it will be found possible to extend the time somewhat.  We appreciate very much indeed what the Minister and the Director have done and the generous and whole-hearted way in which they try to meet the demands made upon them.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the Cork station, and I hope that at no far distant date it will be possible to reopen that station fully, so that the talent in various parts of the country may be broadcast in such a way that the people will have a choice of various programmes.  In congratulating the Minister and the director again, I have only to say that I hope they will continue on the lines which they have decided.  By doing so, they will gain for themselves the appreciation of the Irish race at home and abroad.</P>

      <P>There is nothing in what the other speakers have said with which I can disagree.  They have covered most of the ground I should like to cover and reiteration is not very pleasant to have to listen to.  I quite agree with the suggestion as to the Irish news.  Anybody who is interested in the English news can hear it at least twice in four or five hours, but people are anxious to hear the Irish news, and, when the English news is presented first, one finds that one has not memorised it sufficiently to know when the Irish news will come on.  I agree that the Irish news should come first.  Deputies have wondered what we will do for news when the war is over.  I suppose we shall only have to invent it.  An acquaintance of <Col N="624" /> mine had the happy knack of knowing the latest.  If there was none, he could invent it, and he was known as &ldquo;Tomorrow's Independent&rdquo;.  There are still a few geniuses on the map.  We will not be short of news, anyway.</P>
      <P>Allusion has been made by Deputy Murphy to the lives of those wonderful men of Parnell's party.  He referred also to Canon Sheehan.  I do not suppose he omitted &ldquo;Knocknagow&rdquo; deliberately&mdash;I would not say he would&mdash; but it is a book which has had a steady sale and is the grandest of all the Irish novels.</P>

      <P>I was recently reading in the National Library some things written by Kickham in which he spoke of '48 and '49, the famine years or directly after, the decline of Irish games and how they were killed.  He said that we had '98, '48 and '67. Nobody regards these as failures because they led to something bigger. 1916 was not a failure.  We are here by virtue of 1916.  Who led up to 1916? The Gaelic clubs, the G.A.A.  That is the very thing that Kickham mentioned in these writings.  The hurling game was killed at that time.  I mention these matters in the hope of our being allowed to hear more of that period with particular reference to the earlier days of the G.A.A.</P>
      <P>Kickham gives a description of boys and girls collecting on Sunday evening and hurling the two sides of the road &mdash;one parish against another.  Mr. Justice Shallow, with a party of peelers at his heels, bailiffs and rent warners, came and told them to clear away.  If they did not, the Riot Act was read, and, inside a week, the rent warner came round to the farmers, who, as you know, were tenants at will, and advised them to keep the boys at home &ldquo;or the rent will be &lsquo;ris&rsquo; on you&rdquo;. Of course, they were kept at home. The games were revived in 1884 and I suggest, as I suggested last year, that we should have broadcasts of all these games, starting with the very last final and going back.  I am charmed by the principal commentator on Gaelic finals.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I agree also with Deputy Corish that the time allotted to Seán O Ceallacháin on Sunday night is clipped too short.  On last Sunday night there were eight or ten county matches taking place, but we were not told whether they were minor, junior or senior.  These are merely pin pricks, but he should get more time, as he is a brilliant announcer.  I suggested last year that arrangements should be made for the broadcasting of G.A.A. finals played in earlier years.  Let each county committee be responsible for the preparation of the script, the speakers to be those members of county teams who have played in the finals.  At present we have too much of the Oxford accent and &ldquo;Haw-Haw&rdquo; stuff from announcers over the radio.  I want to tell the House that we have a greater variety of accents in Ireland than they have in America.  You will get a greater variety of accents between Donegal and Cork and Antrim and Wexford than you will between San Francisco and New York.  Why do our Irish announcers assume the Oxford and &ldquo;Haw-Haw&rdquo; accent?  The Oxford accent may do all right in a city of dead languages and lost creeds, but I doubt it.  Language was given to us, I suppose, to convey our thoughts. I have nothing very much to say against Dublinese.  The good-class Dublin accent is second to none.  But there is no county where the people have the right to claim that they speak the best English in the world.  I believe that the best language is the most easily understood.  I do not want to make any special claim for my native county, although I do say that radio listeners can easily understand what we say.  We had no G.A.A. in '98, in '48 or in '67.  As Kickham pointed out, the magistrates or the rent warners would not allow a hurling or a football match to be played.  If the G.A.A. had not been started we would not be here to-day.  I knew Tom Clarke and <Col N="626" /> most of the men of his period, but I repeat that if it were not for the G.A.A. lads we would not be here this evening.</P>
      <P>I am interested in the G.A.A.  At the same time I do not want to say anything against other games, such as rugby, soccer or hockey.  The championships under the G.A.A. were started in 1887.  It is only a short time since the captain of the Tipperary team that won the championship in 1889 died.  He was a man who would be fit to broadcast the story of that game and, as Father Hayes reminded us, it is a pity that his voice was not heard over the radio.  My suggestion is that the script for a broadcast of these old championship matches should be prepared under the aegis of the county committees of the G.A.A. Let them pick the men to take part in the broadcast.  We do not want the &ldquo;Haw-Haw&rdquo; or Oxford accent to perpetuate the memory of those great games.  The broadcast that will be given by some of those old players will not be biased in any way.  At the present time we have 70,000 and 80,000 people attending the All-Ireland hurling and football finals.  If train services were available on Sundays, Croke Park would not be able to accommodate the crowds that would attend.  The attendances, I believe, would reach the 250,000 mark.  I suggest that the great games that were played in the last ten, 20 or 30 years are well worthy of description over the radio by some of the men who took part in them.  Many of those men are well fit to broadcast.  It is not long since I heard a broadcast by Charles Coburn who, many years ago, was a famous figure in the music-hall world, and I enjoyed it very much.  Finally, my suggestion is that we should have a broadcast for at least half an hour a week of these old G.A.A. games over the whole year by some of the men who took part in them.  The present generation would like to hear the voices of those old gladiators.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the director and the station I am very grateful for the very kind things the Deputies have said about the station.  I think it is a good thing that that should be done. <Col N="627" /> It will encourage them because they come in for a great deal of criticism. The suggestions made here to-day will be examined by the director, and those which are found to be suitable will be availed of.  Deputy Hughes put his finger on the weak spot.  It is true that the news service, which has been reduced to the minimum, is giving us a great deal of trouble.  At the moment, we are actually trying to get a new staff.  The Civil Service Commission is now engaged on the task of making certain appointments for us.  In the meantime we are trying to carry on as best we can.  It is quite true, as one Deputy has said, that the war situation made difficulties for us in several directions.</P>
      <P>First of all, news about the war was so much more interesting than any other items, that it obliged us to put the news in the order of interest.  Our station news has long been regarded as being very unbiased, and as giving a very fair view.  As regards the news, we are faced with the difficulty not only of getting a staff at headquarters but also of getting correspondents all over the country.  A news service is an extremely expensive thing if you are to get it done properly.  It requires a special flair, or gift, in people, especially in rural areas, to be able to get news which will be of interest on a national service.  However, we are doing the best we can.  We are examining the matter to see what we can do to establish a service which will be suitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very anxious indeed that we should use the radio as a great national institution so that it will reflect really significant and interesting activities over the whole country.  It is the policy of the Government to decentralise and to make our programmes more attractive for the people who live on the land.  That is a problem to which we will direct our attention.  We hope to get the fullest possible co-operation from Deputies so that if they get interested in some cultural activities in their own areas they will seek the assistance and advice of Radio Éireann.  Similar work is being done in other countries.  We are <Col N="628" /> anxious to do everything we can in that direction.  So far we have succeeded in getting certain centres to co-operate with us, but we are not satisfied that they are sufficient.  Included in that will, of course, be attention to significant sporting competitions, including hurling and Gaelic football matches.  A weak point is, undoubtedly, that the farmers do not like talking on the radio.  It is very hard to get really good farmers to come to the radio or even to be interviewed.</P>

      <P>Scientists have very experimental mind.  I do not say that they are adventurers but they are, certainly, out for adventure.  For that reason, we have to be pretty careful. At the same time, we are giving very special attention to the matter.  The ideal thing would be if farmers who have proved successful would allow themselves to be interviewed.  Some people think that the farmer himself must come to the microphone.  I do not think that that is at all necessary. We could send our people to interview them and we could put over the stuff for them.  I should like to be able to give a really vivid picture of rural life all over the country, taking in not alone farming but other activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Byrne raised the question of television.  Our experts have been watching that very carefully.  Some of them were recently in America and elsewhere and they made inquiries as to the progress of television.  We are watching developments.  Unfortunately, television is extremely expensive and the range is very limited.  They have not succeeded in increasing the range.  We were hoping that they would.  I am afraid that it will be a long time before we shall be able to adopt television.  The range at <Col N="629" /> present is only 50 miles, and the installation of television is very expensive. It is only the very rich people who could avail of it.  It will be a long time before television will compete with the pictures as a democratic amusement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy suggested that we should have a certain type of attractive feature dealing with Irish history.  I am in entire agreement with that.  The station has already done sketches of a great many episodes in Irish history and we ought to cover every period. However, when dealing with periods which are not fighting periods and which are not so vividly dramatic, the task is somewhat difficult.  It is not easy to put across a purely political situation.  Some Deputy made the admirable suggestion that we should put some of Canon Sheehan's works on the radio.  There is some difficulty about getting permission to dramatise the works, but we shall bear that suggestion in mind.</P>
    <P>The difficulty in Wexford is an extraordinary one.  It may be due to the configuration of the land but we do not know.  At present, there is no booster or gadget we could get to improve matters.</P>

      <P>The sound that the experts call the &ldquo;curlew&rdquo; has disappeared. That was due to the war, as the Deputy probably knows.  The trouble came from a radio beacon for aeroplanes in Brest.  There is no harm in saying that now.  The reporting of the Dáil is a problem in a way, because some people say we do not give enough of the speeches and others say that we give too much.  Frankly, I think that we were giving too much.  The art of summary is a very difficult one.  On the whole, I think that Deputies are satisfied with the present situation. As regards questions, we use them principally for the purpose of indicating Government policy.  If we were to give the names of Deputies in some cases, we would have to give them all or there would be complaints.  We use questions for Government policy <Col N="630" /> purposes.  It will be noticed that the questions are chosen to put across important policy matters or information for the benefit of the people.</P>
      <P>A question was raised as to the wage of a boy messenger.  If the Deputy had followed the item across the page, he would have seen that the boy messenger is getting 19/- a week.</P>

      <P>I did not suggest that. Deputy O'Sullivan asked about the Advisory Council.  I can hardly express my gratitude to the Advisory Council for their helpfulness.  We have done exactly what they suggested. There has been a continuous survey of the various sections of the radio and we have adopted a great many of their suggestions.  They were particularly helpful in connection with the &ldquo;Listen and Learn&rdquo; programme.  It took us about six months to hammer out that programme.  To them, the Department of Education and Aindreas O Muineacháin, we are extremely grateful.  It is a great success.</P>

That matter is being attended to.  We are doing our best to get such a station into operation, but it will be very expensive. If we were to start work to-morrow, it would take 18 months or two years to set it up.  Any other suggestions made will be sympathetically examined.  We always welcome suggestions at the station.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £656,635 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1946, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, and of certain Services administered by that Office, including sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estimate which we are now considering for 1945-46 shows a net decrease of £282,605 compared with the Estimate for 1944-45.  This reduction is due to the decrease in the provision for fertiliser subsidies under sub-head G (3).  There are, of course, certain changes of a comparatively minor nature in other sub-heads, but that is the big change in the Estimate for this year.  I shall have something to say about it when we come to that particular sub-head.  I just want to deal with certain sub-heads that I think call for comment.  As regards, sub-head A &mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances&mdash; there is an increase of £28,787 on the previous year's Estimate.  This increase is due to the increase in the cost-of-living bonus and the emergency bonus granted to civil servants as from the 1st January, 1945.  It will cost in the financial year under consideration approximately £22,800.  In addition to that, the administrative staff of the tillage section has increased from 69 to 99.  Provision is included also for the appointment of a soils advisory officer. The amounts provided for salaries, wages and allowances in other sub-heads total £304,308.  When we add all these items together the various staffs <Col N="632" /> of the Department are costing for the coming year £549,460.</P>
    <P>The next sub-head on which I should like to comment is E (2)&mdash; Veterinary Research Laboratory&mdash;for which the provision is £15,129.  This Estimate includes £7,000 for the acquisition of lands for a new veterinary research institute.  As Deputies are aware, the position with regard to the more serious live-stock diseases in this country is unsatisfactory and comprehensive measures to deal with these diseases must be taken. The most pressing need is for research work on an adequate scale on the elimination and control of disease and for a comprehensive diagnostic, advisory, vaccine, serum, etc., service. The present premises at Thorndale, Drumcondra, are too small.  There is no room for expansion or improvement. The whole position was reviewed recently by the Committee of Inquiry on Post-Emergency Agricultural Policy and the committee put forward a scheme for more extensive research on animal diseases.  They also recommended the reorganisation and improvement of existing veterinary services and the provision of extended facilities for the training of veterinary personnel.  I have decided to adopt the recommendation in regard to the first item.  That means that we shall have to vacate Thorndale as soon as we get a more suitable place.  What we aim at is a large farm of 300 or 400 acres.  The buildings, of course, may not be adequate for the various purposes for which they will be required, but we can add to them. The provision made is for the purchase of such a farm.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Have you got a site?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The farm will be the site when we get it.  The next sub-head with which I should like to deal is F (2)&mdash;Grants to Private Agricultural Schools, etc.  There is provision here for a contribution of £9,838 towards the erection and equipment of new buildings at Copsewood Agricultural College.  Pallaskenry, County Limerick.  This will crop up again in connection with another sub-head.  The new building <Col N="633" /> is capable of accommodating over 70 students.  For sub-head F (4)&mdash;Scholarships in Agriculture&mdash;a sum of £1,492 is provided.  I should like to say a few words to explain the purpose for which the money is voted.  A number of scholarships in agriculture, horticulture and dairy science are granted annually by the Department.  The scholarships are tenable for one year, renewable annually, so that the scholar may cover the four years' course leading to the degree of Bachelor of Agricultural Science or Bachelor of Dairy Science.  Deputies are aware, of course, that the degrees in Agricultural Science and Horticulture are obtained in University College, Dublin, and the degree in Dairy Science in University College, Cork.  There are 20 scholarships for these purposes and the scholars receive free tuition, a maintenance allowance of £68 6s. 8d. per session and also get free travelling expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards G (1)&mdash;Improvement of Milk Production&mdash;there have been some changes since last year.  The provision for allowances to supervisors of cow-testing associations has been increased from £5,300 to £10,880.  This is also as result of a recommendation of the Post-Emergency Advisory Committee. There are nearly 200 cow-testing associations and the members own about 53,000 cows.  That is slightly better than it was but by no means as high as it should be.  The members of these associations are required to test all the dairy cows, pedigree and non-pedigree, in their herds.  The normal income of each association includes the following:&mdash;A fee of 2/- per cow, payable by the owner; a grant from the Department of 4/- in respect of each cow under test; a further grant of £26 10s., plus 1/- for each cow under test in excess of 250, to enable the association to supplement the salary of its supervisor.  This year the provision is increased again by the payment by the Department of an additional allowance at the rate of 3/6 in respect of each visit made to herds by supervisors.  Deputies who carry out cow-testing know that the supervisor makes a visit once every six weeks to check up on returns, so, in fact, this increased grant amounts to <Col N="634" /> 28/- per year for every herd under supervision, but there is a maximum laid down of £30 per year.  There is also a slight increase of £300 to provide for a course of instruction for supervisors.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head G (2), there is an increase on last year's provision for the improvement of live stock.  In order to ensure that adequate numbers of thoroughbred hunter-breeding stallions are available to mare owners at reasonable fees, the Department purchases a number of suitable thoroughbred stallions each year and these are subsequently located in the most deserving areas. These stallions are sold, as a rule, at a lower price than that at which they are purchased.  In addition, the buyer gets part of the money by way of loan if he so wishes.  There is a condition that the fee for the service of nominated mares must not be more than £5.  At the outbreak of the war we had in this country 162 thoroughbred stallions on the Department's register of stallions.  Business was, of course, very bad for the owners of thoroughbred horses for the first few years after the outbreak of war, with the result that we have only now 92 and the demand for stallions has become very acute again.</P>
    <P>We must do everything possible to get more of them.  We also provide a scheme, which is already in operation, for the purchase of thoroughbred colts. Under sub-head G the subsidy for fertilisers amounts to £120,000.  The provision under this head last year was £500,000.  Owing to the high shipping charges then prevailing it was necessary to guarantee to make available advances of subsidies to meet the cost of transportation of the raw materials required by the manufacturer of superphosphates. The materials they were to bring in were raw phosphates and pyrites.  With a change in the shipping arrangements, and with supplies of raw phosphates becoming available in North Africa instead of Florida, there is a considerable reduction in ocean freight charges.  In 1943 the average cost of importing pyrites was £17 8s. 0d. per ton, as compared with an average cost last year of £7 7s. 0d. <Col N="635" /> In 1943 the cost of importing phosphates was £28 1s. 0d. per ton, and last year it fell to £10 8s. 0d. per ton.  Owing to the reduced freightage the manufacturers have not required advance payments on account of subsidy for the manufacturing year, 1944-45, which ends on 30th June next.  Any subsidy due will be paid after that date.  If fertilisers had been sold at the same price as last year, it is calculated that the subsidy would be about £50,000. Actually we got the manufacturers to reduce the price of fertilisers by £1 per ton.  That meant, of course, another £70,000 in the subsidies.  The £50,000 and the £70,000 make £120,000, the amount of the Estimate.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the amount of fertilisers turned out this year is greater than last year.  This season 75,000 tons will be sold as against 55,000 tons last year, divided into 45,000 tons of 30 per cent. superphosphates for general farm use, 15,000 tons of 1943 compound fertiliser for the sugar beet crop, and 4,200 tons of potato fertiliser.  This is distributed in the western seaboard.  There are 3,700 tons for the production of certified seed potatoes, 500 tons for unemployed allotment holders, and 600 tons for the growing of root and vegetable seeds.  Owing to the increased supply of superphosphates available, farmers who were purchasing on a quota were able to get 50 per cent. more this year than last year.  In fact, we had a small quantity of superphosphates left over at the end of the season which we permitted manufacturers and merchants to sell freely as they wished.  Last year we got 2,000 tons of nitrate of ammonia 15½ per cent.  It is estimated that there will be, if it is not already distributed, about 5,000 tons of this artificial manure this year.  This particular fertiliser is confined to the category of wheat&mdash;growing areas. These are areas where farmers are required to devote 10 per cent. of their arable land for the cultivation of wheat.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head H, the grant to county committees of agriculture amounts to £117,990, or about £6,000 <Col N="636" /> higher than last year.  The special temporary grant is £2,000, or £500 less than last year.  The special grant to provide lime for agricultural purposes is £75,000, the same as last year.  The normal grant is £ for £ of the amount raised by rates by county councils for the county committees of agriculture. The special temporary grant is provided for a number of poorer counties that are not in a position to raise sufficient on the rates to meet the purpose. Under the lime subsidy scheme, I think this amount is quite sufficient. The scheme is supplemented by an amount contributed by county committees. It is calculated that this year that will produce £21,000, in addition to the £75,000 grant.  Under the lime scheme, sea sand is also eligible for a grant, particularly in the southern areas, in Cork and Kerry, and in other counties, particularly Donegal.</P>

      <P>With regard to the National Stud, it is hoped to introduce legislation before we adjourn for the summer to entrust to a statutory company the work of conducting the stud farm at Tully.  In the meantime ordinary farm operations must be conducted, and it is calculated that the amount provided will be sufficient to meet normal expenses on the farm for part of this financial year.  Of course there will be Appropriations-in-aid against this amount which will come in later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say a few words about the Botanic Gardens because a new item arises here.  There is an item of £13,050 for expenses in connection with the arboretum at Kilmacurra Park, Rathdrum, County Wicklow.  In this particular place there is a rare and valuable collection of exotic trees and shrubs.  Experts say that it is one of the best known of its kind in Great Britain or Ireland.  Trees were pointed out to me that are supposed to be the best of their type in Europe.  It <Col N="637" /> appears that the soil, the situation and the climate of the estate are peculiarly favourable to the successful growing of such trees and plants.  The former owners who, some 40 to 50 years ago, planted the trees were evidently experts in that type of planting.  They were very keen on planting rare trees of various kinds.  On looking at the file I find that the correspondence has gone back over 20 years, but nothing could be done until recently, when a change of ownership took place and we were able to make the necessary agreement with the owner.  I should like to thank the owner, Mr. O'Connor, for his kindness and willingness to cooperate with us in this matter.  The arrangements are to fence off a certain part of the grounds of this estate, to remove all the weeds and undergrowth which had become very bad because the place was very badly neglected for some years, and to remove some vigorous trees that have no interest to the botanist because they are the ordinary trees that one finds anywhere and, in addition, to plant some rare trees that may grow there.  The expenditure is for that purpose.  We hope that it may become a valuable adjunct to the Botanic Gardens and I am quite sure, from what I have been told by those in a position to know, that it will be a valuable place for those who want to pursue the study of botany to a rather high degree.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head N (5)&mdash;Improvement of the Creamery Industry&mdash;there is only a token Estimate of £5.  An Act passed in 1943, called the Creameries Acquisition Act, 1943, which became law on the 26th May, 1943, empowers the Minister for Agriculture to require the sale to the Dairy Disposal Company of specified creameries and the chattels thereon.  The Act was passed with the object of clearing up the remaining proprietary creameries which had not come in voluntarily as a result of the legislation passed as far back as 1927.  Progress has been made. The necessary sales orders have been made and these creameries are being handed over to the Dairy Disposal Company.  I am not in a position yet to say what these remaining creameries will cost because prices have not yet been fixed and they will probably go <Col N="638" /> to arbitration, but in any case the cost of the creameries will be paid out of the funds of the Dairy Disposal Company and this is only a token sum in order to acquaint the Dáil of what is being done in the matter.</P>
    <P>There is a temporary scheme in connection with farm improvements&mdash; £58,000&mdash;sub-head M (9).  This, of course, is the administrative expense of the scheme.  The grants came from the Vote for employment schemes, which will come up before the Dáil later, and the amount it is proposed to spend is £350,000.  This scheme continues to work very satisfactorily and, judging by the number of applications received and inquiries made, the benefits that can be derived from the scheme are becoming more widely appreciated.  I should like to give the Dáil some idea of the amount of money spent under the various headings of this scheme.  We have not got the account for 1944-45 complete, but in the last year for which the accounts are complete&mdash;1943-44&mdash;on reclamation and intensive drainage, we spent £76,700; in the making of watercourses and clearing up drains, we spent £57,700; on fencing, £33,200; on farmyard improvements, £23,900; on liquid manure and water tanks and silos, £5,700; on roadways, £45,900.  I should say that while roughly the same amount of money has been spent during the year just completed, 1944-45, it is estimated that very much more has been spent, under the headings of farmyard improvements and liquid manure and water tanks, etc.  These items were only brought into the scheme for the first time, I think, in 1943-44 and had not got properly under way, but the amount spent under these headings is very much higher than it was at that time.</P>
    <P>The scheme has become more simplified. Certain conditions were laid down and we made certain exceptions but there is now no bar as regards poor law valuation.  That bar has been removed.  There is no bar with regard to whether the holder is a farmer and nothing but a farmer, as was laid down also in the beginning.  If he is getting an income from other sources it does not debar him from benefiting under the farm improvements scheme. <Col N="639" /> We found it difficult to decide in borderline cases whether a man was deriving his living entirely from agriculture or not and we thought it better to drop that bar because we found in practice that very often a man who was not deriving his living entirely from agriculture was more likely to give extra employment in a scheme of this kind than the farmer.  We have, however, continued to give preference, if by any chance we had too many applicants, to people of low valuation and to those who are making their living entirely from farming.  We should also like to give preference in cases where labour is being specially employed for the job that is put in hand.  The grant is 50 per cent. of the labour content and in jobs for which they have to buy material, the material must be bought by the applicant. Therefore, it is obvious that for such work as reclamation and drainage the grant is a very much bigger proportion of the cost of the work than, say, in respect of putting in floors in houses or building walls, because the purchase of the cement and sand, etc., falls upon the applicant and, therefore, the proportion which he gets by way of grants is not so high.</P>
    <P>I have given, more or less, a list of works for which grants have been given up to the present.  We are making at least one addition to that list.  We have all the time excluded farm buildings because our inspectors are not competent to make any estimate of the cost of a farm building and, as well as that, the loan for farm building should properly be dealt with by some such body as the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  It was put to us that building a wall as a shelter for outlying cattle might be included.  Some farmers had adopted the practice of building these walls because they found that in that way they were in a much better position to make farmyard manure than by allowing the cattle to roam around and seek shelter at the back of fences, and so on.  That will be included in the coming year.</P>
    <P>The amount under sub-head M (10) &mdash;Potato Reserve Scheme&mdash;is much <Col N="640" /> lower than last year because the amount of potatoes which we purchased is smaller.  I may say also that we will have no difficulty in disposing of potatoes this year and, therefore, there will probably be very little loss but, in any case, we will have to show the purchase amount this year if we are to show the amount against Appropriations-in-Aid. As I mentioned in the Dáil, in answer to a question, the blight last autumn was very severe, in particular in the counties that supply Dublin with potatoes, and the frost last January took a big toll of potatoes that were stored for sale during the spring months.  The result is that potatoes are somewhat in short supply, but I still have hope that we may not have an acute shortage before the new potatoes come on the market.</P>
    <P>There is a small reduction under sub-head O (6)&mdash;Acquisition of Land (Allotments) Act.  During the 1944 season, schemes were operated by 86 of the 87 local authorities, and by 38 associations in towns not possessed by municipal government, bringing the total number of centres where schemes operated to 124.  We supplied seeds and plants of which adequate supplies were available for the unemployed plotholders, and any shortage of artificial manures was made good by the supply of farmyard manure, town refuse and seaweed.  Reports on these allotments which I received from time to time were, on the whole, satisfactory. The standard of cultivation is high, and it has resulted in the production by those plotholders of a very good supply of vegetables and potatoes. In some cases, they claim to have enough vegetables and potatoes to do them the whole year round.  The same arrangements have been made for 1945, and the preparations are now well advanced.  Many of the plotholders have their crops in, and the total number of allotments is expected to be much the same, that is about 30,000, for 1945.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head O (7)&mdash;Flax Act&mdash;the provision is almost the same.  The area under flax in 1944 increased to 30,431 acres.  It is expected that the acreage will be about the same in 1945 &mdash;if anything, it will be a bit shorter. <Col N="641" /> The price payable by the Ministry of Supply in England for our flax has been reduced for the 1945 crop.  It will range from 25/- to 30/- per stone, compared with 26/6 to 31/6 for the 1944 flax.  That 1/6 was a bonus in 1944, and it has been dropped.  As Deputies know, we were able to get during the war years other fibre materials that we required in this country, against this flax, including binder twine, which we are most interested in on the agricultural side, and we have made satisfactory arrangements for the raw material for binder twine sufficient for the 1945 harvest.  Other fibre was also negotiated for&mdash;a small amount for fishing nets, and so on.  The British authorities also supplied the seed for the flax, as well as a certain quantity of muriate of potash, roughly about 1 cwt. to the acre of flax.</P>
    <P>With regard to sub-head O (10)&mdash; Emergency Powers (Tillage) Orders&mdash; this Estimate is up by £9,323.  The increase is mainly due to the fact that provision is made for the employment throughout the year, instead of for part of the year, of temporary tillage inspectors who replaced some officers on loan from the Department of Lands; and also to an increase of five in the number of the staff.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Appropriations-in-Aid will give any trouble to any Deputy.  They are practically the same as in 1944-45, with the addition of an item of £8,000 against the potato reserve fund.  Last year there was no Appropriation-in-Aid, because the procedure was that we guaranteed a certain committee here in Dublin against loss.  This year the Department purchased the potatoes, and will sell them.  Therefore, we have to ask the Dáil for the money to purchase the potatoes, and we have to put into Appropriations-in-Aid whatever we may receive against them.  Then there is £1,100 for receipts from threshing mill licences.  So far, we have inspected 2,276 threshing mills, and the fee for inspection and licence is 10/-.  The tillage inspectors inspected a number of those machines.  In some cases, they passed them as being all right.  In other cases they ordered certain adjustments <Col N="642" /> or repairs to be carried out before the granting of licences, and in some few cases they refused licences.</P>
    <P>Compulsory tillage is an item on which I should like to say a few words.  The Emergency Powers (No. 345) Order, 1944, which deals with compulsory tillage, requires every occupier of land comprising five acres or more of arable land to till 37½ per cent., that is three-eighths, of the arable land.  Then there are further provisions.  The country is divided into three zones.  In the first zone, 10 per cent. of the arable land must be under wheat.  In the other two, the amount is less.  There is also a provision that one-fourth of the tillage may be in the form of first-crop grass. The Order is the same for this year as it was for 1944.  There is no change whatever.  Up to the end of the 1944 season, 93,000 holdings had been inspected.  During 1944, the officers of the Department visited 78,771 holdings. It is interesting to analyse these holdings.  They comprised about 3,000,000 acres of arable land, and the total area cultivated in 1944 amounted to 1,283,500 acres, that is 158,500 acres in excess of the minimum requirements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear the total figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The total figure inspected was 3,000,000 acres of arable land.  Of that 3,000,000, they found that 1,283,500 acres were tilled, which is in fact 158,500 acres more than the minimum requirements.  The area under wheat on the same holdings was 373,000 acres, which was 50,000 acres more than the minimum requirements for wheat.  On the whole, therefore, the experience of the inspectors was very good, because I think Deputies will agree that inspectors are more inclined to visit the farmers who are suspected of not doing their duty rather than those who are known to be doing their duty.  On the whole, then, their experience was rather good.  Certain individuals, however, are not coming up to the minimum requirements, but the number is getting smaller.  Deputies know that in 1944, we had 2,567,143 acres under tillage, <Col N="643" /> of which 642,487 acres were under wheat.  That, of course, was an increase over 1943.  The tillage requirements for the coming year remain the same.  I do not think it is necessary for me to say why, because every Deputy will realise that whatever changes may come as a result of the ending of the war it is not likely that there will be any immediate change in the food situation of the world.  Therefore, we will be in much the same position, as far as food goes, for another year or two.</P>
      <P>The results of the activity which has taken place here in the growing of root and vegetable seeds are rather interesting. The amount harvested for 1944 covered 1,650 acres.  In the preceding year the figure was 1,250 acres, and in 1942 only 730 acres of these seeds were produced.  It is expected that during 1945 we will have 3,000 acres of these root and vegetable seeds.  This, of course, will be more than our full requirements, but if we are to go in for this as a permanent policy it is considered advisable that there should always be a carry-over of some percentage of the requirements of the following year, because something may happen in the production of these seeds.  We may come across a very bad harvest or, perhaps, some very unexpected or unknown disease.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We should always have some carry-over to meet any deficiencies which may turn up.  As farmers know, these seeds are not any worse in germination or anything by being kept for the year in store.  Rye grasses have always been produced here and we have had sufficient of them.  We have sometimes to import some from the North of Ireland and sometimes we have a surplus to export but, on the whole, we grow a fairly adequate supply of rye grasses here.  We have to import clover seeds and I am doubtful, from many reports I have seen so far, that we will ever be in a position to grow our own clover seeds because, so far as I can learn, you want an extremely dry <Col N="644" /> climate to grow clover seeds properly and we certainly have not got that every year here; we might have it occasionally.  We have to take in certain of the other grasses from other countries, too.  We are probably on good lines with regard to the production of cocksfoot.  We are in a position, at any time, to produce whatever cocksfoot we require.</P>
      <P>Seed testing is becoming very much more popular as a result, perhaps, of the tillage campaign.  It may be that we can claim that it is also a result of more advanced knowledge on the part of the farmers.  The number of samples coming in is very much higher than some years ago.  At the central station of the Department this year we tested 14,500 samples; that is about 1,000 more than the previous year.  In addition to that about 8,000 samples were tested by the rural science instructors in vocational schools, under an arrangement made with the Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>With regard to agricultural machinery, in 1944 we made arrangements for the importation of 50 threshing sets, 350 tractors and 350 reapers and binders.  Some of these reapers and binders did not arrive in time for the last harvest, but they have arrived now and are being allocated to those to whom they were promised last year; at least they are being offered to them, because some are not now inclined to take them.  They will not go to waste, anyway. This year it is hoped to import 620 tractors, 750 reapers and binders and 50 threshing sets.  Some of the tractors have already arrived and are being distributed through the ordinary trade channels.  We thought it well this year, on account of the large number coming in, more or less to withdraw the control we had and to allow the trade to go back to the ordinary trade channels.  On the whole, I think it has worked satisfactorily. There are, of course, numbers of applicants disappointed but, even if we had the distribution of them in the Department, or if the distribution was through the county committees, there would still be some applicants disappointed. If the same number comes in next year.  I think nearly every applicant should be satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="645" /> I am sorry to say that the reapers and binders are not all likely to arrive in time for the harvest.  I am afraid, after seeing the programme for shipping, that they will not all be in here; but the greater number of them will, I hope.  They are being distributed under the same scheme as we had in operation last year; that is, that a local committee in each county, consisting of the chairman of the county committee, the county manager, and the chief agricultural officer or the secretary of the committee, as the case may be, will recommend to me the most desirable applicants for these machines.  That scheme, I must say, has been working very satisfactorily.  I have already mentioned that the binder twine position is all right and I think we should have no worry about that for the coming harvest.</P>
    <P>Although the number of tractors is going up very steeply indeed compared with the number we had pre-war, which was very small, we still have succeeded in having enough fuel oil for these tractors, and I think the scheme for the distribution of that oil has worked very smoothly.  Sometimes, I must admit, I get complaints from certain owners of tractors down the country, but almost always I find that the fault does not lie with the Department of Supplies, that it lies more with the owner of the tractor who has not, perhaps, sent in some return he was asked for, or has allowed his fuel oil to run out before asking for more and, if he is very busy, he dislikes being kept waiting for a few days.  The position with regard to coal remains the same and, so far as agricultural operations, the burning of lime, and the driving of threshing machines are concerned, I am afraid we will have to carry on as we are for the present.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that there was a small increase in the number of pigs offered to the bacon factories in 1944, 9,480 more pigs being offered than in 1943.  What is more heartening, I think, is that since May, 1944, there has been a considerable improvement in sow services.  Of course, we do not get returns from everybody, but the returns we get have usually been a very good indication of the <Col N="646" /> future of pig production.  If it is as reliable on this particular occasion as it has been in the past, I think we should be coming to the time when there will be almost sufficient bacon for any prospective purchasers in this country.</P>
    <P>The Pigs and Bacon Commission have recently put into operation a scheme for the distribution of a limited number of pure-bred sows to farmers on special terms.  The number, of course, is small, because it is not easy to get good sows at present, but it will have a good effect in time, because the idea is that these sows will become the source of further breeding sows as time goes on.  They are about six months old and the object, as I say, is to improve the breed generally in the country.  The recipient is required to undertake to sell for breeding purposes the female young of the sows to pig breeders in the locality.  Each applicant is required to pay £5 when his application is accepted.  Of course, the applications at first are only filed but, if the application is accepted, he pays £5.  Then he pays another £5 after the first year.  He is liable for a third £5 after the second year, but the Commission will forego the third £5 instalment if they find that the recipient has been carrying out the conditions faithfully and, especially, is distributing the progeny to neighbouring farmers for brood sows.  These sows will be distributed to the various counties in the order in which the applications were received.  But, again, it is a case where all applicants cannot be satisfied because it is a slow job getting these sows at the moment.  It may be that we will get them as time goes on.</P>
    <P>The total quantity of canned meat, that is in the form of stewed steak and ox tongue, exported to the British Ministry of Food in 1944 was 8,300 tons.  This was expected to reach 10,000 tons, but there were various snags which cropped up last year. For a good part of the year it was impossible to get the necessary cans from the British Ministry of Supplies, and the business could not be carried on without the cans.  For the year ended 31st March, 1945, the quota was 10,000 tons, and the British Ministry of Food <Col N="647" /> have intimated their willingness to accept a similar quantity for the year ending 31st March, 1946.  The price payable last year for canned stewed steak was 14/5¾d. per dozen 1 lb. cans, ex quay in Great Britain, and that was based on the price of cans as at the time when the agreement was made. If the price of cans should increase, this price will go up, and, I presume, if the British Ministry can give the cans for a smaller price, we may expect the price to go down.  The same price is being offered for the coming year.</P>
    <P>Dressed beef, including veal, went cut to the extent of 60,235 cwts., and mutton and lamb to the extent of 9,550 cwts.  Though the quantity was considerably higher than last year, it is still small.  The increased export in 1944 was due to the poor price on the home market for second-rate cattle at the end of the year, and they were slaughtered and sent out as dressed beef instead of going alive. The number of live cattle exported in 1944 was considerably less than normal, but the weights were still above the average.  The severe drought in the spring was an important factor, there were emergency restrictions against travel, and shipping was very scarce.  These things militated against the export of cattle for some time, but probably the main cause of the drop in exports was the limited capacity in Britain for the feeding of the beef types of cattle.  There is a very big increase in the number of dairy cattle there.  They had a year something like ours, when feeding was very scarce both in the form of autumn grass and hay and straw for the winter.  The result was that our best cattle went out and younger cattle did not go to any great extent, and that means that we have a big carry over commencing this year.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of the year a number of second-rate cattle went out as dressed beef and also a number of second-rate cattle went out as fat cattle.  About 20,000 cattle went out as fat cattle that would not have gone if prices had been better for stores. The home consumption of beef was up also.  The general result is that we have a good many more cattle in the <Col N="648" /> country than we had some few years ago.  The export of cows was down also as against 1943.  Over the year about 25 per cent. of the licences were not used.  Cows and springer heifers go out under licence and a number of the licences were not taken up.  We exported 47,000 sheep and this is higher than in 1943, when the number was 26,000.  These sheep went over the Border and were mostly breeding ewes.</P>
    <P>As regards eggs and poultry, there was undoubtedly an increase in production in 1944 and there was also an increase in exports.  The increase in exports was probably not so high as the increase in production.  It is estimated by those whose business it is to make these calculations that the home consumption of eggs has increased by 50 per cent. since pre-war days.  The number of fowl went up by 1,000,000 since 1943.  The production of eggs would have been better were it not for the rather severe weather that came in the autumn, and then the frost came in January, frost which has hit us in so many ways.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last year that we meant to do everything possible to increase poultry and egg production and I think the House agreed that the best inducement was an increase in price. We introduced that increase in price. During the flush season of production last year the price given was 5d. per dozen higher than in the previous year and, taking the whole year round from 1st February, 1944, until 31st January, 1945, the average price of eggs was increased for the producer by 3½d. per dozen, which was a very substantial increase.</P>
    <P>We also offered other inducements. We offered a very high price for cockerels that might be killed during the spring months.  We went as high as 2/6 per lb.  The intention was to induce producers to bring out early chickens.  The early pullets are the layers we require, because they will lay during the scarce season in October, November and December.  As we all know, when we bring out chickens early, at least half of them are cockerels, perhaps sometimes more than half, and in order that they might not be too much of a nuisance <Col N="649" /> to the producer we offered that high price of 2/6 per lb.  All these things have to be balanced.  We found that during the year exports were limited and we are regulating these prices by giving so much to the producer for the eggs and so much for the cockerels. The production towards the end of the year was not sufficient; the production of eggs and the exports were not sufficient to make up for losses and we had to retrench.  There was something taken off turkeys, but in spite of that there were 1,000,000 more turkeys exported, or about 18 per cent. more than in 1943.  The increase in production would be about the same.</P>
    <P>The export of rabbits declined, and it is perhaps a good sign that there are less rabbits in the country.  That is a thing we all desire.  Whatever we might want in the way of increased production in other things, we would all like to see rabbits decreasing in numbers.</P>
    <P>There was talk recently about agricultural education.  It is no harm to see how we stand with regard to agricultural institutions.  I have already mentioned that the higher education is done in the university colleges; that is, agricultural science and horticultural science in University College, Dublin, and dairy science in University College, Cork.  There are a number of scholarships&mdash;I mentioned 20&mdash; tenable at these colleges.  These scholarships are provided by the Department.  We have three Departmental schools, at Ballyhaise, County Cavan; Athenry, County Galway, and Clonakilty, County Cork.  These schools are intended mainly for the instruction of farmers' sons in the best principles of husbandry.  Schools somewhat like these, but not owned by the Department, and run by religious orders, are situated one at Mount Bellew, County Galway, conducted by the Franciscan Brothers; two at Warrenstown, County Meath, and Pallaskenry, County Limerick, conducted by the Salesian Fathers; and one at St. Patrick's, County Monaghan, conducted by the diocesan clergy.  The courses provided are something the same as in our own colleges, but these outside colleges receive financial assistance in the way <Col N="650" /> of teachers' salaries and capitation grants for the students who attend.  As I mentioned earlier, some alterations have been carried out at Pallaskenry which will enable them to accommodate about 70 students.  The ordinary number in any of these colleges was about 40 or 50, but we have not had enough room.  We have more applicants than we can provide for at the moment in colleges of this kind.  There has been a very big demand in recent years and the problem of catering for it has been under consideration for some time.  We have tried to meet it to some extent, by sanctioning these extensions to some of the colleges, although personally I do not like to see the numbers growing too large, as I fear that, if it goes beyond 40 or 50, the students cannot get the same individual attention.</P>
    <P>We also intend to open as soon as possible the college which is projected for Johnstown Castle, County Wexford, but owing to the difficulty of getting certain supplies it is not easy to make the alterations necessary. Deputies will realise that a castle is scarcely a suitable building for a college, and that to provide for the residence of students and for class-rooms we must make some alterations.  It is not easy to make them, but we hope to start there in September with a small number of students.  I am afraid the number will be very small at the beginning, but we will make a start.</P>
    <P>On the girls' side, we have the Munster Institute in Cork, which is conducted by the Department.  It is a residential school for rural domestic economy, and there is a farm attached. Provision is made for instruction in poultry-keeping, dairying and rural domestic economy, for farmers' daughters who intend to go back to the farm.  There are advanced courses, to enable students to take up positions as instructresses in poultry-keeping and butter-making under the Committees of Agriculture. There are also nine domestic economy schools run by religious orders, in which there is a one-year course for girls who want to go back to their own farms or who are ambitious to get into the Munster Institute.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="651" /> The Committee of Inquiry into Post-emergency Agricultural Policy, which was set up some time ago, has presented three interim reports&mdash;one on dairying, one on poultry and one on animal diseases and veterinary services. Regarding those reports in general, I would like to say that the recommendations are very practicable and that there is good commonsense behind them.  I would almost be inclined to say to certain Deputies who condemned this committee in the beginning: &ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; but I had better wait until I get further reports before I say that definitely.  I think I can say that these three reports will be adopted in the main, though there may be some slight deviations here and there.  I hope that the main recommendations will be adopted, and, if I can get the necessary agreements of the Minister for Finance in some cases and the Minister for Education in others, the recommendations probably will come into operation eventually.</P>
    <P>I am expecting a main report from that committee which will decide some of the bigger issues we are up against, now that the war is over.  I am also expecting a report in the very near future on pigs and bacon.  We have had at least two commissions already on that very difficult subject, but I think it is only fair to give this committee an opportunity to make its observations before we proceed to do anything definite.  I expect that report in the very near future, and then I may be in a position to put certain proposals before the Government, after which the matter may reach the Dáil.  I believe the committee also intends to report on marketing, on farm buildings, on education and on the policy of finance and credit.</P>
    <P>As soon as the main report I have referred to reaches me&mdash;I expect it in a few weeks' time&mdash;I hope to be able to advise the Government on some of the big problems in front of us and on some of the big decisions we have to make.  For instance, there is the whole problem of feeding stuffs&mdash; whether it is advisable that we should, for all time, produce our own feeding <Col N="652" /> stuffs or go back to complete freedom of trade, throwing the gates open and letting them come in from other countries, or whether there should be some compromise between the two extremes. That decision will govern our attitude to compulsory tillage and to such schemes as the wheat scheme and the beet scheme.  We may not have long to wait for that main report and I may be able to give some indication to the Dáil before we adjourn as to the Government attitude to some of these questions.</P>
    <P>For the immediate future, of course, there can be no change.  As has been pointed out already, the food situation in the world has not changed, nor is it likely to change.  For some few years, there will be a food shortage, and the least we should do in order to ease the world shortage is to feed ourselves. If possible, we might hope to do a little more, but we must do at least that much.  I feel that Deputies will be anxious to know what our policy is in regard to certain things which we will have to deal with in the more distant future to which we must be looking forward.  I take it that the main report of the committee will contain advice regarding the future production of agriculture, whether we should try to direct agriculture to a certain form of production or leave the farmer free to produce whatever he thinks best.  If there is a recommendation to interfere in any way, we have to consider what that interference will be.</P>
    <P>I take it that the best way to influence the farmer to produce a certain thing is to tell him that, if he does so, we will guarantee a market and a fixed price.  That leads us to the old question of the guaranteed market and the fixed price, and I would say straight off that I am in favour of that, so I do not want Deputies to waste time in trying to convince me that that policy is right.  I am in favour of it, but I must add, &ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo;, and I think every Deputy would agree with that addition.  For instance, before bringing any commodity into the category of commodities that can be dealt with in this way, you must have a home market.  We <Col N="653" /> cannot control either the market or the price unless the commodity has a home market.  I suppose we may succeed in making trade agreements with other countries, but they would be unstable even at the best, as we could not expect another country to make an agreement&mdash;even though that was done during the war&mdash;to last over a very long term, and guarantee a price or a market for all of our exportable surplus, whatever it may be.  Therefore, the first condition would have to be the existence of a home market.  I do not think we need say it is out of the question if there is only a small surplus for export.  For instance, if butter could come under this scheme of guaranteed price and guaranteed market, and if, after three or four years, 5 per cent. of our butter became surplus and had to be exported, that could be dealt with and would be only a small matter, but when it comes to a question of a big proportion being surplus and due for export, it is difficult to work a scheme of this kind.</P>
    <P>In addition to having the home market, there must be some uniformity of standard.  Butter would fit into that easily, as creamery butter is a uniform commodity.  There are very few consumers in this country who could say, if they got butter from five different creameries at random, that one was definitely better than another.  The quality is practically uniform, though the experts may be able to say that one is better than another.  Uniformity is a necessary quality, and so you could not bring cattle or dogs under the scheme, as you could not value cattle either by age, by weight, or by volume.  Two cattle of the same weight may be of quite different values, and as there is not uniformity in that way, they could not come under this scheme.</P>
    <P>The commodity, also, must be economic to produce because you might have an article that could be produced on the home market and that would be uniform and yet would be uneconomic to produce here at home.  For instance, you could produce oranges here, under glass, which would be quite uniform, but which would be uneconomic to produce and, therefore, could not be brought under our scheme. It is advisable also under this scheme <Col N="654" /> to have marketing through some recognised channel.  That, of course, is not absolutely essential, but it would be advisable in a scheme of the kind.  The principal thing to be borne in mind is the use of such commodities for human food.  If such a commodity were to be used partly for animal consumption, the scheme would not work because, as in the case of potatoes, let us say, the price would come down to the price the farmer was willing to pay. Therefore, in connection with such commodities, we come down to the question of the commodities for which a price could be guaranteed to the farmers.  I think that dairy produce comes under all those headings and that we could guarantee the farmer a certain price for all the commodities coming under those headings.  I think that that could be done, and perhaps it could be done in the case of bacon also, since that is also uniform.  Of course, in the case of bacon there is the possibility that if we get back to bacon production on a proper basis, there would be a very big surplus for export, and therefore that commodity could not come under this scheme.  The same applies in connection with wheat, beet and other commodities, but I do not think it is likely that we would ever have a surplus for export in connection with these.  As a matter of fact, the range of such products is not very big.  Of course, horses, cattle, and so on, could not come under this scheme, and then the next point is the matter of the price to be fixed, and the difficulty arises there, of course, as to how the price should be fixed.  Everybody will agree that the price should be such as to give a fair return to the producer and a fair value to the consumer, but it is not always easy to reconcile those two things, and we should all try to see how that can be done: to see whether it could be done properly and, as far as possible, to do justice as between the two parties concerned.</P>
    <P>That is so far as regards the home market, but then, when it comes to the question of an export market, it must be remembered that the nation requires to have exports, if only to pay for the necessary imports, and, of course, naturally, the farmer would <Col N="655" /> like to have an outside market to take his surplus produce over and above what he can produce for the home market.  Accordingly, I think that we can assume that an export market is desirable, and the question then is how to tackle that problem.  It may be necessary to increase exports if we want to import certain articles in order to have a certain standard of living here and, from past experience, it looks as if the greater part of our exports&mdash;in fact, any increase in our exports that might be expected&mdash;must come from agriculture.  If you look, for instance, at the years from 1924 to 1939&mdash;taking 1924 as the last year when things were fairly normal, and 1939 as the year when the war commenced&mdash;we find that agriculture accounted for 71.2 per cent. of the visible exports and industry for 17.6 per cent.  That is the relationship which our exports and imports bore to one another.  Of course, certain re-imports have to be taken into consideration in connection with that, and there are also certain commodities which are not classed as either industry or agriculture, such as fish, to give one example.  Now these are the figures: agriculture 71.2 per cent. of the visible exports and industry 17.6 per cent. during those years, and during the war years agriculture had even a bigger share.  It went up to 74 per cent., while industry was 17.6 per cent.</P>
    <P>Another thing that we have to take into consideration is that from 1931 to 1939 agricultural exports fell.  In connection with all these matters we want, if possible, to get at the real fact and truth of the situation, because we cannot do any good in the future unless we get at the foundation of all these things.  As a matter of fact, the volume of output during that period&mdash;I am not speaking of the value, but of the volume of output&mdash; was as high as ever it had been, but still the volume of exports went down, and we want to know why.  First of all, of course, certain imports were stopped.  We had been importing, say, bacon, butter and some other commodities of that kind.  We stopped them coming in and, therefore, had to fill the void by production at home. We stopped the import of bacon, <Col N="656" /> butter, and so on, and had to fill the void from our own resources.  Besides that, during those years, a bigger proportion of our land was, devoted to the production of wheat and beet, and other commodities that formerly had to be imported.  Then, again, there was an increased consumption of such things as beef, mutton, wheat, butter, and even bacon.</P>
    <P>During the same years, 1931-39, industrial output increased&mdash;remember that agricultural output remained stationary&mdash;but the export of industrial goods did not increase.  The industrial output was more in the line of commodities which had previously been imported.  There was no increase in industrial exports, and, if we keep these two facts in mind, the inevitable conclusion is that if we want increased export when this war is over, from the point of view of the nation as a whole in order to pay for more imports, that increased export will have to come from agricultural production.  That, of course, means that our agricultural production will have to be increased, because we cannot increase exports and, as it were, leave our own people short.  All the indications, therefore, point to agriculture, because even if there is, as I believe there will be, increased industrial production, it will be more in the nature of the production of goods to supply home needs and not for export.</P>
    <P>That brings us to almost the final point, that is, how to compete in the foreign market, because if we want to get a foothold in the foreign market, we must compete there against other countries.  We shall have to improve our methods of processing and marketing and, if possible, to reduce our costs if we want to do business on the foreign market.  When I speak of reducing costs, I do not want anybody to jump to the conclusion that I would suggest that wages should be reduced. I should like very much if they could be increased, but I think costs could be reduced in other ways and, in fact, there are certain reductions which we may expect.  For instance, in the years to come, I think the price of artificial manures will be on the downward grade for a long time and these manures will be purchasable at a <Col N="657" /> much lower price than at present. They should go down to at least half what we are paying at present and, as well, there may be an improvement in quality.  We shall have a big reduction, I expect, in artificial manures and to the extent to which we import feeding stuffs, they also will be cheaper. As I mentioned already, I am not in a position to say what the policy in that regard may be because we must at least extent to the committee which is considering that matter the courtesy of waiting for their report.</P>
    <P>There are other factors like better equipment.  Undoubtedly better equipment is a big factor, and I mean equipment in a very wide sense.  For instance, the first report of this post-war advisory committee was on dairying, and they reported principally on a possible improvement of the dairy cow.  There is no equipment which requires as much improvement as that for dairy cows.  It will be a slow process, I admit, and we will not put the farmer in a position next year or the year after to compete by improving his cow, but at least let us try by every means in our power to improve his equipment so far as we can.  We hope that, by adopting the recommendations of that committee, we may in time improve the dairy cow.  The same applies to the sow.  The Pigs and Bacon Commission have gone out on a scheme of picking up the best young breeding sows they can get and giving them to farmers, on condition that the farmers in turn sell the female progeny for breeding purposes again.  It is a very good scheme, and, in that connection again, I say that equipment in the form of the sow is very important.</P>
    <P>There is, then, equipment in the form of machinery.  That is a very big problem, because in this respect we are up against a sort of contest as between the social and the economic aim.  The social aim is to put as many people as we can on the land, and the economic aim is to give the farmer a better living.  It is doubtful if we can get the two policies to coincide.  There is probably some conflict between them, but we must keep both in mind. However, even leaving that big question of how far we should go in the <Col N="658" /> breaking up of big farms aside for the moment, everybody, I think, will admit that the medium-sized farm is not as well equipped with machinery as it should be.  Many a farmer with 50, 60 or 70 acres has to wait for perhaps a few days for the corn drill from his neighbour, or three or four days for the reaper and binder.  In the first case, he may lose a very good season for sowing his corn, which may make a terrible difference later on, and, in the second case, the opportunity of harvesting his corn properly, and he may lose a good deal of his crop in that way.  We should do everything in our power to enable farmers to get into more machinery, even though their farms are small, when the war is over.  So far as I am concerned, I am quite prepared to consider and recommend anything practical in that respect.</P>
    <P>There is then the question of better technique which, of course, means bringing scientific and up-to-date methods into operation to a greater extent.  I have mentioned before that we have at our disposal in the Department a great deal of knowledge from experiments, literature on what has been done in other countries and so on, but it is not so easy to get that knowledge across to every farmer.  I think we have in this country probably a fairer proportion of farmers who are as good as any in the world, but we have not been able to get it across to all farmers.  It is, however, something which we must try to do, and how to do it is a problem which we must try to solve.</P>
    <P>Then there are farm buildings.  As I said already, this post-war committee is going to present a report on farm buildings.  I am personally very keen on the subject, because I think that one of the greatest causes of the discontent and drudgery associated with agriculture in this country is the very bad farmyard and very poor buildings we find in many places.  If we could by any means help farmers to have nice, clean farmyards, with well laid-out and well-lighted houses, the drudgery of farming would to a great extent be removed, but there again we must await the report of this committee. <Col N="659" /> I can say, however, that personally I should be only too glad to do everything possible to help farmers in that regard.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of credit, which has often been raised.  Credit is a very dangerous weapon and one which must be used very cautiously. We all know amongst our own acquaintances cases in which credit was too lavish.  It came perhaps from a relative, from a bank or from some other source, but many a farmer was ruined by too much credit, and we must always keep in mind, when talking of credit, that money which a farmer gets, if he gets it as a loan, must be paid back both as to the principal and interest.  We must see that money of this kind is useful to the farmer and can be put to such use that he is well able to repay both interest and capital out of the profits he secures from its use.</P>
    <P>Last, but by no means least, we should perhaps be in a position every year from now on to improve the fertility of our land.  I say that because, I presume, we will now be in a position to get more artificial manure and at a lower price, and good seeds as well.  In my opinion anyway, there is no panacea for agriculture.  You often hear people say that what is wrong with agriculture is one particular thing.  I do not think that one thing is going to better it.  There is no panacea for agriculture, as far as I can see.  I think there are numbers of palliatives that could be applied to it.  All these, when taken together, will come to a big thing.  We must apply them all if we are going to improve the position of the farmer so that he will be able, without such a thing as an export subsidy&mdash;even if it were necessary to go so far to help the farmer out of State funds or in other ways to put him on his feet&mdash;to compete against the world for all time, once he is put in that position.  I think we are all agreed here on the fundamentals, and that is on the things I have mentioned: the fertility of the land, the best possible equipment in the way of livestock, machinery, buildings, knowledge, and so on.  We are all agreed that all these things are <Col N="660" /> necessary.  We are all agreed on a just price for what the farmer may sell.  We are all agreed that the farmer should be put in a position to process and market his products in the best possible way.  But where we differ, I think, is that we do not agree to the extent to which these conditions have been achieved, or how they may be fully achieved in the time to come.  I expect, however, that the debate will disclose what our differences are in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the motion standing in my name: &ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration&rdquo;. I put down this motion because we feel that the alarming fall in agricultural production since 1939, which has been indicated by the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement at 11 per cent., is a matter of grave economic consideration for the State.  It is a reflection on the capacity of our people, not because they are to be blamed individually, but because the Minister has failed systematically to organise agriculture during the favourable period of the war so that maximum results could have been achieved.  I think that even the present world shortage is a challenge to our ability and capacity to organise and expand our production.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister, and possibly every Deputy in the House appreciates it, how vitally important that is to the community as a whole. The Minister has on various occasions appealed over the radio, and in other places, for an expansion to feed our people and to save shipping.  His latest appeal over the radio was for the purpose of helping the starving people of Europe.  I think he went further to-night than that, when he mentioned another very important matter, namely, the securing of our essential imports.  I must say that I welcome the Minister's attitude on those matters and his approach to the whole problem of exports, because our most important national asset, our export trade, has not got for many years the attention that it deserves.  Therefore, I say that the Minister's attitude and his approach to that problem to-night are certainly welcomed by me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture is not <Col N="661" /> the only Minister who has referred to the danger that there may be an exchange problem for us in the post-war period.  We know that for a number of years before the war a substantial part of our imports was paid for our of our sterling assets and invisible income. Therefore it will be unwise for us to rely on that method of exchange payment in the future.  For that reason the Minister stressed to-night in a particular way the necessity of expanding production if we are to maintain decent standards here, and if we are to import our necessary requirements, raw materials and other essential things that we cannot produce at home.  The expansion of our agricultural production is a big problem.  Nobody wants to minimise it in any way. We find an extraordinary situation when we compare the figure given by the Minister for Finance&mdash;a fall of 11 per cent. in our agricultural production during the war years&mdash;with the British effort.  That country, despite the fact that it had a world problem to face, claims an expansion in its production of 75 per cent. That shows what can be achieved by properly organised methods and the application of scientific methods, together with the provision of the necessary equipment to which the Minister has referred.  It shows the necessity there is not to rely solely on the individual&mdash;that there is a responsibility on the State to provide the organisations and technical advice which are so essential if we are to compete with other countries in the world to which the Minister has referred.</P>
    <P>I was tempted to ask if the return of peace had found us unprepared for the problems associated with the disorganisation and the chaos of the productive capacity of the world.  The Minister has told us that the post-war planning committee is working out those problems.  He was inclined to say to some Deputies who criticised: &ldquo;I told you so.&rdquo;  I do not know whether he includes me in that category. I may say that I have every respect for certain of the technical experts on that post-war planning committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly I may fall into that category, because I think I was the only Deputy who put down a question to the Minister to ask why the members of that committee were not practical farmers.  I am well aware of the fact that certain experts on that committee thought it necessary, from time to time, to consult practical farmers on practical aspects of the plans they are producing at the present time.  Whether the practical farmers will get any credit for certain proposals embodied in some of those plans is a matter on which the Minister may or may not be able to give us information.</P>
      <P>On the matter of our export trade, I think that we should make some attempt to gauge what the position is going to be in the post-war world, what the world will require, and what the aims of the world generally are going to be.  Some of us may have very little faith in the resolutions that were passed at Hot Springs, in a discussion which took place there, or in the expressions of opinions given by famous economists and world experts on economic world problems.  Whether or not the resolutions will ever be implemented it is hard to say, but at any rate we must take cognisance of the fact that certain ideas were developed and elaborated there, and that certain aims were agreed on and resolved. The main result, at all events, of that conference was that the United Nations there, representing some 44 nations, decided that it should be the aim to provide a sufficient dietary for the population of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that when one talks of a dietary for the population of the world it means a properly balanced dietary. That immediately raises the question, what does that mean exactly?  Food can be divided, roughly, into two categories, calories and protective foods. I suggest that the world never had any difficulty about the provision of calories.  There were always, I think, sufficient calories&mdash;carbohydrates&mdash;to feed the population of the world.  A very big percentage of the people of the world are now existing on calories, but these alone do not provide a nutritious dietary for the people of the world to exist on.  The point is <Col N="663" /> that we have never had anything like a sufficiency of protective foods, those of high value being proteins and vitamins. I think that we in this island are equipped in a special way for the production of protective foods&mdash;animals and animal products, butter, meat, eggs and the by-products of animals generally.  We are a community of small farmers and the production of these particular commodities requires a good deal of personal attention.  That attention can be provided more conveniently on small farms than on the bigger units.  The production of protective foods is particularly suitable to the small farming community.  I agree with the views expressed by the Minister regarding marketing and guaranteed prices for production and consumption at home.  I agree as to the difficulties of guaranteeing prices for goods which we propose to export.  I might add some observations to those of the Minister but I shall come back to this subject later.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to say what exactly we should discuss on a Vote of this sort. I do not know that it serves any great purpose to go through the whole gamut of the Vote.  The problem is a very comprehensive one and, if every Deputy wades through the whole of the material, I do not think that the debate will be very effective.  It might be better if we were sometime to agree upon a procedure whereby we would take up definite aspects of agriculture successively and discuss them.  That would, at least, have this effect&mdash;it would tie down the Minister in his reply to a particular problem.  If he is given too much material to which to reply, he can shy off a difficult problem.  If we were in a position to discuss over a period of years certain definite aspects of agriculture, we could keep the Minister to particular problems and have his views on those.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that Clann na Talmhan are very fond of motions. This is the time when we should tackle the problems of agriculture in a constructive way.  When we are providing moneys for agriculture, the attention <Col N="664" /> of the House should be centred upon that problem.  The post-war planning committee have submitted certain interim reports upon which no final decisions have been made by the Government. Other reports are pending, so that it is rather difficult to see how we should deal with the matter.  It may be rather premature to express opinions on some of the reports submitted. One might feel that there were commissions in those reports, whereas those omissions might be repaired in later reports.  The problem is an urgent one.  I hope that some of the problems which will, almost inevitably, arise will not be upon us before we have plans in operation to deal with them.  The plans must be very comprehensive.  Attention to one particular matter will not solve the whole problem.  Various adjustments will have to be made over the whole field of agriculture if we are to get substantial improvement.  There is room for substantial improvement.  I agree with the Minister that we have farmers equal to the best in any country. But I think the Minister will agree with me that we have a high percentage of mediocre farmers who are getting only mediocre results.  That is where we should look for improvement. We should be able to improve those mediocre results.  There are many reasons for the present state of affairs. One of the major reasons is the poverty of technical knowledge on the part of the farmers as compared with the agriculturists of other countries.  In that respect, I think that our system of technical education is all wrong.  It is not reaching down to nearly a sufficient number of the farmers.  We have a few fine agricultural scientists who are keeping abreast of the times.  The knowledge is there but it is not being disseminated.  The machinery we have in operation is not carrying that knowledge down the country.  I do not think it is necessary that it should reach every farmer.  If we had, here and there, farmers with sound technical knowledge, employing sound methods, their neighbours would follow their example. What we should aim at is what Denmark and other countries have aimed at in the past&mdash;to have one in every ten farmers with a sound technical <Col N="665" /> knowledge.  He would be an example to his neighbours and, in that way, we would ensure that the most modern methods and the methods most suitable to the particular area would be adopted.</P>
      <P>The most important thing we have, from the economic point of view, is the soil of the country, and we must have a proper soil policy.  For the increased production the Minister envisages, we want machinery, fertilisers, research, capital and, above all, technical knowledge.  That is the big handicap at present.  We have a tremendous soil problem here.  I do not know whether the Minister agrees with me or not regarding this matter.  He was inclined to disagree with me previously but I think he will come round to my view.  We have many disadvantages, but our outstanding disadvantage is our big calcium deficiency.  We are using at present, according to a reply given by the Minister to a Parliamentary Question by me, 65,000 tons of calcium carbonate.  I think we shall have to aim at an annual figure of, at least, 1,500,000 tons or 2,000,000 tons and provide that at an economic price&mdash;something like £1 per ton.  In the north, the figure is about 1,000,000 tons.  Our problem, surely, requires more than that.  We have not attempted to measure it.  Most of the other countries which have entered upon soil surveys have advanced considerably in that connection.  We are so backward regarding this whole soil problem that our agricultural leaflet on lime, which was revised two or three years ago, is completely and absolutely obsolete and worthless.  Most of our experts will say that it is just humbug to talk about the application of calcium if you do not attempt to measure accurately the deficiency.  Mr. J.W. Robinson, who visits this country in the capacity of examiner, has stated in his book that the application of an insufficient quantity is waste and that too much may be dangerous, so that you want to measure accurately the deficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because we have neglected this problem for a great many years, we have to overtake the deficiency that is there, first of all.  For some years we must try to correct it and, having corrected <Col N="666" /> it, we shall have to keep up the standard by an annual intake of lime or calcium carbonate, in whatever form is most suitable.  The Minister has told us to-night that we are subsidising the use of sea sand.  There is another form of calcium carbonate which the Minister might have examined.  There is a deposit underlying turf in certain parts of the country that could be utilised for this purpose.  This is not merely an agricultural problem; it is an industrial problem as well.  Great Britain has erected a huge works in Lincolnshire to grind the raw rock.  The product is produced in two grades.  The real fine product is run through a 100-mesh sieve and the second grade through a 40-mesh sieve, so that the reaction will be spread over a longer period of years.  Applying caustic ground lime is a hardship to men and animals.  Countries that have made the biggest advance in this problem of correcting acidity have decided that ground rock is the proper material.  I say to the Minister that there is a big industrial side to this whole problem, if we are going to apply anywhere from 1,500,000 to 2,000,000 tons per year over a period of five or six years until we get the problem corrected, and afterwards make good the annual losses, which might mean the application of 500,000 to 1,000,000 tons annually.</P>
    <P>We must appreciate that in this country, with our high rainfall, there is a tremendous amount of leeching out particularly on the high altitudes. Conditions on the high altitudes are extremely acid.  There again there is a research problem as to how far we ought to attempt to correct acids in areas that may be uneconomic to correct.  We ought to encourage areas where there is a very high degree of acidity, a high rainfall and a high amount of leeching out to go in for crops that are more tolerant of acidity. The Minister has encouraged the production of crops that are intolerant; they do not tolerate acidity.  Wheat does not give good results in acid soil. We talked at the inception of the emergency about the reserve of fertility we had in the old grass lands of this country and people who owned these lands were compelled to break them up <Col N="667" /> and grow wheat.  We thought we were going to get wonderful results but we did not get wonderful results.  We got big straw crops but a disappointing grain yield.  That was due to the acid in the soil.  We suffer loss in calcium not merely by washing out but we have been mining the surface by stock-raising for export as well.  We know that calcium and phosphates are the principal bone-building materials and we have been exporting these materials in the form of animals to Britain.  I do not think there is anything wrong in that; it is a good economy but nature demands that we return to the soil what has been taken out in that respect by the provision of calcium.</P>
    <P>Scientists have discovered that in acid soils you will not get the more nutritious grasses.  They will not persist, and certainly the legumes will not grow at all.  We know now that legumes are nitrogen-fixing plants. The legume fixes the nitrogen for other plants.  That is one way of providing the humus that is so necessary for fertility.  We know that one source from which humus can be provided is turf, which builds up fertility and provides the correct structure in the soil that can only be maintained, provided that not merely the physical condition of the soil but the constituents of the plant food that are so essential, are supplied if we are to encourage these grasses to persevere.  Nature has in an extraordinary way combined animal life with plant life, and modern soil scientists have helped to solve many of the difficulties that retard a most effective combination.</P>
    <P>I think it is agreed by our experts that there is an enormous quantity of grass lands in this country which were looked upon as good permanent pastures which have not as high a feeding value as we thought.  There is a high percentage of weeds and of the poorer grasses amongst them.  Sir George Stapleton, of Aberystwith, holds that there is no such thing as permanent pastures, that every pasture is artificially made, and that nature is continually reverting to the wild state.  It is through the intervention of men and animals that the best pastures have <Col N="668" /> been produced.  I have a cutting here from a South African paper which contains a statement by a well-known soil expert from America, Dr. Hugh H. Bennett, Chief of the United States Soil Conservation Service.  The cutting reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;South Africa is drying up on a large scale and already 25 per cent. of its agricultural land has been lost.  This was disclosed by Dr. Hugh H. Bennett, Chief of the U.S. Soil Conservation Service, in a report on South African agriculture undertaken at the invitation of the Union Government.  Dr. Bennett recommended a greatly increased soil conservation organisation with special powers and also greater cooperation between the State and the farmers, in order to eliminate destructive methods of farming by education and practical aid, backed by a national research programme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It might appear to us here in our climatic conditions, with our high rainfall, that there is no danger of that erosion of which Dr. Bennett states, erosion such as has produced the dust bowls of the States of Middle West of America.  We know there is a good deal of soil in a deteriorated condition in this country, and if we are to achieve the results that the Minister has attempted to envisage here to-night, the fundamental question we have to tackle is this soil problem.  We shall have to make a proper soil survey and have a proper soil service. We must have the soil of the country properly mapped, for that is the basis of scientific agriculture.  The scientist knows that grey speck in oats results from certain soil conditions found in silty peaty soils, but we do not know where these soil conditions occur over the country.  We know that on certain soils you have blackleg in beet and boron and that other soils produce crown rot, due to boron deficiency.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that very few farmers have any technical knowledge of these deficiencies.  When the Minister goes to a ploughing match he knows the skill and the capacity the young farmers show in producing a good seed bed.  Many of them, when they go home, attempt to do the impossible, <Col N="669" /> because the soil they work on has some deficiency that prevents them getting the results which they are entitled to expect.  This deficiency problem is very important.  World scientists and experts are questioning the necessity of ploughing at all these days, and much more attention is being directed to the problem of deficiencies in the soil.  In the past, even the best farmers considered that enough farmyard manure was not produced, and few got humus to give best results.  If certain important mineral and chemical deficiences were not corrected farmers would not get best results, no matter how they strive.</P>
    <P>I press the Minister to make provision for research, which is so essential if we are to correct that situation. Sweden is an outstanding example of a country that tackled this problem in a constructive way.  Having established a station in Svalov, South Sweden, they discovered that advice given from that experimental station did not suit northern centres.  We are in the same position here.  The Minister told us what the position was as regards the Albert College, but it is situate in a dry belt, and the results obtained there do not apply to conditions that exist in the South and West, in Kerry, Cork and even in Wexford, where I believe there is a big acid problem.  I am satisfied if that problem was corrected the Minister's friends in Wexford would obtain better results.  Sweden has set up seven or eight experimental stations in centres where they are typical of the districts they serve.  The Minister talked about the education of students.  The Vocational Organisation Commission has gone into that matter and, as well as I remember, recommended that there should be an agricultural institute in each county.  There are many agricultural and technical institutes in Great Britain.  The one in Cambridge has a world-wide reputation.  The Minister told us that the planning committee will go deeply into the question of agricultural education.  It is vital in a world that is applying scientific methods and that is going to make for much keener competition.  If we are going to stand up to that competition, we must prepare for it.  The Minister <Col N="670" /> talked about an export trade.  We must be equipped not merely with machinery, but with animal equipment and with technical knowledge.  I hope the planning committee will go into the question of having a scheme suitable for hill farms.  We have no source of information there to tell how much of our land is under hills, carrying very low quality of herbage which could be useful in the production of butter.  We have not attempted to put in a different coat of grass that would extend production.  There is a very substantial potential there that has not been tackled at all.</P>
    <P>We have a national drainage scheme, but a very big field problem if we are to make drainage advantageous.  Field drainage will have to be tackled.  There has been a big increase in the amount of drainage done in Great Britain during the war by mechanical means.  The day when men could be expected to dig drains with spades, at an economic cost, is gone.  Mechanical equipment must be provided.  The Minister referred to the provision of machinery. I think we should have some kind of a national institute of engineering, and a group of people paying particular attention to the type of machinery suitable to our conditions.</P>
    <P>When talking about the provision of humus, encouraging the making of farmyard manure, and about helping people to build walls for that purpose, I am sure the Minister knows that there is not nearly enough work of that kind done, and that too many of our people are continuing to cultivate, while making no attempt to provide the humus that is so vital to production. I hold that one thing operating against them is the enormous cost of producing and handling farmyard manure and getting it into the soil.  It is a very expensive commodity.  We will have to have a plan for machinery on a co-operative basis for the benefit of small farmers.  Other countries are doing that, and we must be as good as they are.  We have the ability, the brains and the muscle for the job. There is no reason why we should not succeed there, but we cannot expect our people to operate obsolete methods and to compete with countries where more modern scientific ideas prevail.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="671" /> The Minister made reference to the supply of fertilisers.  I am stressing these points in relation to one vital thing, how to use the soil.  I look upon the soil as the big national asset, and the farmers as the technicians using it in the national interest and for the benefit of the nation.  We cannot expect technicians to use the soil properly if they are not equipped to do so in every way.  It is a State responsibility to ensure that if our technicians are to be efficient they must have equipment.  I think the Minister will agree that a good deal of injury has been done to the soil by faulty husbandry during the emergency. That will have to be corrected at the earliest possible moment, and artificial manures will play an important part there.  The Minister did not give very much information on that point.  There is a conflict between industry and agriculture.  Are we going to give the protection to the manure factories that they enjoyed pre-war?</P>
    <P>Are we going to give the protection to manure factories in this country that they enjoyed pre-war or are they going to give us artificial manures&mdash; phosphates&mdash;at a competitive price? The price of phosphates jumped from £3 to £4 10s. as a result of the protection extended to the factories and which they did not want because they existed long before protection was put into operation.  According to statistics, there are roughly 1,000 operatives in the artificial manure factories, and of them only 100 are put down as skilled operatives.  The fact that artificial manure is costing here a price higher than in any other country in the world is reacting on 600,000 people who are engaged in agriculture.  That figure appears to be unbalanced.  I want to say to the Minister that this is a vital matter.  I should have asked the Minister whether there is going to be any exchange problem in the matter of securing North African phosphates and kainit from Alsace-Lorraine.  I take it that the French kainit quarries will be in operation next year.  Are we going to have any exchange problem so far as the franc is concerned or are we going to get the facilities for conversion that we got pre-war?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="672" /> The Taoiseach has said, and I agree with him, that there is a Christian responsibility on this country to make some effort to help Europe at the moment.  I do not think that our capacity to do that is very great, but I do make this suggestion to the Minister that if there is an exchange problem, France and most of the European countries want foundation stock&mdash; breeding stock&mdash;and that we here have a considerable export trade in heifers, in-calf heifers and maiden heifers, suitable for dairying and breeding purposes. It may be possible to make an arrangement with France to supply her with foundation stock in exchange for kainit from Alsace-Lorraine and raw phosphates from North Africa; and with Belgium too, for slag, when the Belgian factories start to operate again.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us about the small amount of nitrogenous manure that is available.  We have a problem again in regard to the supply of synthetic nitrogen.  Are we going to get nitrogen, sulphate of ammonia, from Great Britain, from Imperial Chemicals, or from Norway, when their factories operate again?  Has any further examination been given to the advisability of providing a factory here to produce our requirements in sulphate of ammonia?  That is a matter that ought to be carefully examined.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of helping Europe, there are very few commodities with which we can provide them. We could provide them with a certain amount of potatoes.  I think the most effective way in which we could help them is the way I have suggested.  In that respect, if we are really sincere in our efforts, we ought to try to ensure that the least possible number of female cattle is slaughtered in this country.  The countries in the world that have a surplus of live stock for the purpose of restocking Europe are very few in number, and we are one of them, and our capacity is not very great.  It ought to be possible to secure from France the necessary potash and phosphates for the coming year, and, in exchange, to help them to replenish their depleted cattle population.  I am well aware of the fact&mdash;and I am sure <Col N="673" /> the Minister is advised on it&mdash;that a deficiency of potash has been shown all over the country.  The plant colouration last year definitely indicated a rather serious potash deficiency.  We had no potash during the period of the emergency, and we have been drawing in an intensive way on the natural potash supplies, and one can understand that we are reaching a stage where the natural potash supplies have been seriously reduced.  We are using other materials that are helping to exhaust the supplies&mdash;lime, salt, and other materials.  Those applied to the soil help to release whatever supplies of potash are available.  Therefore it is most essential that every effort should be made to secure some supplies of potash for next year.</P>
    <P>I do not want to follow the Minister over the various branches of agriculture. We have a planning committee, and I suppose legislation will be required to implement the proposals that the Minister sees fit to implement. On the question of technical knowledge and research&mdash;I do not know whether the Minister has had this experience or not&mdash;I have had this peculiar experience, that some of the advisory services down the country are very dogmatic in laying down certain principles.  If one speaks to some of the scientists at Albert College one finds that they are not nearly as sure about things as the people down the country are.  We cannot afford to be dogmatic, but we will not be able to overcome that until we provide the institutions that we have been talking about throughout the country.  The man in Albert College is perfectly aware of the fact that what he has discovered there does not apply generally.  I believe that the more knowledge a man has in that respect the more cautious he is about laying down the rule that if you proceed in a certain direction you will get results. Some of the people who are going rusty down the country, in the advisory services, are inclined to be dogmatic. We cannot be dogmatic, especially when we have not got institutions that are typical of a particular area.  The Minister referred to Johnstown Castle, situated in his own constituency, Wexford. It is a grand gift to the State <Col N="674" /> and will be a very useful institution for Wexford and the neighbouring counties, but I think the Minister should be very careful when he is drawing up proposals not to have it open to the whole country.  If research is carried on there, and if discoveries are made that are applicable to the conditions in Wexford, they will not apply generally just as the conditions that are applicable in Albert College do not apply to the country generally.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that the planning committee is going to report on sales organisation.  I think that is most essential.  It has often struck me that we are one of the few countries which have a big volume of live-stock exports, and, as primary producers here, we hand over our live stock to a lot of people who have no great interest in price stabilisation.  The Minister talks about fluctuation during the last 12 months or so.  Those fluctuations are very often caused by the speculators.  Sometimes when the market tends to recover the speculators rush out and swamp that market, forcing the price down.  There is no control over that at all.  I am very glad to hear from the Minister that we are planning to provide machinery to operate some control over our marketing. The primary producer has no one to look after his interests in that respect, and it is about time that we should provide some machinery to do so.  It is not by any means a simple matter.  I could not offer a solution of it offhand.  I think it will require a lot of examination.  We should seek the opinions of decent, honest men who are sincerely anxious to help in the right patriotic spirit, men who have not a purely selfish interest in the matter, but who are anxious to help the agricultural community generally by providing the machinery necessary to iron out those inequalities and fluctuations which are so disastrous for them.  We all agree that stability in price is of paramount interest to the agricultural community.  The primary producers of the world generally are as anxious for stability, security and guaranteed prices as we are.  The British farmer is crying out for those things.  If the British agricultural organisation, which is looking after the <Col N="675" /> interests of the farmers there, can secure stability and guaranteed prices for them, there should not be any great difficulty in relating our prices to theirs, and in that way securing a high measure of stability.  We all know that Mr. Hudson, the Minister of Agriculture in Great Britain, has been paying a lot of attention in the last few years to the reorganisation of the live-stock industry there.  In Great Britain, they feel that they will have to improve the standard of their live stock; that all the cross-breeding which has gone on there has produced a very mediocre, nondescript animal, and they mean to stop it.  I think we ought to do the same here.  Possibly, the planning committee will deal with that matter.</P>
    <P>I want to know what efforts have been made to ensure that the quota of our live-stock trade will be taken definitely into account in their planning. I think we should try to have a comprehensive plan covering these isles, because our live-stock policy is inexorably linked up with theirs.  A very substantial measure of our prosperity depends on our live-stock trade.  I think we can all agree with many observations made by the Minister about this problem, but we should avail ourselves of every opportunity to secure that our live stock are not overlooked in Britain's development plan, so that our prices can be anchored to theirs.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the veterinary service, and I think he told us that he intended to put the plans into operation.  I presume he refers to the majority report.  I suppose it will require legislation to do that.  I feel that Dr. Kennedy's minority report has a good deal of merit from the point of view of providing veterinary surgeons on a salary basis.  He suggested that the initiative should be taken by the farmers themselves. There, I think he is speaking purely and simply from the co-operative point of view, and there is a big area in this country which has no co-operative organisation at all.  I think we ought to provide a veterinary service on the local authority basis; <Col N="676" /> that there ought to be a rate struck for the service.  You could exclude some work, but in regard to the treatment and prevention of disease, instruction to the agricultural community on animal feeding, the necessary precautions to be taken against disease, and that sort of thing, we ought to have a State service there. There ought to be a State contribution and a local rate as well.  I would suggest to the Minister that he ought to depart to some extent from the minority report in that, but I am inclined to favour that report because the Minister knows as well as I do that there is a good deal of quackery going on in this country.  It will take a great many years to depart from that quackery, and the only way to do it is to provide a State service. Great Britain has provided that service, and there is no reason why we should not have men on a salary basis here.  They need not cover everything, but they ought to have definite responsibility so far as the general health of the live-stock population is concerned.  There ought to be no great difficulty in doing that.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the production of grasses.  I am delighted to hear about the development of indigenous cocksfoot which is very important. I am glad to know that it will soon be available as a commercial proposition; that we have bred cocksfoot here at Albert College developed from County Meath.  We are too fond of trying to produce in this country exotic things that are not suitable to our conditions.  There is no reason on earth why we should not develop the indigenous grasses that will thrive under our conditions&mdash;the natural Irish grasses.  In that respect again we ought to be prepared to spend a good deal more on research, not merely in that but in every branch of agriculture, the production of cereals and everything else.  The money spent would be repaid a hundredfold.</P>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned the extension of the Botanic Gardens.  The particular matter which he described in County Wicklow will be a great asset.  What is the position about the director of the Botanic Gardens? <Col N="677" /> Have we any permanent director or when does the Minister propose to fill the post?  That is a very important matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a man who broadcasts very often, and I think he would be an ideal man as director of the Botanic Gardens.  I think that position ought to be filled if it is not filled already, and I do not think it is.  I do not propose to go into the other details affecting live stock, dairying, etc., because I think we ought to wait until we get the reports the Minister referred to.  When the legislation will be before the House implementing these reports we will get an opportunity of expressing our views.  I want to stress the urgency of having these reports and of having the recommendations put into operation in time.  There are, however, problems that ought to be tackled right away. There is the industrial aspect of the calcium problem.  I do not think that the existing machinery for supplying our requirements is nearly sufficient. Whether it ought to be a State enterprise, whether we ought to put it on a co-operative basis, or whatever way it ought to be done, it ought to be tackled immediately.  Then again, there is the fertiliser problem.  I put it to the Minister that these are two important problems which ought to be tackled this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing this Vote this year under a disadvantage, as we know that the post-war planning committee are about to issue a very important report.  We have got a very small hint as to what that report will contain, but we are at the grave disadvantage that we do not know exactly how far the recommendations of that committee will go.  The Minister, however, has indicated that he will put forward certain definite recommendations in regard to the stabilisation of <Col N="678" /> prices of certain agricultural products. In this matter the committee, and I think, the Minister who, to a certain extent, I am sure inspires that committee, are meeting a demand which has been put forward from these benches for a number of years.  Deputy Hughes says that this Party are fond of putting down motions.  This House is the legislative body of the nation and, when we want a thing done, it is right and proper that we should make a direct demand to the House to do it. This House has sovereign power.  This Party put down a motion some time ago asking that the price of a certain definite number of agricultural commodities should be stabilised on a remunerative basis over a long period of years, and we challenged the House to accept that motion.  The Minister at that time met us in a reasonable way, and I was rather reluctant to put the motion to a division in the House, but I felt it was necessary to make it absolutely clear that this Party were not in any way half-hearted in putting forward that demand, that we believed it was a sound one and that, if we did not divide the House on the question, it would be felt that we did not fully believe in the proposal which we were putting forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, it is quite clear that something very definite will be done in this matter and, therefore, there is no need to batter at a door which, we believe, will be opened.  The only thing I fear is that the number of commodities which this committee will recommend should command a stabilised guaranteed price will be more limited than we would hope for; but the Minister has certainly indicated that dairy produce and bacon can be so controlled that the producers of these two commodities can expect a remunerative price.  That is a very important concession on the Minister's part, because we have in this House a type of individual who claims that you cannot fix the price of any agricultural produce of which you have even a small exportable surplus.  I have tried to educate that type of individual, but it does not seem to be possible.  Some people assume a shroud of knowledge and shut their minds completely against attempts on the <Col N="679" /> part of more enlightened people to educate them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes referred to some agricultural instructors as being too dogmatic.  A philosopher has said it is wrong to dogmatise concerning dogs.  The same is true of agriculture. But agricultural instructors are not the only people who try to dogmatise in regard to agriculture.  We have other people in this house who try to lay down certain dogmas which I am sure their own intelligence must convince them are false.  We have, for example, the idea so frequently expressed in this House that subsidies for agriculture are all wrong; that subsidies for agriculture mean feeding the dog with his own tail.  When I hear one particular Deputy saying that subsidising agriculture is like bending a dog into a hoop and stuffing his tail into his mouth, I cannot but feel that that particular Deputy is bending himself into a hoop and stuffing his feet into his mouth.  We have had Deputy Hughes strenuously advocating <Col N="680" /> very far-reaching subsidies for agriculture.  We know that there is a deficiency of lime in the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, Deputy Hughes put himself in the wrong by saying last week that he agreed with Deputy Dillon's approach to the question of subsidies.  He said that subsidies tended to crystallise inefficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister went a long way to-night to agree with my point of view, namely, that subsidies can only be justified as a temporary measure.</P>
