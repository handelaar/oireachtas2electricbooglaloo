      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware that grave dissatisfaction exists amongst wool producers regarding the prices paid by wool merchants for wool this season; and, if so, if he is prepared to fix a minimum price for all grades of wool purchased from the producers and to make such prices retrospective from the beginning of the 1945 season.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already stated in reply to another question on the same subject, wool prices are a matter for arranging <Col N="1774" /> between buyer and seller, so long as the maximum prices set out in the 1944 Order are not exceeded.  The maximum prices set out in that Order remain unchanged for the 1945 season. These prices are well above world prices for wool of like quality, and I understand that last year merchants found it difficult to dispose of certain kinds of wool purchased at maximum prices.  I do not propose to fix minimum prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if, in view of the report of the carriage inspector of hackney vehicles and the altered circumstances, he will make an Order to release tyres from stocks held by Dunlops and Goodyears for hackney owners, who, in many cases, find it difficult to keep their vehicles on the road because of worn-out tyres and the impossibility of getting them replaced or remoulded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The rubber supply position has necessitated the suspension for some years past of the manufacture of tyres for all light motor vehicles. There has been no alteration in the circumstances in this connection and consequently there are no stocks of new tyres which can be made available for hackney vehicles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if his attention has been drawn to an advertisement issued by the Great Northern Railway to the effect that they have lorries available for the haulage of sand and gravel; and, if so, if he will state why the Great Northern Railway can advertise for such work, whereas lorry owners and sand and gravel contractors engaged in this work cannot obtain sufficient supplies of petrol to fulfil their contracts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been furnished with a copy of a notice, inserted by the Great Northern Railway Company (Ireland) in two newspapers published in Drogheda, which indicated that the company had available a limited number <Col N="1775" /> of vehicles suitable for the haulage of sand, gravel, etc.  I assume that this is the advertisement referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The Great Northern Railway Company (Ireland) engage in the transport of sand and gravel as a normal part of its business as a public transport concern. In the early part of this year, applications for the hire of vehicles from the company for the haulage of sand and gravel had to be declined owing to the company's inability to provide suitable vehicles.  The company was subsequently in a position to purchase suitable vehicles and the notice above referred to was inserted as a means of apprising those concerned of the altered position.</P>
      <P>The notice does not contain the implications suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewFogarty" hpid="Mr. P.J. Fogarty Mr. P.J. Fogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister state when the Great Northern Railway Company engaged in the business of the haulage of sand and gravel? And is it not correct that the Minister's allocation of petrol is based on the amount of business done in the year 1939?  Is the Minister not well aware that the Great Northern Railway Company never engaged in the haulage of sand or gravel and can he say how this company can advertise for work while sand and gravel contractors, who have been engaged in the business all their lives, cannot get sufficient petrol to deal with contracts they have in hand?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is misinformed. The company have always engaged in the haulage of sand and gravel.  They were unable to engage in that work early this year because of lack of suitable vehicles and the notice was merely to apprise their clients that they are now in a position to resume the service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that Córas Iompair Eireann repudiates liability for the payment of medical expenses under Section 73 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1934, in respect of workmen injured by accident within the meaning of the Act, except in cases where the compensation is fixed by order of the court; whether he is aware that in very many cases no matter of dispute arises relating to the character of the accident and that compensation is payable voluntarily, no agreement being registered; and, if so, whether, in view of the fact that in the latter case the doctors claim fees from the injured workmen which, in the nature of the case, they are unable to pay, he is prepared to make representations to the company that they should in such cases pay the medical expenses not exceeding £5 or, if this course is impracticable, whether he is prepared to amend the law so as to make it clear that employers are liable for the payment of medical expenses in any case in which compensation is payable under a voluntary unregistered agreement.</P>

As the Deputy is aware, the section of the Act referred to by him does not impose any liability on the company save in the circumstances set out in that section.</P>
      <P>I am aware that in very many cases no matter of dispute arises relating to the character of the accident and that compensation is payable voluntarily, no agreement being registered, but I have no information that doctors concerned in such cases claim fees from injured workmen which the latter are unable to pay.  In the absence of more information, I am not prepared to make any representations to the company or to undertake to amend existing legislation in the manner indicated by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that a number of licensed haulage contractors, whose licences permit only the standard unladen weight of 2 tons 2 cwts., are now finding it impossible to replace their obsolete lorries with lorries within the standard maximum unladen weight of 2 tons 5 cwts., as the only new lorries now available are 28 h.p. unladen weight 2 tons 11 cwts.; and, if so, whether in view of the unavoidable discontinuance of a number of the lorries within the 2 tons 5 cwts. unladen weight limit, and the hardships resulting therefrom, he will state if he is prepared to amend the Transport Act, 1944, to enable those concerned to purchase and license lorries, the unladen weight of which does not exceed 2 tons 11 cwts.</P>

      <P>On the representations of the Irish Licensed Hauliers' Association, provision was made in the Transport Act, 1944, for substantial increases in the standard lorry weight <Col N="1778" /> specified in existing carriers' licences. I am satisfied that there are no grounds to justify further increases, and that when it is possible to procure new vehicles hauliers should have no difficulty in obtaining lorries within the prescribed limits.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1783" /> The figures I have given for compensation include costs.  Statistics not being available for the years 1934 and 1935 in respect of Department of Posts and Telegraphs vehicles, my statement does not take account of those years so far as the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is concerned.  Also, it would not be possible without a disproportionate expenditure of time and labour to indicate the number of drivers involved or the number of persons to whom compensation has been paid in the case of Army vehicles. Consequently, the figures given for the number of drivers involved and of persons to whom compensation has been paid exclude cases involving Army vehicles.  Further, the figure for aggregate compensation does not quite refer to the calendar years 1934-1943, as statistics in respect of the Army were available only for the financial years 1933-34&mdash;1943-44.  Finally, the figure for the aggregate amount of compensation paid has had of necessity to include certain payments of compensation where other than mechanically propelled vehicles were involved in the case of the Army owing to the impossibility of extracting separate figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to reply to questions Nos. 16, 17, 18 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>The balance of payments between this country and the hard currency countries has always been heavily against us, and the amount of hard currencies which it has been possible to accumulate or which could be acquired from Irish residents under emergency finance legislation is extremely limited.  Even including the capital element, the amount available would finance our imports from the hard currency countries for a short period only.  All currencies as they are acquired are placed to the credit of the Foreign Exchange Account set up pursuant to Section 49 of the Finance Act, 1941.  As the Deputy is aware, the section provides for the annual examination of the account by the Comptroller and Auditor-General and for the publication of a final statement when the account is being wound up.  Initial purchases for the account were financed by advances from the Central Fund and subsequent purchases by further advances in so far as the proceeds of sales, for essential purposes, of currencies already held were insufficient.  The amount of such advances now outstanding is £2,661,000.  It is not possible to make any reliable estimate of the amount of any particular currency which it may be possible to acquire from Irish residents in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Negotiations have not been entered into recently with any country in <Col N="1785" /> regard to currency matters.  For some time to come, at any rate, the amount of goods which can be imported into this country will be limited not so much by currency considerations as by scarcity of supplies abroad and by lack of transport facilities.</P>
    <P>There is complete freedom of movement of sterling funds within the sterling area so that accumulations in Great Britain of sterling assets of Irish residents are available to finance the imports from any part of that area.  Consequently, it is assumed that as goods in the greater part of the sterling area become available for export or re-export this country will get its share.</P>
    <P>The general position is under constant review and every effort is being made to mitigate the disabilities arising from the scarcity of certain foreign currencies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned I was dealing with the objectionable character of this Bill and the fact that it displays little idea of whatever policy the Minister has in mind concerning the future of the national stud.  I was dealing, in particular, with Section 13, subsection (2), paragraph (d) which makes provision for the remuneration to be paid to the chairman and other directors of the company.  I think that this type of board, which is to be subject to the whim of whatever Minister is in office, is objectionable from many points of view.  The Minister has not given the House any indication of the particular type of people that he has in mind for appointment on the board. <Col N="1793" /> Whatever individuals are appointed to the board will be removable at the whim of the Minister.  They will be entirely dependent for their retention as members of the board on his good opinion.</P>
      <P>This particular type of board and company has come under the stringent strictures of the Vocational Commission Report.  Irrespective of the findings of that report, it is undesirable that a committee or board of this kind should be dependent for their retention on whatever Minister is in power. It is further undesirable that the Minister and the Minister for Finance should fix the salaries of the members of the board.  Anybody of independent mind would not desire to be dependent on a Minister or group of Ministers for appointment or retention as a member of the board.  While it may be a suitable type of board from the point of view of placing political nominees in lucrative positions, it is very undesirable that in a matter such as the national stud, which is in no way contentious, which is in no way disputed by the various Parties here or by the various interests, a board of this nature should be placed in control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know who drafted this Bill. I am quite sure that none of the officers of the Department favour this type of legislation.  I do not know what the Minister's intention concerning the Bill is but, so far as I and most of the Deputies who have spoken are concerned, we regard this legislation as objectionable.  We regard it as detrimental to the securing of efficient personnel that a board of this kind should be set up, the members of which are dependent on a Minister for their appointment and retention and who possibly will have no knowledge whatever of stud management or of bloodstock breeding.  It is vital in a matter of this kind that the personnel of the board should have detailed knowledge of every aspect of thoroughbred breeding.  There is no stipulation as to the qualification of any member of the board, merely the phrase, that the board shall be appointed by the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and the usual stipulation in boards of this kind that they will have to hold one <Col N="1794" /> share each&mdash;which merely conforms to the requirements of the Companies Act&mdash;and the share is held in trust for the Minister.  The person has no interest, good, bad or indifferent, in the affairs of the company because he is not dependent on the success of the company for his remuneration and his sole consideration will be to remain in the good offices of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Bill is singularly lacking in any indication of the stud policy that will be pursued by this stud.  This Bill has been considerably delayed and now it is brought in in a most disappointing form.  There is no indication of the type of horses it is proposed to breed there.  There is no indication of the terms on which it is proposed to lease horses or of the facilities which are to be afforded to small breeders or a large breeders.  It is assumed that the stud is intended primarily to benefit the small breeders of this country and, so far as I can see, it has been drafted in a rather haphazard fashion by individuals who may have their own point of view in the matter but who are not conversant with the interests of the small breeders or with the type of legislation that should be enacted and who have, possibly, no particular concern in ensuring that whatever public money is spent will be subject to examination by the Comptroller and Auditor-General. According to the Bill, the audited accounts shall be laid on the Table of the House, but they are not subject to control by the Comptroller and Auditor-General or to scrutiny by the Committee of Public Accounts. So far as these provisions are concerned, they are entirely contrary to the type of legislation that should be enacted and entirely contrary to the best interests of the stud, because there is no possibility of the Dáil having an indication of the policy that is being pursued.</P>
    <P>So far as this stud has been concerned in the past, the British Government had considerable difficulty with many stud owners who disputed the wisdom of leasing horses to particular individuals without affording bloodstock owners and breeders in general an opportunity of purchasing or bidding <Col N="1795" /> for the horses with a view to racing them.  They carried on for a long time leasing to one particular owner and, after his death, they leased them to the King.  I do not know whether or not the President proposes to race in this country, if the stud produces any horses, but I think it is undesirable that all matters of this kind should be covered over by the phrase in the Bill, that the object of the company will be to establish and maintain a stud.  As far as I am concerned, I am resolutely opposed to this Bill as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was reading what Deputy Costello said in his speech on this Bill on the 27th June.  He points out that, in accordance with the terms of the Bill as at present drafted, the board it is proposed to set up seems to be responsible to nobody.  I should like to see a national stud in this country, for two reasons&mdash;one, because the average small breeder in this country has not access to the best sires because very often he is not able to afford the fee when the sire is in private ownership, and, secondly, because some of the biggest and wealthiest breeders in this country, who have brought into this country some of the finest brood mares in the world, have not access to some of the best sires in England because those sires are owned by syndicates of owners who divide up amongst the members of the syndicate the services of the sire concerned and nobody outside the syndicate is allowed to have access to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the old days, a man like Lord Derby or one of the great patrons of racing in England, such as the Aga Khan, might own a great sire and, after his own mares had been served, the other owners in the country would probably be given facilities, in accordance with the quality of the mare they had for service.  It is only a comparatively recent development that these very valuable sires have become the property of syndicates, and that no matter how high a quality brood mare an independent owner has, he will not be allowed, on any terms, to <Col N="1796" /> have the service of the really ideal sire.  Therefore, I think we should face the fact clearly that in establishing a national stud in this country we are not thinking exclusively of the small owner and breeder who is excluded from access to the best sires by purely financial considerations.  We should also have our eyes wide open to the fact that very wealthy owners and breeders in this country would be facilitated by our national stud.  At first glance it may seem odd that we should consider it expedient to think of such persons in connection with a national service of this kind; but, of course, the fact is that the reputation of Irish bloodstock is very largely conditioned in the world by the news that an Irish-bred horse has won the Derby, the Grand National, the Grand Prix at Longchamps, or some other internationally famous race.  If our bloodstock were to disappear altogether out of the first rank in such races, the injury to the good name of that class of bloodstock all over the world would be very great.</P>
    <P>If, then, our main purpose in establishing Tully Stud is to place at the disposal of private owners in this country the kind of sires to which they cannot have access owing to the syndicate system and the high fees charged for sires in Great Britain, what should we envisage this stud as doing?  I do not know enough about horse-breeding to offer any very exhaustive opinion as to how a stud should be run and there is no use in my pretending that I do. I know that it is a very useful thing to have the stud, but the principal reason why I want to have it is in order to have some person&mdash;in this case, the national stud at Tully&mdash;wealthy enough to go into the market and purchase expensive sires.  Now, I beg this House to remember that as much as £100,000 has been bid for one sire horse &mdash;and that is a very substantial sum. I do not say that that is a very common occurrence, but I think I am right in saying that the price of first-class blood has gone up to that figure.  We would make an egregious mistake if, when we are setting Tully Stud on foot, we excluded from our minds the possibility of going to the very top price necessary <Col N="1797" /> in order to get the very best blood that could be purchased.</P>
    <P>I know this much about horse breeding. Sometimes, a man may pay £70,000 or £80,000 for an untried sire, believing that on its breeding and performance its progeny ought to be superb, only to discover that, in fact, its progency is practically worthless. That is one of the risks of breeding. There is the great danger that, in a State-controlled or State-managed institution of that kind, its director will not dare take that kind of risk, lest furious criticism, founded on false ideas, should assail him.  Therefore, in passing a Bill of this kind we should boldly face the fact that if a stud of this character is to be operated successfully at all the director of it should have the assurance that, provided he uses reasonable prudence, fault will never be found with him for making the kind of mistake that no man conceivably could have avoided making when he bought a sire horse in the hope that he was securing for the breeders of this country quite exceptional blood.</P>
    <P>I want the Tully Stud to buy that kind of horse.  If the Tully Stud were in the market, I would have it buy for us, say, Hyperion, Bahram and others of that kind&mdash;one of which I believe has gone to the United States of America and another of which is in the hands of a syndicate in Great Britain. If we are not going to buy that type of horse at Tully, then it would be very much better if we had not any stud at all.  If the Tully Stud were to be used for the production of medicore sires, far from doing good it would do harm.  Now, possibly the Minister will toss his head when I express such apprehension, but I do not think the Minister realises how difficult it may be to carry conviction to everybody's mind that it was no crime to have misspent £70,000 on a sire which turned out, in fact, to be virtually useless. Running the stud on the right lines as I see it is a very difficult thing to do, if you have to answer to Parliament for every year's crop of foals dropped as a result of your activities.  Therefore, I want to go on record clearly that, in so far as I understand stud management at all, I want to see the <Col N="1798" /> Tully Stud having the finest sires that money can buy.  It does not follow from that that they all must cost £100,000.  Some of the finest sires have been bought for a £10 note.  That is a matter which ought to be left in the hands of the discerning management with which we should furnish the stud.</P>
    <P>The next point is as to how the stud should be run.  I have strongly objected to the placing of public moneys in the hands of persons who are not answerable to this House and I object to all expedients designed to divert public moneys round this House into the pockets of persons not responsible to this House.  Deputies will remember that in the Racing and Racecourses Bill we gave the Racing Board power to levy taxes, to levy a commission on every bookmaker's bet.  It simply meant that instead of pursuing the normal practice of allowing the Revenue Commissioners to levy the tariff on the bookmaker's bet and then pass it on through the Exchequer to the Racing Board, we cut out the Revenue Commissioners, our representatives, altogether, and we allowed the Racing Board to go around Dáil Eireann and levy taxes on bookmakers, for which, as far as I know, they have to account to nobody.  That is a rotten principle.  But another variety of that principle it to set up a semi-autonomous company, empower it to spend public money and so constitute it that, if any Deputy wants to raise a question in Dáil Eireann regarding the administration of this body, the Minister can say: &ldquo;I have no responsibility at all; my responsibility ends the moment I pass the public money to it and then it has absolute discretion to do what it likes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Nor does it stop there&mdash;and this, Sir, is a matter which few Deputies realise: when the Estimate comes before the Committee of Public Accounts, the chairman of that body, representing the Dáil, is bound to determine whether any given matter is a matter of account or not.  The transactions of the kind of company envisaged in this Bill are not a matter of account, and no Deputy on the committee can ask the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture a single question about them, as he is <Col N="1799" /> in a position to say: &ldquo;The day I passed over the funds to that company my responsibility ended, and my only obligation is to produce to the Committee of Public Accounts a voucher showing that this independent company has received the amount.&rdquo; We have in existence already many bodies of that kind, and again and again the committee has come up against that stone wall, that the accounting officer has made that reply to an inquiry; and while I was chairman of that committee I was bound to say: &ldquo;Any further question in regard to that matter is irrelevant, as the accounting officer has produced his voucher and there the responsibility ends; if you wish to bring this matter further, raise it in Dáil Eireann and, if the Ceann Comhairle lets you get away with it, more power to your elbow.&rdquo;  Invariably, when the matter was so raised, the Minister replied that it was a matter in which he had no responsibility and the Ceann Comhairle was constrained to say that, inasmuch as the Minister was not responsible, the matter was not relevant to the proceedings of this House.  That is a very bad system, and I urge most strenuously on the Minister that, instead of having recourse to this extraordinary device, he should appoint as director of the Tully Stud a servant of his own Department and he should invite a certain number of persons to act in an advisory capacity to that director.</P>
    <P>I do not think Deputy Cosgrave faced the difficulty of a proposition which he seemed to favour.  Public life is a rough arena, and only a certain type of man has the moral courage to enter into it.  There are a lot of fellows in this country getting fat on profits because they take damn good care to get adequately paid for every hour of work they do. People of that type are very eloquent in their condemnation of politicians, for whom they have a great contempt. When you ask the same tulips to come down and do the work we do, you would not see them for the dust of the road, because they are flabby, they are timorous, they are cowardly and they would be afraid to get up in any arena <Col N="1800" /> where another man had the right to tell them what he thought of them. Their sole occupation is sitting in well-padded chairs in offices where everybody is obsequious, deferential and admiring.</P>
    <P>You have to face the fact, when you are undertaking highly technical enterprises of this kind, that there may be occasions when you may have to avail of these flabby creatures' technical knowledge, but the moment you tell them their appointment to the executive of a body of this kind leaves them open to criticism in Dáil Eireann, they are gone like a flash. That is not their idea of fun at all and they will not work.</P>
    <P>Now, I think it is necessary, in operating a body of this kind, to get some of these jelly fish and extract from them such technical knowledge as they have, but the only way to do that is to give them the cloak of anonymity, without which they cannot comfortably live, and appoint a director who will be a public servant, acting within the usual limits of the public service and answerable to this House, through the Minister.  The choice of such a person will present great difficulty and we can only trust that the Minister will get the best man.  To give the devil his due, I was not at all optimistic about the personnel of the racing board under the Bookmakers Bill.  When I saw the personnel that was selected, I thought it was as good a board as anyone could pick.  I am prepared to take the risk in this instance of letting the Minister pick the board and be responsible for the members.  I am prepared to let him choose the directorate of the Tully Stud&mdash;somebody has to choose it&mdash;and if he uses the same goodwill in choosing these persons, I would be quite prepared to leave the choice to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt the choice made there was as good as could have been made if the House had been consulted on all sides.  I am quite content to leave the matter in the Minister's hands.  I am a great believer in the policy that if you choose a man to run a stud farm you should let him run it and not be jogging his elbow every hour of the day.  I would say to the director: &ldquo;You will have an advisory council of seven men&rdquo;, and I would tell him: &ldquo;You can choose them yourself&rdquo;.  If necessary, we ought to give the Minister authority to pay these men their out-of-pocket expenses, their vouched expenses.  Some of them probably will not bother to claim the money, but others might be in humbler circumstances and might have to claim it, and would rightly claim it if they were at a material loss as a result of their attendances at meetings of this advisory body.</P>
      <P>I think the director of the stud would have a substantial income from the fees and so forth that he would receive from the owners and it might be that from time to time he would have to ask for large sums of money by way of advances for the purchase of special bloodstock.  Ordinarily, I imagine he would ask for the making good of deficits which he had incurred. It would be no use, for instance, if a well-known sire were up for sale and we had the director coming to Dáil Eireann looking for an advance of £50,000, thereby notifying the owner of the sire that the stud was prepared to give £50,000.  From time to time, as a result of demands for moneys on the annual Estimate, the House would have an opportunity of expressing appreciation of the director, or making complaints, and raising the necessary queries and getting them answered in public.  In that way the public would be reconciled to the existence of the stud as an important national asset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1802" /> If the stud is to start out under suspicion as a private company, the details of whose management nobody knows anything of, and has to come to the House looking for large sums of money to purchase live stock, and coming occasionally with the kind of failures that those who sympathise with the project realise must be met with, no matter who is running it, then I think you will find the carrying on of the stud a virtual impossibility.</P>
    <P>Imagine some fellow at the crossroads clamouring about the stud being run to suit the convenience of wealthy horse owners who can pay £30,000 or £40,000 for a brood mare.  It would make material for a very trenchant speech at the country crossroads, and the only way to get a proposal of that kind the large volume of public support it requires to make it a success is to have everything open and above board and let the people see, the case having been submitted on its merits and considered by Deputies representing Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and the other interests represented here, that there is a general consensus of opinion that a good job has been done.  Without that we cannot make the stud a success; with it we could make it successful and, if we do so, we are securing to the country a very precious asset which, in the long run, will pay high dividends.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, let me say that many of us who are not professional breeders or racegoers have noticed with dismay that for the past two or three years classic race meetings, which in the past always had Irish-bred horses amongst the first three, are beginning to have those places occupied by French or English-bred horses, and no reference is made to Irish breeding at all.  If that were to continue for a protracted period Irish bloodstock, not only racing but hunting and horse flesh generally, would cease to command all over the world the esteem and goodwill it so long enjoyed.  Goodwill can be a very substantial part of the most precious asset of any business.  It is up to us, and I think we are probably the only persons in this country in a position to do it, to provide the means effectively <Col N="1803" /> to preserve that goodwill.  Tully Stud can contribute substantially to that end, provided it is run on the right lines, and those, I submit, are the lines which I have suggested to the Minister.  They are lines which, I believe, will secure substantial agreement on all sides of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know upon what advice the Minister acted when he gave this Bill its framework.  He certainly had the advice of the Vocational Commission.  We have had the spectacle here of two Ministers repudiating two churchmen in connection with matters recommended by the Vocational Commission. On one occasion the Minister for Local Government described the proposals for social security as impracticable. Those proposals had been formulated by Dr. Dignan, as Chairman of the National Health Insurance Committee. On another occasion we had the Minister for Industry and Commerce roundly condemning another bishop for the presentation of the Vocational Commission's report.  He described the work as slovenly, and, not only that, in answer to a query I put to him, he said that when that commission went outside the terms of their reference, they spoke more or less from the depths of their ignorance.  The Minister has been discreetly silent in introducing this Bill, but the Bill itself is symptomatic of the contempt which the present Government are showing towards the findings of the Vocational Commission, their own commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Bill, another fictitious company is being set up and the Vocational Commission roundly condemned this form of State intervention in business or private enterprise.  I think it extraordinary that the Minister did not say at the outset why the Government, in face of the findings of that commission, are sticking to this peculiar form of activity.  The fictitious company is really an evasion of the Companies Acts and for the Government to set an example of evasion is certainly not a laudable practice.  Secondly, the fictitious company, when formed by the State, brings up a number of considerations which I think it well the House <Col N="1804" /> should dwell upon.  In the first place, civil servants will be the nominees of the Minister as the chairman or directors of this new company, and I put it to the Minister that civil servants are not fitted, either by training or experience, for activities of this kind.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I think it a reprehensible principle that civil servants should be put on the board of any enterprise which may be regarded as competing with private business, and I would go so far as to say that in particular cases it may hold out certain inducements to civil servants, which, to say the least of them, would not be in keeping with their position as public servants.  On the other hand, this type of company lends itself to political patronage, and there is always the danger that a Government, in constituting the membership of the board of directors, will be influenced not so much by reasons of securing the best personnel for the direction of the stud but perhaps by political considerations. It is sometimes hard to discard and to put aside pressing political friends.  I am not saying that this has happened, but it is always a danger and, for that reason, it is to be condemned as a practice.</P>
    <P>Under the British dispensation, this stud was a trust, and, to my mind, it would have been a very simple matter for the Minister to divest this stud of its character as a public trust, to have gone to the breeders and racing people generally and said: &ldquo;This was a bequest made in British days.  I do not feel like taking it over.  I should like your advice on the matter and would like in particular to see whether a number of you gentlemen concerned in the breeding of bloodstock and in racing in Ireland would be prepared to buy out the State interest in this stud and run the stud as a private business enterprise, if necessary for profit.&rdquo;  I believe the small breeder and the big breeder, if an enterprise of that kind were undertaken, and if the Minister, in handing over the enterprise to these people, hedged them around with sufficient safeguards, would get as good results as are to be got from the semi-State institution envisaged in the Bill.  The Minister <Col N="1805" /> could have done that as one way out, but to take the course which he took is, to my mind, simply slamming the door in the face of the Vocational Commission.</P>
    <P>I should like to know on what advice he has taken this course.  Are the Government definitely committed, despite the findings of that commission, to this form of fictitious company enterprise?  Are the Government definitely committed to intervening indirectly in private business, because that is what it amounts to?  Alternatively, the Minister might easily have adopted the precedent which obtained in the British days.  As Minister for Agriculture, he could have taken over the enterprise, appointed a new manager or director and new personnel if he considered the existing personnel unsatisfactory in any way. The British Minister did that, and, so far as I know, the enterprise worked efficiently.  But the Minister did not do any of these things.  Under the Bill, he proposes to hand over the enterprise to a number of nominees.  I do not know who these will be, but I take it that two or three of the five will be civil servants and the balance some gentlemen experienced in breeding bloodstock.  I say that no civil servant in this country is qualified for a job of that kind, and I think every Deputy will agree with that.</P>
    <P>My principal quarrel with the Minister, however, is that under the Bill we are asked to do four things, from the finance point of view: to put up the money to promote this company; to find £250,000 to put up the share capital of the company; to find £100,000 to guarantee the borrowings of the company; and to provide an indefinite sum for the promotion of the various schemes outlined in Section 12.  We do not know now what the total effective demand upon the House will be, and from the experience we have had of some of the fictitious companies operated since the present Government came into being, I am not too sanguine that the moneys will be properly expended.  We have had cases under the Mines and Minerals Act&mdash;I have had personal experience of them&mdash;where money has been simply poured down the sink. <Col N="1806" /> Hundreds of thousands of pounds of State money have been advanced to these fictitious companies for which no return has ever been made and which, so far as the public knows, are lost.</P>
    <P>We may have the same position here if the wrong personnel gets control of the company, if, perhaps, people interested in outside ventures get control of it.  The Minister will have to take extreme precautions to ensure that whatever personnel is appointed will at least preserve the interests of the bloodstock of this country and that their minds will not be turned to the development of bloodstock elsewhere. The Comptroller and Auditor-General is to have no control over the finances of this company.  All the company is required to do is to furnish an annual balance sheet and the Minister may put certain queries to the auditor as to the working of the company and may ask for certain information, but the House has no check whatever on all these moneys.  I venture to suggest that the moneys are of sufficient proportion to warrant us in demanding that the House should have control of them and that there should be an annual rendering of accounts by this concern to the House.</P>
    <P>The other point with regard to the accounts is that there is no suggestion in the Bill that the auditor should be a qualified auditor.  Sean na Scuab might be appointed auditor of this company for all the Bill provides to the contrary.  It is not provided that he has to be a chartered accountant; it merely says &ldquo;an auditor&rdquo;.  I think in a matter of this kind there should be some provision to ensure that the company's auditor will be properly qualified to audit accounts under the Companies Acts.</P>
    <P>Those are my general objections to the Bill, and they are objections which have already been adumbrated by various speakers, so I do not want to waste the time of the House on them. But I should like to know from the Minister how he proposes to ensure that the small breeder will get ample consideration from the new company? How is it proposed to give nominations for services of sires of the Tully Stud?  Is it to be by ballot?  Is it to be by a waiting list, or how is it to be <Col N="1807" /> done?  A good deal of discontent and disappointment and abuse may arise if this part of the scheme is not handled properly.  The scheme will stand or fall by the manner in which the Minister ensures fair play for the small breeder.  I do not profess to know anything about racing&mdash;I am just one of the &ldquo;mugs&rdquo; who lose money on the course&mdash;but I should like to know from the Minister by what process of selection he hopes to ensure fair play for the small breeder.  To my mind the success or failure of the stud will depend upon the manner in which he handles that problem.  For the reasons I have given, I am strongly opposed to this Bill.  Apart from what it proposes to do to racing, the principle of State intervention in business enterprise by the method adopted in this Bill is one that has been roundly condemned by a very select body of Irishmen on the Vocational Commission, and it is one that we condemn strongly also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather surprised at the opposition to this Bill.  I did not think it would meet with any opposition at all, but evidently the members of Fine Gael made up their minds that they must oppose it.  They opposed it from a variety of angles, and, I might say, in contradictory ways.  However, they opposed it.  The first thing that is put to us is that we are rushing the Bill.  I do not want to rush the Bill at all.  If Deputies are prepared to go on for the next three or four weeks, I do not mind.  I have no objection, but I think I can at least convince the House, if they want to see reason, that it is important that this Bill should go through before the summer.  But we have plenty of time; there is no rush.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This appears to me to be a Bill that cannot very well be amended; therefore, if the Second Stage is passed by the Dáil there will not be very much object in giving the Bill a great deal of consideration in its remaining stages. As far as I can judge from the speeches, we are all agreed upon one thing, and that is that we should have a national stud.  There were, of course, as Deputies know, questions raised when we took over this property as to what we <Col N="1808" /> should do with it.  The matter was discussed by some of the daily papers and in public statements by people who are interested in agriculture in general, and it was suggested that the premises might be used for various projects, but as far as I can judge from the speeches here, every Deputy thinks it should be used as a national stud, and I think every Deputy agrees that it should be State controlled.  There are other ways in which a national stud could be worked.  You could call it a national stud and still have it worked, say, by floating a public company.  Any horse-breeders who wished to do so could take shares, and then the shareholders could be allowed to run it as a national stud&mdash;that is to say, it could be worked by private enterprise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>You could call it a national stud in the Bill, and you could lay down certain conditions governing the lease of the property.  Anyway, I think everybody agrees that it should be State controlled and should be State aided. Nobody is going to object to any reasonable provision that may be made for voting a certain amount of money from time to time for certain schemes that are referred to here, if they are desirable schemes.  I should say at this stage that any money that will need to be voted for special schemes will, of course, come before the Dáil, and there will be an opportunity for discussion of the schemes.  The only point of difference, as far as the members of this House and myself are concerned, is whether the management should be through a company or should be directly under myself or through the Department of Agriculture.  That is the only point at issue, so far as I can see from the debate.</P>

If I am beaten on it, then the other issue is decided too.  The big difference between us is going to be decided by a vote, if it goes to a <Col N="1809" /> vote on the Second Reading.  If it goes through the Second Reading, the Bill remains for the provision of a company to run the stud, and I do not think there is very much more that the Dáil can do.  There might be certain small amendments made, but they will not be of any great importance.  First of all, it is not possible to postpone this Bill, because the sooner we commence the better.  As the Bill is drawn now, unless we get it through both Houses within the next four or five weeks, or at any rate let us say by the middle of August, and then set up a company, it is not likely that that company would have got the necessary technical assistance that they will require&mdash;by way of a manager, or whatever they may decide&mdash;and be in a position to purchase horses in the autumn.  I think every Deputy knows that if this company is not in a position to purchase horses in the autumn they are not likely to get horses again until the following autumn, and therefore they will have lost a year.  I think we should agree on that point, if we think we should try to get this company going&mdash;if it is to be a company&mdash; and put them in a position to go ahead with the business.</P>
      <P>One would imagine from listening to the debate here that the first notification any member of the Dáil got of the type of arrangement which I intended to make was when this Bill was circulated.  Now, it was not by any means the first notification.  I could recollect having given information to the Dáil on more than one occasion, and I picked out two instances.  I think I could get more if I were put to it.  In answer to a question by Deputy Cosgrave on 30th November, 1944, that is eight months ago, when he asked me what was the intention with regard to the Tully Stud, I said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is the intention to entrust the work of directing the stud farm at Tully, County Kildare, to a company to be established under a special Act of the Oireachtas.  Steps for the preparation of a Bill for this purpose are at present being taken.  The Bill will be introduced as soon as possible, but I am not yet in a position to indicate the approximate date of introduction.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1810" /> Surely to goodness, any Deputy who then had the same objection to a company that he has now&mdash;Deputy Hughes or Deputy Coogan or Deputy Cosgrave&mdash;would have jumped up in protest when I answered that question, and would have said: &ldquo;For goodness' sake, not a company&rdquo;, but there was not a single word about it.</P>

      <P>This question was answered on 30th November, 1944. Surely to goodness there was no evasion or confusion about what was going to be done.  It was laid down specifically that a company was to be established under a special Act of the Oireachtas.  Again, when my Estimate was before the Dáil here on 17th May, 1945, I said, as reported in Volume 97, No. 2, column 636 of the Official Reports: &ldquo;With regard to the national stud, it is hoped to introduce legislation before we adjourn for the summer to entrust to a statutory company the work of conducting the stud farm at Tully.&rdquo;  Again, there was not a word from the Deputies opposite.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was not, as I have said, a word of protest from the Deputies opposite.  One would think, from the pious speech of Deputy Coogan, that it was almost a sacrilege to put forward in this House the idea of setting up a company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That it was almost a sacrilege to introduce a proposal for a company of this kind, but when the matter was mentioned here in the Dáil in November, 1944, and again in May, 1945, there was not a word from Deputy Coogan.  It passed off in just the normal sort of way that anyone <Col N="1811" /> might expect, but now we have all these protests from the members of Fine Gael.  They are not, however, very consistent in their protests, except in one thing that they thought they had got hold of a good thing and came here to quote the report of the Vocational Education Commission. Having read the leading articles in two daily papers they came in here to quote that report&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What I said was that the Deputy's pious speech was despicable.  He came in here and made that type of speech to try to get pious people in the country up against Ministers because they disagree with certain bishops.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway, we can go ahead.  As I have said, there was no objection whatever in November, 1944, or in May, 1945, from the Deputies of Fine Gael.  Apparently, they came to the conclusion then that they had no handle to go upon.  I wish to goodness I could be as decisive as the Deputies opposite as to how this stud should be run.  It is an extremely difficult thing to know how a stud of this kind should be run.  If, say, 6 or 8 months ago, when we were making up our minds about this Bill I could have been as decisive as Deputy Hughes or Deputy Coogan, I could have saved myself a lot of trouble, because I would not have had to give the matter any consideration at all just as they have not.  I, naturally, considered all the methods that have been mentioned.  It was put to me from a certain quarter &ldquo;why not lease the stud to some <Col N="1812" /> private individual&rdquo;, or, as I have said before, &ldquo;why not get 3 or 4 private individuals to float a company to take it over, to buy it or to lease it&rdquo; as the case might be.  I would object to that. The idea that I had in mind was that this stud should be worked, if at all possible, for the benefit of horse breeding in the country.  We go further than that and deal with the position of the small breeder.  The idea was that the stud should be worked for the benefit of horse breeding in the country.  The second alternative would be that the State should control it and that we should have a statutory company such as we are providing for in the Bill. The third method would be to work it direct under a Government Department. That is what a number of Deputies advocated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said what I am sure every Deputy in the House agrees with.  It was this: that whatever directors are appointed, and whatever manager is appointed, and whoever is responsible for the purchase of horses, if the person responsible is going to do his job well, he will have to take risks.  It may happen and, in fact, probably will happen that out of the first 5 stallions, for which he will pay so much, he will find that he will have only one good one amongst them, and that out of the first dozen fillies he buys, in the hope of having good brood mares, he may get only 1 or 2, if he gets that number. Suppose that were to go on for 3 or 4 years, and it probably would take that time to discover whether the stallions or brood mares bought were good ones, do Deputies think that we have reached such a high degree of civilisation in this country that the Minister, if he were responsible, would not be attacked here for his bad management? Of course, every Deputy knows that is what would happen, that the Minister would be attacked because the responsibility was his.  We have had experience of the way in which Deputies are capable of attacking Ministers.  I am quite sure that they would attack the Minister if he was responsible for the stud, having appointed the director himself, if there was a big loss on the horses that were bought.  Even if there was another <Col N="1813" /> Opposition in the House instead of that of Fine Gael, I can quite imagine how the members of it would attack the Minister and his director for making such bad bargains in purchasing horses.  Of course, if that happened the director would be finished, because naturally he would not take any further risks.  It would be impossible to carry on the stud under such conditions, and every Deputy knows that.  Yet, that does not prevent them from yielding to the temptation to reap a little bit of political kudos out of the Report of the Vocational Education Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose, I should feel complimented by the Deputies opposite seeking to put the obligation on me of running the stud myself.  I do not know anything about running a stud. Deputy Coogan said that all he knew about racing was what he learned from backing the wrong horses.  I do not even back wrong horses, because I do not back at all, so that I know even less than Deputy Coogan.  I do not know how to run a stud, and even supposing I were to undertake it, I would have to be advised.  Deputy Coogan said that civil servants were the last people in the world to do a job like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could be advised by an advisory board of racing people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does any Deputy seriously put it to me that it would be better for me to pick five men who know as much about racing as any I could pick in the country, put them on an advisory board to advise me, and then say to them: &ldquo;I accept your advice or I do not accept it&rdquo;, or whether it would not be better for me to say to them: &ldquo;Now, you have charge and responsibility, go ahead and do the job&rdquo;.  Deputies know quite well that it is far better that I should do the latter if it were not for the fact that they want to reap their little political kudos.  If Deputies were truthful they would agree with me that it is far better to pick five men who know all <Col N="1814" /> about racing and put the responsibility on them to do the job, and not have them in the position that they could come to me in six months' time or in two years and say: &ldquo;Well, it was not our fault; you would not take our advice&rdquo;.  I do not think there is any fair-minded Deputy who would seriously contend that it would be better to have those men as advisers rather than in full charge as members of the board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any business that is more technical in the first place and more speculative in the second place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my point.  The more speculative an enterprise, the greater the need for accounting to this House for the moneys advanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe one could think of any business that is more technical or more speculative. I will argue the other way.  Let us take, say, the Electricity Supply Board, any manager of which could come to the Minister at the beginning of the year, and say: &ldquo;We expect our consumption this year to be so much, our wages so much, extensions so much and, therefore, we must charge so much per unit.&rdquo;  I think a Minister could run that business without any trouble because it is like running a Government Department.  But, who is the director who could come to me and say: &ldquo;We will have to pay so much for horses; we will get so much for the horses we sell and, therefore, we can let our two-year-olds for racing at such a rate and let our stallions for service at such a rate&rdquo;?  Who is the man that could give me an estimate like that?  Nobody could do it.  Deputies know that very well.  It is so technical and so speculative that it could not possibly be run by a Government Department under the ordinary methods of financing.  Deputy Dillon pointed <Col N="1815" /> out the absurdity.  He said that he did not expect that a Minister could come before the Dáil, and say: &ldquo;There is such a stallion going for sale and I want the Dáil to give me £50,000&rdquo;.  I know that would be absurd and I do not say that if it was run direct you would need to go that far but you would have to comply with the ordinary methods of Departmental financing and it is not suitable at all for a business of this kind.  What is more, it is not right&mdash;whatever Deputies may say&mdash;that a director of such an establishment should be subject to criticism for every act of his and Deputies will not resist the temptation of attacking the Minister if a mistake is made.</P>
      <P>There were various other things said. Deputy Costello started a hare.  I do not know where he got his information. He talked about a trust.  There was no such thing as a trust in the national stud.  The British Government never created a trust.  The British Government, I admit, ran that place as Deputies opposite want me to run it now. The only thing I can say in that regard is that it was a small thing for a big Government like the British to run and a small item in their Department where the total Vote is many millions more than it is here.  It was a small item and not so much notice was taken of it but they did run it direct by appointing a director.</P>

      <P>The British Government purchased Colonel Hall-Walker's interest in the Tully establishment for about £47,000.  There was, therefore, no question of the bloodstock having been presented and accepted as a national trust&mdash;none whatever.  The Deputy thought I was omitting something. The Deputy can come over and read it out for himself.  That is the position. I say Deputy Costello started that hare of a trust.  There was no such thing.  Deputy Costello also said that there was no opportunity for this Dáil to see what was being done.  He possibly did not read the Bill, but if he had read it, he would see in Section 25 that the accounts must be audited. The report of the year's working and the accounts must be presented first to the Minister for Agriculture, and eventually to the Dáil, so that the Dáil will know from year to year what is taking place.  It is true that if a question is asked of me about the purchase of a certain stallion, for instance, or the grievance of a certain breeder that he did not get a nomination for his mare, I will not be in a position to answer it in <Col N="1817" /> this House, but I think it is all to the good that I should not be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House should know what the policy is, but I think Deputies will have to agree that if they want to come down to the point of finding fault with a manager for giving a nomination to one man and not to another, it would be impossible for the manager to carry on.  It would be advisable, I admit, and as far as it can be effected it will be done, that preference should be given to small breeders but, on the other hand, suppose a large breeder had a very good mare that would be eminently suitable for mating with a good stallion in the national stud, that would be likely to produce a world champion, let us say, would not it be very unfair if the company were precluded from giving the stallion to the mare owned by the big breeder?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The company must have a certain amount of freedom.  We could lay it down as a matter of policy that small breeders should get a preference.  I am not saying that rule should be made because I have not thought about it.  We could say that not more than a certain number &mdash;one if you like, or two, if you like&mdash; of mares from any one breeder should be served in the national stud.  In that way, no big breeder would get a great advantage over the small men. The annual report will be laid upon the Table and that will give an opportunity, if any Deputy wants to raise the matter, for a discussion on general policy if he is not able to get sufficient information on policy during the year. On the Minister's Estimate, for instance, that question could be discussed also because anything that he is responsible for, I take it, will be discussed when his Estimate comes up <Col N="1818" /> and he will be definitely responsible for the policy pursued by the national stud.</P>

    <P>Deputy Norton made a point about staff.  I do not think Deputy Norton has anything to be afraid of.  I did state specifically that the staff would be notified on a certain date that their services were dispensed with and the company would then come in and take over.  It is the intention, I assure Deputy Norton, that the company will take them over, but I am advised legally&mdash;unfortunately I do not know as much about law as perhaps I should&mdash;that if we put the obligation on the company of taking over the staff it might possibly give that staff a right that we never intended and that they could stay there for the rest of their lives, no matter how unsatisfactory they might be.  I can assure the Deputy that the intention is that the company will <Col N="1819" /> take them over and treat them as humanely as any company would, and that as long as they are satisfactory they will be kept.</P>

      <P>Yes.  When the company is calculating the gratuity on the man's retirement, it will go back to the 1st January, 1944, where the man got a gratuity from the British.  There are some cases in dispute with regard to the term of service, where an employee was employed at the national stud in the time of the British Government and had not a sufficient number of years' employment to qualify for a gratuity.

      <P>Will the Minister do that by formal representation to the company or by making it obligatory in the articles of association?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to say.  As regards the point made by Deputy Mrs. Redmond, I am having it looked into.  All these points will be dealt with in the lease or the licence or in the memorandum of association, as the case might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will we have an opportunity of seeing the lease or licence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if all these papers will be laid on the Table.  I would refer to a question which will illustrate that point.  Deputy Mrs. Redmond asked if we would enjoin on the company in some way the proper upkeep of the Japanese Gardens, so that they would continue to be a show place for visitors.  As Deputies know, they were very famous in their own way.  For some legal reason, it appears to be an extremely difficult thing to put that into the memorandum of association, but we can put it into the lease. In other words, in granting the new company a lease or licence I can make it subject to the maintenance of the gardens in a proper way.  Whether it be by putting it in <Col N="1820" /> the memorandum of association or in the lease or licence or by way of a gentleman's agreement&mdash;which may be as good as anything else&mdash;Deputy Norton may rest assured that the employees will be looked after.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave objected that the men who would be appointed as directors would not be sufficiently free agents, as they would be appointed by the Minister for Finance and their fees or remuneration would be fixed by him also.  Strictly speaking, that is true&mdash; they will be appointed by the Minister for Finance, they will be removable by him and whatever remuneration they get will be fixed by him.  On the other hand, Deputy Costello made the very opposite point about this, saying that the directors were absolutely independent of anybody once appointed and no one could interfere with them. Whether Deputies Cosgrave and Costello want a fair measure of independence for these men or not I do not know, but the position is that they will be appointed by the Minister, removable by him and whatever remuneration they receive will be fixed by him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister does not want to misinterpret Deputy Costello, but surely he has misunderstood Deputy Costello's point?  It was that their activities could not be discussed by this House, which is a different thing.  He did not say they were utterly independent, but he maintained that, owing to the independence of the company, their activities could not be discussed by this House.  That is not inconsistent with Deputy Cosgrave's point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy Costello stressed the absolute independence of these directors, perhaps he meant independence of this House.  I may have been wrong there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not that so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they are independent of criticism in this House.  Deputy Cosgrave also mentioned a point which I do not think he had considered fully or he would not have made it&mdash;that the Bill was not detailed enough, as we had not pointed out the types of horses it was intended to buy.  That <Col N="1821" /> would be a very difficult thing to put in a Bill of this kind and would place a great restriction on the body that is to be set up.  It is understood by everybody, of course, that the national stud is for the purchase and breeding of high-class thoroughbred horses and that there is not the slightest intention to do anything else&mdash;to breed Clydesdales, for instance.  I repeat that the policy to be pursued&mdash;which is one of the things to be laid down by the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;is to get the very best horses that can be bought and to try to improve the breeding of high-class thoroughbreds in this country.</P>
      <P>It is true that the accounts are not subject to the audit of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  However, they must be audited by an auditor approved by the Minister for Finance and the report will come before this House.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go into the controversy which has been started here with regard to the question of companies in general.  Deputy Coogan made a point that this is a fictitious company and is an evasion of the Companies Acts.  It is to some extent departing from the Companies Acts, but to say it is an evasion is hardly fair, since whatever departure there is from the Companies Acts is laid down in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but &ldquo;evasion&rdquo; is hardly the word, as it is done with full publicity.  It is brought before the Dáil and it is pointed out in what way it differs from the Companies Acts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>It is not an evasion.  I would not like the Dáil to assume from what Deputy Coogan said that it is proposed to man this company by civil servants or that that was the expected result.  I could not honestly state at the moment who are likely to be the directors, but I must say that I had not in mind that the company should be manned principally by civil servants.  That is one of the big points which made me decide in favour of a company rather than direct control&mdash;the fact that I had not got civil servants in the Department of Agriculture who knew anything about the breeding of racehorses.  It is something we have never dealt with, and it is a very specialised subject. If I had men on my staff with experience in that business, I might have been inclined to take the other line&mdash;although I do not think I would, for other reasons which I have given &mdash;but I have not got them and I do not think it is likely that there will be a majority of civil servants on the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is not correct in that?  Is there not a tradition in the Department where the officers of the Department select brood mares?  Have they not done so with outstanding success and why should they fail in this case? That is a reflection on the officers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Deputy to understand that there are very many men in this country who are good judges of horses on appearance, who are very good judges of hunters, and so on, and we have veterinary surgeons who are quite capable of finding out whether a horse is sound or not. Those are the men we have in the Department, but when it comes to the point of mating thoroughbreds to get the best results, that is a specialised job and we have not the men who would know anything about it&mdash;they do not know much about it, anyway.  We have not got the specialists necessary for this job and, therefore, it is not to be assumed that in setting up a <Col N="1823" /> board of this kind it will be a board of civil servants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the whole secret. When the Minister for Finance desired to get a director for the National Gallery and had nobody in the Department who was a judge of pictures, he chose a man whom he thought suitable and he brought him into the Civil Service as the director of the National Gallery.  It is obvious that the Minister cannot have in his Department, despite the vast ability that he has at his disposal, technicians in this particular sphere.  What conceivable objection is there to the Minister choosing the best man that his advisers think is to be found either here or abroad for the running of the stud farm, and making him the director of the Tully Stud and a member of the Civil Service of Eire, surrounded by the advisers he by his peculiar ability is qualified to choose and answerable to the Minister for the administration of the stud and, through the Minister, to this House?  Surely there is no conceivable difficulty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy was absent when I dealt with the advisory committee&mdash;whether the advisory committee should be a committee advising me and whose advice I could accept or reject, or whether those same five men should compose a board and should be told: &ldquo;Go ahead, adopt your own advice and accept full responsibility&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest the Minister should appoint a director answerable to him and that that director should be instructed to surround himself by an advisory board of five persons whose advice the director would have absolute discretion to accept or reject, but for the final decision he would be answerable.  In those circumstances I suggest the House would wish him to know that they did not expect 100 per cent. success; that we all fully <Col N="1824" /> realise that it is in the nature of such enterprises to have miscarriages.</P>

      <P>Is there any difficulty in securing a person with the technical competence to manage the Tully Stud as a private company and being able to secure that that person would be enrolled as a member of the Civil Service, would act as a director and chief of the Tully Stud, with day to day contacts with the Minister, be responsible to the Minister and be advised by an advisory council all the time, with control, through this House, over the money invested in the stud?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister assured Deputy Norton that every consideration will be given to the employees in the matter of re-employment.  There is a man there who has been manager since 1900, since the national stud was formed by the British.  He has to leave his house and get another house. He is a very old man and the gratuity he got was very small.  I think the Minister is conversant with the details of this case.  The Minister may say that it is the responsibility of the British, but he is an Irish national and the British are not concerned about his future.  He is 78 or 79 years of age and I think he has been very harshly treated.  Can the Minister do anything for him or for his wife?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is I think sufficiently described in the Long Title, but the need for it may require a little explanation. Borough corporations were in the early years of their existence the recipients of many grants of property, particularly land, and to-day the older corporations still hold such property for the benefit of citizens.  Before 1840 they were the owners of the property, and could virtually do as they chose with it, but a little over a century ago those corporations were converted into trustees, and the borough funds from that time could only be made applicable to certain defined statutory purposes.  Those local authorities which have come into existence within the last century or so are not in so favourable a position as the older authorities in regard to property. What they need they have to acquire and in several codes, such as those relating to housing and public health, provision is made for the acquisition, either by agreement or by compulsion, of such land as they require.  The present position, therefore, is that local authorities may acquire property, either by agreement or in certain instances by compulsory sale, but they have no power to acquire it by way of gift and to administer such gifts apart from their ordinary revenues as local authorities. This Bill will enable a local authority to accept gifts, but only on condition that they adopt schemes for the civic <Col N="1829" /> improvement of their areas, and devote the gifts to the purposes provided for in such schemes.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill, the local authorities, as defined in it, may frame civic improvement schemes so that the gifts which they accept will be administered for the purposes of such schemes.  It will be seen from the definition clause that the expression &ldquo;civic improvement scheme&rdquo; includes anything which tends to improve local amenities or is otherwise conducive to the welfare of the people.  A civic improvement scheme may be made in respect of civic improvements generally, a particular class or classes of civic improvement, or a particular civic improvement, but it must provide for the establishment of a separate fund into which any moneys given for the purposes of a civic improvement scheme must go. Revenues arising from such moneys, if not required for the purposes of the fund at any particular time, may be invested, and the proceeds would go to the credit of the fund.  The adoption of a civic improvement scheme will be a reserved function, that is, it will be a matter for the decision of the elected members of the local authority.  When a scheme is adopted, the local authority will be bound to give publicity to the fact that there is such a scheme, and every year will give notice that the scheme continues in existence, and that any person may make contributions to the civic improvement fund. Once a scheme is framed, then, under the provisions of the Bill, it cannot be varied except by an Order of the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for a measure of this sort will be better appreciated, I think, if I remind the House of the legal difficulties which now confront a public-spirited citizen who wishes to make gifts in trust for the benefit of the people of a particular locality.  We had, for instance, an example in the case of the late Mr. Daniel McGrath, who died in 1941, and who bequeathed over £48,000 to be expended in improvements of the town of Muinebeag and for the benefit of the people of that town.  In that case, on the application <Col N="1830" /> of the trustees of Mr. McGrath's will, the High Court settled a scheme for the administration of the charitable trusts, and another body of trustees&mdash; the McGrath memorial trustees&mdash;were appointed to assist and advise the trustees of the will.  Again, some time ago I had occasion to observe the difficulties which arose in Bandon in connection with the trusteeship of the Bandon town park, which was bequeathed by the late Sir John Arnott to the town of Bandon.  In that town it had become the custom for the town commissioners, after they had finished their statutory duties, to resolve themselves into a meeting of the trustees.  A difficulty arose because the commissioners as a statutory body were not the trustees.</P>
    <P>The most noteworthy example, however, of the present anomalous position arose last year, when our great compatriot, the unique Mr. George Bernard Shaw, proposed to hand over property which he owned in Carlow to the Carlow Urban District Council. He wished to make this the nucleus of a permanent voluntary civic improvement fund, to which any citizen could contribute.  It was found, however, that under the existing law effect could only be given to Mr. Shaw's ideas through the medium of a body of trustees, but the council was not in favour of the idea of a charitable trust; neither was Mr. Shaw, and he said so most pungently.  The only satisfactory way of meeting the wishes of both is by general legislation on the lines proposed in this Bill, which indeed might be referred to as &ldquo;the Shaw Bill&rdquo;, for it was he who suggested the main feature of it, which is the establishment of a voluntary civic improvement fund.  The scope of the Bill, of course, is not confined to Carlow, but embraces all local authorities, including vocational education committees and county committees of agriculture.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Section 2 of the Bill, as may be seen by reference to the section, will enable a permanent voluntary improvement fund to be established by the Carlow Urban District Council.  The capital of this <Col N="1831" /> fund, I think I should explain, will not be limited to Mr. Shaw's gift.  It will be open to anyone who wishes to improve the amenities of Carlow to contribute. In this connection, I should perhaps stress the significance of the word &ldquo;amenities&rdquo;, and emphasise that the fund cannot be applied towards the reduction of the Carlow rates.  What is in fact proposed here&mdash; if I may paraphrase a letter written by Mr. Shaw to the Carlow Urban District Council&mdash;is to give legal sanction to a new way by which those who wish to benefit their fellow citizens by making gifts or leaving legacies to municipal authorities can give effect to their wishes.  People who have money to bequeath are sometimes at a loss in selecting suitable objects for their benefactions, or even if they know what they want to do have to incur considerable expense in giving effect to their purpose.  The establishment of improvement funds which we hope will, in the course of time, come into existence in every town and county under this Bill, will make it easy for benefactors to act together with a common public purpose and so secure for local communities gifts which otherwise might not be so applied.</P>
    <P>These are the main purposes of the Bill.  They are comparatively simple, and I think the intention and effect of every section of it are clear on the face of the measure.  I should say that on the Committee Stage I shall have some small drafting changes to make, the first being to make it optional for local authorities, other than the vocational and agricultural committees, to defray the cost of advertising a scheme out of the rates, and the second being to make commissioners of towns bodies corporate for the purposes, and only for the purposes, of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I wish to welcome the Bill.  I think it is an extraordinary thing that this omission has existed in our legislation during all those years. We in Carlow can be thankful, first of all, to George Bernard Shaw for his gift to the town of Carlow; and, secondly, for suggesting that this sort of provision ought to be made in our <Col N="1832" /> legislation for the purpose of removing the anomalies that have existed hitherto.  The Minister has told the House that Mr. Shaw is responsible for the suggestion that that difficulty can be overcome by legislation, and that this Bill is to provide for a voluntary civic improvement fund. There is no contentious point in the Bill.  We are pleased to give it our support.  I take this opportunity of expressing, on behalf of the people of Carlow, our appreciation for the generous and thoughtful gift that Mr. George Bernard Shaw has given to the town.</P>

      <P>With Deputy Hughes I welcome the Bill.  In so far as it puts right the position that arose in Carlow, I think it is a very necessary measure.  I join in the Deputy's expression of gratitude to the donor in this particular case.  The Minister rather indicated that it will be the duty of almost every public authority to consider the initiation of what is known as a civic improvement fund. I do not know what purpose that would serve, because a number of public-spirited or benevolent individuals in the country seem to be of the opinion that the average citizen has fulfilled his duty when he has paid his rates.  A good many of them consider that there is a certain amount of hardship involved in doing that duty.  There will be agreement, I think, with the general tenor of the Bill.  I do not share the Minister's view that anything will eventuate from the idea of each public authority throughout the country initiating what he described in the Bill as a civic improvement fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Agricultural Wages Act, 1936, provided for the fixing of minimum rates of wages for agricultural workers, made it an offence for an agricultural employer to pay an agricultural worker less than the minimum rate, and gave the agricultural worker (or an officer of the Agricultural Wages Board acting on his behalf) power to recover by civil proceedings any sums due to him on account of payment of wages at less than the appropriate minimum rate. The Act did not, however, fix any limit to the period in respect of which such arrears of wages could be recovered, and workers may, therefore, at present bring proceedings dating back to the year in which the Act came into operation.  In time it would be possible to bring claims extending over 20 years at which point the statute of limitations would apply. The experience of my Department and of the Agricultural Wages Board has shown that the absence of such a limit is giving rise to serious abuses. The principal aim of the Bill is to remove these abuses in the interests both of employers and workers alike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may now refer to the sections.  Section I deals with contracts of employment. The Agricultural Wages (Minimum Rates) Orders made by the Agricultural Wages Board fixing minimum rates of wages for agricultural workers distinguish between two kinds of contracts of employment: (1) contracts of employment for a period of less than five months, and (2) contracts of employment for a period of five months duration and upwards.  In the case of the first, the minimum rates of wages are fixed on the basis of a week of 54 hours, and, in the case of the second, on a monthly basis.  The definition of &ldquo;a wages period&rdquo; in Section 1 of the <Col N="1834" /> Bill is intended to conform with this practice of the board in fixing minimum rates, and also to facilitate the calculation of the two-year limitation periods for recovery of wages which is provided for in Sections 3 and 4 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2 deals with the question of determining whether a worker is an agricultural worker or an employer an agricultural employer.  Under the 1936 Act, these are matters for decision by the Minister.  In that connection difficult legal points have often arisen in practice.  For a long time I have thought these were not proper questions for the Minister to decide.  As a matter of fact, I having decided whether a person was an agricultural worker or not, the court must often also decide whether the work arose out of a contract or not.  It is very involved at the moment and I think it would be very much more appropriate if it were left to the court to decide whether a person was or was not an agricultural employer or an agricultural worker.  That is provided by Section 2.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with summary proceedings. Where there are summary proceedings, as distinct from civil proceedings, for an offence under the Act, the court may award the wages due as well as dealing with the offence. That is sometimes done and this section was put in to limit the period in that case to two years.</P>
    <P>Section 4 may be regarded as the main section of this Bill.  It limits to two years the arrears of wages that can be recovered in civil proceedings and it also limits the time within which application may be made to the court to two years from the end of the period of employment.</P>
    <P>These provisions are being introduced at the instance of the Agricultural Wages Board.  Some considerable time ago, the Agricultural Wages Board passed a resolution asking me to have the Act amended accordingly. They had had the question discussed at the five area committees.  These committees, as Deputies are aware, are composed of an equal number of employers and employees and all the committees and the Board recommended unanimously that this amendment <Col N="1835" /> should be made.  It is not contended that an employer should get away with doing what would be regarded as illegal under the Act, but he can be dealt with summarily for the offence and, even after this Bill is passed, he will, presumably, be compelled to pay whatever wages were due for a period of two years.  The amendment is proposed because there has been a certain amount of dissatisfaction amongst employees as well as employers.  I think every Deputy will realise that if a man is prepared to hire with a farmer at less than the minimum wage, that has a very depressing effect on wages in general in the area and it holds out the temptation to employers in that area to try to get men at less than the minimum wage.  The employee who is willing to do this has in mind, when his employment ceases, to go to court and get the arrears.  It would be much better if that were discouraged and that, as far as possible, we should see to it that employees insist on getting the proper wage and that employers are compelled to pay the proper wage.</P>
    <P>In the case of any person who has a genuine grievance, let us say, an employee who has made a mistake about the wages he should be paid or who, by reason of a temporary depression in a given area, accepts work at lower than the minimum wage, and who becomes dissatisfied or who changes his mind and regrets having done so, it is considered that two years is quite sufficient to give him to make up his mind to go to court and get what is due to him.  There seems to me to be no good reason for allowing him to continue longer than two years taking less than the proper wage and then having the right to go to court to get the arrears.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Section 3 and Section 4 are not in any way retrospective and do not apply to any case that is being brought before the court or that may be brought before the court before the passing of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with another matter. It was provided in the Act that application could be made to the <Col N="1836" /> Board for sanction for less than the minimum wage if the employee was believed to be unsound either mentally or physically.  There was a certain number of applications of this kind. The great majority of them were granted by the Board.  Some were refused.</P>
    <P>The number of cases was comparatively very small and a number of employers who were afterwards brought before the court claimed that the employee was not capable of doing a hard day's work and when it was pointed out to them that they could have applied to the Agricultural Wages Board to pay less than the minimum wage they claimed that they did not know of the provision.  It is possible that some employers did not know and possibly some employees did not know.  This is to give the court the right, after full investigation, to decide that an employee was not physically or mentally fit and where that is pleaded, if the plea is a just plea, they may, in fact, apply Section 18 of the Principal Act retrospectively, that is to say, they may find that the person was unsound either mentally or physically.</P>
    <P>Deputies may not be aware of some of the cases that were brought under this Act, and I think if they were, they would agree that something should be done.  Cases were brought before me to decide whether the work was agricultural or not.  I may mention one or two of these cases.  One was a case brought about two years ago of an employee who had been working with an employer for something like six years.  The inspector who investigated the case reported that the worker was aged 70 years, rather broken down in physique and seemed deformed; was obviously unable to do really heavy work.  It appears he was taken in by the employer, being a friend of the family, on his discharge from hospital, in 1937.  He was kept and fed and so on, and in return for that he did a certain amount of work around the place, including some agricultural work.  He got a certain amount of pocket money as well as being kept. The employer and he had a falling-out <Col N="1837" /> and he went to court and claimed the full arrears of wages.</P>
    <P>Another case was that of a deaf mute who was working with an employer for some years at less than the minimum wage.  He left that employer and went to work with another.  The second employer was more conversant with the law and told him that he would take him on if he would agree to an application being made to the Wages Board for exemption.  The employee agreed and the board gave the exemption because they considered he was not physically fit for hard work.  The employee then understood that the previous employer, not having asked for exemption, was liable for the full wages and he applied for the amount&mdash;over £200&mdash;which was due to him in respect of the time he was working for the previous employer.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to weary the House by giving a lot of cases.  I am giving a couple of instances which show that great injustice can be done as the Act stands.  I think there is certainly a case for the amendment I am proposing. The principal amendment there is that the employee can claim only two years' arrears of wages and must put in his claim within two years from the time he leaves the employment.</P>
    <P>The other amendments are more or less incidental.  They concern the transfer of the function of determining whether work is agricultural or not from the Minister to the court, which I believe to be desirable, and the point about bringing the period of employment into line with the present practice, and they are of no great importance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no objection to the Bill and I think the Minister has given good grounds for the necessity to amend the Agricultural Wages Act of 1936.  The Minister is deleting Section 2 (2) of the Principal Act, which is a desirable deletion, as it was not wise to leave the decision to the Minister.  The proper place to have the decision made is the court, and that will be the position on the repeal of Section 2 (2) of the Principal Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1838" /> In Section 4 it is provided that an officer of the board may act for the individual&mdash;I think that was in the Principal Act, too, and I see no reason to object to it.  I agree with the Minister that it is necessary to have a statutory limit to the period of claim and that it is unfair to leave it wide open to a man to claim over a long period.  This will have the effect of compelling an individual who has a claim to introduce proceedings within the statutory period laid down.  The Minister is right in pointing out that some men, knowing that the protection was there in the law, were quite satisfied to hire with individual farmers and work at a wage below the fixed minimum wage for a long period.  It had a bad effect in the district, as it became known that some people were employing labourers at less than the minimum wage and I have no doubt it tended to depress wages.  The arguments the Minister has advanced on that point should convince any Deputy as to the desirability of the amendment.  The period of two years after the determination of employment is quite satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Under Section 5, the court can decide as to the physical or mental capacity of an individual and may make it retrospective so far as the employment of an individual over a period of years is concerned, where an employer was in ignorance of the provisions of the Act.  I do not see any objection to it.  The various amendments in the Bill are useful and will help to remove the anomalies which existed in the Principal Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewFogarty" hpid="Mr. P.J. Fogarty Mr. P.J. Fogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the Minister very carefully on the Second Reading and took particular notice of his remarks regarding the definition of an agricultural labourer.  It strikes me as extraordinary that, in spite of various representations which have been made to him from time to time on this point, he has always evaded the question of gardeners.  If a gardener is not an agricultural worker, I do not know how I could describe him.  If he applies to proceed to England for employment, he cannot go, as he comes under the <Col N="1839" /> definition of an agricultural worker or someone who knows something about turf.  Any ordinary person realises that a gardener is engaged in the production of food and, therefore, he comes within the ambit of an agricultural worker.  The Minister could make an amendment in this Bill, bringing gardeners within the scope of the Agricultural Wages Act.  Gardeners should be entitled to the increases given to agricultural workers by the Wages Board since it was set up. Farmers generally have applied those increases.  I represent a constituency where the farming community is paying more to the agricultural workers than the minimum wages laid down by the board.  I appeal to the Minister to consider this question of gardeners and make provision in the Bill to bring them within the Principal Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know there are several types of gardeners attached to the big estates of titled people and who might be growing roses or tulips.  At the same time, you will always find they are growing tomatoes, too, and that their whole occupation is not confined to roses and tulips.  Even so, there is a fairly good market for roses and tulips. Farmers generally cannot afford to indulge in growing them and, unfortunately, we have to get men to come from Holland and Belgium to make a fortune growing roses and tulips here, as I have seen in my constituency at Rush, where they find it far more remunerative than growing wheat or potatoes.  Nevertheless, it will be found that 99 per cent. of the gardeners generally deal with the growing of small vegetables, beet, lettuce and celery.  These vegetables keep the Dublin market going and it is rather unfair that they should not come within this Bill.  It is rather difficult to bring it in, as there are various grades: there are first-class men and then others who may describe themselves as gardeners but who really are only handy labourers.  The Minister will agree that there are many wages disputes going on at the moment, as the agricultural worker is the worst paid worker in the country to-day, without any doubt whatsoever.  I see <Col N="1840" /> them on the Dublin road, coming in to the Dublin market.  They get home in the evening time, after delivering cabbage, and I have often heard them boasting of the price it fetched&mdash;some fabulous price like £8 or £9 or even up to £13 or £14 a load.  I hear of potatoes going at £28 and £24 a ton; but the agricultural worker who has to bring the load to the market just goes back to the farm and maybe loads up again for the next day.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Wages Act, which the Minister brought in, was generally appreciated by the agricultural worker, but one thing which was not appreciated was the laying down of a &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; wage.  It should be emphasised that that was a minimum, provided to ensure that the worker would not get less and that it was a matter for the farmer to pay considerably more, if he so desired.  Unfortunately, that is used by the employers to say: &ldquo;We will pay you the Government wage&rdquo;.  That is a situation that the Department of Agriculture should clean up.  The farmers who employ these men will know that this wage is fixed and the workers themselves will know that they should not be employed at a lesser wage.  The farmer is entitled to give the worker a higher wage if he thinks he is worth it.  I know farmers who have good men working for them and they are quite prepared to pay them a good wage.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the minimum wage fixed at a higher level.  It is one reason why you have not so many agricultural workers.  Even the Minister's statistics have shown that, notwithstanding increased tillage, there are fewer agricultural workers.  The Minister may say that is due to the use of machinery.  Of course, the farmers are entitled to get a big amount of their tillage done by contract with the people who have tractors, binders, corn drills, ploughs, etc.  If you are to encourage people to work on the land the best inducement is to improve conditions.  We seldom hear of a &ldquo;young&rdquo; farmer.  Even if a farmer is only 18 years of age, he is described as an &ldquo;old&rdquo; farmer.  I have asked many people for an explanation of that, but it is difficult to find one. <Col N="1841" /> Similarly, you seldom hear of a &ldquo;small&rdquo; rat.  No matter how small the animal may be, it is always described as a &ldquo;big&rdquo; rat.  The farmer's life is a tough one and he really earns his money.  The agricultural worker should get a little more consideration.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider how best to improve agricultural conditions and encourage men to work on the land.  A great deal has been done by the Department in the matter of reviving ploughing competitions.  In that way much has been done to revive interest in agricultural work.  We should endeavour to improve the conditions of the farmer and give him better opportunities of earning a decent livelihood.  I know the conditions of the farm labourers and I know the conditions under which builders' labourers and tradesmen generally carry on their work.  The farm labourer is often depressed when he reads of the trade disputes about conditions that he would be glad to work under.  Many farm labourers would be delighted to work under the conditions that dissatisfy tradesmen.</P>
    <P>Why should not farm labourers get a week's holidays with pay?  The ordinary farmer fills up a form and mentions the men who are employed by him during the year.  He sets out whether they have worked constantly and also gives the number of days worked, all with the object of getting an abatement of rates.  If he complies with the regulations he gets certain allowances.  Why should not some scheme be devised so that farm labourers will get holidays with pay? I believe 99 per cent. of the farmers will not object.  Other workers are entitled to holidays with pay.  The exception is the farm labourer.  He gets the Catholic holidays but not the bank holidays.  I think the Minister's Department could prepare some scheme so that farm labourers will get reasonable consideration as regards their holidays.</P>
    <P>There are a good many members of the farming community in the Government Party and surely the Minister, who is himself a farmer, could have a consultation with them?  I would not agree to a consultation with outside organisations or members of the Opposition <Col N="1842" /> Party.  The Minister should consult the farmer members of the Government Party to see if something could be done to provide a week's holiday with pay for farm labourers.  They will not be able to look forward to a trip to Lisdoonvarna or Ballybunion, but they can have a week's rest and they might be able to do something in their own homes or gardens that will be of benefit to themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister talking about inspectors in connection with the minimum wage.  I have never seen one of the inspectors connected with the Agricultural Wages Board.  The only inspectors one can hear of are those who follow old age pensioners to see what means they have.  If they have a hen laying, the inspectors will find out, but they seldom find out if a man is being paid an unreasonably low wage. If a woman pays a penny or two too much for tea, the inspectors will find that out, but I have never known them to inquire closely into farm workers' wages.  They will enter the house of a woman who tries to keep her place comfortable and cosy, and they open the presses to see what she has.</P>
    <P>I heard the story of an inspector who had a chat with a farmer.  The farmer told him he had three men working on the land; he was paying two of them wages, but the third fellow was getting about 10/- a week, an odd ounce of tobacco, and possibly a &ldquo;pint.&rdquo;  The inspector was quite annoyed, and immediately asked to see the man.  &ldquo;Here I am,&rdquo; said the farmer, &ldquo;it is myself I am talking about.  That is all I get.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The provision in the Bill about certain people being exempted from getting the trade union wage is a very bad one.  I know rural areas in Co. Dublin where some of the people described by the Minister are working and I am certain they are the hardest workers.  Some of these unfortunate fellows work from morning till night. They may be mentally deficient and that factor is played upon.  They are working night and day and even on Sundays.  I do not think anyone should be allowed to avail of that type of provision.  If a person is mentally <Col N="1843" /> deficient it does not mean that he does not work hard.  Such persons do not realise their rights.  Some of these men may be taken out of institutions. They work from day-break till dark and also on Sundays.  This Bill should not give employers an opportunity to apply for exemption in the case of workers of that type.</P>
    <P>I thought the Minister would give some definition of a gardener and I had hopes that he would introduce a provision to give farm workers holidays with pay.  Employers and employees should be made aware that there is a definite minimum wage below which it is not right for them to go.  I do not know how this thing may be criticised by the Labour Party, but the workers have at least this guarantee, that by law they are entitled to a certain wage.  It should be brought home to the worker and the employer that that is the minimum wage and employers are entitled, if they so desire, to pay their workers more, and that the farmer cannot say: &ldquo;I am giving you the Government wage and that is all I can do&rdquo;.  Some of these workers think that it would be an offence if they were given a higher wage.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in connection with the wages of workers engaged in threshing, but I do not know the exact position in this regard, or whether the Agricultural Wages Board has any authority in the matter.  I know that they fix the amount to be paid per day for the machines and that the machines are subject to inspection by the Department's inspectors, but I do not know what the position is with regard to the wages of the workers. It is really only casual work, but, not knowing the exact position, I do not intend to deal with it.  Finally, I suggest to the Minister that he should bring the wages boards for the various areas together more often so that the situation as it exists in each area may be dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with the problem of fixation of wages in any industry, whether agriculture or other industry, two lines of approach along <Col N="1844" /> which progress can be made are available. One is the line of trade union organisation and activity and the other is legislation.  So far as the majority of industrial and commercial workers are concerned, more especially in this country, the line of activity along trade union organisation has brought them good results, but, even in industry and commerce, there are certain trades which, because of their peculiar characteristics, have rendered themselves almost impervious to the line of development pursued by the working-class movement, and, as in industry and commerce we have that picture, so also have we it in agriculture.</P>
      <P>The difficulties which face any trade union or the trade union movement as a whole in this country in trying to do for agricultural workers what they have done for industrial and commercial workers are not only manifest to anybody who knows the rural areas but constitute a burning problem for those who are particularly and keenly interested in the trade union movement, and while Deputy Fogarty, possibly with a good deal of correctness, takes all credit to his Party for having introduced the 1936 Act which fixed minimum wages, there is a history behind it, and it is the history of the maintenance and the development at all times of the demand of industrial and commercial workers in the cities and of the trade union movement for protection and better treatment for their brothers in rural communities on the basis of their recognition as human beings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Fianna Fáil Party did, in 1936, give heed to that demand and introduce the measure of that year, they were only doing something which was very much belated.  But even with the fixation of that minimum rate, we still had the position in 1939 in which, in the area immediately adjacent to the capital, the weekly rate of wages of the agricultural worker was 36/- a week.  That in itself emphasises the point made by Deputy Fogarty that here we are dealing with the fixation of minimum conditions, and unfortunately, when we deal with conditions of employment through legislation, what we get are minimum <Col N="1845" /> and average conditions, and not minimum and maximum conditions, because what is laid down as a minimum inevitably becomes the average, and, with certain exceptions, the maximum, for that class of work.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to tell farmers that they are only legally bound to pay a certain minimum rate and that there is no legal prohibition, no moral obstacle in their path and no device of any kind which prevents them from giving greater recognition to their labourers and paying a more reasonable wage. The experience both of labourers and of those who interest themselves in the conditions of agricultural labourers is that the farmer who recognises the value given to him by his agricultural labourer by giving something over and above the legal rate is an exception &mdash;and we should give credit to him. Not only have we got the mass of the farmers sticking rigidly in the same way as the average industrial or commercial employer sticks in the main to the minimum rates fixed by trade boards in industries and trades, but we have also the other class of farmer who is not even prepared to recognise the obligation imposed on him by the law of the country.</P>
    <P>I should have thought that after eight years' experience of the working of the Act when we had an amending Bill an effort would have been made to get rid of the defects and to improve the original Act from the point of view of the purpose and spirit of that Act.  The purpose and spirit of the Act was to benefit the agricultural labourer and not to hold him up to ridicule as was done by the Minister this evening but to make the Act more effective in dealing with the farmer who is breaking the law, who as the Minister pointed out, is taking advantage of his fellow farmers, and not only of the labourer he employs, who is not only doing harm to the labourer but to the whole industry of agriculture, because he continues to keep tacked on to the farmers the reputation of seeking to acquire for themselves improved conditions in the shape of prices, credits and facilities, while at the same time refusing to recognise the claims of the labourers.  I do not think <Col N="1846" /> that is the actual position in regard to the great mass of the farmers. They are in the same difficult position as their labourers, but one black sheep in a district can very often blacken the reputation of the decent and reputable men working around him. Instead of trying to strengthen the Act so as to protect not only the agricultural labourer as such, but the decent farmer, we propose to take away some of the weapons which were provided in the original Act.  The suggestion of the Minister that the Bill should be accepted by the House and that summary proceedings for the recovery of wages should be limited to two years is an outrage.  I think the reasons the Minister advanced in that regard are even more outrageous. Later in the course of his case in support of the Bill the Minister referred to Section 5 and to the possibility that farmers might not know the law and the legal facilities provided for them in the 1936 Act in regard to obtaining permits from incapacitated workers.</P>
    <P>If the farmer is to be assisted because he possibly does not know the law surely there is a thousand times a stronger argument for assisting the labourer who may be in ignorance of the law.  The Minister's case is that labourer who take up employment with a farmer under the minimum rate not only tend to depress conditions in the particular district but do it deliberately, knowing that at any time, without limitation, if their employment ends they can have recourse to the courts.  Agreed that that is objectionable and I shall be with the Minister in dealing with any individual who would be a party to that practice. But if that is the case, how much more so should we deal with the farmer who is prepared to take advantage of that individual, and instead of dealing with him we are going to limit his penalties first of all to a very nominal fine&mdash;if you look at the records given to the House some months ago you will see how nominal the fines are in regard to breaches of the Act&mdash;and secondly, we are going to limit the recovery of wages to two years.  What is the need for that limitation?  The Minister has mentioned one or two <Col N="1847" /> cases.  He has told us that the Agricultural Wages Board and the district committees have unanimously made this recommendation.  I have no doubt; I think the board could hardly do anything else in view of their record.  If you go back and read the figures given by the Minister in regard to the period since the Act came into operation in 1937&mdash;the cases where there were breaches of the Act, the proceedings taken and the fines imposed&mdash;one amazing fact stands out, and that is, that at a time when agriculture in this country as a whole entered upon, if you like, the boom period of the war, and at no other time within 20 or 25 years were the farmers generally in a better position to comply with the requirements of the Act, the inspection system collapsed. The inspectors were taken away from the board.  I do not blame the board. The inspectors were taken away and put on certain other duties, and so far as enforcement of the Act was concerned&mdash;and an Act that is not enforced is not of very much value&mdash;that particular side of the activities of the board practically came to a standstill.</P>
    <P>It might be argued that those inspectors, men skilled in agriculture, were required for other duties, but the ordinary visits to farmers, the inquiries as to wages paid, and the checking up of the enforcement of the provisions of the Act, once there was a determination that the individual was an agricultural labourer, did not require any highly skilled knowledge.  It only required a certain determination that the persons for whom the Act was devised would get the benefit of it, and that those who were guilty of breaches of the Act would be dealt with.  So far as the limitation of the period of recovery to two years is concerned, I personally feel, and I think the same can be said of all those on these benches, that I cannot agree to it.  I cannot see any reason why the farm labourer should not be given the same facilities as any other person to whom a commercial debt is owed.  The ordinary trader gets the protection of the Statute of Limitations.  He has more experience; he is capable of dealing with his business; in most cases <Col N="1848" /> he is a literate man who reads the papers and keeps himself informed as to the law and its requirements.  If he is to be allowed a period of seven years in which to protect himself, surely the agricultural labourer, living possibly in the backward parts of the more outlying counties, very often semi-illiterate, working under the pressure of the economic and physical conditions under which he is forced to live, and perhaps not having the opportunity of reading a paper for months at a time, should be given every facility and every protection, instead of limiting the period of recovery.  I should prefer to see the Minister coming in here and seeking powers to impose heavier and more severe fines in order to make the original Act more effective.  According to the figures which the Minister gave to the House, the fines imposed were negligible, a matter of £5 or £6 or £10 for offences running in certain cases, as he said himself, over a period of two years.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other proposal which the Minister is embodying in this Bill, the change of powers in connection with the determination of an agricultural labourer, I do not think we have any great quarrel with that. We recognise and know from experience the difficulties that have arisen not only in regard to agricultural labourers but other classes of workers who get determinations from the courts, and the subsequent difficulties that arose when the cases were pursued through the legal channels.  So far as gardeners are concerned, I think there is already in the Bill a certain definition in regard to agriculture as a whole where it refers to market gardeners, and that in itself would give a certain amount of direction as to whether the gardeners referred to by Deputy Fogarty could be brought within the scope of the Bill.  The other type of gardener&mdash;the type to which Deputy Fogarty was perhaps really referring&mdash;is the man working inside the city, the man working for casual days, and getting 5/-, 6/-, 7/- or 8/-.  Very often he gets only three or four days' work a week.  For a wage of perhaps 36/- to 50/- he provides highly skilled labour.  He has to maintain a family on a wage which in <Col N="1849" /> many cases in the city is paid to a worker of 18 or 19 years in other occupations. I do not know how they can be given protection.  I do not think they can get it through the form of machinery we have now.  That is the type of gardener who requires consideration more than the market gardeners to whom Deputy Fogarty has referred, and who, as far as I know, especially in the area to which he referred, enjoy the benefits of the 1936 Act.</P>
    <P>The section proposing that a change should be made in regard to the securing of permits to employ incapacitated workers below the minimum wage is also objectionable.  If there has been such a small number of cases, then it is quite clear that no great burden of work has been created, and that the machinery in general functioned fairly well.  I do think it is an objectionable practice to come in to court after an offence has been committed, and urge that a particular worker was incapacitated for one reason or another.</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be open to many grave abuses.  From experience of the attitude of courts in assessing the incapacitation of workers, I can see many grave difficulties arising when it comes to a question of deciding whether a particular worker who was under-paid was at that particular time incapacitated to the extent represented by the wage paid.  I think it would be far better to leave the section as it is in the original Act and place the onus on the employer to obtain a permit in advance, and to have the position fully examined by competent and skilled inspectors of the board.  Then if they are satisfied they can give the necessary permission to employ the particular individual in question.</P>
    <P>So far as the Bill as a whole is concerned, it seems to me that it can be summed up as it was by the Minister when he said that the main purpose of this section is to incorporate this limitation to a two years' period.  We feel that no case has been made to justify that.  It is regrettable that, instead of an amending Bill being brought in to remedy any difficulties <Col N="1850" /> which may have become apparent in the 1936 Act, our expression of sympathy with the agricultural labourers, after five years of strenuous circumstances in this country&mdash;and that sympathy will probably be again extended to them by the Minister during the coming season&mdash;is to suggest that they are to blame; that they are trying to take advantage of laws made for their protection; that they are willing to allow themselves to be used as tools by unscrupulous employers, and that, therefore, we are going to limit the protection we will give them to a period of two years.  I do not think that is an advance.  I think it would be far better if we looked at the position from the point of view of seeing what defects in the original Act may be remedied, and from the point of view referred to by Deputy Fogarty&mdash; seeing whether it is possible in 1945 to give to those men and women engaged as wage earners on the land that annual holiday of at least one week which we have given to so many different sections of industrial, commercial and transport workers.  All of us are aware that large sections of workers are now looking for something more.  I think it is becoming recognised that, under modern conditions, a period of a week for recuperation purposes is not sufficient for workers.</P>
    <P>Surely if the industrial organised workers are looking forward to a further improvement in their conditions, we can give to these, if you like, outcasts who have nobody to speak for them, what the industrial workers are already starting to leave behind them, namely, a week's holidays with pay.  The Minister will possibly argue that that is a matter for another Department and should be dealt with under other Acts.  In my opinion it would be quite feasible, by amending the 1936 Act, to make it possible for the board so to arrange their schedule of wages as to afford these men that week's holiday with pay.</P>
    <P>Two other points arise.  The first is that if we are to have machinery for the fixation of wages, and if the results of its working are to be <Col N="1851" /> accepted by all sections engaged in the industry and by the public generally, as being fair and equitable, then I suggest it should be fully representative. It is not so at present.  The Minister has power under the Bill to determine the representative character of the people he invites to sit on boards or committees.  I suggest to him that he should accept, as a matter of equity, that where there is a Trade Union organisation, or the claim that there is one, he should investigate that claim, and if he is satisfied on investigation that the claim is substantiated, he should then afford the Trade Union organisation an opportunity of submitting names of representatives to act on the Committee or Central Board.  Recently, that was done, but unfortunately the names submitted by the Trade Union organisation were not considered.  I do not want to go into that now.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister does recognise that in any system of wage fixation, conciliation or negotiation, in which two parties are concerned, both sides should be represented in the fullest possible manner, and that where there is to any extent an effective trade union organisation in the district&mdash;I am not now suggesting a national organisation&mdash;he should accept its nominations.  In that way the representatives put forward by a trade union organisation will be of a more representative character and will be able to speak with more authority on committees and boards than an individual who may be accepted by the Minister because in his opinion that individual represents the workers generally in an area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fogarty, when speaking of trade union organisation, referred to the fact that certain workers in the city are now seeking to improve conditions with which agricultural workers would be highly satisfied if they could obtain them.  May I suggest that nobody knows better than the Deputy that whatever little improvement agricultural workers in his constituency have obtained in the last 12 months was brought about because of the stand which industrial workers in the <Col N="1852" /> city were prepared to make on their behalf?  Right down the years, any effort that has been made to give to agricultural workers the possibility of independence and strength to improve their conditions had its origin first in the ranks of industrial workers.  They took upon themselves the initial burden in that regard.  The pity is that, at the present time, we have not a wider organisation to speak for agricultural workers, so that they would be able to voice in a more effective way, and on a national basis, their claims to consideration.  If they were able to do that in an effective way, I am sure they would, as I have done, protest against the type of amending Bill that has been put before us, and would express their regret that the Minister has shown his sympathy with agricultural workers in such an unfortunate way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>While Deputies in general will accept the Bill as an improvement on the Principal Act, it will at the same time be generally agreed that the measure is in keeping with very much of the legislation that passes through this House.  It is merely an attempt to patch patches. The original Act represented a sort of compromise.  It did not set out to provide for the agricultural worker what is regarded as a fair wage, but rather tried to establish some kind of adjustment as between what the worker needed and what the farmer could pay.  It was never a very satisfactory compromise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as this Bill seeks to limit the period with in which arrears may be claimed or recovered, I think it is satisfactory.  There is no analogy whatever between arrears of agricultural wages due and ordinary shop debts which are covered by the limitation of the seven year period.  Ordinary shop debts are the result of a contract entered into between a merchant and a buyer, and the merchant is quite entitled to recover the full amount of the price set out in the contract.  Here, however, we have a contract entered into between the worker and his employer. At the time it is entered into it appears to both parties to be fair and reasonable, but afterwards it is <Col N="1853" /> found to be contrary to the law.  I think that, in matter of that kind, it is highly dangerous to allow a long period to elapse.  In the first place, as the Minister has pointed out, you might have in one area a number of workers working below the fixed rate for a very long period.  That would have a bad effect on wages generally. Then there is the more serious feature that the agricultural employer is frequently a man of very limited resources, and he may find himself up against a claim which he is absolutely unable to meet.  Generally speaking, the resources of agricultural employers are much smaller, and much more limited than the resources of industrial or commercial employers.  For that reason they are not able to meet substantial claims stretching over a very considerable number of years.</P>
    <P>That adds very much to the risks and hazards which farmers have to meet in the ordinary course of their occupation &mdash; if they are to find themselves liable for substantial claims being made against them over a considerable period of years.  We all know the big risks which farmers have to take in regard to stock and the weather.  This summer will have proved that to anyone not already aware of it.  In addition, farmers are up against very substantial risks in regard to workmen's compensation and other matters.  All these things tend to discourage the employment of men on the land.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fogarty referred to the fact that the Fianna Fáil Party was the first Party that gave protection to the agricultural workers in regard to wages.  He forgot to mention, however, that this Government had not given complete protection to them inasmuch as a very large percentage of workers have been driven off the land.  You have far fewer agricultural workers upon the land now than you had when agricultural wages were first fixed.  In as far as the Bill seeks to remove certain defects in the original Act it is to be welcomed but it does not approach the whole question of remuneration of the agricultural worker and fair play for the agricultural employer on a reasonable basis.  There is only one reasonable basis if the State <Col N="1854" /> is to interfere at all in the matter of remuneration of workers, and that is, to base the remuneration on the cost of living to the worker and to follow that out to its logical conclusion by ensuring that the agricultural employer should get a price for his produce that will cover those wages.</P>
    <P>The original Act and this amending Bill are merely tinkering with the problem.  There are two definite, clearcut lines of approach to the question of the remuneration of the agricultural worker and of the farmer. Either the State must leave matters entirely alone and let the farmer make his own arrangements with the worker and let the prices of the farmers' produce be governed by the ordinary law of supply and demand or, alternatively, the State may interfere and fix a reasonable wage for the worker and, following that out to its logical conclusion, fix a reasonable price for the produce of the farmer based on those wages.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to recommend the second course.  I maintain, definitely, that a system of fixing wages for the agricultural worker while affording no protection whatever to the agricultural employer in regard to prices is not an equitable system and, as it has worked out, is merely a sort of compromise. We have the board fixing wages, not on the basis of what they consider a reasonable wage in accordance with the cost of living and in accordance with the importance and equality of the agricultural labourers' work, but on the basis of a compromise as between what the worker needs and what the farmer can pay.  Compromises in matters of this kind are hardly ever satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fogarty made one remark to which I would like to refer.  He said he has never heard a farmer described as anything but an &ldquo;ould farmer.&rdquo; It ought to convince Deputy Fogarty that there is a superiority complex amongst the non-agricultural population in regard to farmers generally when they speak of the farmer with contempt, as is implied in that term. I think that superiority complex is due mainly to the fact that farmers have never been adequately remunerated <Col N="1855" /> and therefore have never been in a position adequately to remunerate their dependents, whether they be members of their own family or their employees.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in relation to wages. I cannot, however, forbear to invite Deputy Cogan, when he contemplates a scheme of fixed prices, to dwell on the exportable surplus and to suggest methods to Dáil Éireann, on some suitable occasion, as to how prices can be fixed for that exportable surplus, which must be sold in the British market because there is no other market in which we can sell it.  Deputy Cogan says there is no analogy between shop debts and wages.  I am entirely in agreement with Deputy Cogan there, but the inference drawn by Deputy Cogan from that absence of analogy is far different from the inference that I would draw.  A merchant makes a contract of sale with his customer.  If he does not want to make that contract there is no reason why he should; he can hang up a notice in the shop, &ldquo;no credit given&rdquo;, and trade on a cash basis.  If he elects, for his own reasons, to give credit and fails to collect it within a reasonable time, he cannot expect the whole process of law in this country to be held up waiting for him to make up his mind to recover his debts from his customer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was a child and when the Minister was a child and when Deputy Cogan was a child, I am sure he and I and the Minister had recourse to the penny catechism.  There I learned of the Seven Deadly Sins, the Ten Commandments, the Precepts of the Church and the sins that cry out to Heaven for vengeance.  If my memory serves me well, one of the sins that cry out to Heaven for vengeance is depriving the labourer of his hire.  I may be a very simple creature, but when I read that in the penny catechism I believed it.  I still believe it.  I believe <Col N="1856" /> that an employer who knowingly withholds from his employee the wages to which the employee is entitled is guilty of mortal sin and is bound to restitution.  I do not care whether the debt is due for a year, or six years or 16 years, if he knowingly withholds it, he is bound to pay it back, if his resources permit him to do so, before he can get absolution for his sin.  That is what I was brought up to believe and, so far as I know, that is the law of God.  There is that remarkable distinction between shop debts and the kind of debts that are associated with a labourer's hire.  I may be wrong, but that is my understanding of the situation.</P>
    <P>If a farmer hires a labourer, it is common knowledge to us all that in the vast majority of cases, the labourer is looking for a job.  There are exceptional circumstances when there are more employers than labourers, but in the vast majority of cases there are more labourers than there are employers. If an employer, in those circumstances, having three or four men looking for one job, finds one of them so straitened that he is prepared to say: &ldquo;If the fixed wages are 42/-, I will take £2 to get the job,&rdquo; and the farmer, in pursuit of that agreement, hires the man and gives him 2/- a week less than the man is entitled to under the law it seems to me that, whether that deed was done one year, five years, ten years or 40 years ago, there is a solemn obligation on that farmer to find the man from whom he stole the 2/-, or his descendants, or the next nearest party he can find, and restore what he stole.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances why should we in this House lift off the farmer who has stolen from his labourer part of his wages weekly the obligation to pay back what he stole under due process of law?  Deputy Costello was here a few moments ago and, I think, he confirmed me in saying that the law of this land requires that if a trustee defrauds his <i>cestui que trust</i> it does not matter how long ago that took place, the Courts of Equity will compel the trustee to put right his breach of trust in favour of his <i>cestui que trust</i> and refuse to give the trustee the benefit of any statute of limitations.  His special <Col N="1857" /> undertaking to deal justly &mdash;<i>uberrima fides</i> is the phrase &mdash; with his <i>cestui que trust</i> is recognised and that duty of <i>uberrima fides</i> in the case of a trustee is deemed to admit of no claim to protection from the passage of time.  Is not the employer, in some sense a trustee of the goods he holds, be it land or property of any kind, obliged to deal justly with a man who has worked for him?</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Larkin when he says that Section 5 is a bad section.  I think Section 5 of this Bill is a good section, provided that Section 4 be not in the Bill.  A case could arise where a delicate or disabled man would come to a farmer and say: &ldquo;I will drive the cattle in at night, and help about the place night and day, as I am not able to do the average heavy work of an ordinary labouring man, and if I get £1 a week and my meals it will be better to me than to be on the rates.&rdquo;  I can well understand a neighbouring farmer saying that that man would be welcome on those terms, and there would be no sense of obligation on either side.  There would be the readiness of such a disabled man to knock about in the evening time, when the ordinary labourers had gone home, and it may be a convenience to a farmer who might want to go to town and wish to have some dependable person about the house in the evening.  I can well imagine the situation arising, in the case of a dispute, where such a labourer might go into court and dishonestly say that he had entered into a contract with that farmer and now claimed to recover ten years' arrears.</P>
    <P>All of us who know the country are aware that not infrequently there is about a farmer's house maybe a dummy or a disabled individual who for years has been an indetermined retainer.  Such a person, if malicious, might institute proceedings against a perfectly <i>bona fide</i> employer and recover 10/- or 15/- a week for a period of ten or 15 years, because the employer had not conformed to the technical necessity of getting a certificate from this man before he was employed. I think it is right that the farmer should be entitled to go into <Col N="1858" /> court and say, in his own defence, that he did not look upon this man as a labourer at all, but as the afflicted child of a neighbour for whom he was glad to provide an opening, and that it never crossed his mind to go through the performance of getting a certificate, and that he was prepared to produce abundant evidence that the man's condition was such, at the time the contract was entered into, that the certificate would have been issued had it been applied for.  Where the court is satisfied that that is so, it ought to have the power, provided here in Section 5, to deem that such a certificate had been issued, and dismiss the case.</P>
    <P>Where an employer has hired an able-bodied man at a lower rate of wages, he is clearly bound under the moral law to restore to that man, no matter how long it is due or how much the sum, what he was immorally withholding. I think it would ill become this Legislature to lay down that we withhold from the employee his right to assert at law that moral claim, against which I do not think any citizen of this State would contend. Surely the farmers of this country are not so low-grade that they do not know the difference between right and wrong?  I believe every farmer knows perfectly well what his obligations are. I cannot conceive a situation in which a farmer had in his employment a man who was receiving less than the statutory rate of wages not knowing at some stage that that situation obtained. I am convinced that 99 per cent.  of the total number of cases where agricultural wage earners were getting less than the statutory wage will prove to be cases where the employer well knew that he was not paying the full rate.  In such a case, I would allow of no limitation to the claim.</P>
    <P>I think it is perfectly right, as provided in this Bill, that an employee, to assert his claim, should take action within a limited time after his employment with the man had ceased.  I see the provision here is that he may institute proceedings at any time within two years of the cesser of his employment. I presume that if he continues in the man's employment, some section <Col N="1859" /> here operates to limit his right of recovery to two years.  I could justify limiting the period after the cesser of employment for the institution of proceedings to six months.  As soon as the labourer becomes aware of his rights, he ought to make up his mind whether he is going to assert them or not; and he is not entitled to keep that decision hanging, like the sword of Damocles, over the head of his employer. The employer is entitled to say to the ex-employee: &ldquo;If we have differed, let us go to law within a reasonable time and have the matter determined between us.&rdquo;  It is not fair to leave the farmer, not knowing what is going to happen and having no means of bringing the case to a conclusion, for two years after he has received notification of the employee's claim.</P>
    <P>I therefore urge most strongly on the Minister that he should reconsider his attitude on Section 4.  Unless the right of the employee to recover in full that which has been wrongfully withheld is left unlimited, I think the very small number of persons who would defraud labourers of their hire will be tempted, by the possibility of never having to recoup more than two years' arrears, to try it on.  But should they successfully try it on for ten, 15 or 20 years, and be liable at the end of so long a term to repay all that they have stolen, very few boys will take the risk.  Consider what this means: pause before you opt for this.  Suppose you deny the agricultural labourer 2/- a week, that is, 104/- a year or £10 8s. for the two years; suppose you consistently, over a protracted period, endeavour to screw down your employee to the lowest figure he will take, the maximum penalty, the worst that can befall you, if you are paying your employee 2/- a week too little, is that that employee will recover £10 8s.  Do you not think a lot of people would take that risk?</P>
    <P>Why should we concern ourselves for people who withhold from the labourer his hire?  For such people I have no sympathy at all; I would give them no protection from the law, good, bad or indifferent.  I would extend no <Col N="1860" /> sympathy to them; they should be made answerable to the last penny.  I cannot conceive of any argument being advanced to justify a concession of this kind.</P>
    <P>Mind you, there may be some people who will answer me by asking: Why do you justify the statute of limitations at all, for the simple reason that if a creditor allows a debtor to lose sight of his liability for the want of due prosecution of his rights, it is contrary to precedent that the law should be invoked to correct the laches, the laziness of the creditor?  At any period of the currency of the debt the debtor could be brought to court and the creditor could get his decree. The reason he did not go is pure laziness or reluctance to enforce the debt.  If his reluctance mounts to the stage when he allows it to go on for six years, that is a kind of implied indication to the debtor that he is not to be forced to pay.  There is no analogy between the relations of those two persons and a man depending not only for his own livelihood, but for his wife's and his children's livelihood on the good will of the other party to the contract, a man who, if he claims his due, may find himself on the side of the road with no job at all.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of this wage-fixing machinery is to come to the assistance of persons who are constrained by the social conditions obtaining in this country to enter into contracts while they are at a material disadvantage <i>vis-a-vis</i> the other party to the contract.  Why else fix wages? Is it not fantastic, after you have set up a whole structure of wage-fixing machinery on the ground that the labourer, in whose behalf you have passed the legislation, is comparatively defenceless <i>vis-a-vis</i> the employer, to come along at the next stage and take from the employee the most effective sanction he can invoke against a dishonest, law-breaking employer?  I cannot believe that this House will take up the position that that which everybody here is agreed upon is a sin crying out to Heaven for vengeance is to be afforded the protection of special legislation.  If that aspect of the problem has not presented itself to <Col N="1861" /> the Minister or to Deputies, I ask them to consider it now and allow us to mend our hand in respect of the proposals in Section 4.</P>

      <P>He cannot take his medicine, but he can administer it all right.  &ldquo;Tripe,&rdquo; he said, and then walked out.  I do not know any of these farmers who do not pay their men a fair wage.  One would imagine that the farmers are parasites.  We looked here for £3 an acre, but most of the House voted against us.  I was working last Monday evening on a Tipperary farm.  The rain was coming and the horse-flies in the fields were taking bits out of our faces.  The conclusion I came to, not for the first but for the twenty-first time, was that you could put a man working on every 30-acre farm, two men on every 60-acre farm and three men on every 90-acre farm, but this House would not give us sufficient to pay them.  The gentleman who talked about tripe walked out. He was one of the crowd who walked into the Lobby against us when we tried to give the farmers something reasonable.  I am sorry he did not wait to hear me; he was going to get it.  We were looking for 1/- a gallon for milk.  I was reminded of that, too, <Col N="1862" /> when I was at the hay last Monday and the rain was coming.  &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;it is dung we are making and not hay, and we are sick turning it.&rdquo;  Twenty cows came through the thorny hedges; the place was badly fenced.  We could not get men to fence the land because the House here would not give us the wherewithal.</P>

      <P>I am merely alluding to the fact that there is talk about farmers not paying wages and yet the House is not prepared to treat them reasonably.  There is not a farm-house in any part of the country that a hungry man is allowed to pass by any day of the year.  Farmers do not defraud people out of their wages.  The gentleman who walked out lectured us on the Ten Commandments, on the sins crying out to Heaven for vengeance, and talked of tripe and cowheel.</P>
      <P>I do not think this is a fearfully important measure.  The farmers in Tipperary are paying more than the minimum wage; at least, they are paying the minimum wage and are treating their men well.  The difficulty is to get men on the land.  You are not making it attractive.  Our sons are going off the land &mdash; they will not stay there. Deputy Dillon hinted at an exportable surplus.  If he got milk at 5d. per gallon he could export butter and it would be all right.  We do not want Deputy Dillon's lecture on these matters. We have got fair sick listening to him.  Give us a fair show.  We have asked for reasonable prices in order to be able to employ and pay men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We asked for a fair price for beet. We find it hard to pay our men, but we are doing our best.  You did not accede to our request to increase the price of milk and beet.  The £3 an acre has gone by the board now, because the war is over.  The English farmer was getting £10 an acre for potatoes.  We did not.  If you increase the price of beet you will be able to give sugar to the nation.  I am sorry the tripe-and-cowheel gentleman did <Col N="1863" /> not wait.  He is not half as sick of me as I am of him, and the Tipperary farmers are sick of him, too.</P>

      <P>I agree with other Deputies who suggested that we should endeavour to improve the conditions under which agricultural workers are trying to exist.  If we are anxious to compete with other countries, such as the country across the water, to which is every inducement for our workers to emigrate, we shall have to improve the position in our own country.  The only way in which the conditions of the agricultural workers here can be improved is by the introduction of some scheme whereby they will be entitled to a least one week's leave.  They are contributing very substantially to the production of foodstuffs here and, as regards the harvesting operations, I would like to suggest that the Minister should seriously consider granting a harvest bonus to agricultural labourers.  That in itself would improve the conditions under which these people are trying to exist at the moment.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that it was the wish of the Department that these workers should be kept on the present rates of pay.  Is that a fact? I certainly agree with the suggestion for a harvest bonus, and I had a question down last year in that connection. I do not agree with the Deputy <Col N="1864" /> from Tipperary who spoke of being unable to get men.  I think that is wrong, because, according to the unemployment figures, we have thousands of unemployed, and I find that when jobs at the turf dumps are available, the farmer's son goes in, while the ordinary worker on the dole has to remain.</P>
      <P>We speak of the flight from the land. It is the farmers' sons who are leaving the land, while the agricultural worker has to live on starvation wages of £1 19s. 6d. per week, and pay out of that 2/6 a week to the board of health for a cottage.  It is impossible for the agricultural worker to live on that wage with the cost of living as it is to-day.</P>
      <P>I hold that the small farmer should be subsidised because the man who is unable to pay on Saturday night cannot keep a man.  Big industries are subsidised and small farmers should also be subsidised to enable them to employ men.  The Bill provides that a farmer can work a man for upwards of two years, and to get money owing to him the labourer will have to go into court and pay a solicitor, which will probably cost half the amount due to him.  There is no protection in the Bill for the agricultural worker.  The majority of them are unorganised, but there is protection for the farmer after two years, because, I suppose, since the local elections, some of the Fianna Fáil farmers have spoken to the Minister and have told him that a certain number of farmers have had to pay up.  It is very unfair that a working man should have to bring a farmer into court to compel him to pay the miserable sum of £2 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing must be done: we must encourage the workers to stay on the land and the only way in which that can be done is by paying them.  If we want contented men, we must pay them.  The majority of farmers are paying, but others are escaping, and the man who works with them is in a very bad position.  He may be living in the house which belongs to the farmer, and if he seeks to get his money he may be told to get out of the house, and he probably will not get a job in that area again.  I know that there are people in this position, because I <Col N="1865" /> get letters from agricultural labourers in my constituency asking me to send down the Wages Board inspector or to forward his address to them.  As other Deputies have said, we have inspectors dealing with old age pensions and widows' pensions, but wage inspectors are very few.  I have never seen them yet.</P>
    <P>The farmer has guaranteed prices and the Minister should take his courage in his hands and ensure a guaranteed wage and protection for the worker.  During harvest time in years gone by, they got a bonus, and they should get a bonus to-day.  It may be said that these men get many perquisites.  There may be a few decent employers who give them milk or potatoes, but not all of them do so, and, if we want to employ men on the land, the small farmer must be aided. It is easy enough for the man with capital who can carry on from harvest to harvest.  He probably has a milk or other business to bring in money every week, but the farmer with only a small acreage is not able to pay and these are the people who must be assisted, because they are in as bad a position as the worker.  They are just struggling from one threshing to another and working on credit.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to increase the rate of wages.  Industrial workers have got a bonus of 11/- per week and how can we expect men in rural Ireland with £1 19s. 6d. per week to bring up families, pay rent and insurance and meet other liabilities, such as clothing and boots?  In fact, they cannot buy clothes and the purchase of agricultural boots at £2 per pair is beyond them.  These are the matters which will have to be faced if we are to keep our men on the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal feature of this Bill appears to be to prevent the agricultural labourer from recovering any arrears of wages due to him after a period of two years.  I cannot understand the attitude of the Minister in this connection.  It is all very well for him to say that an agricultural labourer offers himself for employment at a lesser wage than the minimum wage laid down by the Wages Board, but I am sure the Minister is as well <Col N="1866" /> aware as I am of the conditions which prevail in various parts of the country.</P>
      <P>As other Deputies have pointed out, a man may be in very bad circumstances. There may be three or four other men in similar circumstances in the particular district in which the job is available and he may be compelled by force of circumstances to take advantage of a farmer's offer, which may be that he will take him into his employment at a lesser wage than is required to be paid by the regulations.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the attitude of a man who goes into employment at lesser wages, but that is the position which prevails, and in that connection I should like to ask how often the Minister's inspectors visit various districts. Do they visit these districts of their own accord, or do they not visit them until asked to do so by an agricultural labourer or on representations made by some person on behalf of an agricultural labourer?</P>
      <P>I have never yet heard of a case in my county of visits having been paid to farmers in an endeavour to find out what wages are being paid to their employees.  We all know that it is possible to find unscrupulous employers amongst farmers, as amongst others, and if a man complains to the Wages Board that he is not getting the minimum wage, such a farmer may be brought to court, but it will follow, as night the day, that that man will be discharged from his position as soon as the court case is over.  I think, if the Minister were to provide that there should be visits from his inspectors in those districts at certain periods, there would be tightening-up in connection with the payment of the proper wage to agricultural labourers.  When he is replying, I should like him to tell us whether the inspectors visit the various districts periodically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general question of agricultural wages, is the Minister able to give us any idea as to how the wages are determined?  What evidence is taken into consideration?  It would appear to me that the method adopted is a slipshod one&mdash;that it is merely a compromise between one thing and another. Has any effort been made to <Col N="1867" /> ascertain what, if any, the profits of the farmer are?  Has it been ascertained whether the farmer is in a position to pay the minimum wage that is in operation now, or whether he is in a position now, or will be at any future date, to pay a higher wage? In an ordinary industry if a man is not able to pay an increase in wages to his employees, he is helped by the Department of Industry and Commerce in some cases, or he hands on the increase to the consumer.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a state of affairs in which the whole question of agricultural prices would be examined, and an effort made to find out what is the exact relationship of the wages now being paid to the profits, if any, that the farmers are making.  I do not think it is good enough to say that a farm labourer shall have only £2 a week and that the farmer is not able to pay any more.  I think some proof should be forthcoming.  If the farmer is not able to pay any more because of the prices he is getting for his produce at the present time, then his prices should be adjusted in such a way as to enable him to pay a decent wage to his labourers.  The farmers and the farm labourers have been the Cinderellas of this country in so far as the economic system is concerned.  I would urge the Minister to say if he is aware as to how the wages are determined by the Agricultural Wages Board.</P>
    <P>Some speakers have referred to the fact that the agricultural labourer gets no holiday.  In recent years, under the Conditions of Employment Act, industrial workers were given a week's holidays in the year, and they are paid for certain bank holidays.  In some areas the Catholic holidays were substituted for bank holidays.  I do not know anybody in this country who wants holidays worse than the agricultural labourer.  He is employed at a long, weary, monotonous week's work.  He has longer hours than the industrial worker.  He works all day, from Monday until Saturday, inclusive, and in a great many cases he has to work on Sundays, so that to all intents and purposes he has a seven-day week. <Col N="1868" /> Surely it is not too much to expect that the farmer should be asked to adjust his work in such a manner as to enable the farm labourer to get holidays in the same way as the industrial worker gets them.  He should at least be given a half-day in the week.  The farm labourer has shopping to do, just the same as anybody else.  He has to buy clothes and boots.  The Minister should ask the Wages Board to go into that matter with a view to finding out whether it is possible &mdash; I believe it is possible, with good will on the part of the farmer and the farm labourer &mdash; to give the farm labourer at least a half-day's pay.</P>
    <P>On various occasions in this House questions have been put down requesting the Minister to ask the Wages Board to grant a harvest bonus to the farm labourers.  As the Minister knows, under the Corn Production Act introduced by the British Government during the last war there was a stipulated amount of money paid as a harvest bonus to the farm labourer.  I suggest that that should be done now. We notice within the last week that certain workers are being asked to work to help to save the harvest, and those men are getting a good deal more money than the agricultural labourers. I do not begrudge them that money; I think they earn it.  But surely if those men are brought in at a higher wage than that paid to the farm labourer, the latter should get something by way of encouragement at harvest time.  In dealing with this matter, I am not saying for a moment that farmers generally are not paying the minimum wage.  I am perfectly satisfied that 90 per cent. of them are paying the minimum wage.</P>
    <P>I think the Bill is wrong.  I agree with Deputy Dillon that a man should pay his lawful debts even though two years have passed.  There is not a bit of use in his craw-thumping so long as he is not paying his agricultural labourers what they should be paid according to the law.  Apart altogether from the law, there is the moral aspect of the matter.  The farmer has no right to keep a man working from Monday to Saturday and sometimes on Sunday, and at the end of the week <Col N="1869" /> not give him sufficient money to enable him to keep his children in a proper manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The first question I was asked by Deputy Fogarty was with regard to gardeners.  If anybody will examine the Act he will find in Section 2 a definition which decides what an agricultural labourer is.  In effect, it amounts to this, that any person who is working for a farmer, at market gardening or anything else, comes under the Agricultural Wages Act.  The only gardeners who would be exempt are those working in city gardens, and I do not think it would be possible to do anything about that category under this particular legislation.</P>
      <P>I think it would be more appropriate to some of the other Acts which have been brought in with regard to conditions of employment.  It is true that it is a minimum wage.  I think that is known generally throughout the country. Deputy Fogarty made some statement that some body, an agricultural wages board or something else, had fixed the wage for Dublin and other places for attendants on threshing sets.  That is not true.  Deputy Larkin talked about the general idea of, say, regulation of wages.  It is done either through organisation of the men themselves, that is, trade unionism, or it is done by legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always looked upon this legislation dealing with agricultural wages as a scheme more or less to replace trade unionism, because it was not possible for trade unionism to organise agricultural workers.  I looked upon the machinery set up as, more or less, taking the place of what might be regarded as the meetings from time to time of the representatives of workers, through trade unions, and the representatives of employers.  Deputies are aware that, first of all, there are committees set up throughout the country. On these committees are representatives from each county of employers and employees.  These committees meet occasionally and make certain proposals for consideration by the central board which, again, is composed of representatives of employers and employees with what are called <Col N="1870" /> three neutral members and the chairman. Where the representatives of the employers and employees on the board agree on anything with regard to wages, the chairman just accepts it.  It is a sort of conciliation up to that point.  If the parties concerned agree the chairman makes it a rule of law by issuing an Order which must be obeyed.  If, however, they do not agree, then the chairman has these three neutral members as his advisers, and the rule that he makes at that stage becomes arbitration.  The scheme may have defects, but if we look on the present scheme in that way, and if we want to make any improvements in it we ought at least try to recognise what is the true position, and then go ahead and make any improvements that we think fit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin talked about the low fines imposed in cases that come before the courts.  I answered a question which the Deputy put to me some time ago on that matter, and in my reply I gave some interesting figures. I think it would be no harm if I were to repeat them.  I told Deputy Larkin on that occasion that from the time the board was set up in 1937, up to the end of 1944, the inspectors under the board had carried out, roughly, 50,000 inspections.  They found breaches of Wages Orders in 7,000 cases, roughly, out of 50,000.  They brought only about 50 cases to court. I do not know if Deputy Larkin gathered from my reply that, in all other cases where there had been breaches of the Orders, the inspector was satisfied that the employer had been acting in ignorance and, what is more, the employer made things right by paying up whatever arrears were due to the employee, and continued to pay the proper rate of wages from that date on.  Where the inspector was fairly well satisfied that the wrong wage was being paid through ignorance, he was right to settle the thing on the spot and not proceed any further, but where he suspected that the offence was not due to ignorance then there was a summary case brought to court.</P>
    <P>That, however, was not Deputy Larkin's complaint.  It was that the penalties imposed were very small.  I <Col N="1871" /> agree that the fines imposed were very small.  No fine was higher than £15. It must be remembered, however, that was the fine for a breach of the regulations but, in addition, it must be assumed that the court ordered the arrears of wages due to be paid up Perhaps that was the reason why the court was a bit lenient &mdash; that a big amount of arrears was due and that, as the employer would have to pay up these arrears, it considered that was sufficient for the time, anyway.  I am only suggesting that as a possible reason for the low fines.  I agree with Deputy Larkin, or any other Deputy who may look back on the answer to the question that I gave on the 26th of April, that the fines were very much smaller than I would like them to be in such cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But where there was a large amount of arrears to be paid, surely it was reasonable for the court to impose only a moderate fine?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Although in all reason the fines should be higher, it was human for the Justice to come to the conclusion that as an employer had to pay arrears amounting perhaps to £200, it was not possible for him to pay very much in the way of a fine. Deputy Larkin said that the inspectors were withdrawn at a time when their services could be more justifiably used. He said they were withdrawn at the beginning of the war when farmers were better off.  I must say that I look upon it in a different way.  I look on it in this way, that it was not likely that any employer would try to evade paying the minimum wage during the war for the reason that it was a little bit difficult for employers to get men. I do not know of any area where employers were able to get men easily. They certainly were not able to get them during the last four or five years if they did not pay them the proper wage.  At the time the inspectors were withdrawn there was some difficulty in finding inspectors for various other schemes.  I think we were justified at the time in withdrawing them.  In fact, at that time the Agricultural Wages Board agreed that there was not then the same necessity for close inspections <Col N="1872" /> as had obtained up to that period.  I think that if there was any danger of any slight depression in agriculture the services of the inspectors would again be required, at least to the same extent as before the war.  At the same time, I want to say that I do not think there are many defaulters under the Act at the moment.</P>
      <P>It is not true, as some Deputies have said, that the legislation in general is there for the benefit of the employer and is weighted more or less against the employees.  It was certainly claimed by some Deputies that the amendments in this Bill are so weighted.  That is not altogether just. It was also stated by some Deputies that if an employee having worked for, say, two years with a farmer, finds that he had been underpaid, he has to brief a solicitor and pay court costs in order to get his money.  That is not altogether right.  Under the Act the Board is empowered to act on behalf of the employee, and, as far as I know, it has never refused to take up the case of an employee who, in its opinion, had a genuine claim for the recovery of wages.  The Board will take up a case for an employee and, if necessary, will go to court and fight the case in order to get him the wages due to him.  Therefore, I do not think it can be said that the Board or the legislation is in any way against the interests of employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Labour Deputies have made the point that it is unfair to limit the wages due to a period of two years. Deputy Dillon, from another angle, made I think the same point.  In connection with Deputy Dillon's point, I want to say that I am sure it is a big moral offence for an employer not to pay the proper wage to his employee, but I think we will have to leave the employer to be dealt with by another court as far as that is concerned, and just deal with him here under the Agricultural Wages Act.  Under the present law an employee can claim wages for 20 years only and not for all time.  Obviously, therefore, whether it is 20 years, ten years or two years that is in the Act, it is a matter of degree.  It is not a matter <Col N="1873" /> of principle but of expediency what number of years we use.  The area committees of the Wages Board recommended one year.  I thought one year was too little and I changed their recommendation to two years in bringing in the Bill.  Remember the point that they made&mdash;I mention it again because Deputy Dillon spoke of a man who found it hard to get work and who eventually went to an employer and said: &ldquo;I will work for 2/- less than the proper wage.&rdquo;  That particular man is doing a great injury to his fellowmen by agreeing to work for less than the proper wage and I think we should not encourage him to do it.  If we are entitling him to two years' arrears, it is not so bad but we should not allow him to go on too long.  We ought to say: &ldquo;You can only carry on that game for a certain length.  If you continue more than two years, you will not get anything out of it.&rdquo;  In other words we ought to make him take action against the employer.  That will have a good effect in the area.  The local employers generally will pay the proper wages in future.  I think it is a good thing that there should be some limit to it.</P>
    <P>I should like to put it to Deputy Larkin and Deputy Corish, if they had a man in their union who was working with an employer, unknown to them, for 3/- or 4/- less than the recognised wage of the trade union, would they be very nice to him if they discovered it after two years?  Would they shake hands with him and say: &ldquo;Go on; we will get your money back&rdquo;?  I am quite sure that under their union rules they would have power to deal with a man of that kind and that he would not be considered a good union man or a great friend of the union and probably would be dealt with very severely.  I do not think we ought under any circumstances to be too kind to a man who takes work at less than the proper wage.  I am talking now of the able-bodied man.  I should like&mdash; as Deputy Larkin urged&mdash;to try to penalise the employer more, if possible, but, of course, penalising the employer more by lengthening the period is, in my opinion, being too easy on the employee. If we could have some sort of system whereby we would allow the <Col N="1874" /> employee a maximum of two years' arrears but at the same time make the employer pay dearly for what he had done, it would be the ideal thing.  The only thing I suggest in that case is that we should try as far as possible to make the penalties as high as possible.  Again, I am up against a stone wall there.  I have tried a system of minimum penalties and I do not think it is a great success.  Therefore the only thing I can suggest is, if this Bill is passed, and if the employer is going to get away with a maximum of two years' arrears, to put it to the Board that in all cases in future, wherever possible, they should plead as hard as they can for a heavy penalty on the employer who is defaulting. I think it is only fair and just that he should be made pay up, if this Bill is passed.</P>

      <P>I do not know.  The court, I am sure, will see that things are done fairly.  Deputy Larkin mentioned the point about the selecting of names for these committees and boards.  That is an extremely difficult matter.  When this Bill was before the Dáil in 1936, it was recognised by everybody present that, practically speaking, there was no such thing in this country as a labour union representing the agricultural <Col N="1875" /> labourers and no such thing as a farmers' union representing the farmers.  It was, therefore, put into the Bill that the Minister for Agriculture would select representatives of farmers and of employers and employees for the committees and for the central board.  In fact, in the beginning I consulted the county committees of agriculture and they were helpful as far as the employers' representatives were concerned but in very many cases they said they were unable to speak for the employees' representatives.  So, the thing went on.  It may be true, as Deputy Larkin has said, that in a particular area there may be some attempt at organisation of the agricultural workers, but I think no Deputy will claim that there is any substantial organisation of these workers.  In fact, I would say&mdash;I am not saying this by way of threat&mdash;that if the farmers were properly organised in a farmers' union and if the labourers were properly organised in a labourers' union, we could withdraw all this and let the two go ahead and fix their own business. This is only in lieu of organisation on both sides, and was brought in only because there was no organisation there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were three matters mentioned, which I am afraid, as was anticipated by the Deputies concerned, I have to plead are not altogether matters for this debate, that is, the harvest bonus, the half-holiday and the annual holiday.  There is no objection, as far as I can see, to the Agricultural Wages Board considering these matters.  I think it is the opinion of the Agricultural Wages Board that under the present law they have not any legal authority to fix conditions of that kind&mdash;such as half-holidays or annual holidays.  They could, of course, certainly fix a harvest bonus.  In any case, whether they have the right or not, I would feel very loath to approach them on a question like that, because I have never made any suggestion to the Agricultural Wages Board that they should raise or lower wages at any particular time, and I think Deputies will agree that it is much better that I should not, and <Col N="1876" /> that I should leave them to deal with these matters as they think fit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish asked a question as to the considerations that the committees and the board have in mind in fixing the wages.  I do not know.  I think the procedure is that they meet and I presume the employees take the initiative by saying they would like to have a little higher wage, and I suppose the employers point out what their position is, whether the position is better than it was last year or not. I presume they discuss the matter to discover what can the employer afford to give and what can the employee afford to live upon.  There has been a fair amount of unanimity on practically every change that was made so far. When the chairman submits a report to me in respect of any change in wage, he usually gives me the numbers who voted for and against in each committee, and the numbers that voted for and against, if there is a vote, at the Agricultural Wages Board.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, I do not know if there ever was a vote at the Agricultural Wages Board.  I think these things were always settled very amicably.  On every occasion, it was very strange that the general feeling all over the country was that there should be an increase of 2/6 or 3/- or no increase at all, as the case may be. It was in that way that it was fixed.</P>
    <P>I was looking up figures some time ago, on an occasion when I was speaking in the Seanad, on a motion dealing with agricultural wages; and I found that, if we were to take, for the year 1931, the three figures&mdash;the net output of the farmer, the cost of living and the agricultural wages&mdash;and compare them with the corresponding figures for the subsequent years up to 1944, it would be found that they went up practically <i>pari passu</i> up to 1944.  In referring to &ldquo;net output&rdquo; there, I mean the gross income of the farmer less what he has to buy in the way of imported feeding stuffs, fertilisers and seeds but not agricultural machiney, or payment for rent and rates.  There was always an exactly equal percentage in the three cases&mdash;I remember that it was about 70 per cent.  The cost of living went up by the same percentage as the income <Col N="1877" /> of the farmer and the wages of the labourer.  Therefore, if it can be assumed&mdash;I do not know whether everybody will agree or not&mdash;that the agricultural labourer was fairly treated in 1931, he is equally fairly treated in 1944; and that is all I can say about it.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the wages committees or the Agricultural Wages Board had these figures before them when making their changes.  I think the changes recommended by the committees and made by the board were made on the ordinary basis of negotiation, by the employers and employees discussing the matter and coming to a fair decision in regard to any increase.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1878" /> With reference to the point raised by Deputy Corish regarding the inspectors, the number of inspectors was reduced during the war and I do not think they go anywhere unless they are sent for.  I think the number of calls takes up all their time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="An Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>An Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Táirgim: Go léifear an Bille an Dara hUair.  As I informed the Dáil in reply to a Parliamentary Question on the 15th May last, it is obvious that so long as the position regarding essential supplies remains as it is at present, the Government will continue to require certain of the emergency powers which have been exercisable since 1939.  I also indicated, at the same time, that it was not the desire of the Government to retain the Emergency Powers Acts in operation for a moment longer than the public interest required, and that it was their intention to divest themselves of any powers which could be dispensed with without detriment to the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill which is now being introduced gives effect to the Government's intentions in this matter.  It provides (a) that the provisions in the Emergency Powers Acts relating to the postal and telegraph censorship and the censorship or control of newspapers, periodicals and films or the prohibition of the publication or spreading of any matter shall be dropped and that the Government shall be specifically precluded from exercising them; (b) that the provisions of the Emergency Powers (Continuance and Amendment) Act, 1942, regarding the imposition of minimum fines shall be dropped; (c) that the Emergency Powers (Amendment) Act, 1940, which provides for the arrest and detention, without warrant, of natural-born Irish citizens, shall not be continued and that the 1939 Act shall be construed in its original form in this respect; (d) that the Emergency Powers (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1940, which provides for summary trials by commissioned officers of the Defence Forces of persons not subject to military law, shall not be continued and that the prohibition against the exercise of this power shall be reinserted <Col N="1880" /> in the 1939 Act; (e) that subject to the above the Emergency Powers Acts should be continued for a further period of 12 months from the 3rd September next when they are due to expire in the ordinary course.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains the usual provision that the Government may, by Order, declare that the Principal Act shall expire on a date earlier than the 2nd September, 1946.</P>
    <P>With a view to dispensing to the greatest degree possible with the exercise of emergency powers, Departments have been instructed to examine the question of incorporating in ordinary legislation any powers which it may appear necessary to retain for an appreciable period, that is, powers relating to the provision and control of supplies and services essential to the life of the community.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government has already revoked a wide range of Emergency Powers Orders.  Details of these have already appeared in the Press. They cover such matters as censorship, military courts, sitting of courts in camera, powers to arrest and search without warrant, requisitioning goods and vehicles, Regional Commissioners, restriction of movements and activities of suspected persons and a variety of other subjects.  The examination of Emergency Powers Orders by Departments is continuing with a view to the revocation at as early a date as possible of every Order of a restrictive nature which can be dispensed with without injury to the public interest.</P>
    <P>I would draw the attention of the Dáil in particular to the repeal of the Emergency Powers (Amendment) Act, 1940, which provides for the detention of natural-born Irish citizens by way of Emergency Powers Orders.  Before the Bill becomes law, it is the intention of the Government to revoke the provisions of the Emergency Powers (No. 20) Order, 1940, under which natural-born Irish citizens were interned; but simultaneously with the making of the Revocation Order the Government will make and publish a proclamation bringing Part II of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1940, into force.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to have these powers <Col N="1881" /> of detention.  Six months ago the feeling was that even when the war was over it would be necessary in the interests of public safety to keep a number of these internees, the hard core of the organisation, in custody indefinitely until such time as the Government was satisfied that it could, with safety to the community, release them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What organisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The illegal organisation calling itself the I.R.A.  When the war ended, however, the Government reviewed the situation, and, with a certain amount of misgiving, decided to release all the internees.  The Government felt that these men must now see that the policy of trying to get control here by armed force and the policy of shooting individual policemen could not succeed.  The Government were warned that a certain number of these men who were under suspicion in the past for crimes such as murder, armed robbery, etc., would, immediately on release, set about reorganising, and return to their old ways.  Despite this, the Government decided to give them the chance to get back to normal lives. Almost immediately, however, after the men comprising the hard core had been released, the plotting was found to have recommenced.  The murder of police officers was under discussion and meetings were being held.  It has been found necessary to re-intern the former &ldquo;chief-of-staff&rdquo; who had been released. Apart from secret activities, this man had at a public meeting appealed to those who were listening to become members of the illegal organsiation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dáil will see, therefore, that it is necessary to have these powers and that while we are about to give up the powers of internment by way of Emergency Powers Order under the Emergency Powers Act, it will be necessary to keep these powers in Part II of the other Act.  For that, a proclamation will have to be made, and that proclamation will be made simultaneously with the withdrawal of the powers under the Emergency Powers Act.  I do not think that at this stage there is anything more I can say.  Points of detail <Col N="1882" /> which may come up for examination can be dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate opens, might I ask the Taoiseach if he can tell us what parts of the emergency powers legislation it is now proposed to repeal? As usual, the Bill is one by reference and it is difficult for Deputies to know what residue is left.  Could we learn at any stage of the proceedings, in the event of this Bill passing, what residue of the emergency powers will survive in the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The best time to deal with that will probably be on Committee Stage, because, as the Deputy has pointed out, it is legislation very largely by reference, and, as we go through it, it will be apparent what the residue is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Taoiseach's difficulty in answering my question at the moment, but surely it is essential for the House to know what the Taoiseach desires to retain of these powers and what, in fact, we are leaving to him by this amending Bill. Frankly, I do not know what powers originally conferred under the emergency powers legislation remain under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy looks at Section 9, he will see what will continue.  You will have to start off with the 1939 Act, except in so far as it is definitely and immediately amended by this Bill, and the other Acts in the Schedule which are wiped out, with the residue of the 1942 Act, so that you have the 1939 Act in so far as it will not be amended by this Bill and the 1942 Act.</P>

      <P>I hope to illuminate the darkness of Deputy Dillon's mind on this subject in a very short and simple sentence.  He wants to know what residue of the powers conferred under these Emergency Powers Acts <Col N="1883" /> will remain when this Bill passes into law.  The residue will be everything in the 1939 Act, as amended, with the sole exception of censorship.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, Section 2, sub-section (1) of the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, which contains the most drastic and comprehensive powers that could possibly be given by any Parliament to a Government, will still remain in operation, subject only to the provisions in Section 6 of this Bill, which have reference solely to censorship. Section 2 of the Act of 1939, which it is proposed to retain in all its vigour and in all its comprehensiveness, provides, in effect, that the Government may, by order, do anything. There is no limitation whatever imposed by the Act of 1939 nor is any limitation proposed to be placed by the provisions of this Bill on the powers conferred on the Government by Section 2, sub-section (1) of the Act of 1939.  The Government, with the sole exception of matters relating to censorship, can, by order, do anything they like.  They can repeal Acts of Parliament, amend Acts of Parliament, make orders which are equivalent to Acts of Parliament, and in fact, make orders which the Oireachtas could not make if the Constitution were still in full force and effect.</P>
      <P>The residue of powers comprises the provision that any order made by the Government cannot be questioned, having regard to the provisions of the Constitution.  In other words, the Constitution will still be in abeyance. The provisions of an order made by the Government or any Department of the Government, under this legislation will still override the provisions of the Constitution.  The Constitution will still remain in abeyance, as it has remained in abeyance since 1939.  That is the residue of power which it is proposed to leave to the Government by this Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 2, sub-section (1) of the 1939 Act provides that</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;the Government may, whenever and so often as they think fit, make by order ... such provisions as <Col N="1884" /> are, in the opinion of the Government, necessary or expedient for securing the public safety or the preservation of the State, or for the maintenance of public order, or for the provision and control of supplies and services essential to the life of the community.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Whatever opinion the Government may form upon any matter cannot, it has been decided by the courts, be questioned in the courts.  Section 2, sub-section (1), therefore, is a blank cheque to the Government to pass any order they like about any matter&mdash; whether for supplies, public order or anything else&mdash;and that cannot be questioned in the courts.  That order is valid, irrespective of the provisions of the Constitution and irrespective of whether or not it contravenes specifically any particular provision of the Constitution.  Section 2 (1) still remains. Section 2 of the Act of 1939 merely gives illustrations of what the Government can do by Emergency Order, but in no way controls the wide and comprehensive powers of the Government to do anything they like by Emergency Powers Order.</P>
    <P>The only clause in this proposed Bill which amends effectively Section 2 (1) of the Act is Section 6 dealing with censorship. The Taoiseach tells us that it is proposed to do away with minimum fines.  Presumably he is referring to the provisions in Sections 5 and 7 of the Bill when he says that the Bill proposes to do away with minimum fines, with the powers of arrest and detention of citizens, and other matters of that kind.  Even if Section 2 (1) is amended in the way in which it is proposed to amend it by Sections 6 and 7 of the Bill, it makes not the slightest difference to the powers of the Government conferred upon it by Section 2 (1).  Section 2 (1) is the provision that gives the Government power to do anything.  Section 2 (1) is amended only in reference to censorship. The other powers which the Taoiseach says that the Government are abandoning or divesting themselves of refer only to the illustrative powers that are referred to in Section 2 (2).  In other words, the position is that the Government can do <Col N="1885" /> anything by Order if this Bill is passed, except matters in connection with censorship.  That is a very short and, I hope, a very simple answer to Deputy Dillon's very straight question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If it were only correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I challenge the Taoiseach or any of his legal advisers to say it is incorrect.  I would be interested to know if the Taoiseach will have the hardihood to state that what I have said here is incorrect.  Section 2 (1), I repeat for the information of Deputies, is amended only in one respect by this Bill, and that is by virtue of Section 6 which provides&mdash;I am speaking comprehensively&mdash;for matters in reference to censorship.  Section 2 (2) of course is amended, but as I have already pointed out&mdash;I hope I am not wearying Deputies by reiterating it too frequently&mdash;Section 2 (2) of the Act of 1939 sets out a list of things which the Government may by Order do, but it is not in any way to derogate from or in any way affect the comprehensive and wide powers conferred upon the Government by Section 2 (1).  I therefore assert that the position is as I have said&mdash;that Section 2 (1) remains as it was enacted when the war in Europe broke out in 1939.  The Government, if this Bill is passed, may pass any particular legislation by Order about any matter they like, except censorship, and it cannot be questioned in the courts.  That is the position that we have to face here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in the few remarks he made in moving the second reading of this very drastic measure, gave hardly any justification for this Bill. He stated that he was carrying out the principle which he enunciated in a reply to a question put down by Deputy Dillon in May of this year.  In the course of that reply he stated, as he has more or less stated to-day, that &ldquo;so long as the position regarding essential supplies remains as it is at present the Government will continue to require the powers in regard to production, rationing, price control, etc., which they have exercised since 1939.&rdquo; He says that the Government are divesting themselves of their powers under this Bill, and he implied&mdash;<Col N="1886" /> though he did not state it specifically &mdash;that the result would be that the Government would have power only in matters relating to the topics referred to in the reply from which I have quoted, put shortly, matters relating to essential supplies.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated to the House, and I hope I have convinced the House, that this Bill goes very much further than the Taoiseach suggested in his statement here to-day. This Bill is not a Bill to enable the Government to have powers in relation to essential supplies.  It is a Bill continuing the powers of the Government under a wide variety of matters, under the widest variety of matters, in matters completely unrestricted except on the one matter of censorship. It might have been that a measure of agreement could have been obtained if the Taoiseach had come here and asked for this Bill, justifying it on the basis of the necessity for preserving essential supplies, for securing distribution of essential commodities, and for ensuring that prices would be kept down.  He might have had some measure of agreement on that, or at least on the granting of some particular powers in reference to those matters.  But what is the justification for continuing a Bill which enables the military to walk into a person's lands and take them without compensation?  What is the justification for allowing the military authorities to take possession of a person's house without compensation? Those powers are still continued.</P>
    <P>I do not know if Deputies or the public&mdash;except those members of the public whose property has been taken over in the last six years&mdash;realise that the Government have authority to take property without giving compensation. There is no provision in the Act of 1939 or in any Order made under that Act, enabling compensation to be had or assessed in any case where a person's property has been taken from him compulsorily under the powers of that Act.  In many cases the military authorities, where they took over lands or houses or property, did in fact either negotiate or allow compensation to be assessed, in one or two cases by the court, but I believe there has been <Col N="1887" /> a court decision to the effect that if the military authorities or the Minister for Defence representing those authorities or the Government, did not agree either to the measure of compensation or to a tribunal to assess that compensation, then the ordinary courts of this country have no power to assess or give any compensation for property taken over compulsorily under this Act.</P>
    <P>I myself was in one case where a farmer whose property was taken over brought an action in the courts to get compensation for the property that was taken from him and for the loss that he had sustained thereby.  I was met by the counsel for the State with the contention that the courts had no jurisdiction.  I raised the old case which was sufficient to torpedo the claim that was made by the Crown after the last war in England in similar circumstances that the Crown had the right to take property without compensation&mdash;the De Keyser Hotel case&mdash;and founded my argument on that to the court.  Fortunately or unfortunately&mdash;fortunately from the point of view of my client and unfortunately from the point of view of general principle&mdash;the matter was never decided by the court, because it was settled out of court, but in a subsequent action I was informed by a colleague that a decision was given that the courts had no jurisdiction in a matter of this kind.  This Bill, if it is passed into law, is going to continue that state of affairs, and I take that particular instance merely for the purpose of underlining the argument I am putting to this House, giving an illustration of the powers that are still being retained, and showing the untenable nature of the argument put forward by the Taoiseach when he submitted that the Government were divesting themselves of the powers under the Emergency Powers Act, 1939.</P>
    <P>I submit that the public interest requires that the Government should be divested, as quickly as possible, of all the powers that were vested in them under the peculiar conditions and dangerous circumstances that existed in 1939.  If there are any powers which <Col N="1888" /> the Government say they are advised by their officials are necessary, for a short space of time, to ensure the supply of essential commodities for the people, and, above all things, to keep down the price of commodities for the people, then let those powers be put into this Bill and they will get a sympathetic hearing from this side of the House.  There is no reason why, in the last couple of months, the Department, with the experience it has had in a period of nearly six years, should not be in a position to say: &ldquo;We can do without this, that and the other power, but we want those powers&rdquo;, naming them.  I think the House would give a much more sympathetic consideration to a Bill which set forth the specific powers which were being given to the Government, and in respect of each of which the Government made the case that the public interest required its continuance.  That is a course of action that I commend to the Taoiseach and to the Government.  I see no justification whatever for this Bill which is being recommended to the House by the Taoiseach on a false basis&mdash;as a Bill divesting the Government of powers when, in fact, it is a Bill retaining, or revesting, in the Government all the powers that they had during the war and during the emergency when the country was in danger militarily and economically.</P>
    <P>I do not think it requires any further statement by me to demonstrate the arguments against this Bill.  The people have been suffering grievously from the mass of Emergency Powers Orders with which they have been inundated in the last six years.  It has been utterly impossible, even for lawyers whose livelihood depends upon their day-to-day knowledge of these Orders, to have even the remotest idea of what is happening or what the law happens to be, not from day to day but almost from moment to moment.  It has been crippling the business community of the country to have these Orders coming out, necessitating the maintenance of additional staff and subjecting innocent people to prosecution.  It has been established in these courts that it was no defence for a company or an employer to say that he knew nothing about it when his servant made a <i>bona <Col N="1889" /> fide</i> mistake as <i>bona fide</i> mistakes were bound to be made under the spate of Orders that inundated the business, community in the last five or six years. It was no defence for an employer to say that a <i>bona fide</i> mistake was made by him.  It is no defence for a servant who has to work hard and who is trying to do his best if he contravenes the provisions of an Emergency Powers Order that he cannot buy in the Stationery Office.  That has frequently occurred because the Order had either not been printed or had gone out of print.  These hardships are to be continued under this Bill.  The Taoiseach gave an indication of some of the Emergency Powers Orders that were being revoked, but they can be continued by a stroke of the pen.  Each of them can be reimposed, and the power under it will still remain.  It is no assurance to this House or to the public to say that these Orders will not be reimposed, or that they will not be made to-morrow or the next day.  Merely to say, as the Taoiseach has said, that the Department is examining them, and that a number of them have been already revoked is not enough.</P>
    <P>I submit to the House that there is no justification whatever for this Bill. The powers under the Act of 1939 were given reluctantly by this House to the Government.  They were given with the idea that it would be wrong to withhold in the smallest degree the smallest power that the Government thought they should have to preserve the people of this country from the terrible dangers that threatened them in 1939.  The Government got those powers reluctantly from this House, and it is time now that they should be dropped.  The Taoiseach, in the course of his reply to Deputy Dillon, on the 15th May last, said that Deputy Dillon &ldquo;as well as any other person&rdquo; ought to know perfectly well &ldquo;that the emergency is not over.&rdquo;  I say with confidence and with gratitude that the emergency is over, at least to a very considerable degree.  While saying that, I recognise as fully as the Taoiseach does that the country is still faced with difficulties, but they are not the type of difficulties that enabled this House, <Col N="1890" /> unanimously, to grant these drastic powers to the Government.  We are not now menaced by invasion, by warships, or aeroplanes from any Government, either foreign or otherwise.  We are faced now with no military catastrophe. We are faced with no necessity for reposing in the military authorities any of the drastic powers that were conferred on them by the 1939 Act.  It is realised that there are still difficulties about supplies.  These difficulties will remain probably for many years to come, but they will occur in normal circumstances and not in the emergency circumstances that existed during the last five or six years.  We have had the Constitution in abeyance as well as those constitutional rights in it which are set forth in such high-flown language.  The Constitution had only been in operation for a year or two when the emergency came.  These constitutional rights have been eaten into by the decisions and operations of the Government in the last few years.  I say this, and I say it as solemnly as I can, that if these emergency conditions are artificially continued by the Government, and if these Emergency Orders are operated in the teeth of the Constitution then by the time the emergency is over you might as well scrap your Constitution and the fundamental rights that are contained in it in such high-flown language.  I think this Bill should be refused to the Government unless very drastic amendments are made in it on the Committee Stage, specifying and defining the powers they want.  Unless that is done, we propose to vote against the measure.</P>

      <P>We are entitled to measure a man's good faith by his candour.  If the Taoiseach wanted us in this House to know precisely what powers it was requisite for him to retain to meet the types of emergency that he foresaw in the immediate future, was it not open to him to draft a Bill setting out the powers that he required, declaring all previous Emergency Powers Acts repealed, and standing on the merits of the Emergency Powers Bill which he has now brought before the Dáil by outlining the specific powers that he ought to have to meet the emergency which he <Col N="1891" /> is prepared to describe for us? Instead of that he has adopted the extremely ambiguous expedient of bringing in a Bill by reference, and of representing that it divests the Government of the serious and important powers that were conferred upon them.  It is apposite to dwell on the fact that there remains a sub-section of the Bill which enables him to reinvest himself virtually with all the powers he has had up to this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an easy way of providing me and every other Deputy with a clear, uncontroversial picture of what the Taoiseach wanted, and that was to bring in a new Bill, bespeaking special emergency powers to meet the emergency that lies ahead and repealing all the emergency powers he has already in his hand.</P>
      <P>Then there could be no controversy across the floor between Deputy Costello and the Taoiseach as to what in fact the Taoiseach was asking us to do.  The Taoiseach is no lawyer, but doubtless he comes before us briefed by his legal adviser.  Deputy Costello is a lawyer, long versed in abstruse problems of the constitutional law, a man who repeatedly had to envisage the enactment of restrictive legislation such as the Taoiseach is asking for now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach forget the days when he was standing in these benches denouncing Deputy Costello for enacting the very legislation which he desires himself to retain in the present time?  Does the Taoiseach forget the days when he stood in these Opposition benches and charged Deputy Costello with being the instrument of tyranny because he devised the very kind of legislation that the Taoiseach is now advocating?  Does he want us to forget that the Taoiseach himself <Col N="1892" /> described Deputy Costello as the past master of legislation of this very kind? Does the Taoiseach want us to believe that he, a layman, was a competent critic of the lawyer's legislation but that the lawyer is incompetent to discern the true meaning of the layman's proposal?  I return to the acid test of the Taoiseach's good faith.  If he wants us to know the powers he desires to retain, let him draft a Bill setting them forth and bring it before this House and repeal all the Acts the vestiges of which he wishes now to preserve.</P>
    <P>I wonder is the Taoiseach beginning to think that our people have grown tired of the burdens of freedom? Liberty is a burdensome system for the average man.  To preserve it he must think.  To preserve it he must be vigilant.  To preserve it he must be prepared to make sacrifices.  I wonder does the Taoiseach think the time has come when our people want their thinking done for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently the Deputy is allowing his thinking to be done for him by the previous speaker.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I do not profess to understand the devious labryinth of the Taoiseach's mind.  No other human creature does.  And I see the effort to lead this Dáil into that devious labyrinth in the hope that it will there be lost and forget its duty. Let him produce his purpose and tell us what he wants in a Bill and then we can judge if the powers he now asks for are excessive or if they are no more than adequate to the crises that may come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us remember the circumstances in which we conferred the powers upon the Taoiseach that he now desires to retain.  The first Act was passed at the opening of the European war.  The Taoiseach came before us and said that at any moment he might be called upon to defend the territory of this nation against invading armies.  He came before us and said that so imminent was that danger that he was dividing the country up into sections, the complete isolation of which he envisaged, and he planned to establish a skeleton government in each of those sections lest the imminent invasion <Col N="1893" /> would isolate them.  He went on to ask for power to ensure that if an invading army succeeded in capturing his own person and that of all his Government the executive powers of State could be maintained by other authorised persons, and that the continuity of constitutional government in this country could be maintained no matter what forces were brought against us by a foreign enemy.</P>
    <P>That is the atmosphere in which he sought for and got the powers under the 1939 Act which Deputy Costello has read out.  Do Deputies forget the situation which obtained when the Taoiseach asked for and got the 1941 Act, when it was made manifest in this House that a conspiracy was on between the illegal organisation to which the Taoiseach has referred to-day, the I.R.A., and the German Government, between them, to deliver over this country into the hands of the German Army?  And it was because German agents were discovered to be in contact with the I.R.A., plotting for the overthrow of the legitimate Government of this country and the establishment here of a usurping government under the patronage of the German Reich, that the Taoiseach came in and we gave him all the powers that he asked for.</P>
    <P>So drastic were these powers, I remember members of the Opposition resisting and my saying: &ldquo;In the presence of a conspiracy of that kind, I am prepared to give the Government of the day any and every power necessary to trample it down.&rdquo;  We gave it to them.  Now the war in Europe is over.  Now the threat of invasion is passed.  Now the nation that contemplated attacking this country is no more, swept out of existence.  Why does the Taoiseach wish to retain these powers?  Does he anticipate invasion from Japan?  If you leave these powers in the hands of the Government now, ask yourselves when will be the acceptable time to take them from them?  At what stage is this House unanimously going to agree that something new has happened which calls for the withdrawal of those powers.  If the end of the threat of invasion to this country has passed with the conclusion of the <Col N="1894" /> European war, what other major event can happen in the world which will create a consensus of opinion in this House that the powers of these two Acts ought to be retained?  Mark well, that although the Taoiseach proposes to strip himself of the right to arrest and detain people without charge or warrant under the emergency powers, he announces his intention of acquiring the right under some other law. No one in this State can be more resolute in determination to crush any person or combination of persons who claim the right to overthrow the legitimate Government of this country by force of arms than I am, but since when has the only method of effecting that purpose been to take powers to arrest anyone without warrant or charge and detain them indefinitely? Is that going to become a permanent feature of our law?  Mind you, if it is, the pretence that this is a free country is going to evaporate.  We all have a tendency to contemplate extreme measures when there is a pretty general consensus of opinion against persons against whom they are to be invoked, quite forgetting that a day may dawn when they may be invoked against ourselves.  I have stood sufficiently alone in this country in my day to appreciate the nature of that danger; and it is hard to live if you believe that your enemies at any moment may encompass your destruction, without even giving you a dog's chance to fight.</P>
    <P>I recognise that, in times of unprecedented emergency, it may be necessary to take powers of that kind temporarily, until the desperate danger be past; but are we forever going to say to the citizens of this country that they may be apprehended and detained? Have we not reached the stage of public opinion yet in Ireland in which a person charged with armed conspiracy to overthrow the legitimate Government of the country can be prosecuted to conviction in the criminal courts?  Is there not sufficient unanimity amongst all sections of our people now to permit of our invoking the ordinary processes of the criminal law against those who seek to encompass the overthrow of the legitimate Government by <Col N="1895" /> force of arms?  If we have not yet reached that stage, when are we going to reach it, and if we are never going to reach it, how long will we hope that our right to call ourselves a free and democratic State will be left unquestioned?</P>
    <P>I remember listening with grave apprehension to the Taoiseach's answer to my question last May.  Yet I suppose it is human, at least partially, to believe that which you want to believe. I suppose instinctively one turns one's head away from the accumulation of incidents which, once faced together, lead to conclusions too horrible calmly to contemplate.  Why does the Taoiseach want the ambiguity of this Bill? Why does he want us to give him powers, the exact nature of which none of us knows?  I say deliberately that not a single Deputy in this House, perusing this amending Bill, fully knows the measure of the powers he is leaving in the Taoiseach's hands.  Why is that ambiguous course followed?  I am beginning to get uneasy about it.</P>
    <P>I see voluntary organisations engaged in voluntary work which is within the law summoned into the Taoiseach's room and told that he does not like their constitution and he wants it changed; and at the time he issues that unconstitutional and illegal ukase he imposes an absolute censorship on any reference to that transaction, if it is an isolated incident, it may be due to nothing more serious than oversight.  But when, on top of that, I see the Taoiseach, through his Ministers, leading off in a campaign to warn the trade unions of this country that, unless they are organised on lines that he approves, they must go, I behold in that merely a second straw which happens by coincidence to be floating in the same direction.  When, furthermore, the Government openly commits itself to the proposition that, in order effectively to pursue its policy, it must control all local authorities in the country, it must have in the Presidential Office a man who will interpret every doubt in the Government's favour and who will be of a sympathetic, understanding temperament, <Col N="1896" /> and when I know that the Taoiseach is on record as saying that he will not hold office in any Dáil in which he has not got an automatic machine majority; and when on top of that he implements his undertakings to do away with emergency legislation by an ambiguous Bill of this kind&mdash;which, in fact, leaves him the power to decree as illegal anything he does not like and to do it by a law against the effect of which no citizen of this State can invoke the Constitution&mdash;shall I be blamed if I think of the decent Catholic democrats of the Weimar Republic who saw the Dictator growing but could not believe their eyes, who gathered as some of us have gathered and said: &ldquo;Ah, well, he is a democrat after all; he does not believe in authoritarian régimes.&rdquo;  I do not believe the Taoiseach is a conscious dictator or consciously desires it, but I am honestly beginning to wonder if he has become so obsessed by his own destiny as a sort of divinely chosen leader of this country that he is prepared to say to himself: &ldquo;Rather than face the evil of my master plan being frustrated by opposition, I must face the lesser evil of suspending liberty until some time when my great purpose is achieved.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mind you, many a man who believed himself a good democrat could get himself into that frame of mind, and hateful as it is to imagine that we are facing a crisis of that kind in this country I am obliged to ask myself again why there is an ambiguous approach to this Bill.  Why is the House asked to decide, when no single Deputy knows the powers that the Taoiseach desires to retain?  Why is it asked so to decide, when it was possible to put into the hands of every Deputy a precise account of each power that he desired to have and into his hands an opportunity and occasion to explain the necessity of each one? Would that not have been the straight thing to do, the candid thing to do? Would it not have been the method of procedure calculated to win the confidence of all sides in this House in his protestations of his belief in freedom and the liberty of the individual?</P>
    <P>If we pass this measure and let the <Col N="1897" /> people think that in passing it we have swept away the bulk of the unconstitutional powers that have been exercised in this country during the past five years, we are misleading the people.  In fact, if we pass this Bill we are doing nothing but abolishing a censorship which, as far as I can see, could be reintroduced the day after to-morrow, if the Taoiseach desired to do so.  There will be Deputies in this House who may say: &ldquo;How solicitous members of the Opposition have become for the provisions of the Constitution.&rdquo;  That is the constant jibe of a majority Party that does not understand the methods of democracy.  If democracy is to work at all, when we have argued out legislation in this House and when it has been legitimately enacted for the country, then it should be loyally obeyed by all sides and it becomes the duty of every citizen to do his best to make it work until such time as, by legitimate means, he can secure its legitimate repeal.</P>
    <P>I opposed the Constitution, because I thought it was largely &ldquo;codology,&rdquo; and I still think it is, but that does not alter the fact that it is the enacted legislation of this country, and as such every citizen is bound by it until such time as it is legitimately repealed.  Are those who preach that doctrine to be derided before the country as two-faced frauds who invoke an instrument, the implementation of which they resisted so long as it was legitimate to do so?  There was a Constitution in this country before Fianna Fáil was ever heard of.  When Fianna Fáil came into office they succeeded in repealing that Constitution and substituting another. By that second instrument the constitutional rights of our people are regulated now, and a great many people in this country believe that, so long as it is there, essential freedom is secured.</P>
    <P>We are failing in our duty if we do not tell the people now of the events of which we have been witness for the past few months, beginning with the St. John Ambulance Brigade incident and culminating in events more recent and brought not to quite such a successful conclusion from the Fianna Fáil <Col N="1898" /> point of view.  We have a duty to say that we do not accept the Taoiseach's interpretation of the effect of this amending Bill and we have a duty to warn the people that if they subside into reassurance in the presence of this Bill, they are making exactly the same mistake as the well-intentioned Catholic democrats of the Weimar Republic.  Now is the time to be on their guard.  It may be that by vigilance and vigour we can wake the Taoiseach to the kind of road he is travelling.  I am not without hope that if he could see himself as others see him he might change his tune. Now we can do it within the Constitution and by constitutional methods.  Now we can preserve our liberty by persuasion and representation. That is the way in a civilised community to achieve that end.</P>
    <P>I measure the Taoiseach's good faith by this simple question: does he want Deputies of this House to understand the powers he desires to retain? If he does, let him draft a Bill, set them out and submit it to the House, and we will argue it here on its merits. But if he does not want it, if he wants to perpetrate a confidence trick on Deputies, he will produce an amending Bill which he represents as obliterating the greater part of the emergency legislation but which, in fact, leaves him all the effective powers that were given to him in an unprecedented time.  It is in the hands of the Taoiseach to recover the confidence of this House, or to leave us under the impression that we are being asked to do something which would be a fatal betrayal of our trust.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure the House that we will certainly vote against this Bill.  I am one of those who never desired to give those powers to the Government.  When there was an emergency in this country there were people who did vote that way. I suggest that in doing so they gave a bad habit to the Government and I believe that the giving of that bad habit is responsible for the Taoiseach coming here with this Bill in which he seeks actually to retain what I might call the most offensive portions of the Emergency Powers Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1899" /> We sometimes hear on public platforms statements of Ministers.  They tell us that they cannot bear an opposition. It is time for the people, and especially members of this House, to consider one important point.  This House controls Government, this House rules this country and no Party or Government should be placed in a position where they can work with Emergency Powers Orders without first coming before the House.  Very often during the past two years, even while the House was sitting, we could hear on the wireless during the news broadcast at night that certain Emergency Powers Orders were being put into operation.  Common courtesy demands that those things should first be mentioned in the House, but that was never done.  Statements were made even to political clubs and organisations when, in the ordinary course, they should first have been mentioned in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>It was a mistake ever to give such powers to the Government.  No Government, whether Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or any other, should have such powers.  I believe this House, composed as it is of the elected representatives of the people, is well able to <Col N="1900" /> rule the country and no hidden section is able to do so.  That is my honest opinion.  We will vote definitely against this Bill.  I am one who never will vote in favour of giving a Government or a Minister authority to retain any emergency powers in this country, more especially when there is no emergency.</P>
