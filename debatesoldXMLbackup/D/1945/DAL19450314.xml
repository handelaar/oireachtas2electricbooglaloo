    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Vote on Account, 1945-46 (Resumed).</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have listened for quite a while, in the course of the debate, to a number of items that were mentioned here in connection with our export trade, but, in my opinion, while that is important enough in its own way, there is one export that concerns this country much more, and that is the export of our people.  One thing that the Government should realise is that something must be done to prevent that, and I think that the one Department of Government that has the chief responsibility in that connection, so far as we in the West of Ireland are concerned at any rate, is the Land Commission.  It is that Department of Government, to a certain extent, that is responsible for the conditions in the West which have brought about the export of our people, because at the present time lands are being held in the West of Ireland and have been kept in the hands of the Land Commission over a long period of years. Those lands are not being divided and <Col N="1300" /> allotted out to our people as they should have been, with the result that many of our people have to leave the country.  That is also the cause of production from the land not having reached the peak that it should have.</P>
      <P>I have here a Report of an Inter-Department Committee on Seasonal Migration, 1937-38.  On that committee was no less a person than the present Minister for Lands, and in page 30, paragraph 57 of that report, I find this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;At present the Land Commission has on hands to be dealt with in the congested districts counties some 18,800 holdings and parcels of land purchased for the most part over 25 years ago by the Congested Districts Board and upwards of 37,000 holdings acquired by the Land Commission since the abolition of the Congested Districts Board for the purpose of improvement, rearrangement and/or enlargement where necessary before resale.  The preparation of these estates for resale will entail work....&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>And then it goes on to explain that as a result there were at that time 55,800 holdings in the hands of the Land Commission. I think it is up to the Government to make at least some attempt towards handing over these lands. Several times here, during the past 12 months, other Deputies for my constituency as well as myself raised the matter of the division of lands held by the Land Commission, but we are always told that we must wait until the emergency is over.  Surely, the emergency does not affect us so much as all that.  Some of the chief inspectors of the Land Commission have been taken over and put into the compulsory tillage section.  I think that that is a great mistake because you are hampering the chief department, which is the Land Commission, so far as production on the land is concerned and so far as keeping our people at home is concerned.  I urge the Government to hasten the division of estates.  I put down questions in this House and approached the Land Commission about estates so that certain people might be prevented from buying land <Col N="1301" /> that tenants expected would be divided amongst them.  In a certain area in County Galway recently the Land Commission allowed people to come in and buy land which had been set in conacre for the past five or six years, with the result that the former holders have no conacre now.  That is one reason why agricultural production in that county is not as good as it was. If land of that type was acquired there would be an improved output and a cessation of the export of our people. We heard a good deal about the importance of the home market.  It is a very valuable market and the only hope of this country.  Every effort should be made to make it a safe market.  The only way to do that is to build up the population from the present miserable figuré of 2,500,000.</P>
    <P>One way to do so would be to take steps to keep our people at home on some of the 55,800 holdings now in the hands of the Land Commission and to develop certain industries.  If we could bring about that position it would be a happy one.  Perhaps it could not be accomplished in our life time, but that was the aim of those who in the past sacrificed their lives for the independence of this country.</P>
    <P>I notice that one item in the Vote on Account concerns Secret Service. In the year 1932-33 the expenditure on that head was attributed to the infirmities of Cumann na nGaedheal, and it was stated that no such service would be required in future.  Since then the amount required for that service has increased to something like £20,000, or over 20 times what it was in 1932-33.  I wish the Minister would let the Committee know who were getting that money, what class of people they were and what useful purpose they served in this State.  I do not know if I am correct, but I understand that that Vote is not submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor-General for examination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I will refer to it later.  Our people are worrying at present lest they may be driven back to the position they were in before the outbreak of this war.  For instance, the labouring man does not want to find himself in a position where he will have to accept starvation wages, and producers of agricultural products do not want to find themselves compelled to sell beet at 30/- a ton or wheat at 27/6 a barrel.  These are things that should be guarded against, more especially in view of the fact that thousands of people who are now absent from this country will be returning home.  As Deputy Norton pointed out last night, our people in future will not be willing to line up at labour exchanges to seek work, but will expect some results from the plans made for them by the Government. Accordingly, it is up to the Government to have preparations in that respect made in the proper time.  Anything I have said is not meant by way of criticism.  I know that it is easy to criticise, but I ask the Government in their plans to consider the question of expediting the work of the Land Commission.  People talk about the value of our exports, but what about exporting our young people to labour in foreign countries?  I believe that 90 per cent. of our people will agree with what I say, that they are disappointed with what has been achieved by native Governments in the past 20 years.  However, there is <Col N="1303" /> no use in going back on the past.  We must look to the future, and for that reason I urge the Government to do something that will obviate the export of our young people by the provision of work on the land at home and by the establishment of industries.  That is the way to build up the population and to put this country into such a position that it will not be dependent on foreigners to buy our produce. I admit that the Government will not have an easy task before it, but I am asking them to do the best they can, and that being so, I can assure them that they will get any assistance this Party can give them. What has been done by the Government to develop certain of our products is all to the good, and has been in the right direction, and if they face the position that now confronts us, I believe they will get the co-operation of all Parties in this House, especially in their efforts to keep our people on the land and to increase production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking for County Galway, I think that the lands at present held by the Land Commission should be immediately divided.  This excuse of the emergency is very old and it counts no longer.  One would think that we were a people in the heart of the war area.  I could understand an excuse of that kind coming from a British Minister or from a Minister of a belligerent nation, but surely that excuse cannot hold here any longer.  I would ask the Government, especially the Department of Lands, to make sure that that state of affairs will not be allowed to continue.  Place our people on the land which the Land Commission has in their possession at the moment.  I would also appeal to the Government to prevent people from outside districts coming in to purchase land on estates which are required for the tenants of the particular district.  By doing that, the Government would take the first step towards increasing production and keeping our people at home.  By doing that, it will establish the people on the land of their forefathers, the land to which they are entitled and in many cases the land from which their forefathers <Col N="1304" /> were driven.  In this way, the Government will be doing something to achieve the programme which our people in the past visualised as one of the first objects of this Dáil.  They looked forward to the day when a native Government would do something to keep our people at home. That was what they worked, fought and died for and that is what this Government, 20 years later, has not given them in the way it should.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>One would have thought, now that the end of the war is in sight, that the Minister would have said something as to the position of this country after the war.  One would have thought that the post-war plans of the Government would be indicated to the House by the Minister for Finance.  We have been told that inquiries were made during recent months, that there is a special subcommittee of the Cabinet sitting and deliberating on this matter.  I suggest that the time has now arrived when the Minister and the Government should take the Dáil into their confidence and give us some idea of what they have in mind, so far as planning for the future is concerned.</P>
      <P>Within the past few weeks a report has been published in the newspapers on a post-war building programme and this morning we have received a White Paper indicating, not what the Government propose to do, but what demands have been made on the Government by various local authorities and other people concerned.  I have carefully read that document and I could not find any paragraph or section of it which definitely stated that the Government propose to carry out any of this building programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister knows, housing of the people is a very important matter. I want to give credit to the Minister for Finance for the great work he did in that connection when he was Minister for Local Government.  He did that, of course, because of the fact that he had been, for a number of years, a member of the Dublin Corporation and was very familiar with the housing situation.  I think he was satisfied, as <Col N="1305" /> a result, that large-scale housing schemes were absolutely necessary for our people.  In 1932 and 1933 we had two Housing Bills&mdash;the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bills&mdash;which are now Acts.  Under these Acts certain financial provisions were made for housing.  Certain grants were given and certain arrangements made in connection with the Local Loans Fund to advance money at a certain rate of interest.  At that particular period the arrangements were suitable or almost suitable, at any rate, to enable local authorities to proceed with large housing programmes.  From then on, up to the outbreak of war, materials had become very costly with the result that local authorities hesitated, even immediately pre-war, to proceed with housing schemes.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government was approached with a view to securing better terms for housing.  The Minister will remember that the financial position was that a subsidy of two-thirds was paid to the local authority on houses costing up to £300. I am speaking now of provincial towns.  After pressure had been brought to bear on the Minister by people interested in housing, it was agreed that the subsidy would be increased to two-thirds of £350.  That was helpful but since the war began the amount of subsidy given by the Government is not at all sufficient to enable the authorities to proceed with housing schemes and to have houses let to people at rents which they would be able to pay.  The house that cost £300 or £350 in the year 1938 would to-day cost £700 and that, in my opinion, would prevent local authorities from proceeding with housing schemes even if materials were available.  There may be some reduction in building costs after the war but I do not think it will be very great.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that it will be very hard to get materials for a considerable time.  There is some Irish material available but I am very much afraid that unless the rate of interest is lowered and unless two-thirds of a subsidy is given on the complete cost of the house, local authorities will <Col N="1306" /> be reluctant to proceed with the housing schemes which are now so badly needed.</P>
    <P>I may tell the Minister that it was possible up to 1938 to build, in the town of Wexford at any rate, at a cost which enabled the corporation to let a four-roomed house at rents of from 4/9 to 5/2 per week.  In 1939 that had increased to 6/6 per week but the same house now would cost about 15/- per week.  I think the Minister will agree that to take a man from a slum area where he had been paying a rent of only 2/- or 3/- a week and ask him to pay a rent of 15/- a week is going to create a situation which will bring about absolute chaos in the finances of the local authorities.  The Minister knows quite well from his practical experience in the service of the Dublin Corporation that it is very hard sometimes even to get people to come out of slums.  He knows the position in that connection and I need not tell him that when you have to compel them to come out of a slum where they have been paying 2/6 a week and ask them to pay 14/- or 15/- a week for a new house the position becomes ridiculous. I have had experience of taking people out of slums and putting them into new houses.  I know these people feel that they are unequal to paying the rent of the new houses.  The result is that they get into arrears in the payment of the rent and they find their way back to the slums.  The houses in which they lived have of course been demolished but they find their way back to houses in the same vicinity. They are taken in there as lodgers in one room and the position is no better, in fact in a great many cases it is infinitely worse, than at the time they were taken out of the original houses.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is anxious to help.  I suggest to him that at this stage there should be some kind of commission or committee set up of members of this House to examine the housing situation.  I feel certain that in anything the Minister does he is anxious to secure the co-operation of every Party and every individual in the House.</P>
    <P>I believe he can get that if he sets up a commission or a committee of <Col N="1307" /> inquiry, composed of Deputies.  There are many Deputies who are members of local authorities and I am sure they would be willing to pool their experiences, so to speak, and submit their conclusions to the Minister through the medium of a committee which he could set up.</P>
    <P>This White Paper is all right so far as it goes, but it does not state definitely that it is proposed to proceed with certain work immediately the war is over.  The Estimates this year show an increase and, so far as this Party is concerned, we have never been very much against increases so long as the money is spent in the interests of the people.  It will be noted that the Estimate for agriculture is reduced this year.  The Minister has, of course, given the reason for that.  Almost every Deputy who has spoken has referred to agriculture and I think, no matter what interest a Deputy represents, and no matter what part of the country he comes from, he should be interested in agriculture. It is a hackneyed phrase that agriculture is the staple industry of the country, but that, nevertheless, is true.</P>
    <P>I think the time has arrived when the end of the war appears to be in sight and when we should have a definite pronouncement from the Government as to what they consider the position of agriculture is likely to be in the post-war period.  We have a Farmers' Party in this House. Within recent weeks they tabled, and the House discussed, a motion asking for certain guarantees to be given to agriculture in the post-war period.  I suggest everybody in the House feels the same way so far as that matter is concerned.  After the last war agricultural matters were in a state of chaos. The fact that agriculture suffered so badly had certain reactions in the urban areas.</P>
    <P>Up to the time the war started the position of the agricultural labourer was an unenviable one.  A great many people to-day are inclined to pay a good deal of lip service to agriculture <Col N="1308" /> and the agricultural labourers, but are we to use agriculture and the agricultural labourer only during a period of stress in this country, during a period of emergency?  Surely we ought to recognise that these are the people who are keeping us alive, that these people are the foundations of industry, and that if agriculture is not kept on a proper plane there will be reactions in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>At the moment an agricultural labourer has £2 per week, which was given to him by the wages board.  Certain adjustments have been made in the prices of agricultural products, and these are thought by the Minister to place agriculture in such a position that it will be able to pay that wage.  I am not sufficiently informed in so far as the working of the agriculturists is concerned to know what their economic position is, but I do know that even now £2 per week is not sufficient to maintain an agricultural labourer and his family.  I would like anybody here to contemplate what his position would be if he were asked to live on £2 per week.  What I am afraid of is that, bad as the position is now for the agricultural labourer, if some kind of planning is not done to prepare for the post-war period the position will be infinitely worse.</P>
    <P>Something ought to be done soon by the Government, some statement ought to be made, as to what they propose to do in the post-war period.  Are we to go back after this war to the position in which the agriculturist will be entirely dependent upon a foreign market?  I know it is necessary to export commodities from this country, but let us export only what is surplus. If this country were properly developed, properly organised, I believe the home market would be capable of taking considerably more from the farmer than it is taking.  It is to be hoped that the Government will, in the very near future, indicate their proposals in connection with agriculture. The agricultural labourer will not go back to the position he occupied pre-war and neither will the farmer.  I will give the farmer credit for this, that if his position is made sufficiently strong to enable him to pay a decent wage to <Col N="1309" /> his labourers, he will be only too happy to do so.  I believe there is a good feeling between the agricultural labourer and the farmer.  That is as it should be, because without the co-operation of those people this country would be in a very bad way indeed.</P>
    <P>I noticed in examining the Estimates that there is a reduction in employment schemes for urban areas.  There is a decrease of £20,000.  I am wondering why that has come about because, even though 150,000 people have migrated from this country, we still have a registered number of unemployed to a total of 76,000.  That is a very high figure, when we remember all the people who have gone out of the country.  We know that there are still large numbers of unemployed in our urban areas.  We know that there are many good schemes waiting to be carried out.  I know that at the present time it is not easy to get certain materials for certain schemes, but there are schemes which would not require the materials which are at the moment in short supply, and they could be undertaken.</P>
    <P>Last year I mentioned here that the Wexford Corporation had submitted proposals to the Minister for Local Government for the provision of a public park.  The labour content on that particular job would be about 80 per cent.  Up to now no sanction has been forthcoming.  I believe schemes of that kind ought to be encouraged. An Act was passed here a few years ago which enables the acquisition of land to be short-circuited, but when we asked that that Act should be brought into operation, the Minister refused.  We all know that when the Minister for Lands, Deputy Ruttledge, at that time was trying to get that Bill through the House, he laid great stress upon the fact that this would enable the local authorities to take over land more speedily than they had been able to do in the past. I notice that unemployment assistance has been reduced this year by £110,000, and I am anxious to know how that came about, because the number of unemployed was about the same as last year.  Whilst there has been a decrease in the amount of money paid to the unemployed over <Col N="1310" /> a long period, I notice that there has been no decrease at all in the rate which the local authorities are called upon to pay to subsidise unemployment assistance.  In 1933, or 1932&mdash;I forget the year the Act was passed&mdash;it was laid down in the Act that the Cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, I think, were called upon to pay the sum of 1/6 in the £ in order to supplement the money the Government contributed to unemployment assistance.  Towns like Wexford, Sligo, Dundalk, Drogheda, Clonmel and Kilkenny were called upon to pay the sum of 9d. in the £.  That is a big impost on small towns.</P>
    <P>I think that the time has arrived when there should be some reduction in the amount asked for from the local authorities since the Government itself has very considerably reduced the contribution which it pays to the Unemployment Assistance Fund. Surely a proportionate decrease should have been made in the case of the contributions made by the local authorities as was made in the case of the contribution of the Government. I would ask the Minister to look into that, because at the present time local taxation is increasing. Anybody who has read the newspapers in recent weeks will find that the rates of county councils and urban councils have increased.  In most cases that is brought about by schemes initiated by the Government.  The Government stipulates that certain things should be done, and gives a certain amount of money, I agree, but the local authorities are also asked to pay a certain amount of money which to my mind is out of proportion to the amount the National Exchequer pays.</P>

      <P>Well, I am going away from it now.  I say that the Government <Col N="1311" /> gets the kudos but the local rates feel the brunt of these schemes.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies have mentioned the control of prices.  It has been the policy of this Government since the outbreak of the war to prevent trade unions from seeking wage increases for their members.  Stipulations have been made in connection with wages in a town like Wexford where a workingman's wages cannot be increased over £2 10s. 0d. a week.  That is a policy which we have denounced since its initiation by the Government.  Bad as that is I suggest that the Government has made no serious effort to control the prices of foodstuffs and wearing material.  I have only to refer to the fact so far as the drapery trade is concerned that the Minister for Supplies has given such a margin of profit that the drapers of this country are able to sell at considerably less than the prices agreed to by the Minister himself.  If you go into any draper's shop in the country the draper is in a position to sell an article a good deal less than the price fixed by the Minister. I defy contradiction on that. Whilst the Government have made every effort to keep down wages they have made no serious effort to deal with the question of prices.  I have no more to say on the matter except that I would ask the Minister when he is replying to this debate to give us some idea what it is proposed to do in order to save agriculture in the post-war period and also if he has any new financial proposals in connection with housing.</P>
      <P>Housing, as the Minister knows, is a very, very important social function in this country.  The local authorities are anxious to help but the local authorities hesitate to proceed with the building of houses for which they will have to charge a rent which the people are unable to pay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephHallide" hpid="Mr. Halliden Mr. Halliden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halliden</NameTxt>
      <P>A considerable time ago a commission was appointed by the Government to report on post-war agricultural policy.  That commission was composed of experts on various matters.  Although it did not comprise any farmers, so impressed was it with <Col N="1312" /> the desirability of keeping the key industries in a proper position that immediately or at least as quickly as possible it issued an interim report on dairying and store-cattle industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An interim report was supplied to the Government in July or August of 1943.  That is practically two years ago and it is incomprehensible why the Government have taken no practical steps to implement any of the findings of that report.  The dairying industry is a key industry in agriculture. There were very practical and very essential recommendations in that report and the Government have taken no steps to implement the findings.  It is rather unfortunate that an important report like that should be pigeon-holed by the Government at this time.  We have brought the matter before the Dáil and before the Minister frequently and still nothing has been done.  As Deputy Corish has said, every Deputy who spoke on the matter referred to the unstable position in which the key industry of the country is.  The report was supplied to the Government practically two years ago and no steps have been taken to implement its findings.  That is very unfortunate and it shows the attitude of the Government towards the agricultural industry.  If this ineptitude continues I am afraid that the farmers of the country, their families and labourers will find themselves in the unfortunate position in which they were after the last war. In support of what I say I find that in the Estimates for the coming year there is a reduction of £282,000 for agriculture.  I believe that if our Minister for Agriculture were on the alert he would not allow that colossal sum of money to be diverted from agriculture and put in the Treasury for some other purpose.  I have asked him some time ago to give, or, at least, to try to secure an additional grant for farm improvements.  The Minister told me that he had no intention whatever of making an additional grant for that purpose.  When we asked for a five years' long-term policy, the excuse the Minister gave was that he was afraid the Minister for Finance would not foot the Bill.  It has become fashionable <Col N="1313" /> for Ministers who are asked for essential moneys of this kind to put the blame on the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is always the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephHallide" hpid="Mr. Halliden Mr. Halliden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halliden</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance does not seem to be physically or mentally anything the worse of turning these proposals down.  He comes back smiling and as benevolent-looking as ever.  That big sum of money, however, which could be used for many useful purposes is taken from agriculture.  It could be usefully applied in increasing the price of beef, in subsidising, to an extent, the price of milk supplied to creameries, or in supplying seed wheat to those people who had tremendous failures last year, owing to the fact that proper seed wheat was not supplied to them.  Many uses could be made of that money and yet it is lost to farming this year.</P>
      <P>Side by side with that, we find increases in other Departments where curtailments were expected and demanded. I wish to refer in particular to the establishment of the President in respect of which there is an increase of £535 in the Estimates.  There is also an increase in the amount for the Department of Lands of over £52,000, including £5,000 for travelling expenses. These increases are very galling to the taxpayers and particularly to the farmers who, more than anybody else, are bearing the burden. Fully 50 per cent. of the community are engaged directly on the land. Practically 25 per cent. are employed in distribution, the remaining 25 per cent. being made up of civil servants and others.  In view of the fact that practically 75 per cent. of the people live, directly or indirectly, from the land, it is only reasonable to conclude that the bulk of the rates and taxes must fall on them, and in that connection I should like to say that we of this Party particularly feel that grave injustice is being done by the increases in these directions.  At the same time, we find a decrease of £10,000 in the amount of old age pensions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephHallide" hpid="Mr. Halliden Mr. Halliden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halliden</NameTxt>
      <P>That is satisfactory, because that sum of £10,000 required explanation.  If we let the matter pass, we might be told down the country that the Estimate showed a decrease of £10,000 and asked why we did not say something about it in the Dáil.  We have now got a satisfactory explanation.  Another matter which is troubling us in our part of the country is the shortage of wheat offals.  We are told that our dairy cattle are not producing sufficient milk because they are not properly fed.  We find now that wheat offals, bran and pollard, have been completely withdrawn from the market and at present there is an emergency ration on the market.  Shopkeepers have told us that that emergency ration is made up of bran, pollard, beet pulp and one or two other ingredients.  It is sold at £19 per ton.  The controlled price of bran is £10, of pollard £10 and of beet pulp £7, but when all are mixed together, the controlled price is £19, which must be paid by the farmers if they want to feed cattle, pigs or poultry.  I hope the Minister will explain how by mixing a £10 ration with another £10 ration and a third ingredient at £7 or £8, it is possible to produce a mixture valued for £19.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So much has been said about agriculture and the dairying industry generally that I do not intend to delay <Col N="1315" /> the House by repeating what has already been well and wisely said, but I think the time has come when the Government should take action on the interim reports supplied by the Post-war Agricultural Commission.  Some of these reports have been issued for almost two years.  There is a report on poultry and another on cattle diseases, but we have not been told what is happening.  That is very unfortunate. It is well known that there are colossal losses every year from diseases in dairy cattle and other cattle, but the Government are silent on the matter.  I ask the Minister to give us an assurance that something will be done in the immediate future so as to inform farmers and those depending on them as to what is to happen in the post-war period and whether the same unfortunate position is to arise as arose after the last war. The farmers and those depending on them &mdash; shopkeepers and the urban population generally &mdash; want to know what is to happen in the post-war period and I hope the Minister will give us a satisfactory answer and will induce the Government to give us information in this respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with attention and very considerable interest to the variety of speeches made on this Vote on Account, and I appreciate the efforts made by the numerous speakers to put fairly and reasonably their points of view before me as Minister for Finance and spokesman for the Government in this debate.  Taking them generally, I do not think the criticisms offered&mdash;and there were plenty of them&mdash;were altogether unreasonable. I might say in this connection that though the war is not yet over, there has been a good deal of complaint that the Government has not announced its post-war plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am no prophet.  I do not know when the war in Europe is likely to end, though, for the sake of everybody, I hope it will end soon.  Even when the end of the war in Europe does come and peace is formally declared, my belief is that the economic situation will not appreciably change for a considerable time&mdash;perhaps a year or two <Col N="1316" /> years.  It will be only possible to put the plans which the Government have into operation slowly and, perhaps, with great difficulty.  Some of the more important plans which the Government have prepared have already been announced. However, anxious the Government and the Dáil may be concerning the implementation of those plans, it will be a considerable time before they can be brought into full operation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy suggested the setting up of a body to watch the economic situation and advise the Government in regard to it.  The best body to watch the economic situation is the body which the Dáil has appointed and upon which it has placed that responsibility&mdash;the Government. It is their responsibility to watch the economic situation.  They should look for advice and assistance, I agree but I think they get that here in the Dáil. They get it from Deputy Mulcahy and his colleagues and from members of other Parties, including our own Party. They get advice from Deputies every day the House meets and they get it in the Press as well.  They are, certainly, not without advice and assistance from members of the Dáil and the public, through the medium of the Press, and otherwise.  Several Deputies have suggested that it would be wise for the Government to listen to advice tendered to them.  I agree.</P>
    <P>During the course of the debate, it struck me as strange that, so far, we had not got to the position here in which members of the House, irrespective of Party, interested in some economic, industrial, financial or other problem, would come together of their own free will to discuss the particular subject in which they had a special interest or of which they had special knowledge, thereafter putting their suggestions, through that voluntary body, before the Minister or the Government of the day.  That would be something which members of the House might regard as useful procedure. Perhaps the history of political Parties here was such that co-operation of that kind would not have been easy in the past.  But we are getting away from the early history of the formation of Parties and the bitterness associated <Col N="1317" /> with certain aspects of that activity and, perhaps, co-operation of the type common in other democratic institutions may be possible here at an early date.  It would be for the good of the country, as a whole, if that type of discussion amongst members of the House were possible here.  I noted one remark which Deputy Mulcahy made&mdash;&ldquo;the more information we get from the Government, the more our hopes recede&rdquo;.  If we are to accept the implication of that remark, then the less information we give the Deputy, the more hopeful for the country he will be.  I wonder if that is the interpretation which the Deputy desires in respect of the remark he made.</P>

      <P>I should not like to see the Deputy without hope.  I should not like to see him always in a depressed mood.  Perhaps, we shall, therefore, furnish him with fewer reports.  I agree with Deputy Mulcahy, Deputy Hughes, Deputy Cogan and other Deputies, who said that they would like full, free and frank discussion on this Vote.  I am prepared to discuss any matter arising on the Vote&mdash;and a great many things arise on it.  I am prepared to do that in the fullest and frankest manner.  As Minister for Finance, I should like as many Deputies as possible to speak on the Vote and raise as many points as they wish.  I get a sufficiency of information and have officials here to supply me with answers to the questions put and I am anxious to give all the information in my possession to Deputies with regard to the financial business of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In opening his speech last evening, Deputy Hughes said that the figure, of which this Vote on Account is part, was a staggering one and unprecedented. He urged that it was a very severe burden.  I agree with him and underline what he says.  I should like the House and the country to realise the position.  The figure is a record <Col N="1318" /> one and the State is asked to bear a very heavy burden, as Deputy Hughes properly said.  Basing their statements on the Book of Estimates, the newspapers have pointed out that the Budget will be for a sum of well over £50,000,000.  As Deputy Hughes said, that is a staggering figure for three-quarters of a country.  It is a marvel where all the money comes from and how we are able to afford that sum. Again, I should like Deputies on all sides to realise the size of the bill and its staggering and unprecedented nature, to quote Deputy Hughes.</P>
    <P>I would like every Deputy and every taxpayer in the country to realise that. Far from wishing to hide it, I wish the country to know it and to realise it, and that at the same time Deputies and the country should know what value they are getting for this money. I want all to realise that.  Despite the size of this enormous bill&mdash;this very heavy burden, to quote again Deputy Hughes&mdash;there is not a day that the House meets that some Deputy, speaking for his Party, does not ask us to spend more and more.  All Parties, with my own Party probably heading the list, want to have more money spent.  Deputy Hughes wants more money spent in certain ways, and Deputy Mulcahy wants more money spent&mdash;for good and proper objects admittedly.  Even yesterday there were demands for a big increase of expenditure, despite the unprecedented nature of the bill that I, as Minister for Finance, am asking the House to adopt.  I am asking the House to provide the Government with the cash for that great expenditure.  Despite, as I say, this enormous bill, there was hardly a Deputy who spoke yesterday that did not say that he wanted more money for this, that or the other good object.  There was not one Deputy who suggested where I could save £100,000 or even £10,000.  There was not one Deputy to point to a figure in the Book of Estimates and say that the amount there indicated was being uselessly spent.  There was, perhaps, one suggestion made this morning by Deputy Donnellan about the Vote for Secret Service.  He said that we were spending £20,000 a year on secret service. <Col N="1319" /> We have never spent £20,000 on it.  We have the sum of £20,000 in the Book of Estimates, but a sum like that has never been spent on it.  It is wise to have that provision there, and if Deputy Donnellan asks for details of how the money is spent he will not get them.  As long as there is a Government here, whatever Government it is, it will need to have money of that kind at its disposal, and I am satisfied that whoever is Minister for Finance will see to it that none of it is wasted.</P>
    <P>When savings are made the Minister is criticised.  Deputy Cogan said yesterday that the only saving made was on agriculture.  That statement was not true, and his colleagues, sitting beside him, had to correct him.  As Minister for Finance, I am willing and anxious to save wherever I can.  The Estimates from the various Departments are asked for about the month of October in each year.  They begin to come in at the end of November and during December and January.  As they come in it is hard work&mdash;I do not object to hard work&mdash;and serious work fighting with every Department trying to get savings made in the Estimates sent in.  That is my job, because as Minister for Finance I have to try to cut down expenditure.  I admit that I have not been very successful. Expenditure has gone up by leaps and bounds, even since I became Minister for Finance.  I want, however, to assure the House that there is no item in the Estimate for each Department that is not carefully scrutinised, rigidly examined and fought over.  That is the truth. But knowing what the House and the country demand, and knowing what is necessary for the welfare of the community as a whole, I, taking the broad view, do not adopt the penny wise and pound foolish policy.  I cannot, as Minister for Finance, go around with an axe cutting anywhere and everywhere. But, as I have said, the cost of government has gone up by leaps and bounds, even during the years that I have been Minister for Finance, and even though I have tried to economise.</P>
    <P>I do not know what is going to <Col N="1320" /> happen to our finances when the war does come to an end.  We are at present living through a period when there is too much loose money in the country, when many people have more money in their pockets than they know how to spend in a useful way.  That is the position at present, but it will not always be the position.  The hard times will come some time after this war as they came after the last war. The people ought to remember that. We, too, must try to bear that in mind as the Dáil and the Government prepare for the future. I do not think there will be any radical economic change immediately the war ends.  The Government will have time to put its arrangements as rapidly as possible&mdash; but nevertheless, I believe, slowly, too slowly perhaps&mdash;into operation.  There will be changes in the economic and financial sphere and money will not be as plentiful as it is to-day.  Taxation cannot go on at the high rate at which it is at present if we are to develop our country industrially, and, when I say industrially, I include our greatest industry, agriculture.  We will have to develop both our arms, industrial and agricultural.</P>
    <P>May I digress for a moment on that subject?  When I speak of developing the industrial as well as the agricultural arm it reminds me of Arthur Griffith.  He brought me up, politically. I want to say that the movement that brought this Government and this Dáil, into existence&mdash;was founded on Sinn Féin.  It was founded on the gospel of Sinn Féin of self-reliance, as taught to us by Griffith.  That was the foundation of our movement for winning independence for our country.  Unfortunately, I noted very little of that philosophy in the speeches delivered here in the last two days.  All the speeches were to this effect, that the Government must do this and must do that, and asking &ldquo;why does not the Government initiate this or that,&rdquo; or put such a programme into operation. The advice that I give to everybody in the House, and to all Parties, is that we should think more of what we can do for ourselves, what we can do in our own sphere, in our own various <Col N="1321" /> social activities&mdash;economic and business activities&mdash;what we can initiate and put through by relying on ourselves and not be always putting our hand out to see what the Government will do for us.  Sinn Féin, as I have said, was founded on self-reliance.  It was that which brought us into existence politically.  I say this, particularly to the Fine Gael Party: do not forget the philosophy of Arthur Griffith.  I say to all Parties, to my own as well as the others, that philosophy should not be forgotten, politically, by those who claim Griffith as their patron.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Hughes raised the question of our policy and what it is likely to be <i>vis-a-vis</i> Britain post-war.  I hope our policy will be to develop trade relations on the most friendly nation basis, to develop our trade, our intercourse, our commerce, with our nearest neighbour so far as we can, to the good of both countries, to develop them to the fullest possible extent.  That is, I think, the wisest policy for this country to adopt. Britain is our nearest neighbour.  We have been in the past Britain's best customer.  There were times in the past, over long periods, when no country bought more from Britain than we did.  It suited us, even when this Parliament was established with a Government of its own, and we continued that policy.  If it suits us commercially, economically and financially, I see no reason why it should not continue as long as we get value for our money.  But I also say that that should be borne in mind by Britain as well as by us, that we are nearer to them than any other country, geographically speaking.  As long as we have suitable goods to offer, at suitable prices, if we are prepared to buy from them the industrial goods that we need, I think they ought to be ready and willing to buy from us <Col N="1322" /> at suitable prices the goods we have to sell.</P>
    <P>It is properly said here that we cannot live without exporting. That is true.  We cannot live without importing and, in order to import necessary goods, we must export.  A Deputy mentioned tea and petrol last night&mdash; two commodities that will be as necessary in our economy in the future as they have been in the past.  We have to purchase these things from abroad. Some day, some way of producing petrol at home may be discovered.  It has not been discovered yet, at any rate on an economic basis, and when that day comes maybe we will be able to produce our own petrol, but I cannot see any possibility of even Deputy Corry producing tea on his farm.  I believe Deputy Corry is an excellent farmer and produces many good things, such as beet seeds and other things that were not previously grown in this country, but tea, I am afraid, will evade even the expert agricultural hand of Deputy Corry, and we will have to export in order to provide Deputy Corry with that tea.  Whether he drinks tea or not, I do not know. Maybe he prefers beer or coffee.  But, at any rate, I think even Deputy Corry must agree that to provide certain goods, that we cannot produce or procure otherwise than from outside sources, we must export in order to pay for them.</P>
    <P>Up to the present our exports have been mainly agricultural.  We do hope to develop the industrial arm and to export industrial goods in future.  We do export industrial goods at present.  From this city alone one very old established firm in Dublin&mdash;Jacobs&mdash;exported biscuits almost to every corner of the earth.  Jacob's biscuit tins were to be seen in China, Japan, India, Australia, Canada, and all over the world.  I hope developments of that kind will continue after the war and that they will grow and prosper.  It will be necessary to have proper understanding with our nearest neighbour, to begin with, so that our trade with that country may grow and prosper to our mutual advantage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy asked, in reference <Col N="1323" /> to the export of men and money, why we should not use our own money to set our own people to work.  I think it was hardly necessary for him or any other Deputy to ask that question.  We have practised that policy since we became a Government.  We have practised it against the bitter criticism of Deputy Mulcahy and his Party during the last 12 years.  There has not been an effort &mdash;we made many, and we made many successfully&mdash;there has not been one occasion when we did use the money of this country to develop industries here that we have not been fought and criticised every inch of the road in developing that policy.  We intend to continue that policy, to develop it, and to use all the financial and other resources of this country to set our people to work, to provide employment for them, to do everything we can to prevent the necessity for emigration.  That is our declared policy and the policy practised and pursued at all seasons, every day, since this Government was formed and founded and got authority here.  There is no intention of changing that policy as long as we remain the Government.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it would be as well at this moment to answer the many queries that were raised about post-war plans for employment.  Deputies said that they have no idea as to what the Government's plans for the future are&mdash; that the Government ought to announce plans for post-war employment. I think it is true that the Government have not alone announced several important plans, schemes of work for the future, but have published them broadcast, and have not alone done that but have asked the House to pass legislation to implement certain aspects of them.  The House has passed that legislation.</P>
    <P>The first big scheme was the arterial drainage scheme.  It took a long time to develop.  First of all, we had to set up a commission.  A very representative commission was set up, and it took some years to consider its report.  The report was presented to the Government, and was very closely examined by the Government.  Then the Government announced to the House here <Col N="1324" /> that, with certain slight reservations, the recommendations of the commission were adopted.  It then took a couple of years to get the very intricate piece of legislation drafted and put through the House.  It was put through the House very effectively by my Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Paddy Smith, who did a great job.  One of the best pieces of parliamentary work that was ever done in this House was done by Deputy Paddy Smith in conducting that Bill through the House. The House will agree that he did his job very well.  I think Deputy Hughes was one of those who complimented him on that piece of work.  That is a post-war plan, which it was estimated in the report would cost the country £7,000,000.  I do not want to adopt the mantle of prophet; I hope my dismal prophecy will not be borne out, but I am afraid it will be double that&mdash;that by the time the work is completed it will have cost £14,000,000 rather than £7,000,000.  That is my anticipation.</P>
    <P>The next big plan was for rural electrification. Why would not Deputy Cogan, or his colleague, Deputy Halliden, remember those two plans that were brought up in the interests of agriculture primarily, and in the interests of the country as a whole? There are two big plans.  The cost of rural electrification was estimated roughly at £20,000,000; it will probably cost nearer £40,000,000.  Those are huge figures.  The farmer will not be asked to bear all the cost of providing himself with electricity for light and power.</P>
    <P>The Dáil will be asked for a very considerable sum to help the farmer to instal electric light and power, and to pay what, generally speaking, he would not be able to pay&mdash;the small farmer, at any rate&mdash;out of his own pocket.  We will have to ask the Dáil to provide a considerable amount of the capital charge.  We have asked the Dáil, and the Dáil has agreed, to provide, as a beginning, £5,000,000. As time goes on, the Dáil will be asked for the balance of the money necessary to cover a considerable part of the cost of providing the farmer with light and power.  I hope in days to come that, in the same way, water <Col N="1325" /> will be brought into the farmers houses and yards.  I hope to see the Minister for Local Government or some other Minister asking the Dáil to provide money to do that.  I should be very glad if the responsibility fell on me.  I should like to be able to come into this House to introduce a Bill asking the Dáil to provide money to bring water into the farmers' yards and maybe into every room in their houses.  Perhaps some day it will be possible to provide hot and cold water. That would be my ambition.</P>
    <P>I was shocked when I read some words by Deputy Cogan in the debate on agriculture here the other day, when he said that this Government and the Minister for Finance have no interest in agriculture.  What right has he to say that?  What right has anybody in this House to say that the Government is not interested in agriculture, least of all Deputy Cogan? The Government would not be fit to be here if it were not interested in agriculture. It would not be fit to hold its job for 24 hours if it did not have agriculture always in mind as the primary industry, on which our whole economy is built.  That was a foolish and ridiculous statement for Deputy Cogan to make.  He knows it is not true.  Although I was brought up in the City of Dublin, in the slums of Dublin, I am not such a fool as not to realise that our foundation is agriculture, and that we must have regard to that industry at all times, while not forgetting other industries&mdash;the industrial arm generally.  The fact that we have looked after agriculture well during our 13 years of office has kept us here, and has kept the farmers behind us.  Where can you find a better Farmers' Party than our own Party, composed mainly of people interested in agriculture, who know the needs of this country and its people?  The fact that we are here is sufficient indication of what the agricultural community thinks of us and of our administration over 13 years.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy referred to Australia, and to certain revolutionary changes in banking laws that have been initiated in the Parliament of Australia in the last few weeks.  I would suggest to Deputy Mulcahy that the economic, financial, and other conditions in Australia are very different from conditions here.  Australia is in the war, has had to provide a large army and navy, has had to go up to the neck in debt, and therefore has had to take what the Government there believe to be a very stringent, not to use any stronger word, control of finance.  They have gone so far there that they are taking complete control by law of the Central Bank and, through the Central Bank, control of all banking operations.  I think I am not wrong in saying that the governing body of the Central Bank is to be abolished and that one governor in future is to rule the bank.  He will have an advisory board mostly nominated by the Government and, in all matters, the governor of the Central Bank will be subject to the Minister for Finance, who is there called the Treasurer.  Does Deputy Mulcahy say that we should adopt that system here?</P>

      <P>I listened carefully, but I do not want to misinterpret the Deputy.  I want to underline what Australia has done.  If a question is raised here as to what Australia has done, we want to know whether people desire us to take similar steps here or whether it would be wise for us to follow the Australian example. Deputy Mulcahy also raised the question of interest rates.  We shall have a talk on that later on, perhaps.</P>
      <P>One other matter referred to by Deputy Mulcahy in conclusion was the hopes that were raised in the people's minds when the first Dáil was established in 1919 with regard to economic and social betterment. I am glad Deputy Mulcahy keeps that in mind.  I hope I always keep in mind, too, the democratic programme adopted by the first Dáil on January 21st, 1919.  I am very pleased to here anybody refer to that. Many members of this House have read it and know of it, but it would be an advantage if every Deputy studied that document and from time to time questioned the Government of the day as to how far the promises held out in that document have been implemented or tried to be implemented by succeeding Governments here.  As one who had a special interest in that document, I have borne its contents in mind and have tried since I got a measure of power here to implement, so far as circumstances would allow, the social and economic programme contained in that document for the welfare and betterment of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To return to agriculture.  A couple of years ago I made out a list of the sums of money spent by the Dáil in a variety of ways for the betterment of agriculture.  I have revised that list and I think it would be no harm <Col N="1329" /> for the agricultural community and those interested in agriculture in the Dáil and outside to realise the extent of the financial provisions made in a variety of ways by the Dáil out of its resources to help the agricultural community. In giving these figures, which amount to nearly £9,250,000, I wish to repeat what I said before, that I do not think it is too much to spend on agriculture.  I think Deputies will bear that in mind.  I think they will realise my interest in agriculture as Minister for Finance in what I have already said to-day, speaking on behalf of the Government.  I do say that, whatever we spend on agriculture, we ought to spend as much as we can in order to make agriculture prosperous.  That is what we would like to do.  What we are asking the Dáil to spend in the Book of Estimates now being discussed is not too much. If we could afford more, I would like to see more spent on agriculture in some directions.</P>
    <P>Before I read out this list I should like to refer to the apparent reduction in the Vote for Agriculture.  This reduction is more apparent than real. We provided a certain sum last year as a subsidy for fertilisers.  It was not all spent as we could not get the fertilisers.  We are not providing the same amount of money this year.  But I will say this much, that if the fertilisers come in and we can supply to the farmers the fertilisers that we would like to supply to them, I would not hesitate to ask the Dáil for the extra money to provide the additional fertilisers.  There is no real diminution in the Vote for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>This list is similar to one which I quoted two or three years ago in a debate on a similar subject.  The ordinary Estimate for the running of the Department of Agriculture amounts to £984,635.  Deputies may criticise the Department of Agriculture and the Minister for Agriculture as much as they please, but I do not think anyone will seriously deny that the Department of Agriculture was set up to assist agriculture and does its best to do that.  Other items are:&mdash;Estimate for agricultural produce subsidies and payments proposed from the Price <Col N="1330" /> Stabilisation Fund, £1,065,000; grants for relief of rates on agricultural land, £1,870,000; estimate of amount required to meet deficiences on Land Bond Fund arising from the reduction in land annuities in 1933, £637,000; the approximate amount which farmers will receive from flour and bread subsidy, £2,024,000; farm improvement scheme, £350,000 &mdash; Deputy Halliden thinks that that is not enough, but it is a very considerable sum&mdash;seed and lime distribution schemes, £85,000; rural improvement schemes, £90,000; improvement of estates, £171,000.  The total of these comes to £7,276,635.  In addition to that, £637,000 provided directly by the State, the farming community not now having to pay £1,565,000 land annuities, which were paid under the Land Purchase Acts passed prior to 1923.  That sum was wiped out after the economic war and the agricultural community have not to pay it.  It is more than £1,500,000, and it can be regarded as a direct subsidy to agriculture.  In addition, a fertiliser subsidy of 2/6 a barrel is payable after the war to every farmer growing wheat.  This subsidy is valued at £380,000 for the coming season.  The total of these figures for the assistance of farming, amounting to £9,221,635, is not inconsiderable, even out of a Budget of £50,000,000 or £52,000,000.</P>

      <P>They do not contribute anything like half that amount, directly or indirectly.

Many farmers, if they pay any income tax at all, should be paying more than they are paying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that they have them.  I know friends of my own, big farmers, who do not pay one shilling in income-tax and who should be paying.  They escape on account of the poor law valuation of their land.  Some of them pay whatever they have to pay, but if they paid here as they pay in England, there would be an examination of their accounts and their profits, I know that it would be very difficult to have that done.  I would not like to have to tackle it.  If proper arrangements were made for the examination of the accounts of many farmers who are not now paying the income-tax they should be paying, I should not like the job of starting out after them.  It would be pretty difficult work and I might not be much the richer in the end, having regard to the cost.  If we are to be honest and truthful, I think Deputies on all sides will admit that they know farmers, prosperous men, some of them in a large way and some of them in a small way, who should be paying tax on their revenues, who are not doing so.</P>
      <P>In his speech Deputy Cogan referred to the huge increase in the cost of administration compared with 1930.  I do not know why the Deputy selected 1930 particularly.  He might have taken 1922 or 1923.  One year would be just as effective as the other.  The Deputy might have started with 1932 and compared this Government's record then with the last year of office of the previous Government.  The Deputy's point was that the cost of administration had increased enormously compared with 1930, and that no part of the increase was used to increase production.  There was never a more unfounded statement made in this House.  Deputy Cogan is famous for making foolish statements, and that is saying a good deal.  Why his Party put him up as their principal spokesman I do not know.  With all respect I think Deputy Halliden would have been much more careful and more effective.  An exaggerated statement carries no weight.  Bearing that in mind, the Deputy would be well advised in future to be guided by someone with more experience of public life than he, before making such foolish statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1332" /> I have gone to the trouble of making out a list of the principal increases in expenditure since 1930, comparing the figures in the Book of Estimates with those for the 1930-31 period.  To use the Deputy's words there have been considerable increases.  I shall read out the increases over the 1930-31 period:&mdash; Office of Revenue Commissioners, £430,000; Old Age Pensions, £1,038,000; Supplementary Agricultural Grants, £672,000.  Does that money not go into production?  The Deputy said that no part of the big increases had helped production.  Is not that £672,000 for grants to agriculture?  What are agriculture doing with it?  For Widows' and Orphans' Pensions there was an increase of £250,000.  I questioned that figure.  There were no widows' and orphans' pensions in 1930. I think the subsidy last year for Widows' and Orphans' Pensions from the Exchequer amounted to £450,000. The amount this year is £250,000.  Last year the amount was £450,000.  The increase under the heading of Agriculture amounts to £509,000; Gárda Síochána, £812,000; Local Government and Public Health, £1,416,000; National Health Insurance, £177,000; Primary Education, £539,000; Secondary Education, £285,000; Technical Education, £247,000; Department of Lands, £679,000.  Most of that increase went into the division of land and the improvement of estates.  The Deputy will probably say that the money does not go into the development or to the improvement of agriculture.  The increase in the provision for Forestry amount to £196,000; Industry and Commerce, £221,000; Transport and Meteorological Services, £718,000. These services did not exist in 1930.  In Unemployment Insurance and Unemployment Assistance the increase amounted to £705,000; Posts and Telegraphs, £979,000; the Army, £6,755,000. That is a huge amount.  I hope it will not continue.  Army Pensions increased by £424,000; Employment and Emergency Schemes by £1,250,000; Agricultural Produce Subsidies by £825,000.  Does the Deputy suppose that that expenditure does not go into production?  For the Department of Supplies expenditure increased by <Col N="1333" /> £5,350,000; Food Allowances by £582,000; Children's Allowances by £2,230,000.  The total of these increases amounts to £27,289,000.</P>
    <P>That is an enormous figure&mdash;as big as the Budget was in 1930.  Some other Estimates have decreased, the total of the decreases amounting to £1,905,000. That makes a net increase, if we take off the decreases in certain Estimates, of £25,384,000.  That, undoubtedly, is a huge figure.  Deputy Cogan can read that list at his leisure again when it is published in the Dáil Debates, and, some time or another, in a discussion here on agriculture or on any matter upon which he might wish to have a discussion, I would like him or one of his colleagues to say what item in that list could be eliminated without the State and the community suffering some disadvantage from its elimination. I do not know, except in the case of the Army Vote, what prospect there is of seeing any large item in that long and costly list being eliminated without disadvantage to the State and the community.  I do not say that even the increase of £6,755,000 in the Army Vote is going to be eliminated.  It is not, and it would not be safe for the State that it should be eliminated.  I should like Deputies&mdash;and I appeal principally to Opposition Deputies&mdash;to take that list and see what they would eliminate, and what part of the huge increase in cost, to which Deputy Cogan referred, could be cut down.  Everybody wants the old age pensioners maximum of 10/- a week increased, but the cost of old age pensions has increased by well over £1,000,000 since 1930.  Nobody would suggest that that should be reduced. Then, take the case of Supplementary Agricultural Grants, and the possibility of effecting a decrease there.  I know that not only the members of Clann na Talmhan, but many others besides, have repeatedly asked that all rates should be taken off agricultural land, so there would be no chance of a decrease there.  In the case of widows' and orphans' pensions, I am sure nobody would suggest eliminating that figure of £250,000.  The Vote for Primary Education has gone up by more than £500,000 in 13 years.  I do not know <Col N="1334" /> where cuts could be made there, or in the case of the Votes for Secondary and Technical Education.</P>
    <P>There is an increase of £679,000 in the Vote for the Department of Lands. Now, from all sides of the House there is clamour for more expenditure in that direction.  Deputy Donnellan was on that subject even to-day.  He said that the Land Commission ought to be more active.  Well, if it is more active, it will cost more, and I should like the House, and particularly Deputy Donnellan, to know this: that I, as Minister for Finance, was largely responsible for inducing the Government to stop the division of land during the war.  I was largely responsible for that decision, but I was forced, when emergency departments were set up to deal with such vital matters as our food supply and defence, to find experienced staffs for the Department of Supplies, the Department of Defence and the Department of the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures. Large numbers of experienced men were required.  In the matter of compulsory tillage, it should be obvious that there was no use in sending out as inspectors people who had had no experience of these matters.  Of course, you could get plenty of people in the City of Dublin or in the Cities of Cork, Limerick, and so on, and take them in to help, but what use would people of that type&mdash;people like myself&mdash;be in dealing with tillage? What use would I be in going out on the land in order to tell people what amount of land they should till or whether or not the land was fit for tillage?  We had to get experienced men.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

      <P>We did not take the chief inspectors.  We took a certain number of inspectors&mdash;experienced men&mdash;and sent them out to deal with the matter of tillage.  It was necessary to send experienced people all over the country in order to see that food was grown by our people, since <Col N="1335" /> it was essential that we should produce as much food as we possibly could, and we could not get such experienced people except from the Department of Lands.</P>

      <P>There is another figure which I shall give to the House, and, again, I wish to say that I do not want to hide anything.  I want to give the House the fullest information possible on all matters, and this is a figure that Deputies may use in order to hit the Government hard in the days to come.  Let them fire away with it.  They will get the facts and the truth, at any rate.  Deputy Cogan referred to the high cost and the big increase in cost of administration. The administrative cost of the Civil Service on January 1st, 1944, was £7,284,950.  That is a huge figure. On January 1st, 1930, it was £4,600,000, so there has been an increase in those 14 years of £2,680,000, approximately. I would like everyone&mdash;the Dáil to begin with, and the country&mdash;to know these figures and realise them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister explain those figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I can, of course.  I do not think it would make much impression on the Deputy, but I can do so.  Everybody in this House knows the reason for the increase.  There have been put into operation new services <Col N="1337" /> which did not exist before this Government came into office in 1932, and to administer those services huge staffs have been necessary.  Take the last one. Deputies on all sides of the House, without exception, I think, demanded children's allowances.  Now, you cannot operate a scheme like children's allowances, which costs £2,600,000, without staff.  You cannot go into a Department and say: &ldquo;Here, administer the children's allowances,&rdquo; without the officials saying to you: &ldquo;Very well, we will do so and administer it efficiently, but you must give us the men and women to do it.&rdquo;  I had the administrative cost of children's allowances in mind at the time, but I do not remember the exact figure now. Probably, it takes close on 200 officials, at a cost of between £90,000 and £100,000.  Look at the long list of services that have been introduced since 1930, at the request of the Dáil.  They are services which did not exist before, costing millions, for which staff had to be provided. There is the explanation. Deputies will demand new services to-morrow and, even while demanding them, will not tell us how to administer them without additional cost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it is an exaggeration to say they remain until they die.  Most of them remain until they reach the age of 65.  When an attempt is made to put anyone out, there is a queue of Deputies waiting at the Minister's office, saying: &ldquo;Don't put that one out or I'll be ruined in my constituency.&rdquo;  One of the first to come will be Deputy Cogan, saying: &ldquo;Don't touch County Wicklow, whomever you have to fire out anywhere else.  Don't come near my constituency, because that girl or boy is a son or daughter of a most influential constituent and backer of mine.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do, certainly.  I <Col N="1338" /> am not saying I always act on it.  I think I have kept the House too long. There were a lot of questions raised here on which I would like to give the House more information.  The question of social services has been discussed before, so I will not delay on it. In 1930-31, the social services, such as they were, cost us £3,400,814.  I go back to that year because Deputy Cogan started his speech by comparing that with the position to-day, and I take it he is the spokesman for his Party.  The social services this year, 1945/46, cost £9,655,852.  In 1930/31 there were no direct subsidies given to local authorities to help in social services, but in 1945/46, as given in this Book of Estimates we are dealing with, those direct subsidies to help social services through the local authorities&mdash;mostly in food and fuel; if any Deputy wants a list I can get it for him&mdash;amount to £5,473,100. Those two items together come to more than £15,000,000.  Deputies can see that big increase in the cost of services since 1930/31, a cost which now reaches to over £15,000,000.  I do not think any Deputy would suggest that any of these social services should be or could be abolished.  I hope that some of the subsidies will disappear when the war ends, or soon afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies desired in many cases that I should go into detail about the future for agriculture and prices for agricultural produce.  That would better come from the Minister for Agriculture, and Deputies will have an opportunity on the Estimate.  I do not think the Minister for Agriculture, any more than any other Minister, would object to Deputies asking for particulars on these matters.  I hope he and other Ministers will give Deputies the fullest information.  It would be difficult, I would even say impossible, for the Government to give at present any guarantee of fixed prices for agricultural goods over a five-year period after the war.  Deputies ought to know from the history of this Government and the policy that it has carried through regarding agriculture, that we have a certain definite policy which we have brought into operation <Col N="1339" /> against very bitter opposition from many of those who said they represented the farmers in this House over the last ten or 12 years.  It was not true that they represented the farmers.  We had more authoritative spokesmen for the farmers here in our own benches than there were in all the rest of the House combined, including the new Farmers' Party.</P>
    <P>I am glad to hear that those who now officially claim to speak for the farming community are not adopting the policy that was officially announced here as being the policy of agriculturists as opposed to the policy this Government put into operation.  I am glad to note from the speeches of Deputies Cogan, Donnellan and Halliden in the last day or two that they are in line generally with the policy of this Government.  The development of agriculture is the first thing and the keeping of the home market, to provide our own people with the goods produced here at home as far as we can.  That does not exclude the export of agricultural produce, but our own people must be looked after first.  As a corollary to that, in order to get the farmers to produce the goods we must pay the farmers.  I know that many farmers, including our friend, Deputy Corry, who is not in the House at the moment, do not admit that they are getting enough. But when did a farmer, at a fair or anywhere else, ever say that he got all he wanted?  I think that that is enough, at any rate from me, with regard to the Government's agricultural policy.  I hope the question will be developed in greater detail in later debates with perhaps the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Norton that the agricultural community have made a very substantial contribution for the benefit of the nation.  I do not know where we would have been were it not for the farmers of this country.  They provided the food, or the greater part of the food, necessary to keep us alive during the war.  I shall not develop discussion on the industrial side any further, but I hope it will be developed in detail in later debates.  I do want <Col N="1340" /> to say in reply to a question of Deputy Norton as to what are the Government's plans for the post-war period, that our plans are to continue to develop and expand still further the industrial developments that were initiated and carried through up to the time war broke out.  If the war had not come upon us, our industrial developments would have expanded very considerably.  We have plans, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce will probably furnish information in regard to them at a suitable time.  I think big plans are in preparation for a big expansion in industrial development after the war. I do not think I shall say any more in that regard.  I do not know whether Deputies are tired of me, but I am tired myself.</P>
    <P>One remark with regard to housing. Deputy Corish knows that there is no subject in which I am more interested than housing.  I admit fully that the housing financial situation at present is such that there will be no advance in housing developments as things stand.  It is not possible at present, nor has it been possible during the war to do much in regard to housing. I marvel at the amount of work some local authorities have done&mdash;Dublin Corporation, for instance.  How they have kept going has been something that is very much to their credit. There will have to be a re-examination and review of housing finances at some future date&mdash;I cannot say any more than that.  Probably the subject will be developed at greater length by the Minister for Local Government.  We must continue to build houses until every slum in this country&mdash;and I include agricultural slums&mdash;has been wiped out.  There are numbers of them still in all parts of the country, rural and urban.  We must continue that essential social improvement policy of providing houses.</P>
    <P>No country in the world&mdash;and that is a big statement&mdash;provided more generous subsidies for housing than were provided by this Government with the assent of the Dáil from 1932 onwards.  I have met members of other Governments and discussed this <Col N="1341" /> question with them.  Take the present Prime Minister of New Zealand, who was here on a visit at the beginning of the war.  I took him round and showed him what we had done in housing.  I gave him the terms of the finances of housing.  He marvelled at what we, who did not claim to be a Labour Government, had done and he said to me that he doubted if it could be bettered anywhere.  It was certainly not bettered by his Government anywhere which was more generous with subsidies to housing than this Government has been.  Because of the cost of building and the changes that have taken place, the financial situation will have to be reviewed, but any more than that I cannot say.  We have to keep housing going some way.  I hope the Government will continue to do that for a long time and that we shall be allowed to continue this progressive social improvement policy which includes housing in town and country and the provision of better social conditions for all our people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to open an elaborate discussion on the Second Stage of this Bill but following some of the statements made by the Minister, and the general tone of his reply, I should like to say that the really important matter with which we are concerned at the moment and for the future, is <Col N="1343" /> to concentrate on increasing the production of this country both agriculturally and industrially.  If we are to drag across the facts that must face us in doing that, the facts that we have to make use of in setting about increased agricultural and industrial production, men's names, history or anything else that will obscure our judgment and prevent us joining in a full, complete and frank discussion of the facts, then we are injuring the prospect of our people, particularly the less economically strong class of our people, in getting a decent subsistence. If we drag across the discussion an argument as to whether we are going to produce for export or for home consumption, then we are going to interfere, I believe, with our full capacity to produce here.  If we produce, then we can make the best possible use of what we produce.  Whether we dispose of its abroad on a definite plan that we would agree would be the most suitable way of using the nation's wealth in the interests of the people of the country as a whole, or whether we dispose of it at home, I think that both on the industrial side and the agricultural side, to discredit the export market is to do very great damage to our material interests.  We may feel that we are flattering ourselves as Nationalists and keeping in accord with some kind of tradition that we never attempt to understand but, if a Nationalist is a person who takes the resources of the country and utilises them to make the most of them, do chum glóire Dé agus onóra na hÉireann, and for the betterment of the people of the country, then we are not Nationalists by acting in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the side of industrial production certain complaints are made from the Labour Benches of the rise in the cost in recent years of industrial products as compared with say the pre-1932 position.  I would again direct attention to the fact that the committee examining plans disclosed that, in the year 1929-30, we exported £17,000,000 worth of products that were not agricultural products and in ten years that has been reduced to £4,000,000.  So <Col N="1344" /> that there is no use in thinking that by ignoring the export market we can increase our industrial products.</P>
    <P>If we concentrate on increased agricultural production, we can feed our people better than if we did not concentrate intensively.  The one thing that will induce confidence and induce the capitalisation of our agricultural industry is the knowledge that the market is vast, and we will serve our own people in agricultural production here if we realise that we have a vast extension of the market for our Irish farmers outside in Great Britain.  If we take that into consideration, and if we set ourselves to produce not only for our own country but for the profitable market that exists outside, then our production will be increased without our overheads being necessarily very much increased and we will be able to establish credits to buy the things we want from abroad and give our people what they need in the way of food at a cheaper rate than we otherwise would if we narrowed our vision and simply set ourselves to produce for our own people.</P>
    <P>That is the thing that I think stood out in the whole debate.  We had the farmers rather disparaging the idea of production for the export market. We had the Minister rather exalting the idea of the home market, too.  It is a very great mistake.  It is reducing our standard of production, and if we reduce that, then we reduce the standard of living that we can offer to our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in this Bill, seeks to obtain money for certain purposes.  I endorse what Deputy Mulcahy has said with reference to the necessity of expanding production and raising the standard of efficiency in production.  I think the Minister misunderstood me.  I am sure he did not want deliberately to misrepresent my remark in regard to total expenditure. I stated definitely that only a small fraction of the total expenditure of £52,000,000 is being devoted to production. I did not say that no part of that expenditure was being devoted to production.  If the Minister will take the trouble of looking up the <Col N="1345" /> report of what I said, he will find that he was, perhaps, not deliberately but certainly misrepresenting my remarks, and he did try to make a case against me that I disregarded the truth completely.</P>
      <P>My complaint all through in regard to this high rate of expenditure of approximately £1,000,000 per week has been that only a very small fraction of it adds to the wealth of the nation. I do not think that any member of this Party belittles or despises in any way the importance of an export trade, not only in agricultural produce but in industrial produce.  When we speak of the importance of the home consumer we are emphasising a fact that is well known to everyone, namely, that the motive behind all production is ultimate consumption by our people, and even if we do require to export a considerable amount of agricultural or industrial goods, we export them merely in order to bring into this country goods which our people can consume.  That is mainly the purpose for which we export.  If we did not require to import goods, there would be very little reason for exporting.  If we did not require to import goods, we would be simply exporting in order to accumulate credit balances abroad which might, as Deputy Hughes suggested, be of very little use to us in the future.  As it is, we export in order to import, and I think there is no member of the Farmers' Party who does not recognise the importance of catering for the requirements of the British market, because the British market is the only market to which we can export our agricultural surplus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to that, we can always be assured of securing from Great Britain a very large variety of things which we urgently need.  Therefore, the economic systems of the two countries are complementary.  I think every farmer realises that and endeavours to see that agricultural policy is directed towards making that aim effective.  The events of the past few years ought, I think, to promote better trading relations between Great Britain and Ireland.  Without going into the field of international <Col N="1346" /> affairs, I think there ought to be a better feeling between the Irish people and the people of Great Britain.  In the past we have treasured the memories of wrongs which the British nation inflicted upon us in years gone by, but to-day we must realise that the British nation has treated this country very fairly in a time of grave danger and difficulty.  Because they had done so our approach to the British people both in regard to commercial dealings and otherwise must be of a more friendly nature than they have been in the past.  I am quite sure that the British people will approach us in a friendly and neighbourly way realising, as the Minister has said, that their country provides a good market for our exportable surplus just as our country provides a good market for them.</P>

      <P>I have not much to say.  I entirely agree with Deputy Mulcahy when he appeals for increased industrial and agricultural production. There is no hope or future for this country unless we make ourselves more efficient and produce more and better goods of all kinds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cogan, in his speech, yesterday, said that there was untold wealth in the land of Ireland.  That is quite true.  We have never in the history of our country extracted from the land anything like what it is capable of producing.  I endorse what Deputy Mulcahy said to the effect that it will be more necessary in the future, conditions being as we know them to be, and as we may forecast them to be in the immediate post-war period, that we should keep our people on the land and keep them at home and fit and help them as far as we can by Government action to produce more and better goods for home production and for export.  With regard to Deputy Cogan's speech, I only want to say that I have no desire at all to misrepresent him.  I would dislike very much that any Deputy could be able to prove me guilty of misrepresentation, but the note that I took of that part of Deputy Cogan's speech was that he said that no part <Col N="1347" /> of this big increase, the increase between 1930 and 1945, was used to increase production.  That is the note I took and if I am wrong I apologise.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister spoke of housing he has indicated how difficult the financial position is.  Certain financial considerations enter into the production of houses in the same way as certain financial considerations enter into increased production of other kinds. The Minister seemed to think that yesterday I wanted to suggest that we should get done here what the Australian Government are doing in Australia.  No, I simply drew attention to the fact that in various countries in various parts of the world certain things are being done for certain reasons.  One of the reasons the Australian Government has taken the action it has taken was that it considered that high interest rates brought about unemployment.  They were not going to have a situation in Australia in which unemployment would be continually brought about by the high rate of interest.  Their general financial policy has as its object first and foremost to keep the currency firm and honest, and, secondly, to see that full employment will be brought about as far as possible, and, thirdly, to finance the well-being economically and socially of the people as a whole.  They felt that <Col N="1348" /> financial considerations enter into these matters to such an extent that it was necessary for them to take very elaborate powers and risk very grave criticism in order to get power over the financial position.  We have some evidence of what the situation may be from the point of view of increased production if we refer to paragraph 494, on the Report of Housing in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>No one will deny that genuine savings are entitled to seek a legitimate income or return.  We have also to learn to understand that if investment is kept at a particular rate of interest you cannot continue employment in the country or improve the general position of the people. One of the things that we are likely to be called upon to decide as between the general workers seeking work and the person with genuine savings seeking investment is which of these is really the first consideration.  If we are going to be in the position that the person with genuine savings is going to stand out for a price that he thinks he can get for investment, then the Government if it accepts its responsibility for the economic and general social welfare of the people as a whole has to decide what its attitude is going to be towards the genuine worker genuinely seeking work and the person with genuine savings.  The Report of the recent Inquiry into the housing of the working classes of the City of Dublin at paragraph 494, at page 168, says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Negotiations took place with the Banks Standing Committee on the matter of raising £2,000,000, by issue of stock, but in January, 1939, it was intimated to the corporation that the banks could not underwrite a public issue.  The reasons given were:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  the uneconomic character of the housing programme, aggravated by the high level of building costs; and</P>
    <P>(2)  the magnitude of the sums required for the corporation's five-year programme of public works.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Paragraph 5 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Negotiations still continue and in April, 1939, an issue of £1,500,000 <Col N="1349" /> of 4 per cent. stock at 96, was put on the market of which approximately £850,000 (including Government investments) was taken up. The underwriters had to take up the remaining £650,000.  This was taken as a definite indication that the market would not be disposed to respond to any further larger demands in connection with the corporation's housing activities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister if that should be read in relation to the attitude of the banks.</P>
    <P>I want to contrast the provision made for the Dublin Corporation and the attitude to the public generally at that particular time.  If the banks were not prepared at that time to support a loan of £2,000,000, to issue it to the public, and if they afterwards condescended to lend £1,500,000, at 4 per cent. at 96, which was equivalent to lending it at 4.1 per cent., and if the effect of interest rates on the housing situation, on rents, was to continue, what was to be the Government's attitude with regard to it?  The point I want to make is that the Government must have a definite policy with regard to interest rates and must not allow the withholding of savings on the one hand by private persons or refusal by the banks to accept their responsibilities and to discharge their functions to operate in such a way that housing cannot go on.</P>
    <P>In moving the amendment, I suggest that, in borrowing this £17,000,000, the Government should pay no more than 3 per cent. to ordinary lenders and no more than 2 per cent. in the case of the banks.  I do not think there is any necessity to elaborate on the position with regard to the 3 per cent. at present because there is plenty of evidence before the Minister in that connection.  The Government of Northern Ireland is borrowing at 3 per cent. and substantial loans held by local authorities are being liquidated, conversion loans are being issued for millions of pounds of indebtedness of local authorities in Great Britain, at 3 per cent., with the British Government standing behind them.  If the persons holding the old loans at 4, 4½ <Col N="1350" /> or 5 per cent. do not accept the conversion loan, the British Government stands behind the local authorities and provides them with the necessary capital to enable them to pay off their loans, so that a standard of 3 per cent. in respect of loans of local authorities in Great Britain is being definitely set as a matter of Government policy.  The reason, both in Great Britain and elsewhere, is very clear&mdash;Government debts have risen to such an enormous figure that there is a general policy on the part of Governments to keep interest rates low.</P>
    <P>To return to the banks, in April, 1939, the banks as a whole took up £650,000 worth of Dublin Corporation Stock at 4 per cent. at 96 and subsequently, in July, 1944, the Bank of Ireland, on its own, entered into an arrangement to lend £1,000,000 to the corporation at 3¼ per cent.  I want to reduce this to a matter of simple arithmetic, so that whatever is wrong may be sought out and, without theorising in any way but simply facing facts, we may come to an understanding as to the rate at which we can expect to get money from the banks when we have to go to the banks and as to the rate we can reasonably endeavour to fix for private persons lending to the Government. The United States Government have taken definite steps to see that so far as possible banking institutions will not invest their money in high-priced Government securities which should be kept for the ordinary person with genuine savings to invest.  It is recognised there that the banks can lend money at a lower rate than that at which the private person can be expected to lend it.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 495 of this report says that the banks lent £650,000 to the Dublin Corporation when the loan the corporation floated of £1,500,000 was not taken up to that extent and I want to show what the banks profited as a result of taking up that loan.  I will take the figure of £660,000 instead of the £650,000 for purposes of easy calculation. When the banks took up that amount of £660,000, we may accept that new money to that amount was created. I want to isolate the transaction and <Col N="1351" /> to deal with this loan of £660,000 by the banks.  As I say, new money to that extent was created.  When the transaction is isolated and completely gone through, according to the general understanding of what happened, one-third of the amount devoted to housing was spent on imports of materials from abroad, so that £220,000 had to be paid to sellers outside who sold building material of one kind or another to this country for the purpose of carrying on that scheme.</P>
    <P>When a sum of £220,000 is paid to persons outside this country for goods received, there has to be a surrender, from the Irish banking system, of British securities to that extent, and through surrendering British securities held by the banks to that extent, there is a loss to the banks of the income they derived from these securities.  If we take the average amount of British securities held by the Currency Commission between March, 1943, and March, 1944, and examine what their income from these was, we find that the British securities held by the Currency Commission to the amount of approximately £23,000,000 yielded dividends at the rate of 1.58 per cent.</P>
    <P>The banks have increased very substantially in recent years their holdings of British Government securities, and I am not minimising the position in any way if I take it that the British securities which the banks would have to surrender for the purpose of paying for £220,000 worth of goods imported here are yielding not more than 2 per cent. to the banks, so that, as a result of the export of capital for goods required for the £660,000 worth of housing done here, the banks would lose an income of 2 per cent. on £220,000, that is, their annual loss would be £4,400.  There would be in circulation in the country additional money to the extent of £440,000.  The amount of the £660,000 that was not used for the payment of imports would be left as additional money in the country and the general opinion of the Banking Commission has indicated that additional money like that will be held in fairly definite proportions <Col N="1352" /> as between cash in the hands of the people, money on current account and money on deposit account.  Any additional money in the hands of the people has to be backed by British Government securities and any additional deposits left with the banks here are paid for by the banks here at the rate of 1 per cent., so that, as well as losing the income from the British Government securities they had to release because of the money paid for imports, the banks will lose an income&mdash;again, at the rate of 2 per cent.&mdash;on the British Government securities with which they backed the additional cash to the extent of one-sixth of the £440,000 that would be left in the hands of the people.  The additional money on current account will cost them nothing but the additional four-sixths of that amount, or £2,933,332, will have to be paid for by the banks at the rate of 1 per cent. The total losses, therefore, to the banks, as a result of the transaction, will be £4,400, arising out of the loss of the British securities which had to go for the payment of imports; £1,466 in respect of British securities that have to back the additional cash put into circulation here, and £2,933 payment for the additional deposits that have gone into the banking system and on which the banks pay 1 per cent. The sum of these losses would be £8,799 or, let us say, £8,800.</P>
    <P>The banks, however, have lent £660,000 to the Dublin Corporation at 4.1 per cent. and, in respect of that, they will have an annual income of £27,060.  If we take the £8,800, which was the amount of the loss I have indicated, from their income, the banks will at the rate of 4.1 per cent., be receiving from the Dublin Corporation in respect of the part of the loan they took up, to the extent of £660,000, a net annual profit of £18,260.  That is from a body for which, in the beginning of the year, they were not prepared to underwrite £2,000,000 required for housing.  If that loan from the bank, instead of being paid for at 4.1 per cent., were paid for at 3¼ per cent., the annual net additional income to the banks from the Dublin Corporation would be <Col N="1353" /> £12,650.  If the money were lent at 2 per cent., the figure would be £4,400. The experience of the world at present is that people expect that the resources of the world will be able to maintain the people of the different countries in fairly reasonable conditions. They are asking that as much intelligence and energy should be brought to bear upon the well-being of the people in peace as was brought to bear on their well-being and safety in war.  Just as a bricklayer or carpenter or engine driver has a function to perform and services to render in return for maintenance, bankers and financial administrators of one kind or another have a function to perform.  We must demand that that function be performed. If it is not performed properly by those who accept responsibility and have the training and capacity to perform it, then we shall have very considerable chaos.  It is the Government's function to see that proper steps are taken to secure that the financial machinery, which is so important, is properly operated.</P>
    <P>As I read it, the standing committee of the banks almost deliberately&mdash; from culpable ignorance if not by deliberate intent&mdash;sabotaged credit of the Dublin Corporation in January, 1939. I cannot find any words to describe what happened in January, 1939, other than that the standing committee of the banks deliberately sabotaged the credit and good financial name of the Dublin Corporation.  Then, as a result of the sabotaging of the corporation's credit they made a profit of £18,260 a year on the loan they took up.  Following that up in July, 1944, the Bank of Ireland, when it gave a loan of £1,000,000 at 3¼ per cent. for housing, which involved imports to the extent of one-third of the amount, made a profit of £19,166 in the same way.  Assuming that the transaction was entirely inside the Bank of Ireland, they lost the income on British Government securities sacrificed to the extent of one-third because of the imports involved.  They had a loss because of the necessity for backing by British Government securities at, say, 2 per cent. the additional cash brought into circulation <Col N="1354" /> and because of the fact that they had to pay for the additional new deposits created.  But, as a result of issuing £1,000,000 credit to the corporation, the bank gained £19,166 from the corporation, having indicated in 1939, in association with the banks standing committee, to the holders of genuine savings, that it was not worth investing their money in this way at 4.1 per cent.</P>
    <P>The same banks have a very considerable amount of money invested in British Government securities at the present time that, I suggest, is earning less than 2 per cent.  The interest on Treasury Deposit Receipts of the British Government is 1? per cent. The <i>Statist</i> of the 3rd March last gave particulars of the assets of the Irish banks.  It showed that there is at least one bank here that has £1,000,000 invested in Treasury Deposit Receipts. There is no obligation, I understand, on the banks to show these things in their balance sheets, but one bank at any rate has done so.  The other banks may also hold Treasury Deposit Receipts, but, at any rate, the average income that they have from their general holdings in British Government securities is less than 2 per cent. while those with the Currency Commission are only earning 1.58 per cent.  I suggest it is an important point that the banks have earned these very large sums, that is, £18,260 on the £660,000 taken up in April of 1939, and the Bank of Ireland £19,166 in respect of the £1,000,000 loan which they gave to the Dublin Corporation at the end of last year.  That will be the amount when the loan is fully given.</P>
    <P>In considering what the banks can be expected to do in certain circumstances, there is another aspect of this matter of lending that we have to take into consideration.  If the whole of these loans had been lent by the public to the Dublin Corporation the banks would have suffered a loss.  In so far as the two-thirds of the amount subscribed by the public to the Dublin Corporation was kept here, there would be no change, so far as the banks are concerned, as regards cash, current or deposit accounts, the reason being that the money would simply <Col N="1355" /> change hands.  The banking system would lose a certain income by reason of the fact that one-third of the money lent was for housing.  Where £1,000,000 was lent by the people to the Government or to the corporation for housing and where that had the effect of sending certain capital out of the country to pay for imports, then on that £1,000,000 loan the net loss to the banks would be £3,000 odd per year. If it be accepted that, normally, we would expect that housing loans to the Dublin Corporation would be subscribed by the ordinary public, and not by the banks, then the net loss in income to the banks arising out of such a loan of £1,000,000 would be £3,000 odd per annum.  We may take it, however, that the banks in one way or another would be able to make up a loss of that sort.  You have there the situation that a person holding genuine savings and lending them to the Government or the corporation for housing is, by doing so, causing loss to the banking system.  Here we have a scheme by which very substantial sums of money are being earned by the banking system either through shaking the credit of the Dublin Corporation or, for some reason, that the holders of genuine savings were not prepared to invest their savings in corporation stock.</P>
    <P>From the information put before us by the Government we have very big problems to deal with in regard to housing, roads and drainage and electrical development of one kind or another.  Housing, for example, is very necessary for the health of the people, and for their economic well-being. None of these works is positively reproductive.  Some are, perhaps, likely to be less productive than housing or road expenditure.  We also want capital for industry, and we want to bring agriculture back to a vigorous and progressive state.  We ought to be getting clear in our minds now as to where the moneys are to come from to build up the productive capital of the country, and the price that is going to be paid for it.  If we are going to accept the situation in which the banks, lending money to the Government <Col N="1356" /> or the corporation, are going to claim a rate of interest that the holder of genuine savings may not be entitled to expect, then we are going to lift to a very high rate the interest that the genuine holder of savings is going to expect.  By allowing the banks to charge as high a rate as 3¼ per cent. for Government loans or for housing, we are going seriously to injure the improvement of our agricultural and industrial development because we are going to put down on these an amount for interest charges that is going to be swollen by the way in which we allow the banks to increase their charges.</P>
    <P>Everybody responsible for seeing that the banks are strong, healthy, vigorous and secure&mdash;that they function as faithfully in their own way as we expect carpenters and plumbers, in their way, to function&mdash;ought to stand over figures such as I have given. They ought to ask why, in the light of these figures, the banks should be paid as big an amount of money by way of interest as the investor of genuine savings, on the one hand, and why they should be allowed to charge 3 per cent. when they can make substantial profits by lending money at 2 per cent.</P>

      <P>In connection with the amendment, I would like to raise a point on procedure.  This amendment was circulated at 11 o'clock this morning.  Two hours later the Bill itself was circulated.  Ordinary Deputies were not aware of the terms of the Bill until two hours after they had read the amendment.  I would like to know if it is the custom to circulate Bills of this kind to one or two Deputies and not to the members of the House generally, or whether the Leader of the largest Opposition Party in the House has special rights which are not shared by other Parties. Perhaps the Minister could give us some enlightenment on that matter.</P>

I thought it fitting to have it discussed in a proper way, considering the Government's responsibility in the matter and, therefore, I drafted my amendment and I gave information to the Dáil Office as early as I reasonably could this morning, knowing that it was important that the Minister and the House generally would know that the amendment was proposed even though the Bill had not actually been circulated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand, Sir.  I am grateful to Deputy Mulcahy for the courtesy of his explanation in regard to the matter.  I was rather at sea. As far as the amendment is concerned, I should like to support it as far as it goes but, personally, I think it does not go far enough.  The Minister and Deputy Mulcahy said that we ought to be clear in our minds as to where the money for national development work is to come from.  So far as I personally am concerned, I am very clear in my mind as to where it should come from.  I believe that the credit of the State should be used to provide any money that is required for national development work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no obligation or no duty on the State to pay interest for money, either to banks or to private individuals. <Col N="1358" /> There are old-fashioned people in this country who believe that the State has no income other than that secured by taxation imposed on the people or by borrowing from banks or individuals.  I believe the State has another source of income, namely, the creation and issue of money on the security of the State.  The main function of taxation really is to avoid inflation by preventing a surplus of money getting into circulation and lowering the value of money.  There should be no quarrelling or haggling with banking institutions in regard to rates of interest.  The State should be independent of the banking institutions, independent even of the savings of the people.  The State should draw exclusively on its own credit and thus save enormous sums which are being paid out annually in interest charges on various Government schemes, such as housing, road development, electricity development, and all the other public activities which are financed by the State through borrowing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>This question of financing State undertakings and services, such as housing, to which Deputy Mulcahy has referred in particular, is, of course, a very important one, vital to the welfare of the nation as a whole.  We cannot get on without money.  Everything we do, development of any kind, requires State money or State credit to be utilised in one way or another and, of course, the question of raising money and of the interest we have to pay on that money is a very important question for everybody and, in particular, of course, for the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Cogan that the State can disregard the savings of the people.  I do not agree with him that the State is independent of the savings of the people.  If we went on that basis, as long as we were going out for State expenditure on the scale to which the State is involved at the present time, we would be heading for national bankruptcy. We must have regard to the production of the country and to the savings arising out of that production. &ldquo;There is no obligation on the State <Col N="1359" /> to pay interest on the money it borrows,&rdquo; Deputy Cogan says.  I would suggest to Deputy Cogan that the farming community would not like him to develop or to preach that principle on their behalf.  I make that suggestion respectfully to him. The farming community of this country are a very thrifty community and the money on which the banks operate is very largely contributed by the agricultural community.  Although the agricultural community does not insist on its money being reinvested in agriculture to the extent that I should like to see, they believe their money is safe and they are satisfied with the very small interest they receive on the very large sum of money they lend to the banks.  I think they would be dissatisfied if they got it into their heads that those representing the agricultural community, or claiming to represent the agricultural community, and to speak their minds, were urging the State to take that money and to use it as they wish without giving any return.  I do not think the Deputy is wise in propagating that idea, especially to the farming community.</P>
    <P>The banks' money is, as to the greatest content, made up of the savings of the community as a whole and the banks are responsible primarily to those who lend them that money, who have their savings and deposits in the banks, for the safe keeping and management of these funds.  As Deputy Mulcahy properly says, the banks also have their responsibilities.  They have their obligations to the community just as, as he said, the bricklayer, the engine driver, the farmer and everybody else has responsibilities.  But I do not see that the banks are obliged to run themselves into bankruptcy, even to build houses for the Dublin citizens, very necessary as that work is.  If money has to be provided, the State may have to say to the bankers: &ldquo;This money has got to be provided; we expect you to provide it; we will use your machinery to provide it,&rdquo; but, if the State adopts that attitude to the banks, then the State, in the name of the people, will have to see to it that the banks are not the losers.  The <Col N="1360" /> question of the rate of interest to be paid is a matter that changes considerably from time to time.  The banks are commercial institutions, the same as are farmers or shopkeepers or any other person in trade or commerce. There have been times when the banks were in a position to demand of local authorities interest rates as high as 5½ per cent.  There were times when the local authorities paid that, and paid it without question.  But much water has run under the bridges since the date in 1939, to which Deputy Mulcahy refers, when the banks refused to lend money to the Dublin Corporation for housing.  I had the responsibility more than once of going to the Banks' Standing Committee and the Bank of Ireland, on behalf of the Dublin Corporation, long before I ever thought I would be a Minister of State here in this country, asking for money for housing principally.  I argued that matter out with the bankers.  The Dublin Corporation were good customers of the Bank of Ireland, customers that they should facilitate.  I am speaking now as a member of the Dublin Corporation.  We went to the bank to look for large sums for housing, and mostly we got them.  Sometimes we did not get all we asked for. We had to pay for what we got, and pay for it pretty dearly.  I am speaking now of periods going back 20 years, and even before that.  We paid 3½, 4 and 4½ per cent. at different times, and we were glad to get the money at that price.  We dealt with the banks in something the same way as we would deal with a shopkeeper.</P>
    <P>When it is necessary in the interests of the community as a whole that the State must, for the welfare of the people, get money, then the State may decide that it is necessary to get that money wherever it can get it, in the banks or elsewhere, and may decide in the interests of the community that if interest has to be paid at all it must be at a very moderate rate.  But, as I say, changes in those matters come about, just as changes in the prices of commodities come about. There have been changes, and considerable changes, with regard to the <Col N="1361" /> value of money and the cost of money since the date to which Deputy Mulcahy refers, January, 1939.  It is now generally agreed that money is a cheaper commodity than it was five or six years ago.  There is much more money in circulation and it is more readily available.  The fact is that the banks nowadays&mdash;all the banks in Ireland at any rate&mdash;have much more money on their hands than they can usefully employ.  The farmers are not looking for capital from them.  The industrialists have no opportunity of developing their industries.  Therefore, money is cheap, comparatively cheap, here at home, and readily available.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the difficulties of the Dublin Corporation, in particular at that time of which Deputy Mulcahy speaks and at other times, was that bankers are commercial men and must make a financial success of their institutions in the interests of their shareholders. At that period of which Deputy Mulcahy speaks, the market was so full of Dublin Corporation stock that it was not readily saleable, and the bankers have to keep a very considerable portion of their money in a liquid state.  If they lent large sums to the Dublin Corporation they would have to be lent for long periods.  The corporation loans sanctioned by the Minister for Local Government are usually for a period of 30 years.  The banks, generally speaking, do not like to lend money for long periods of that kind.  It is more profitable for them to be in short-term securities even though the interest is lower, so that they can turn them over very rapidly. In general, they think it is better for them and better for their shareholders. But if it becomes necessary, in the interests of the State, that money be made available, we may have to go to the banks and put that proposition to them, but, if we do, we are bound in conscience as well as from other points of view to see to it that the banks are reasonably and properly treated.</P>
    <P>Coming to this amendment by Deputy Mulcahy, I cannot accept it. First of all, I think that question of <Col N="1362" /> the rate of interest is a matter which the Minister for Finance of the day must be left free to negotiate as best he can with those who have money to lend.  He should not have his hands tied in the manner suggested by Deputy Mulcahy.  I suggest to the Deputy that, if his hands were tied, it might be to the disadvantage of the State; it could happen that the Minister could get money more cheaply than is suggested in the amendment.  That could happen, and it would not be wise that the Minister should be obliged to pay other private lenders the rate of interest which the Deputy suggests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good; that disposes of that point of mine that I should be free to pay less.  At present we are paying 2½ per cent. to Post Office depositors.  That was the rate we took over from the British Government, and we have kept it on ever since.  To holders of Savings Certificates we are paying more than 3 per cent.  The figure is £3 1s. 5d. per cent.  We are anxious to promote thrift; I think Deputy Mulcahy would be just as anxious as I am in that regard.  The immediate consequences of what Deputy Mulcahy suggests would be that I would have to reduce those rates, and that would not be in the interests of thrift anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point is that the Deputy suggested we should differentiate between the amount of interest paid to the banks and that paid to private investors for our loans.  I do not think that would be practicable, and I do not think it would be a wise scheme to adopt.  Here, generally speaking, our business in loans has been done <Col N="1363" /> with the banks' co-operation, and I must say that generally we have got full co-operation and great help from them.  I have no reason to complain that we have had hard tussles, at least since I became Minister for Finance, on the few occasions I had to discuss the question of loans or possible loans.  We met the banks as businessmen, and I tried to get the money at the lowest possible rate of interest, while, naturally, they were looking to the protection of their own and their shareholders' interests in getting as high a rate of interest as they could, because, generally, our loans are for pretty long periods.</P>
    <P>If they were like the moneys invested in England, where most of the loans are short-term loans, it is understandable that we should have much lower rates of interest, but, here, when we go for loans they are for at least 20 or 25 years, and there have even been longer periods than that. I think, as I already indicated, that it is possible that when we go to the banks again or to the country for money to carry out the big schemes of development referred to in the earlier debate to-day&mdash;the Electricity Supply Board development of rural electrification&mdash; we will have to get money for all the schemes Deputy Mulcahy referred to for roads, housing and so on.</P>
    <P>Enormous sums, that is comparatively speaking, will be required if we are to carry through the housing programme we have in mind for the country as a whole, and the building programme in general that we have in view, and certain particulars of which have been published.  They will require very considerable sums of money, and I feel fairly satisfied that the rates of interest that are common in other parts of the world, that are certainly considerably lower than anything known before the war, will not be denied to us by the lending public, any more than they have been denied in other places.</P>
    <P>I might comment that in England at any rate and even in Australia to which we have been referring off and on during these debates, it is common to find that in the case of a normal <Col N="1364" /> loan of even 15 to 20 years, a rate of 3 per cent. is not considered improper. I hope that here it may be found possible to get it at 3 per cent. but I will be happier still if we are able to get our loans at a lower rate than 3 per cent. from the public or from the banks.  I think it is just as well that the public and the banks should know what we are anticipating and what the State thinks should be proper in the way of assistance to the State to be obtained from the public who have money to loan, and from the banking institutions.  In that way, I think, the debate, as it is going, is not unhelpful, and I am not a bit sorry to have the subject raised and thrashed out in the Dáil so that the country may be prepared for what is in store for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the debate has been very helpful yet, because, among other things, the Minister has indicated that he sees no reason why if he has to go to the banks for loans he should pay them any less than he is prepared to pay the public.  That is a matter which I think we ought to get quite clear. Happily, it is a matter which I think is possible to take apart and to examine in a very detached way, and, for that reason, I would like the Minister, as a constructive action, in helping to clarify the situation, to bear with me and to take steps to have examined with the technical advice that is at his disposal, the arguments I wanted to put forward.</P>
      <P>I have indicated that when this money is lent to a public authority for carrying on any particular class of work which involves imports, a certain amount of money goes out of the country, and if that money has been provided by private persons, to the percentage to which the money is spent on paying for imports, the banking system loses a certain portion of its income.  Therefore, if the borrowing is normal from people with genuine savings, one of the incidents in the life of the banking system of the country is that it loses portion of its income.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister not to misunderstand me in that matter.  When I speak of genuine savings, I mean savings in the hands of private persons.  Some of the people go to the bank and are satisfied with a return of 1 per cent.  Others want to put their savings into the Industrial Credit Company, because they cannot make up their minds where they should put them, and others place them in different directions.  What I do want to say is that the £1,000,000 that was loaned from the banking system to the Dublin Corporation at 3¼ per cent. last year, 1944, was new money.  That increased the amount of money in circulation in the country to the extent to which it remained in the country, without being exported to pay for imports, and the extent to which it did not casually wipe out certain advances that had already been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I mean by genuine savings is savings in the hands of the private person capable of being invested.  I say that the banking system loses when savings in the hands of the private person are loaned to a particular public authority, or to any kind of business that spends part of it by paying for imports.  Therefore, the banking system is affected by loans given from private persons to the Government. When the loan is given by the banks to the Government, then there is a substantial income, and by reason of that, and by reason of the fact that the money loaned by the banks is largely new money, I think a very strong case can be established that where the Government cannot get the money from the people with genuine savings&mdash;if people with savings to invest feel they can invest them more profitably for one reason or another&mdash; then the Government has to go to the banks and new money has to be created.  Then the banks ought to be <Col N="1366" /> able to provide the money at a lower rate.  At any rate, interest rates generally must be controlled in such a way that the continuing increase in the productivity of the country will not be choked.</P>
    <P>Further, on the point that I consider that banks ought to lend to the Government and to local authorities, when they are called upon to do so, at a lower rate than should be expected from the ordinary investing public, I ask the Minister if he will take cognisance of the argument I want to make now with regard to a loan of £1,000,000 by private persons to the Government for a purpose such as housing, where one-third of it is spent on imported materials.  One-third being spent for paying for the import of materials means that £333,333 is withdrawn from the banking system to pay to the sellers of the goods, say, in Great Britain, and as a result income is lost to the banks at the rate of 2 per cent. on that amount.  I do not think it is unreasonable to take the figure of 2 per cent.  The Minister was not able to tell me the other day what certain investments of the banks in British securities are earning.  But, at any rate, we know that the Currency Commission is earning at the rate of 1.58 per cent.  As a result of having to part with these British securities, the banks lose £6,666.  But the banks will have certain savings, as one-sixth of that amount has been in the hands of the people as cash; four-sixths of that amount has been on current account; and one-sixth has been on deposit account.</P>
    <P>They are, therefore, being relieved of having to back cash to the extent of one-sixth of the amount of money that has gone out of the country, and will be saved a payment of £1,111 per year.  By being saved from paying 1 per cent. on the deposits to the extent of four-sixths of the amount which has gone out of the country, they will have saved £2,222 per year.  The joint savings amount to £3,333 per year.  I have indicated that their losses were £6,666 per year, so that there will be a net loss to the banks of £3,333 per year in the case in which private owners have subscribed £1,000,000 to <Col N="1367" /> the Government to be spent on housing.  That is what happens to the banking system when that transaction is fully completed and isolated.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the arithmetical side of what, in my opinion, happens to the banking system when the banks lend £1,000,000 to the Government for housing.  Again, one-third of the money is disposed of abroad to pay for imports and the banks' loss is the same, £6,666.  The remaining two-thirds of £1,000,000 is new cash in circulation and that remains in the hands of the people in the various proportions that I indicated before, as shown in the Banking Commission's report. One-sixth of the new money remains in the hands of the people as cash, one-sixth on current account, and four-sixths on deposit account.  The banks have to back the additional cash in the people's hands by securities with the Central Bank, British securities that pay the banks at the rate of, say, 2 per cent.  Therefore, to back the new additional cash in circulation we have an annual loss of £2,222.  In respect of the increased new deposits they pay 1 per cent. and they have to pay out for that an additional £4,444.  Therefore, their gross loss under these three headings is £13,332.  If the rate of interest at which they lend the money to the Government is 2 per cent., they will have an income on the £1,000,000 of £20,000 per year.  Putting that against the loss of £13,332, they will have a net profit of £6,668.  I suggest to the Minister that a review of these facts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will let me finish.  Establishment of these facts and a review of what was established would, as I understand the situation, emphatically show that when the Government has to go to the banks for loans, whether for general running purposes or other purposes that involve even payment for exports, the banks should lend money at a substantially lower rate than that at which the normal lender would be expected to lend because, <Col N="1368" /> when the normal lender lends money, the banks suffer.  Yet, apparently, we will all agree that the banking system would survive if the ordinary holders of money were the investors, because we all think that the great weakness in the system, where a loan is not fully taken up by subscribers outside, is that we have to fall back on the banks Therefore, that requires to be examined and I ask the Minister to examine the case.</P>

      <P>I am sure he understands as well as we do how essential it is to see that the blocks, particularly on the financial side, that stand in the way of increased housing, increased production and increased employment, must be removed or we will be faced with forces that will remove them without the assistance of technical experts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When you approach things that have to be removed, the explosive nature of which has to be dealt with, it is always better that they be handled by experts.  We should not act like the person who finds a bomb on the seashore and begins to tamper with the knobs.  We have plenty of evidence from every country around us facing up to the problems of to-morrow, that they consider the financial aspect of things to be important, that they realise how shockingly the financial machine has operated in the past and how the failure to use finance to bring men, materials and resources together, is responsible for the situation which brought about the war.  We should be able to challenge the people who are responsible for seeing the implications of those things and bring them down to facts.  I am making the suggestion here that the standing committee of the banks did definitely sabotage the credit of the Dublin Corporation in 1939 and is, to some extent, challenging the corporation's credit by charging 3¼ per cent. for housing now, on a banking loan.  That challenge should be enough to bring those responsible for the banking situation to a clear and frank statement in explanation of the position.  I put to the Minister and, through him, to them, the figures <Col N="1369" /> and calculations I have made and I ask for an examination of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two small points I wish to make.  In regard to the present arrangement to grant indefinite leave to members of the Defence Forces, I wonder if consideration could be given to the possibility of allowing those men who are on indefinite leave at the moment, to secure their final discharge.  That would relieve them of the restrictions which, of necessity, must be attached to indefinite leave.  It is quite clear that, when indefinite leave was being granted earlier in the emergency, it had to be kept under strict control. However, with the approach to the possibility of a reduction in the numbers and the fact that that leave has been granted on a wider scale, I feel it might be possible, even though we have no definite indication from the Government in regard to general demobilisation, to ease the position of many of those men who are at present out of active service on the basis of indefinite leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that, prior to the actual commencement of the emergency in 1939, there was a small <Col N="1370" /> number of men who did not join on the usual period of enlistment but joined under special privilege in one particular unit, in which they could join up for a period of two years plus another year in the reserve.  Subsequently, the Government took the view that an emergency existed and the service of the general members of the Defence Forces was continued.  Then this small group, which amounted to 50 or so, was overlooked and the position was that, though they had joined on a specific contract of service prior to the emergency, no provision was made for them, and they were brought under the general conditions which applied after the emergency regulations same in. Accordingly, they were committed to service for the period of the emergency. This has given rise to certain hardships and there is some dissatisfaction over the matter. I think the Minister is aware of the number of cases arising.  I do not know whether anything can be done to regularise the position of these men, but I would ask him to consider the matter.  He might see if the mistake, which I suppose all were party to on that occasion, could not be rectified, now that we are out of the more troublesome period of the emergency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>While most soldiers appreciate the small provision being made in this Bill, the Minister has failed entirely in not informing the House of his proposals concerning the demobilisation of the Army and the L.D.F.  However, I am glad that many Deputies, including those with whom I am associated, have, since I raised this question originally, realised the importance of this question of demobilisation and the gravity of the situation which will attend the demobilisation of a large number of soldiers, on the cessation of hostilities, or, at any rate, of the emergency here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since this matter was raised some time ago, apparently some people have come to realise how important it is to take certain steps, particularly in view of the plans and efforts made in other countries to deal with demobilisation efficiently and effectively. This Bill only deals with one <Col N="1371" /> aspect of demobilisation, that is, the retention in the Army of officers and men who wish to remain on as regular soldiers.  While this Bill, as a result of its provisions, could not deal with demobilisation, it only deals in a small way with a rather grave problem which is bound to arise, and the Minister, in saying that post-war plans will be introduced to deal with demobilisation, is adopting an attitude of &ldquo;live horse and you will get grass,&rdquo; unless he really means to introduce them immediately after the Easter Recess.</P>
    <P>As far as the officers and men in the Army are concerned&mdash;at any rate the majority of them&mdash;they are still in the dark, because it is reasonable enough to assume that, however large the Army may be, or however large an Army in a country like this may be permitted under whatever international agreements or regulations which are likely to be adopted after the war, the vast majority of our Defence Forces will have to be demobilised sooner or later, and so far as they are concerned at the present time they are faced with very grave difficulties. They are faced, on the one hand, with uncertainty as to the duration of the emergency.  I cannot blame the Minister or the Government for that, but they are also faced with limited possibilities of employment, limited possibilities of securing whatever available employment may be there, and they are faced, on the other hand, with the loss of time, resulting from their service in the Army, which they might otherwise have spent in employment or in preparing for work as tradesmen or professional men, or whatever type of work they might have been engaged in.</P>
    <P>I do not want to repeat the arguments I made here recently on an Adjournment Debate, but I should like to say that the Minister and the Government, in fairness to the men who came forward to give their services to the country in this crisis, should immediately announce to the members of the Defence Forces, including the Local Defence Force, what plans or provision they propose to make concerning demobilisation and gratuities. <Col N="1372" /> As I say, I do not want to blame the Minister particularly, since this matter is the responsibility of the Government as a whole.  Deputies from almost every side of the House in this debate have stated what I have already stated here: that in the case of officers and men serving in the forces there is a considerable increase in letters to Deputies and in interviews concerning the anxiety of these men to secure employment, and also their anxiety at the failure of the Government to make any provision or even to announce their plans in the matter of the demobilisation of the Army.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other matters that I should like to bring to the Minister's attention.  One of them is that we are spending a large sum of money in this country, and propose to spend more, in dealing with the tuberculosis problem.  Now, a number of soldiers&mdash;not a very large number, but a comparatively large number&mdash;have been invalided out of the Army because they were found to be suffering from tuberculosis.  A number of these men have applied for pensions and have been granted them, but I would say that the majority of those who have been invalided out as suffering from tuberculosis, and who applied for pensions, have been refused pensions on the old familiar ground that the disability from which they were suffering was not directly attributable to Army service.  I should like to point out that while the disease or disability might not be directly attributable to Army service, and while some of these people may have had a pre-disposition towards the disease, or have had some symptoms of it, nevertheless the rigorous type of service entailed by Army life has produced active tuberculosis in the case of many of them.  Now, these people, their dependents, their relations, and many others who come into contact with them are dissatisfied with the way in which they have been dealt with. It would appear to me that if we are to deal with tuberculosis in the case of other members of the community, adequate and proper provision should <Col N="1373" /> be made to deal with officers and men of the Army suffering from this disease, and that if they are not entitled to a disability pension, they should at any rate receive proper treatment at Army expense until they are restored to normal health or at any rate to a state of health sufficient to enable them to return to their homes and to take up light work.  As far as I can understand the matter, from reading the Bill, it is difficult for a number of them to fit in under the provisions concerning disability, and I would urge on the Minister and his Department the desirability of examining that matter as soon as possible in order that some relief may be given to a number of men who have been found to be suffering from tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the Army problem which has been brought to my notice is that a number of old soldiers and officers have not received the promotion to which they considered they were entitled, in comparison with certain officers and men&mdash;and this applies particularly to officers&mdash;who enlisted during the emergency.  While influence may not have been used, it is significant that certain people who have enlisted since the emergency arose, and who have had association, be it close or otherwise, with the Fianna Fáil Party, have got promotion, while others who have given long and, so far as their Army record shows, efficient and honourable service, have not received the same attention. I should be glad if the Minister would examine that matter and see if those who have been promoted were entitled to the promotion they received or if others, who have not been promoted, should have received promotion more rapidly.  This, in one respect, may be of vital importance to many people in the Army when it comes to the matter of a gratuity.  It is reasonable to assume that the rate of gratuities will be measured both by service and rank, and if people are being promoted merely to secure the benefits of a gratuity, then, at any rate, those who are of a different political persuasion from the Government should receive the same consideration as <Col N="1374" /> those who have connection with Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I think that those are most of the points I should like to bring before the Minister's attention.  In conclusion, however, I should like to say that the members of the Local Defence Force are dissatisfied that no announcement has been made concerning the composition or otherwise of that force in the future.  As was mentioned here yesterday, the attendances have dwindled considerably, and while it is unreasonable to assume that there would be the same enthusiasm at the moment as was present a few years ago, I think the Government are partly to blame for that, in so far as they have not announced to the members of the Local Defence Force what form, if any, that body will take in the near future or on the cessation of hostilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I must express my pleasure at the general trend of the debate on this Bill.  The terms of the Bill itself have hardly been referred to, and my pleasure in that respect is due to the fact that, a week or so ago, in the course of my efforts to get the Bill dealt with as an urgent measure, I stated that, in my opinion, it was a non-controversial type of Bill. The rest of my pleasure is due to the fact that Deputies from all sides of the House have expressed their anxiety as to the welfare of the patriotic young men who came forward at a very critical period&mdash;the very grim and dark days of 1940 and 1941 &mdash;to give their services to this nation in what they considered to be her hour of danger.  I agree with all the remarks which Deputies have made in respect to the patriotic young men of the Army of to-day.  There is nothing in the form of words that I or anyone else could express that would pay proper homage to their patriotism on that occasion, and I can assure the House that, as far as the Government are concerned, they will express their pleasure in the most generous terms that they can regard as being within the means of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In opening the debate, Deputy Mulcahy spoke, as many other Deputies also spoke, of the failure of <Col N="1375" /> the Government to produce plans in regard to a demobilisation scheme. Some Deputies were somewhat more definite than others in that respect. Deputy Larkin went so far as to state almost positively that the Government had not even thought about a scheme, much less attempted to formulate or produce one.  That is the kind of unconsidered expression which should not be made in this House, and I suggest that, if Deputy Larkin has the interest in the Army which he says he has&mdash;and I do not doubt that he has&mdash; he must surely have been aware of the fact that this question of the production of a demobilisation scheme was raised some five weeks back, and I think that Deputy Cosgrave, on the Recess, on the occasion of his motion on the Adjournment, also raised the matter.  On both of those occasions it was made clear that the subject was being given urgent consideration by the Government at that particular period.  I think I made it fairly clear to Deputy Cosgrave on that occasion that the Government, for a considerable time, have been discussing ways and means by which demobilisation, and all the plans associated with demobilisation, would be put into operation.</P>
    <P>Now, that is a very intricate and very difficult matter. It is one which requires the most mature consideration, and I can tell the House that, for a very considerable period, the Government has been giving time, at meeting after meeting, to the question of devising the best possible plans to meet the situation which will arise out of the demobilisation of the men of the Army.  I think it would be unreasonable, and I doubt if any Deputy in the House&mdash;certainly, any Deputy who is serious on this matter&mdash; would suggest that we should issue, merely for the sake of issuing them, plans which would be immature or plans which had not been completely and fully considered, or which had not been found, after due consideration, to be completely satisfactory.  It may be some considerable time yet before it will be possible for me to produce to the House the plans which a number <Col N="1376" /> of Deputies have been demanding should be produced forthwith. I presume that, when they are produced, they will be produced in the form of a White Paper, or something of that kind, which will give Deputies ample opportunity for examining them and, at a later stage, if necessary, for discussing them.</P>
    <P>In the course of the discussion, many questions were raised, some of which I suggest would be more appropriate to the annual Estimate, and could be dealt with, perhaps, more effectively on the annual Estimate.  While I realise that almost anything can be discussed under the heading of this particular Bill, I think that the House does realise that this is only a continuing Bill, a Bill to enable the Army to be continued in existence for a further period of 12 months.  From that point of view, it naturally follows that I cannot come into this House prepared to answer all the various types of questions that would be more appropriately raised on the Estimate than on a Bill of this kind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy raised the question of better pensions.  Well, that is another of those points which, while it can be raised on this particular Bill, could be considered just as effectively, or even more effectively, on the Estimate than in connection with this particular matter.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he is aware that many relatives of Irish nationals resident in the Philippine Islands have not received any correspondence for a considerable time on account of the present hostilities; and if, in view of the rumours prevalent that several Irish priests and Christian Brothers have lost their lives, and also with a view to relieving anxiety, he will cause inquiries to be made as to the safety of all Irish nationals in that area; and if he is in a position to make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the position referred to by the Deputy.  My Department is taking all possible steps to obtain news of the Irish citizens who are at present in the Philippine Islands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our records, compiled mainly from the replies received to the Press advertisement <Col N="1378" /> we inserted in July, 1942, inviting the public to let us have particulars of their relatives and friends in the Far East, contain the names of a total of 84 persons scattered throughout the various islands in the Philippine group.  These are mainly priests and nuns, and the majority of them are Irish citizens. In response to specific requests received from their relatives and friends, we have from time to time during the past three years made inquiries in regard to a number of them through the Vatican authorities, the Japanese authorities and the International Red Cross.  At the beginning of this month the names and addresses of those appearing on the Department's records were furnished to the American authorities, who have undertaken to obtain up-to-date news for us in regard to the persons concerned.  The Deputy will appreciate that, in the prevailing circumstances, inquiries of this kind inevitably take a long time.  According as any news is received, however, it will be conveyed immediately to the relatives and friends of the persons concerned.</P>
    <P>As regards the rumours to which the Deputy refers, I have seen reports that three Irish Brothers attached to the American Province of the De La Salle Order lost their lives in Manila last month.  Urgent inquiries were immediately instituted with a view to verifying the report.  The results of these inquiries are not yet available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Among some of the queries which were put, and in which Deputies had some interest, was one submitted by Deputy Norton in respect of a particular type of case.  I think the type of case the Deputy had in mind was one where a man enlisted in the period prior to the emergency, and his time expired in the course of the emergency and he was compulsorily retained. That man would come in; we can deal with him through regulations, and he would be entitled from the period in which he was compulsorily held to the end of the emergency, or whatever period is decided upon, to whatever emoluments or gratuities will be available.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>He will.  The Deputy was also anxious to know something about Section 7.  Section 7 is mainly concerned with easing the administration within the Forces in respect of publishing matters which are purely domestic, if you like, or internal.  For instance, they comprise such things as the promotion of a young 2nd Lieutenant to be 1st Lieutenant, or a young 1st Lieutenant to be Acting-Captain. These things are incidental to the services, and they are of no great public interest, except, perhaps, to the young man's friends or relatives.</P>
      <P>Such things as commissioning, or a man beginning his Army career, or dismissals or retirements&mdash;these things will continue to be published in the ordinary way, as they have been published to date.  By the adoption of the amendment, we will relieve ourselves of a task which is practically unnecessary. The promotions and reversions will be in future, as they have been in the past, published in the official Defence Forces Regulations, which are available to all sections of the Army, and which can also be made available to members of the public who are sufficiently interested to purchase them from the Stationery Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton very wisely suggested <Col N="1384" /> that the question of demobilisation was one in which we should display very great care and in which there should be no attempt to rush matters. Against that we had Deputy Larkin suggesting that demobilisation was of the utmost importance at the present time, and that men should be released whether they have work to go to or not.  He said that some individuals to whom he was talking suggested to him that they were quite prepared to depend on good luck and their skill to secure employment if they were immediately released.  We hope that, when the period arrives when we can demobilise, we will do so in the orderly fashion which Deputy Norton visualises rather than in the &ldquo;hit and hope for the best&rdquo; method of Deputy Larkin.</P>
    <P>In that respect, I think it would be appropriate for me to make a very strong appeal to all the large companies operating in the Twenty-Six Counties, and to all employers of labour, even if they are only one-man employers, to give a preference to the young men who joined the Army in the very precarious days of the emergency. I think it will be found that the training they have received in the Army, the discipline which has been inculcated in them during their period in the Army, and their endurance and physical fitness, will be very valuable to any of these employers to whom I make this appeal.  I want to appeal, too, to the Labour Party, and through the Labour Party to the trade unions, to deal more sympathetically with the young men who have been trained in trades in the Army and who are not being given the status of skilled tradesmen outside.</P>
    <P>I can assure the trade unions that no man who has been given a trade in the Army and who has been graded as a skilled workman is any less efficient than the best trained man who comes out of private employment.  The men on whose behalf I make this appeal are men who may have been trained in motor mechanics, carpentry, electricity, bricklaying or any of the very many crafts which are operated in the Army by highly skilled men.  In the <Col N="1385" /> days which we shall face at the end of this emergency, we hope that a place will be found for these in the post-war operations in respect to building and whatever other operations may be carried out.  I am in that respect making an appeal to both capital and labour, and instead of this House making an appeal, as it has to do continuously, to a Minister to do certain things, I am availing of the opportunity to appeal to these bodies which can do a large amount of very valuable post-war work in regard to helping to place men, both skilled and unskilled, in the way of earning a reasonable livelihood.</P>
    <P>References have been made to allowing men out of the Army to take up employment.  I can assure the House that on every occasion on which such a case has been brought to my attention I have speeded up the release of the individuals concerned.  It takes a certain amount of time, and perhaps Deputies who are used to acting fairly quickly do not quite understand why it should take two or three weeks to do these things, but they will realise from their experience of Civil Service procedure, the various forms which have to be filled in and the records which have to be filed and preserved, that it is quite impossible to release these men as men might be released from ordinary private employment.  So far as releasing individuals for whom work can be found is concerned, however, I think I can say with all honesty that no such individual for whom work is available has been held for any unduly long period.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin raised the question of men on indefinite leave and asked if it would be possible to release from indefinite leave men who are already released from the Army.  That may be possible later on, but the position at the moment is that for those forces of the duration type, there is no-reserve, and it is difficult to send men out on what we might regard as the reserve of the duration forces.  If we release them as suggested by Deputy Larkin, in the event of a further emergency or anything necessitating a remobilisation arising, control of these individuals would pass out of our hands <Col N="1386" /> and it would be a question of their either re-enlisting or not taking any interest in the matter of rejoining the Army.</P>
    <P>I want to assure Deputies, and especially Deputy Hughes, who allowed himself to become rather hot and bothered about Government secrecy in respect of the production of plans, that there is no question of secrecy about these plans.  It is merely a matter of endeavouring to do what we think is best in the interests of these men.  I can further assure the Deputy that it is not a simple problem.  It is a very difficult and a very complex problem, and, as I have said, we have taken up more Government time in the last six months, although the matter was under consideration by myself and the Army authorities for six months prior to its even reaching the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>May I give an example as regards one Army man?  A young man came to me on Sunday and told me that in the month of January <Col N="1387" /> he put down his name at a labour exchange in the city in order to qualify for temporary employment.  He has not been called for interview since. Am I to take that as an example of what is being done for those men who have been serving this country and to whom the Minister paid an eloquent tribute to-day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not.  The Deputy has selected the case of one man.  I am pretty sure there will be very many more than the one young man that the Deputy is interested in who will find himself in that position. What I am discussing now is the post-war plan for demobilisation and the putting into employment of the men who will be demobilised.  What is happening at the present time is that, where employment is available, we release everyone who makes an appeal to be released.  We are not releasing those for whom no employment can be found.  Therefore, I would say that the matter which the Deputy has raised is not appropriate to this discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to assure Deputy Hughes that everything that can be done is being done.  As I have said, I doubt if we will be able to complete the discussions on these plans for another month or perhaps even longer.  I want again to assure him and the House that everything that it is possible to do is being done to expedite the whole matter.  Both the Army and the Government are deeply interested in this. We want to make certain, before we produce our plans, that they will be well considered plans and as satisfactory as it is possible to make them. From my own knowledge of what we are doing, I think I can say that the provision to be made will be reasonably generous, generous certainly when compared with the means at the disposal of our people.  It is unfair to suggest that what we are doing should be comparable with what our neighbour across the water is doing, just as it was unfair to suggest that while that great nation was at war it was able to produce plans for the demobilisation of its army, while we are <Col N="1388" /> still in the position of not being able to produce our plans.  It is hardly necessary for me to remind Deputies that our neighbour across the water had its plans pigeonholed from the last war, so that whatever readjustments were necessary were of a minor character.  All that had to be done was to take them out of the pigeon hole, amend them, where necessary, and issue them.  It is hardly fair, I think, to make a comparison between this country and a nation that has had perhaps centuries of experience in dealing with problems of that kind. This is the first time that an Irish Government had a problem of this kind to deal with.  As I have said, I was glad to hear the views of Deputies expressed in the way they were expressed in respect to post-war problems and to the men who joined the Army and gave their services throughout the emergency.  I can assure those Deputies that I am at one with them in their desires and hopes to do well by those men, and that every member of the Government shares those views.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not.  If I were to give a figure it would simply be a guess.  It has been suggested in the House that we may find great difficulty in securing the services of large numbers of those men.  The suggestion made was that their great need was to get out of the Army.  Personally, I doubt that very much.  As I said in my opening statement, I feel pretty sure that a large number of the young men who joined the Army for the emergency have developed a taste for Army life and will probably re-enlist.</P>
    </Speaker>

Would the Minister give an assurance that the House will have an opportunity of discussing the White Paper so that the Government will be able to get the views of all Parties on the proposals contained in it?  The Minister says that the Government wants to treat those who will be demobilised generously.  If that view is shared by all Parties, and I think it is, then I think the Government might very well afford an opportunity to the House of hearing the views of all Parties before it finally comes to a decision on the proposals for compensation or maintenance which it intends to apply.  Can we have an assurance from the Minister that the House will not be presented with a cut and dried scheme of an irrevocable character, and that we will get an opportunity of expressing our views to the Government on the treatment to be afforded to those who will be demobilised?</P>

      <P>In the debate on the motion for the adjournment a few months ago, to which I have referred, when a question was raised by Deputy Cosgrave I told him on that occasion that when the proposals had reached the stage when the Government were satisfied that they were producing something that could be submitted to another body, it was the intention to submit them to the Defence Conference before putting them before the Dáil.  I thought that was the better way of doing the thing at the time. Deputy Cosgrave had asked me to produce these proposals to the Dáil. That was the suggestion I made then, <Col N="1390" /> and it still stands.  The proposals can be examined and the views of the members of the Defence Conference can be heard on them and can be submitted to the Government.  As to whether the Government will accept or adjust the plans they have already made, the Deputy, I am sure, does not expect me here and now to give a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer.  I can only speak for myself on that question.  I think that what I have suggested is the better way of dealing with this matter: that when the proposals are ready they can be submitted to the Defence Conference.  It can examine them in the same way that it examines the Defence Estimates.  The Defence Conference represents the views of the whole House, and if the members of it are satisfied with the proposals, or if they feel that they have other proposals to make themselves, well that is the place to make them, and they can then be considered by the Government.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That in view of the fact that main roads throughout the country are now national highways and arteries of transport, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that their construction and maintainence should be made a national charge&mdash;(Deputies Finucane and Beirne.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, Mr. Childers, gave us some information of a very elaborate road plan that is being prepared at the present time.  It appears that we are contemplating the provision of double tracks and bicycle tracks and means of by-passing towns, the ultimate idea being the speeding up of traffic generally. The Parliamentary Secretary gave us a good deal of information on that matter but he was reluctant to give any idea of the cost.  We got no indication of the estimated cost of this elaborate trunk road policy for the whole country.  Evidently the Parliamentary Secretary was prepared to do everything but pay for the work.  I suppose on another occasion we will get detailed information about that aspect of the scheme.</P>
      <P>In the matter of road planning, the Minister for Local Government should bear in mind that elaborate plans must be related to the national income.  The first consideration is the preservation and improvement, where possible, of the national income.  We must pay for elaborate road development out of the national income.  Therefore such plans are to a great extent in the air until we can be satisfied that we are in a position to provide the necessary capital for construction and maintenance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary informed the House that in some counties the work involved would be much <Col N="1392" /> greater than in others because the roads are narrower in some counties than in others.  The Parliamentary Secretary indicated that the Minister was not prepared to accept the motion, to make the construction and maintenance of main roads a national charge.  I do not think his arguments in that respect were very convincing. He tried to argue that they served mainly individual counties and, for that purpose, he was rather wise in selecting counties in the West of Ireland, such as Mayo.  I suggest that counties in the vicinity of a big city like Dublin act as corridors, carrying huge traffic to and from the city.  The volume of outside traffic passing over these roads is far greater than the volume of internal traffic is likely to be.</P>
    <P>I think the 1926 Act is completely obsolete in regard to the financing of the reconstruction and maintenance of roads.  The local authority secures grants on the basis of the amount of money that is spent on maintenance and development and they have no authority to direct that sums of money allocated for road development should be spent on the smaller roads, the byroads and link roads in the county. That would not indicate that the requirements of the individual county so far as road provision is considered in this respect.  One can understand that when the 1926 Act was passed the roads were in a shocking condition and road reorganisation was an urgent problem. The Act proposed to develop main arteries first.  While Deputies from the West complain that even their main roads are still in poor condition they fail to appreciate that the counties that are best served at the present time are counties that availed of the 1926 Act to the fullest extent to reconstruct, develop and maintain their main roads, and that the counties that neglected to develop and reconstruct at that time and that have been carrying on, more or less, on a maintenance basis, did not get the full benefit of the Act.  I suggest that the Act is, in our present circumstances, more or less obsolete and that new legislation is required in respect of roads.  The financial conditions that applied at the time of the passing of the 1926 Act do not apply <Col N="1393" /> to-day because of the development that has taken place.</P>
    <P>In considering this matter, we might anticipate a much heavier volume of traffic in the post-war period and, of course, we must plan in anticipation of a substantial development in vehicular traffic.  We may find that Córas Iompair Eireann may switch over to road traffic to a greater extent in the post-war period.  We must realise the tremendous advantage, in a small country like this, that road traffic has over any other form of transport.  It is more expeditious and far more flexible than any other form of traffic. Goods can be collected at the point of production and delivered direct to the consumer, eliminating handling charges and expediting delivery. Although road transport may be the most costly method, it is certainly the most expeditious and most flexible method.  Rail services may be far cheaper over very long distances but for short distances road transport has all the advantages.  It is not at all unlikely that the new company may develop road transport to a far greater extent than pre-war.  That all goes to show that it is a national service which is likely to develop and that you cannot justify, in the development of national arteries to carry that national transport service, one particular section of the community bearing the charge.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the Parliamentary Secretary, too when he talks about the Road Fund, that a substantial portion of that Fund has been consistently appropriated by the Minister for Finance from year to year to help him in his Budget difficulties.  Surely when we tax motor vehicles, motor fuel, etc., that taxation ought to be devoted in its entirety to road maintenance and development.  I fail to see how anyone can justify charging the national highways against a particular section of the community, particularly the agricultural community.  I would be inclined to go very much farther than the motion and say that we should not tax land at all; that land is the most precious raw material we have in the country.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to point out one <Col N="1394" /> other instance where the raw material of any other industry is taxed.</P>
    <P>Here we have a very heavy tax on the raw material of an industry.  Why should that raw material be taxed?  If we expect maximum production from and maximum use of a particular raw material in the national interest, surely it is injudicious to burden it with a heavy tax.  I am referring to the local rates which are predominantly subscribed by the agricultural community. They are a direct tax on land. Very often the taxation bears no relation at all to the income accruing to the individual farmer.  Again, if you compare, in many cases, the charge arising out of local taxation on a certain type of agricultural holding with the income from that holding and compare that again with the income earned by other citizens living in houses with nominal valuations&mdash;very often a big business is carried on in a rather small house in rural Ireland&mdash; or by professional men living in houses with a nominal valuation and using the roads sometimes to a greater extent than the small farmer uses them, there is no relation at all to the imposition so far as the local rates are concerned. There is no justification for a man living on the land and using the raw material of the land in the national interest being mulcted in a special way for the upkeep of the national highways. As I say, I would go much farther than the motion if I were putting down a motion on this particular matter.</P>
    <P>We have been talking about production and selling our surpluses and about using our surpluses as an exchange medium for essential imports. We have to sell in a market up against our doors in competition with British farmers and Northern Ireland farmers whose land is free of taxation. That is a very considerable advantage in a world where competition has made prices so keen and where profit margins are invariably narrow, and any extra burden placed on one competitor as against another very often has the effect of knocking out one of the competitors. We should bear that in mind. While I think the agricultural community generally should bear their fair <Col N="1395" /> share of the cost of local administration and the cost of maintenance of roads, there should be an equitable distribution of the charge necessary for local administration and road upkeep.  I do not think the present method is an equitable method of financing road services. We support the motion.  I think that we should remove any sort of charge that is a direct tax on the land, and that is what local rates are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The demand made in this motion is a moderate one.  As Deputy Hughes said, perhaps it errs on the side of moderation.  We have been attacking the forces of the Department of Finance and the Government in various ways.  Sometimes we put forward our full demands; sometimes we try to entice them along to meet us by putting forward a moderate claim.  In this motion we have put forward a very moderate claim.  We have asked that the main roads, which are a very small fraction of the total roads of the country, shall become a complete national charge. The central authority at present is contributing considerably towards the upkeep of main roads.  We are asking that they should go the whole way and make them a national charge.  The Parliamentary Secretary (Deputy Childers) spoke against this motion; at least, I presume he was speaking against it.  He gave the House a lot of very useful information and a lot of impressive figures.  But, as far as I could see, he did not put forward any logical or coherent argument against the motion.  His speech reminded me in many ways of a christening party which arrives with great pomp and ceremony at the church door, to find when they get there that they have overlooked bringing along the baby. The Parliamentary Secretary certainly did not bring along any logical or constructive argument why this motion should not be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case for this motion rests on three main grounds.  The first is that the main roads are not a local service in any sense or meaning of the word. They are a national service in every <Col N="1396" /> sense and meaning of the word.  The second is that the burden of the cost of road maintenance at present is not equitably distributed over the different counties.  Some counties have to bear an excessive share of the cost of maintaining main roads.  The third is that the burden of cost is not equitably distributed over the various sections of the community.</P>
    <P>The main roads are a national service, something like the Army or the postal and telegraph system.  They bring into touch with one another citizens of all parts of the State, just as the postal service does.  The burden of traffic in some counties is much heavier than in others.  In recent years, owing to mechanically propelled vehicles being the larger proportion of road transport, a new position has arisen.  Years ago, transport on the main roads consisted chiefly of horse-drawn vehicles, but now we have motor vehicles carrying traffic from one end of the State to another, that is to say, in normal times we had cars, lorries and vans setting out from Dublin and delivering passengers and goods in every village and townland throughout the State.  If there is one national service in existence, it surely is that provided by our main roads as the arteries of traffic.</P>
    <P>A new State monopoly for the conveyance of goods and passengers has been set up and, apparently, it is determined to divert traffic more and more to the roads in preference to railways.  As Deputy Hughes pointed out, it is very hard to see a permanent future for a railway system, in a country such as ours with a fairly large area and a sparse population.  There is, I think, a short verse on a headstone in Glasnevin: &ldquo;Here rests until the judgment day the remains of Uncle Jack, but no matter how you sound your horn, the tram stays on the track&rdquo;.  The handicap under which the tramcar suffers applies also to the railways.  The railway locomotive cannot get off the track; it cannot deliver goods right to the consumer's door from the farm or factory where they are produced. It cannot do that, and so traffic will be diverted eventually more and <Col N="1397" /> more to the roads, which link up every citizen from door to door, linking the factory with the farm and the farm with the retail shops in the city.  Therefore, we can see that the roads are going to play an increasingly large part in our transport system and that they will be a national service to an increasing extent.</P>
    <P>The burden of the traffic is not equally distributed over different counties. That has been stressed by other speakers.  We can all realise that the main road passing through Meath, Kildare, and the centre of Ireland and on to the West, carries a large amount of traffic which does not serve any useful purpose to the counties themselves.</P>
    <P>The last point is that the present system of financing road maintenance by the local authority is unfair, and implies an unfair distribution of the burden as between one citizen and another. If a citizen happens to own a comparatively small dwelling, but has a large income from some pension, salary or dividend from foreign investments, he pays a very small contribution to the upkeep of the local service; whereas a farmer might have a comparatively high valuation but a very small income, and he is taxed for local services, not upon his income but upon the rateable valuation of his property. That system is obsolete and must be abolished.  One way to approach its abolition is to secure that as many as possible of what are now described as local services be transferred to the State.</P>
    <P>We are asking in this motion, therefore, that the roads be transferred from the local authorities to the State.  In this connection the Parliamentary Secretary trotted out a very hoary old argument.  He said that if we take the main roads off the local rates, it will mean imposing new taxation in order to finance them.  He went on to indicate the particular commodities which might be taxed, and mentioned sugar and tobacco.  He was about to mention tea, but some member of the Opposition asked why he should not include tea, so he was anticipated.  If we look back over the records of this House, we find that the very same argument was used by Deputy Ernest <Col N="1398" /> Blythe when he was Minister for Finance.  He said that the derating of agricultural land would mean putting a tax on tea, sugar, and tobacco.</P>
    <P>The same argument has been trotted out again and again during the last 15 years, every time a demand is made for some relief for the local ratepayer. It is getting a bit too old now and it is time the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister devised some new slogan with which to sidetrack demands on behalf of the rural ratepayers.  I think no argument has been put forward against this motion and, as it is a moderate one, it should be accepted by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion, as the constituency I represent is the gateway for the tourist traffic to the South of Ireland.  During the emergency we have maintained a pre-war rate for the upkeep of our main and trunk roads.  The rate at present is something like one-third of the combined rate for the full maintenance of the roads.</P>
      <P>I disagree with the Parliamentary Secretary on the case he was trying to make as to why the main roads should not be nationalised.  One of his arguments was that, if we nationalise the main roads, it may require extra staff, including extra engineers.  That would not happen.  All we are asking is that the State contribute 100 per cent. instead of the 40 per cent. contributed to the local body for the upkeep of main and trunk roads.  Therefore only the present staff will be required to carry out the orders, under the direction and supervision of the Roads Section in the Local Government Department. It is one of the sections that gives great assistance and co-operation to members of public boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with some of the remarks made here by Deputies speaking for the motion, to the effect that engineers come along to-day and allow a turn to be taken away and later find out that something extra happens in the following year.  I have not that experience, because very many of those dangerous turns have been <Col N="1399" /> removed in my constituency, and I will say our engineers and our public bodies have received the co-operation and advice of the Government Department.</P>
    <P>I think County Wicklow should receive exceptional treatment from the Local Government Department.  I maintain that the tourist who travels by bus or by train is of greater benefit to our county than the type of tourists we have experience of, who merely bring their lunches in a basket in their motor cars from Dublin and other places.  These people flock to the seaside or to some of our inland beauty spots and all we have from them are the empty bottles thrown on the roadside. There is no money left in the place by people who motor like that through the county.  For that reason no argument can be put up that County Wicklow is benefiting from the tourist traffic.  The hotels may benefit when there are no motors running.</P>
    <P>It often struck me, why should the farmer living on the mountainside have to contribute towards roads he never sees or uses?  These roads are no benefit in the world to the men living up on the hills.  Many of these men are unable to bring their cart-loads of corn or hay to their residences.  If the public bodies were relieved of paying for the upkeep of the main roads, they could devote some of the money for the improvement of the by-roads and the county roads convenient to the residences of the agricultural community and in that way give these people some of the benefits that are derived by people living close to the trunk roads and in urban areas.  You will have to encourage public bodies by taking over things not essential to the majority of the people of a particular county, such as main roads, and allowing them to increase the social services.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, no matter what Party you may have on a public body, they will not vote freely, even though it may be for social services, to increase further the burden on the agricultural community.  The rates in my constituency are 13/6, less the agricultural <Col N="1400" /> grant, but the valuations are very high. You may have a farm in Mayo, as was pointed out by the Parliamentary Secretary, with a valuation of £1 or £2.  A labourer's cottage in Wicklow would have a much higher valuation.  Therefore, there is a greater burden on the people in County Wicklow, because of the higher valuation and the higher rates.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any reason why the Government should not give the full 100 per cent. for the main and trunk roads&mdash;make them a national charge. I am putting up a case for my own constituency. We have a bigger grievance than any other constituency, and for that reason we should be given exceptional treatment.  Our county is the gateway for all the tourists for the south of Ireland.  At the present time the roads have to be maintained for the purpose of carrying timber and other fuel to the City of Dublin.  We are not receiving any extra grant from the Government in that connection.  I am not so worried about not being able to procure tar, because I believe some other arrangements could be made to give a suitable road other than a tar macadam road.</P>
    <P>I wish the Government would consider this matter seriously.  It is not a Party matter.  I know men from all Parties who have advocated the nationalisation of trunk and main roads for many years.  Let the motorists who use the roads for pleasure pay for them out of their own taxation.  That can be done in view of the amount that will be received from motorists in post-war days.  It can be taken out of the Road Fund, and not have that fund going each year to relieve the Budget.</P>
    <P>We are being frightened, as Deputy Cogan pointed out, by all the things that we are told will happen&mdash;increasing the cost of necessaries of life and other things like that.  We believe that in the Budget that will face us in the near future taxation will have to be increased, no matter what the Press or other people may say.  There is no purpose served by propaganda of that type.  We must face facts.  Taxation must be increased if we are to maintain <Col N="1401" /> our social services and meet the situation with which we will be faced in post-war days.  We must realise that £1 to-day is worth something like 6/8 in pre-war days.  What is the use of talking about an expenditure of £47,000,000 or £50,000,000 when we realise that £1 to-day is the equivalent of 6/8 four or five years ago?  The Government should have more courage and not be so much afraid of propaganda in connection with taxation.</P>
    <P>We are determined to proceed with the reform to which I have referred. We believe that it is an injustice to the men who never have seen or used these roads.  It would be better to have this made a national charge than have one small section of the community, as I have indicated, paying £52,000 for the upkeep of these roads. That is a huge sum for a small and poor county to bear.  We must face the fact that taxation will be increased and we cannot otherwise have social services or give greater benefits to the people or carry out some of the schemes that are in contemplation. The Government should give this concession to the people who will be asked to bear the burden in the near future&mdash;that is, the people living outside the towns.</P>
    <P>I give my wholehearted support to this motion.  It is not to-day or yesterday that I was converted to this proposal. I have always put up the case, even to past Governments, that Wicklow should get exceptional treatment, because that county is the gateway for the tourists going to the South of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is undoubtedly a very popular motion.  It is the privilege of Opposition Deputies to set down all these nice things which they would like to see carried out.  We used to do it in our day, and, if I were in Opposition to-morrow, I would put down a motion to the effect that all rates should be taken over by the central authority.  It would be the most popular proposal in the world, but, in dealing with these matters, the Minister for Finance must cut his cloth <Col N="1402" /> according to the measure of his finances.  It is all very well to say that taxation must go up and that social services must be maintained.  We have done pretty well in the matter of social services.  As the Minister for Finance pointed out earlier, a sum of £15,000,000 has already been poured out for this purpose.</P>
      <P>I am afraid that the plan of the Deputy responsible for this motion for getting over the difficulty put up by the Parliamentary Secretary is a bad plan. If, for instance, 100 per cent. of the cost of main roads is to be sent to each county council, there would be pretty hot competition in extravagance, to my mind.  I have seen in the Cork County Council county roads starved for a number of years because of the 40 per cent. refund of expenditure on main and trunk roads.  At the same time, we are faced with the position that the rates are becoming more and more of a problem for the ratepayers each year. They are going up by leaps and bounds, and whatever expenditure in national taxation there is, there is three times that expenditure in local taxation, and every social service introduced brings with it a further burden to be borne by the local ratepayer.</P>
      <P>It is very hard to know where to stop.  There is, for instance, the anomaly under which portion of the constituency of Waterford is paying the rates for the poor of Cork City.  If we carried out the Deputy's plan in regard to the 100 per cent. for main roads and sent the amount down to County Wicklow, that county would be looking for three times what they are expending on main roads to-day, while Cork County would be looking for ten times the amount.  It would, as I say, become a competition in extravagance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our trouble at present is that an enormous amount of traffic has been switched to the by-roads and ordinary county roads.  We expended last year on county roads in our county £60,000 more than we expended ten years ago, and the roads are 60 per cent. worse than they were ten years ago, in spite of that expenditure, because a new class of traffic has been switched on to the by-roads which these by-roads were <Col N="1403" /> never intended to take.  Turf lorries and heavy lorries to the creameries have been switched to the by-roads which were made for horses and butts, and our main problem for the past few years in regard to main roads in Cork is what we are to do with them at all. They were not made for horse traffic and the position to-day is that traffic which, for ten years or so before the war, went largely by lorry into Cork City has now to be carried by horses, for which the roads are unsuited.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the job done but, as I say, it is the duty of the Minister for Finance to provide the money, and if something is required which would be of more benefit, it must be spent for that purpose.  It is the privilege of an Opposition Deputy to set down what he would like to see done and to pile it on as much as he likes, but it is the Government's duty to find the money.  I should like to see not alone main roads but other matters as well made a national charge.  I personally think that the burden falling on the agricultural community year after year in the shape of rates is one which has already become too heavy and which must be reduced, but so far as this motion is concerned it is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance to find out whether the money can be provided or not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important matter for the ratepayers, for the farming community and for everybody who contributes to the funds for the maintenance of local administration. For a great many years, the rates in every county have been increasing steadily, although one of the present Government's many and varied promises was that local rates would be considerably reduced when they got into office.  It is a well-known fact that the maintenance and making of roads, even with the State contribution, have to a very great extent increased the rates in every county because better roads were required both by order of the Local Government Department and by necessity.  The traffic was there and had to be provided for.  Ten or <Col N="1404" /> 12 years ago, bus traffic on the roads was very slight, while to-day the bus and heavy lorry are carrying traffic previously carried by the railway company. This has a very serious effect on the life of any road and, therefore, greater charges for their maintenance are made upon local authorities.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that the Government provides so much of the expenditure and the local rates only so much, and when the Parliamentary Secretary, on the basis of this new plan of Fianna Fáil, multiplies the sum expended on roads over the period of ten years, the Government contribution is made to look very big, but the Parliamentary Secretary omitted to say what the contribution from the local authorities was or to multiply it by ten.</P>
      <P>He tells us, however, at column 979 of the Official Reports of last week, that the State contributed £11,000,000 out of a total expenditure on roads of £25,000,000.  Are we to take it that the balance represents the amount contributed by local authorities?  I think it is a reasonable assumption.  When motor taxation was introduced, the purpose was to provide for the maintenance and making of roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a later stage, when the 4d. a gallon was put on petrol, the object of the tax was that it should be applied to the improvement of the roads. When the farming community protested against the expenditure on road work, the argument used against them and the ratepayers was that they contributed very little to road expenditure. It was urged that the motorist was in reality contributing sufficient to maintain the roads, by the £1 per unit horse-power on his car, by the 4d. on petrol, later increased to 8d.  The case was made that if these sums were put into the Road Fund and were expended on the roads they would be sufficient to relieve the local authorities of all responsibility for road maintenance. Everybody knows, of course, that the Minister for Finance raided the Road Fund, and that the money that went into the Exchequer from motorists was applied to other purposes than road maintenance, the result being that the <Col N="1405" /> ratepayers were left to carry the baby. It is no argument for the Minister for Local Government to say: &ldquo;Oh, look at all that we contribute.&rdquo;  During the emergency a new traffic has come on the roads, so that, notwithstanding the expenditure on them, they are deteriorating seriously.  A great portion of the main road from Dublin to the West is pot-holed.  It is so bad that it is almost impossible to drive a car over it at any sort of speed.  Even if one observes the speed regulations laid down by an emergency Order one runs the risk of breaking a spring in a car. This is a matter which I suggest the Government should consider seriously.</P>
    <P>I admit that the local people get a great deal of use from the roads in their counties, and I do not suggest that they should be relieved of all responsibility for road maintenance. My suggestion is that they should be relieved of responsibility for the roads that are a national service&mdash;those carrying bus services, lorries, and so on.  They are the main or trunk roads and should be a national charge.  The railway company, for example, has to maintain the railway line, and it might be argued that it is of great benefit to the farmers living in the districts through which it runs.  When the farmer pays his fare on a bus or transport charges to Córas Iompair Eireann for carrying his produce, I submit that he has already contributed an amount which should cover the maintenance of the roads over which the vehicles so utilised travel.  The total expenditure for the maintenance of the main and trunk roads should be covered, in my opinion, by contributions from the Road Fund, in the first place, and secondly by those public utility bodies which are utilising the roads for their own benefit.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for Deputy Corry to say that it is easy for the Opposition to put down popular motions.  I do not know that that comes very well from any member of the Fianna Fáil Party. The members of that Party have put down motions themselves that they thought would be popular.  In a great many cases they were put down for the purpose of currying favour with the <Col N="1406" /> electorate.  I suggest that this motion has been put down by the Farmers' Party because they are carrying the responsibility to the greatest extent. The farmer in the rural area now finds that his rates are going up year by year.  Take Kerry, for example, the banner county, one might say, of the Fianna Fáil Party.  The rates there are something like 24/- in the £.  How the people pay such a rate beats me. In the old prophecy we were told that the rates would be higher than the rents.  We did not think that possible, but we now find that it is so.  The Parliamentary Secretary may smile with pleasure.  I do not see what pleasure it can give him to see people loaded to the ground with this weight of debt.</P>

      <P>I am astonished that they are.  The last straw, we are told, will break the camel's back, and we know that at last the worm turns.  I think we have reached the stage when the worm is going to turn at last.  In my opinion, this motion should receive the most careful consideration of the Government.  They should accept it. When, as we hope in a short time, normal road traffic is resumed, you are likely to have an inflated petrol and motor tax.  It is not unreasonable to ask that the people paying those taxes should get good roads.  The ratepayers should not be called upon to bear the cost of road construction and improvement since there is a fund, fed by the taxation that motorists pay, out of which it should be met.  Deputy Corry <Col N="1407" /> thinks this is a popular motion.  The position is that every motion is popular or unpopular with Fianna Fáil just as it suits them.  They do not want anybody to put down a motion or to do anything that does not meet with their approval.  You should not think at all unless you think according to the Fianna Fáil philosophy.</P>

      <P>That is the better word.  The attempt by nations to make people think their way, and when they did not, to liquidate them, has brought a lot of disaster on the world.  I suggest that, in justice and equity, there is sufficient money in the Road Fund to do all this maintenance and construction work on the main roads and that the local authorities should not be asked to bear that burden.  The motion does not ask the Government to take over all roads.  One would imagine from the speech made by the Parliamentary Secretary that that was the demand.  It is not.  The demand is confined to the main or trunk roads which are being used to such a large extent to-day by the utility corporations. My suggestion is that the local authorities should not be asked to contribute anything towards road maintenance until the transport company and the public utility corporation have contributed a sum for the performance of that work that will be equal in proportion to the amount they spend on the maintenance of the iron road.  It is a reasonable demand and there is justice in it.  Instead of the Government rejecting it flippantly, it should have the matter examined by a competent authority if they are not prepared to accept it now.</P>

      <P>This motion was not tabled, as Deputy Corry suggested, for a propagandist purpose.  Deputy Corry was quite frank.  He said that if he were in Opposition he would do that.  Our real purpose in tabling the motion was to have something done about the constantly increasing rates. The biggest item of expenditure in some counties is the maintenance of roads.  This matter of rates must be tackled sooner or later.  We tabled the motion with a view to putting up a concrete proposal to the Government. Rates are increasing year by year and, as Deputy MacEoin said, it took Fianna Fáil to fulfil Colmcille's prophecy.  In my young days the suggestion that the rates would be higher than the rent was considered absurd.  In County Mayo the road maintenance fund runs into over £90,000.  That applies in many other counties along the western seaboard. In counties where the valuation is very high, owing to the poor quality of the land, the rates have increased to an alarming extent.  In Kerry the rates are £1 4s. 3d.; in Mayo, almost 19/-, and there is no indication that the ceiling has been reached.  In the course of a few more years, if the present trend continues, it is not unreasonable to expect that the rates will be 30/- in the £.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Childers, used the type of propaganda that the Government Party uses every time the Farmers' Party, or any Opposition Party, moves a motion.  They try to suggest that it is a horrible motion moved by inexperienced fools, and that it is nothing more than an attempt to increase the cost of tobacco, tea and sugar.  I have heard a good deal of that sort of thing since I came into the House.  I have studied the debates that took place when war <Col N="1409" /> broke out and when it became necessary to increase the Defence Forces to a great extent.  That increase involved additional expenditure.  I could not find any suggestion in the debates by any member of the Government Party that the increased expenditure on the Army would have to come off the farmers' tea, sugar or tobacco.  The strange thing is that, according to the Government, the farmer is the finest fellow in the world as long as he pays up and says nothing.  The moment he looks for his rights, he is told that it will mean an increase in taxation.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the Minister that in this case the motion was not tabled for any purpose other than to try to keep the rates within reasonable bounds.  I believe that in the very near future something concrete will have to be done about that matter.  If something is not done, the rates will go beyond the capacity of farmers to meet them and there will be a collapse of local services.  We do not wish that to happen.  We desire to maintain the local services at the highest point of efficiency.  I think the present attitude of the Government is not helping in that direction.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary passed a very nasty remark, to the effect that the mover of the motion came from a county in which the county council had refused to strike the road estimate, or something like that.  This motion was tabled to cover every county in the Twenty-Six, and I cannot see what bearing that had on the matter.  The motion was tabled by our Party as a whole.  Deputy Finucane moved it and Deputy Beirne seconded.  I think that was a very nasty cheap attitude to adopt.</P>
    <P>Most of the points in favour of the motion have been stressed, not only by members of this Party, but by members of the other Parties, and I do not propose to go over the same ground. I do not see why the Government should not accept the motion.  It has been suggested that if the motion were accepted it would involve a special staff being engaged to administer the Road Fund.  There is no need to do that.  I think it would be a very simple <Col N="1410" /> matter to allocate a proportionate sum to each county manager, for instance, in this year, the sum that the county manager or the local authority has agreed to accept as a reasonable amount.  The extra staff that would involve, in my opinion, would not exceed 12 officials.  There is no need to set up a whole department to deal with that one matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes, I think, said that the western counties were in a happy position compared with Kildare and other counties, which he described as corridor counties.  That is all very well.  It is true that there is light traffic in the western counties inasmuch as we are not situated in the middle of the highways, so to speak, and have not to carry traffic for other counties, but we have other factors to contend with that do not obtain in counties east of the Shannon.  For instance, we are subject to very heavy rainfall. I suppose water is the biggest enemy of road surfaces, next to traffic.  We have to contend with a high cost of laying down and maintaining roads. If we have to carry on under the present system, not only will the maintenance of roads collapse, but all the local services will collapse.</P>
    <P>Farmers have contributed wonderfully during this emergency, and they have suffered greatly as a result of lack of foresight on the part of certain Ministers in many ways.  They have contributed by the production of food and fuel.  It has been suggested that County Kerry and counties in the West have done well out of the turf business. I do not think they have.  As a matter of fact, there will be further discussion about that matter in the near future, and it will be proved that if people can produce turf at 15/- or 16/- a ton, it should be capable of being sold in the city at a price less than 64/- a ton.  I do not think the farmers have got such a lot of the fat.</P>
    <P>I think the motion should be accepted by the Government, and should be put into operation as a first step in the direction of trying to reduce the rates.  As I have said, in some counties the rates are high because the land is poor.  In other counties the rates are low&mdash;9/6 in Meath&mdash;<Col N="1411" /> and I think Deputy Everett said that in Wicklow the rates are 13/6 in the £. No matter what rate is struck, the farmers have to bear a fairly equal burden, irrespective of the county they live in.  The situation will have to be faced, and I think the motion should <Col N="1412" /> be taken on its face value by the Government and put into operation.</P>
    <P>Motion put and negatived.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 4.40 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 21st March, 1945.</P>
