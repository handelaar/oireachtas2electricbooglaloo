      <P>The provisions of Section 14 (b) of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1939, referred to by the Deputy, empower the Irish Tourist Board to build, establish, equip or operate hotels, guesthouses, holiday hostels, holiday homes, youth hostels and holiday camps or to assist financially (including by way of loan) or otherwise in the building, establishing, equipping or operating thereof.  The procedure under the Act requires that any proposals for building, establishing, equipping or operating hotels must be submitted to me by the Irish Tourist Board for my recommendation before money can be provided by the Minister for Finance.  Before making a recommendation to the Minister for Finance I would give due consideration to possible effects on existing registered hotels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state, in relation to manufactured goods for which wholesale and/or retail prices are fixed under Orders made by him, the basis on which such prices are fixed, distinguishing between the several types of commodities in relation to which such powers are exercised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The general basis for fixing wholesale and retail prices is to add to the cost of manufactured goods the margins ruling before the emergency where such margins were considered reasonable.  It has, however, sometimes been necessary to modify these margins to meet emergency conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="748" /> The commodities over which price control has been exercised may be divided broadly into two types.  The first is that in which a flat price can be fixed for the manufacturer and includes such commodities as flour, butter, cheese, margarine, fertilisers, etc.</P>
    <P>The second is that in which the products are of such a wide variety that it would be impossible to fix individual prices for each.  This group consists in the main of cloth, clothing and footwear.  In this group the profits of manufacturers are controlled by arrangement and the prices charged by wholesalers and retailers are determined by adding a fixed percentage to the prices charged by manufacturers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say what the fixed percentage is?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it true that, after the Minister has fixed the allowed margin of profit, and the goods have been stamped with the fixed price in the case of boots and footwear, that certain of the footwear that has been manufactured to be sold at a subsidised price to necessitous persons is now, on the instructions of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, being sold at the fixed price to persons who are not in receipt of assistance at all, thus cutting right across the arrangement made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in respect of fixed prices for footwear?</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Reduction of Profit Margin.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether, during the past six months, the profit margin allowable in respect of certain manufactured goods has been reduced by Order or other powers exercised by him; and if he <Col N="749" /> will indicate the classes of commodities affected by such Orders and in each case the extent of the profit margin allowed (a) six months ago, and (b) at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The profit margins on a considerable range of commodities have been reduced in the past six months.  The commodities include cloth, clothing, footwear, leather, biscuits, cocoa, tyres and tubes, dry batteries, soap, tin boxes, agricultural machinery, pipe lead, electric lamps and asbestos slates.</P>
      <P>The margins of profit of wholesalers and retailers of cloth, clothing and footwear are fixed by Order.  For both wholesalers and retailers there are generally two margins, the higher being the normal margin while the lower margin is in respect of articles in the lower price ranges.  The wholesale margin on home-manufactured clothing has been recently reduced from 19½ per cent. and 18½ per cent. on cost to a flat margin of 18 per cent. on cost.  The wholesale margin on home-manufactured footwear has been revised from 18 per cent. and 16¼ per cent. to a flat rate of 16½ per cent. on cost.  The wholesale margin on sole leather has been reduced from 25 per cent. on cost to 20 per cent. on cost.</P>
      <P>Retail margins on home-manufactured cloth, clothing and footwear have been reduced from 40 per cent. and 30 per cent. on cost to 35 per cent. and 27½ per cent. on cost.  The retail margins on imported cloth and clothing have been reduced from 50 per cent. and 33? per cent. on cost to 40 per cent. and 30 per cent. on cost respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The profit margins allowed to manufacturers are not uniform but vary according to the particular circumstances of each industry or of each individual manufacturer.  Continuous supervision is exercised on manufacturers' prices and profits and accounts of individual manufacturers are examined regularly.  Any variation in manufacturers' profit margins are reflected in the ultimate price to the public.  Reductions have been effected in the prices of the products of certain <Col N="750" /> manufacturers during the past six months.  It is not possible, however, to state the average margin allowed six months ago or at the present date.</P>
    <P>In addition the prices of certain goods have been reduced by from 5 per cent. to 25 per cent. including biscuits, cocoa, tyres and tubes, dry batteries, soap, tin boxes, agricultural machinery, pipe lead, electric lamps and asbestos slates.  These reductions in price involve the equivalent reductions in the margins taken by manufacturers and distributors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that certain firms are able to sell commodities at less than what is described as the controlled price and apparently can do that without any serious impairment to their finances, will the Minister consider a further review of the profit margins with a view to ensuring that other firms are not allowed to charge higher prices than their competitors can apparently exist on by charging?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The margins which we have fixed are, in our opinion, reasonable. It is, of course, open to any firm to sell below the fixed price or on reduced margins.  It is not an uncommon practice for business firms to cut the price of individual lines in order to attract custom or to convey the impression that their general prices are lower than those of other firms.  Some firms have a policy of working on a small margin on a large turn-over, while other firms cannot do that.  It is not possible to make regulations applying to the circumstances of each individual firm.  The margins fixed relate to the trade as a whole and are the maximum margins which are considered reasonable to allow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that it is an age-old policy of large combines or large distributing units deliberately to try and eliminate the individual competitor by means of murdering the price until such time as the individual competitor is smashed and then the large combine or unit has a free field in which to charge what it pleases?</P>

So far as duty-free licences are concerned, as the Deputy is no doubt aware, these are issued not by my Department but by the Revenue Commissioners on my recommendation.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the average pay received by the temporary staff at Ballsbridge; why they are not allowed a cost-of-living bonus and war bonus as other civil servants; and, further, if he is prepared to consider their case with a view to granting them a bonus.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy's question refers to the temporary staff employed by the Department of Industry and Commerce at Ballsbridge.  The following classes of temporary staff are employed in that Department at Ballsbridge: temporary male clerks, temporary female clerical assistants, temporary inspectors, temporary professional accountants.  Temporary female clerical assistants and temporary male clerks receive both cost-of-living bonus and emergency bonus, in addition to basic pay.  The total remuneration of female temporary clerical assistants at present is 48/11 (unmarried) and 50/11 (widows) per week.  The total remuneration of temporary male clerks after one year's service is 79/11 (unmarried) and 81/11 (married) per week.  The temporary inspectors and temporary professional accountants, who receive inclusive salaries, are also paid, in accordance with the general practice, emergency bonus, if their total remuneration is less than £500 per year.</P>
      <P>The position is, therefore, that all but a few of the temporary staff employed at Ballsbridge are at present in receipt of cost-of-living bonus and emergency bonus and the remainder receive emergency bonus unless their remuneration amounts to £500 a year or over.  In the circumstances, no further action appears to be necessary.</P>
      <P>In view of the different grades of temporary staff employed, and their varying duties, no useful purpose would appear to be served by calculating the average pay of the temporary staff in question.</P>

    <P>The normal retiring ages for officers above these ranks have not yet been fixed.</P>
    <P>The age limits mentioned will come into operation for officers of the Forces on the 1st October, 1946.  For officers of the Reserve they will come into operation as from the 1st April, 1946, except in certain instances, specified in Defence Force Regulations, in which they will operate as from an earlier date.  The normal retiring ages for officers of the Forces are not for the present being applied to officers appointed in 1933 and 1934 as area administrative officers of the Volunteer Force or to officers of the Marine Service commissioned during the emergency. The normal retiring ages may be extended by ten years, subject to an overriding age limit of 65 years, in the case of an officer who possesses professional or technical qualifications in respect of which, for five years prior to the date of attainment to the normal retiring age for his rank, he has been in receipt of a special rate of pay or <Col N="769" /> additional pay under Defence Force Regulations.</P>
    <P>The normal retiring ages already mentioned for officers of the Forces were originally prescribed by Defence Force Regulation on the 23rd June, 1938.  They were to have come into operation as from the 1st October, 1938, but for administrative reasons and because of the circumstances of the particular time, this date was extended, first to the 23rd June, 1939, then to the 23rd June, 1940, and again to the 1st October, 1940.  At that stage, owing to the expansion of the Defence Forces, the retirement of trained officers was undesirable and the operation of the retiring ages was suspended until further notice.  By a Defence Force Regulation dated 1st October, 1945, it has now been provided that, as already stated, they will come into operation as from the 1st October, 1946.  The ages at which officers of the Reserve will be required to relinquish their commissions were only recently prescribed.</P>
    <P>The original regulation provided that, as in the case of officers with professional or technical qualifications, the normal retiring ages might be extended by ten years, subject to an overriding age limit of 65 years, for stores officers, quartermasters who were accounting officers for stores, officers of the Supply and Transport Service and officers of the Military Police Service, provided that their retention was approved by the Minister for Defence as being in the best interests of the service.  Under a recent amending regulation the extension is now confined to officers with professional or technical qualifications in respect of which special rates of pay or additional pay are issuable.</P>
    <P>The amending regulation, made on the 21st June, 1940, which extended the operative date of the retiring ages to the 1st October, 1940, also provided that until the 1st October, 1945, the retiring ages for officers of the following ranks who had served continuously as members of the Forces from a date prior to the 1st October, 1924, should, subject to certain conditions, be:&mdash;</P>

      <Col N="770" /> This amendment was intended to enable officers of the category mentioned to render longer service for retired pay purposes.

      <P>The Deputy is suffering from some misunderstanding which I cannot fathom.  Normally, no officer will be going out at 45 years of age as a result of these regulations.  By instructions from me, many of these men were retained in the service for many years beyond the prescribed age limits.  They would have gone out, and were, as a matter of fact, going out, early in 1940, but, because of the emergency circumstances which had arisen, I, as I mentioned in my reply to the Deputy's question, extended the period of their service, until eventually I decided it would be better to keep them on for the period of the emergency.  Most of the men affected by these regulations are several years over the prescribed age limit.</P>

These men are being paid on the acting rank and not on their substantive rank, and I do not think any officers will be affected by reason of the acting rank as against the substantive rank.  The people who are of acting rank will still have a number of years to go, and in the very near future all these acting ranks will be disappearing&mdash;they will either be made of substantive rank or they will go back to their normal rank.</P>

      <P>The Minister spoke of avoidable hardship in connection with the cases of officers referred to by the Leader of the Opposition.  He said that no avoidable hardships would be imposed.  May I inquire from the Minister if he imagines that any part of the House&mdash;the Minister himself least of all&mdash;desires that any of these officers should suffer any hardship?  If anachronistic circumstances have arisen under the general regulations which are going to impose hardships on individuals, would he not consider looking into the matter and taking a limited authority into his own hands, or putting it into the hands of some individual in the Army, to alleviate <Col N="774" /> individual cases where the regulations press unduly heavily upon individuals owing to the peculiar circumstances in which those individuals served their time in the Army?

Normally, these men should have gone out at the end of the emergency.  I did not ask them to go out like that, and I applied to the Minister for Finance for permission to allow them to remain in the Army for a further 12 months if they so desired.  The Minister for Finance granted my application. Therefore, I can see no hardship whatever arising in respect of any of the officers in question at the moment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>The Emergency Powers (No. 169) Order, 1942, as amended, prohibits, except in certain specified cases, the cutting down or uprooting of or the removal of branches from any trees standing not more than 30 feet from the centre of any road.  It also empowers certain commanding officers of the Defence Forces to issue notices in their areas prohibiting the cutting down or uprooting of or removal of branches from any trees standing more than 30 feet from the centre of any road.  The Order and the amending Order were made by the Government for military reasons.  They remain in force but all notices served by commanding officers with regard to trees standing more than 30 feet from the centre of a road have been withdrawn.</P>
      <P>I am not yet in a position to say when the Order will be revoked.  Consideration is, in fact, at present being given to the question of whether the provisions of the Order relating to roadside trees should be incorporated in permanent legislation.  The extensive felling of roadside trees created a serious military problem prior to the making of the Order and that fact has to be borne in mind in relation to the future.  It may be possible to achieve the desired result otherwise than by the retention of the provisions of the Order in permanent legislation.  As I have said, the matter is under consideration and a decision will be taken at the earliest possible date.  It is not proposed, in the meantime, to revoke the Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 40 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>It is understandable that some dissatisfaction may be caused by the fixing of age limits which will eliminate from the Local Defence Force some members who have given good service during the emergency, but it must be recognised that an upper age limit for such a force is necessary if it is to maintain its military efficiency.  I am satisfied that the upper age limits fixed are not unreasonably low having regard to the standard of physical fitness required and to the need for vigorous leadership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the points raised about farewell functions and disbandment, the Deputies seem to be under a misapprehension.  Unlike the L.S.F., <Col N="780" /> the Local Defence Force is not being disbanded and it is anticipated that the majority of its present members will continue in membership when the force is organised under the Defence Forces Acts.  In the circumstances, the occasion for an official farewell social function will not be provided although units will, of course, be free to organise local functions on their own initiative where the circumstances suggest their desirability.  I should also like to make it clear that members of the force are at present quite free to resign on giving the notice required in the regulations for the force but, of course, the national interest would be better served if all present members who are eligible decided to continue in the force under the new conditions, and I would like to avail of this opportunity to repeat my recent appeal to all members, irrespective of age, to continue in membership until the reorganisation plan is put into effect.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy is under a misapprehension. I said I would consider any case made for the exclusion of this provision from the Bill.  I have thought over it, and I think it is quite a desirable thing to have that right vested in members of the Oireachtas. If any five members of the Oireachtas think that a book ought not to have been banned, I think it is quite right that they should have the right to appeal.  It may not be a thing that would happen very often; I do not think it would.  Generally, I imagine it would be the publisher or the author who would appeal, if there were to be any appeal at all, but we can visualise a case in which a book written or published by people outside the jurisdiction of this State might be banned, and the author or publisher might take no interest in that at all, while there might be a considerable volume of opinion here that the particular book ought not to have been banned. In a case like that&mdash;it may not be likely to occur very often, or perhaps it may not occur at all&mdash;I can see no reason in the world why representative people, such as members of the Oireachtas, should not have the right to have the question settled by the appeal board.  It is really an extra safeguard.  There may be a section of the public of opinion that the book had been banned without sufficient cause.  I do not think there is any case for withdrawing the provision. Even if there is not a demand for the provision in this House, I am quite satisfied that when the Bill goes to the Seanad I will have a demand for it there.  I have thought over the whole matter and am not prepared to accept the amendment.</P>

The only case I can mention is the one I have given.  It might happen that a book by a foreign author might be banned, and there might be a considerable volume of opinion objecting to that, but the publisher and the author might not take sufficient interest in the Irish reading public to appeal.  That is the only case I can give.  It might never arise, but I think it is a good thing to have such a provision.</P>

There is no compulsion on Deputies or Senators. The reason why it is confined to Deputies and Senators is that they are people of responsibility, who will not lightly make an appeal.  They will have to watch what they are doing, and be able to stand over it in public.  Consequently, it is not a thing that will be lightly done.</P>

      <P>I wish to say that, for once, I think the Minister is perfectly right in his attitude here, and I should like to say that, if I were in the Minister's position, I would oppose this also and would speak out whatever was in my mind.  I think it is a good thing that if five men, who must be deemed to be reasonable people, inasmuch as we have been elected here by many thousands of voters, peruse a book and declare it not to be in its general tendency indecent and say, as five Catholic, Protestant and decent men: &ldquo;We see nothing indecent in this book and want this thing reviewed because we do not believe that any ordinary five men could find anything indecent in its general tendency&rdquo; they should be able to do so.  If <i>Land of Spices</i> had been condemned under this, I would have been glad to be in a position to put my name down asking for a review of that decision, and there are three or four other books in connection with which I would have welcomed an opportunity to sign a memorial asking for a repeal of such a decision, if it were only to have it go on record that I, as a modest, Catholic individual, could see no <Col N="786" /> justification whatever for the fantastic idea of condemning these books as being in their general tendency indecent.  There are lots of books which, in the Latin tongue, are not <i>virginibus puerisque</i>, but to describe certain books as being in their general tendency indecent I believe to be an injustice.  Because I believe it is desirable, over and above the safeguards provided in this Bill by way of appeal, to enable five responsible citizens, men or women as they happen to be, members of this Oireachtas, to invite the appeal board to review the original decision, I welcome the Minister's stand on this matter.  I know, of course, that anybody who dares to say that there should be any modifications or relaxation of censorship in this country leaves himself open to the charge that he is a freethinker and an atheist, and if anyone wants to describe the Minister as such for his attitude, I, for once, find myself in agreement with him.  If anybody wants to describe the pair of us as atheists and freethinkers, we will be together for this occasion at least on that, but for this occasion only.</P>

I am not now talking about Miss O'Brien's book, but other books which have been banned, and yet sound judges of literature&mdash;good and holy Roman Catholics too&mdash;found nothing pornographic in them.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the motion that the Bill do now pass I want to raise a point which I think is of some importance.  Now, it is necessary to preface my observations by the platitude that every normal man and woman in this community and every other community wants to prevent the dissemination of pornography.  Every normal man and woman wants to prevent any corrupt person from selling pornography to impressionable persons, young or old, for the purpose of corrupting them, and I think that that is the principal purpose of the censorship legislation.  But, as a result, I believe, of an amendment to the original Act, proposed by Senator Sir John Keane in the Seanad, power was conferred upon customs officers at ports of entry to this country to search passengers' baggage for books, which were their own private property, and to abstract these books from their baggage, peruse them on the quayside and, in their absolute discretion, submit them to the censors of this country, withholding them from the passenger until such time as a ruling had been given by the censor as to whether the books were fit and proper for perusal or not.  Surely, that was never the intention of this Oireachtas.  Our intention was to secure that people would not bring pornography into this country for the purpose of corrupting the impressionable elements of our community.  It is none of our business what individuals may care to bring into this country in their baggage for their own perusal.  I know there is <Col N="788" /> a risk.  It is conceivably possible that some diabolically minded person would bring in a pornographic volume with a view to passing it on to impressionable people for their corruption, but the likelihood of that happening is so remote that it seems to me to be grotesque to provide for it by legislation, and the amount of offence which is given to persons entering this country by officious officers of the customs and excise who have availed of this power to harry and annoy passengers coming here is fantastic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, does the House want, or does the Oireachtas mean or desire to enter into the personal activities of every individual in this State, never mind every individual from outside this State who happens to visit Ireland? Does the Oireachtas want to place on the Minister for Justice the obligation not only to supervise the character of literature offered for sale in this country, but to go into every citizen's library in this country, determine whether the books on the individual's shelves are fit and proper books to be there, and abstract them?  Because, unless that is our intention: to place on the Minister the right and obligation to go into every individual's library, scan the books on the shelves and abstract books from the shelves, why should an officer have the power to take from a passenger's handbag a book that he would not have the power to take from a shelf in the man's library?  Now, suppose it became known to the police that an individual was constantly passing back and forth across the Channel and bringing in packages of undesirable books, it would be quite open to the Gárdaí to prosecute that man for his activities, and, of course, they could do so. Customs officers or Gárda officers ordinarily on duty at ports of entry are there and can identify individuals who are engaged in illegitimate traffic of the kind to deter them from attempting to make a system of it, but that that power should be twisted into a general power directing customs officers to open an individual's baggage containing some books that he had for his entertainment or his instruction, would, I suggest, be a very serious blot <Col N="789" /> on censorship in this country, and ought to be reviewed.  Have any legal device by which pornography should be controlled without such a penalty as that.  I have no doubt that if the Minister will reflect on the matter he will agree with me, at least, in the spirit of my representation, and I await with interest to hear from him whether, in his judgment, it would be prudent to provide the relief I suggest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the point raised by Deputy Dillon is one to which reference was made on the Second Reading of the Bill, when, as far as I recollect, the Minister said that that particular power was taken to deal with periodicals.  It seems to me that it leaves itself open to question when we have to bring in a Bill of this kind.  We have to deal with this problem of pornography, because we have people who are not normal in certain respects, and because of their abnormality certain measures have to be taken to try to restrict their activity.  When we questioned the Minister on the peculiar power given customs officers, not only to extract prohibited books from the baggage of passengers but to extract a book that had not been examined, and to extract it on the individual view as to whether the book might or might not warrant prohibition, possibly the Minister may answer that the powers given are not going to be used in an arbitrary way, that customs officers will apply their good sense, and deal with the passenger in a courteous and fair-minded way.  But if we are to deal with the exceptions, we have to allow for exceptions being made to the rule, not because customs officers may not have any particular interest in extracting these books and making themselves a nuisance, if you like, but where you have the average type of person being given power which may be exercised in a certain manner. Here a customs officer is given power to detain a book and refer to the appeal board, but, at the same time, we are giving him power to go right through the baggage of incoming passengers, to take out a book and to exercise his own interpretation and his own valuation of the book, and on <Col N="790" /> that basis send it for examination and possible prohibition.</P>
      <P>When we recollect the manner in which the examination of the ordinary individual is carried out, that it is not carried out in a private place, but within public view, generally at a barrier at which anything that goes on is open to the view of other passengers who are likewise being examined, I can see that a person might be seriously embarrassed by a customs officer extracting a book in a public manner and in such a way that it must of necessity arouse the attention of other passengers.  A book is detained to be sent on to the board and whether the customs officer desires to give that impression or not, definitely the passenger will have the feeling that he is being placed in an embarrassing position.  In the case of every such book the title or the name of the individual who wrote it might be taken. The book could then be sent on in the ordinary way and examined in chambers, where an order is made and no particular person is open to embarrassment or placed in any objectionable situation.  We have to recall that the Bill does not make it illegal for a person to have a prohibited book, except when the book is for distribution and for sale.  It is set down in the Bill that it is a perfectly good defence to prove that a book is not being retailed for sale.  If there is a case of a passenger coming into this country with a single copy of a book, it is not going to be a commercial proposition to bring in one book at a time, yet, in order to close that minute loophole, we are giving these exceptional powers to customs officers.  Surely it would be possible for a customs officer, when going through baggage, to make a note of the name of a book and to communicate with the board and, in the ordinary course, they would acquire a copy for examination, without giving these extraordinary powers to customs officers which, no matter how carefully exercised, must necessarily give rise to embarrassment and interference with the ordinary private rights of individuals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel strongly in regard <Col N="791" /> to the private rights of citizens but, at the same time, I feel there is a problem which the Minister is up against, and that is to deal with books published outside this country which have not been brought to the notice of the Censorship Board.  It would appear to me that the most speedy and most effective way of bringing these books to the notice of the Censorship Board would be through a customs officer who would get the books at places of entry.  A new point, however, was made by Deputy Larkin, that customs officers could take a note of the title of a book, and the place of publication and send these particulars to the Censorship Board, so that the book could be examined.  It would be possible for the Censorship Board to obtain the book afterwards.  There is a good deal also in the point that a citizen might be open to serious embarrassment if a book was taken from his possession on entry, while it might afterwards be proved that the Censorship Board decided it was not open to condemnation.  But the citizen concerned would have been held up, perhaps, to the odium of fellow passengers, and would have no redress, if informed afterwards that the book was all right.  I think the Minister should consider the point raised by Deputy Larkin, that it would be sufficient for customs officers to take note of the title of a book and to send it on to the board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, there is nothing new in this provision.  As I pointed out on a previous stage, customs officers had the right, under the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, to detain any book they thought was obscene or indecent.  That was before there was any censorship legislation such as there now is.  That British Act was in operation here during all those years.  In other countries, I am told that the same position obtains.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  My information is that the picture drawn by Deputy Dillon of a person's luggage <Col N="792" /> being rummaged for such books is not accurate.  If a banned book happens to be discovered in the course of the ordinary examination of a person's luggage, the customs officer will hold it up.  That may not be the proper thing to do but it is done.  What the position is if a person has a banned book in his own library, I am not sure, but I imagine he would be entitled to keep it.  However, a person will not be allowed to retain a banned book when coming into the State if it comes under the notice of a customs officer.</P>
      <P>Most of the books sent to the Censorship Board by the customs authorities are stopped in the course of post and form part of parcels sent to booksellers. It is only very rarely that a book which is not banned is detained in the course of the ordinary examination of luggage.  If we had had an amendment dealing with this matter on Committee Stage, we could have considered it at greater length but no such amendment was tabled.  As this arrangement had been operating for close on 70 years and as it obtained in many other countries, I thought that there was no great objection to it.  I do not think that passengers are embarrassed in this connection.  If we were to exempt private luggage from this provision, we might find loopholes created which it would be hard to close.  We may, I think, leave the matter to the commonsense of the customs officers, who have done their work very well since this Act came into operation.  We shall be taking no risk in doing that and I do not think that it will result in damage to anybody.</P>

Imagine the customs officers taking the book from her and telling her, <i>coram populo</i>, that he was going to send it to the censor.  The fellow must have been daft.  He was a plague and a pest but he was acting within his rights.  If the Minister would get into consultation with the Revenue Commissioners and ensure that &ldquo;dafties&rdquo; of that character would be locked up in Amiens Street and that this duty would be carried out by reasonable men, it would be all that would be required.

I undertook to bring their remarks to the attention of the Government and I want to report now that I did so. <Col N="794" /> The Government, having given very serious consideration to the facts, as I related them, and having considered extracts from the statements made here, decided that they would not go any farther than they had already gone.  I have to report back here now that the Bill in its present form is the Bill to which we desire the House to give its assent.</P>

      <P>Even at this late stage, would it be any use appealing to the Minister to have the whole matter reconsidered?  It is well known that if John Brown, in receipt of a military service pension, is appointed as chairman of C.I.E., he will not suffer any deduction in respect of his pension.  If he gets a job with Longford County Council, he does suffer a deduction.  I think that the Minister will agree that the number of persons affected by this Act is reducing every year.  Unfortunately, we are attending too many funerals of these men. Every such funeral we attend means one less of the number that have done the work of the country.  Without wishing to embarrass the Government or to make political capital out of the matter, I feel that the Bill should be reconsidered and that the Government should take the generous step and cut out the Schedule completely.  What is the sum involved?  So far as I can ascertain, the cost to the State would be about £20,000 a year.  For how many years?  Not many.  I appeal to the Minister to go back to the Government and ask them, as a final gesture, to do the right thing in the right spirit.  I am sure that no person in this House and nobody in the country would challenge such a decision.</P>

      <P>I do not think that Deputy MacEoin was in the House on the last occasion on which this Bill was discussed.  On that occasion, I informed the House that the Government had made its final decision in respect of the Bill.  In spite of that, as a result of the pleas made for the abolition of the Schedule, I undertook to take the Bill back to the Government and I did so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, the Government <Col N="795" /> gave very serious and rather lengthy consideration to the matter.  Deputy MacEoin may not be as fully aware as I am that there are numerous other pleas for relief of one kind or another continually coming before the Government&mdash;relief of a kind not very dissimilar to that which is being sought here.  Although it is true to state that the amount involved by the total abolition of this Schedule would add only another £20,000 to the total expenditure, the fact remains that the Government, having considered all the factors, decided that they had met the demand which was made for relief in respect to this Bill and in fact had gone further than acceding to the request put forward by the official organisation representing the men concerned. They decided that that was as far as they were prepared to go and that any other money that may be available for relief of this nature should be devoted to meeting other propositions, without going any further in this respect.  It would be useless, therefore, for me to waste my own time or the Government's time in pressing the matter any further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will probably be interested in some further details of the Supplementary Estimate required to meet the expenditure for the carrying out of a nutritional survey. The expenditure will fall under the following headings:&mdash;Training of investigators, £500; salaries of investigators, £2,000; travelling and subsistence allowances, £1,000; miscellaneous equipment, £30; other expenses including payments for the preparation and recording of information by families whose conditions are being investigated, £3,500.  The study of the nutrition of population groups has been a development of considerable importance in modern science.  In many countries, even long before the recent war, widespread investigations of nutritional conditions were undertaken by national agencies in order to determine the effect of the foods consumed on the health of the people.  From these investigations valuable information was obtained, not only concerning health but illuminating the trend of popular food habits and tastes.  In addition data of great importance to sociologists, economists and agriculturists became available.</P>
      <P>A feature of such research was the determination of the exact quantity and quality of the food required to maintain optimum health.  Such information, specific for each country in respect of differing national foods and food customs, has been elaborated into broad dietary standards which are now generally accepted.  It is unnecessary to describe in detail the very great influence this knowledge of food standards has had on the food policies and rationing arrangements of the belligerent countries recently.  In fact the application of scientific nutritional knowledge has enabled many countries to weather conditions which previously would have brought about famine conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this country, thanks to the fact that so many of our people own and <Col N="797" /> farm their own land and that food, as compared with any other country in Europe, is in relative abundance, the problem of malnutrition amongst large population groups has not been nearly so acute as elsewhere.  Nevertheless, it is undoubted that some social groups in our community may experience hardship owing to lack of proper food or a poor quality of food, due to inefficient distribution, faulty economic organisation or possibly due, in certain circumstances, to improvidence.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I approached the Medical Research Council with a request that they should advise on the organisation of such a survey which I intend to have carried out directly by my Department with the co-operation of various local authorities throughout the country.  As a result of consultation between the Medical Research Council and my Department a scheme of research has been developed. It is proposed to employ a staff of investigators who will receive special training in this work. Arrangements have been made for their training as it is desirable that they should be fully cognisant of methods internationally recognised.  The work will be under the personal supervision of a medical officer of the Department who has special nutritional experience.  It is hoped that this survey will provide data for the drawing up of standards peculiarly suitable to Irish people and which, at the same time, will be relevant to international standards and practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House will welcome this proposal to set up a committee to investigate nutritional problems here.  I think we are very much behind-hand on this question of dietetics and the attempt to investigate it now is a step in the right direction. The Parliamentary Secretary has stated that there is no problem of acute malnutrition in this country.  I suppose that is so; there is no great problem of empty &ldquo;tummies&rdquo; but I think there is a problem of unbalanced diets.  The Parliamentary Secretary, I suppose, knows as well as I do, that large sections of our people are living <Col N="798" /> on carbohydrates and that they certainly lack proteins and vitamins that are essential to a proper balanced dietary.  Of course, the Parliamentary Secretary appreciates that the lack of these elements gives rise to many troubles and diseases.  I think our people generally suffer from a lack of food and that we do not eat sufficient vegetables.  Large sections of our people live on bread, tea and potatoes. The dietary of many of the poorer sections of the community is lacking in essential vitamins and proteins contained in meat, milk, fruit and vegetables.</P>
      <P>I understand that the committee which it is proposed to set up is to investigate the standards of diet at present in existence among the various sections of the people and the standards which it would be necessary to achieve in our circumstances, and for our particular mode of life, having regard to the types of food available. It is essential, before encouraging balanced dietary for the people, that we should find out the standards suitable to our circumstances.  I have no doubt that this investigation and survey will produce very useful and important information for our guidance in that respect.  Therefore, on behalf of this Party, I welcome the proposal.</P>

      <P>We are encouraging our people to look to the State for <Col N="804" /> everything that is required in human life.  I think the principle is morally unsound.  While I am not opposed to the State providing the money in necessitous cases, where people are unable to finance legal proceedings of one sort or another, I think in these cases, where there are people in a position to pay their own expenses, it is a bad principle for the State to step in and pay the expenses of such individuals. It is the trend in that direction to which I object more than anything else and not this particular isolated instance alone.  I think there is a definite trend in our legislation in that undesirable direction.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not think that it would be better to make this Bill last for one year only and bring in a new Bill each year?  Is there any extraordinary objection to that procedure?  I take it that the conditions may vary considerably and I suppose the Minister really looks upon this Bill, as some of us do, as a necessary evil in the present times.  Is there any reason why it should not be brought up every year?</P>

      <P>On that point, I think that there will not be any great change within five years.  The matter can be brought up in a year's time if the situation warrants it.  All that is provided here is that it must come up at least within five years.  There is nothing to prevent its coming up after a year, but I do not think that within one year there would be sufficient change in the situation.  There might be in two years, but we cannot foretell. If there is felt to be a necessity for bringing it up in a shorter period than five years, there is nothing to prevent its being done.  The only thing laid down here is that it cannot go beyond <Col N="805" /> five years.  It must definitely come up within the five years.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 24, to delete the figures and word in brackets &ldquo;(1923 Act)&rdquo; and insert before the word &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; the word &ldquo;old&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are consequential on amendment No. 1.  I frankly do not like the composite terms used in this Bill, the mixture of words and figures; they jar upon my ear.  These terms are: &ldquo;controlled (1923 Act) premises&rdquo; and &ldquo;controlled (non-1923 Act) premises&rdquo;. I have suggested that the term &ldquo;old controlled premises&rdquo;, which could be defined if necessary, should be substituted for &ldquo;controlled (1923 Act) premises&rdquo; and &ldquo;newly controlled premises&rdquo; for &ldquo;controlled (non-1923 Act) premises.&rdquo;  I think it would make for easier reading and certainly would be more euphonious than the present definitions.</P>

      <P>While I agree that the terms suggested might be more euphonious, I doubt if they would make it any clearer.  I think we would have to define &ldquo;old&rdquo; and &ldquo;new&rdquo;, and therefore we would be introducing extra definitions.  I would be prepared to use something more graceful, but the draftsman, who is very experienced in this matter, thinks it is the best way to explain it.  If you put anything else in, I think you will have to define it and that would make the Bill more complicated.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), lines 1 and 2, page 5, after the word &ldquo;let&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;or about to be let&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to tighten up the law relating to the payment of premiums, to leave no loophole to the landlord to come to an arrangement with a third party.  A practice has grown up elsewhere, when a house becomes vacant, that the adjoining occupier takes over on behalf of the landlord and becomes an intermediary between the incoming tenant and the landlord.  He accepts a premium, and while the landlord can say that he knows nothing about it, the house cannot be let unless this fictious owner agrees.</P>
      <P>I also wish this definition to be read in conjuction with the provisions relating to premises in Section 51.  It is to prevent any escape of this kind that I have put down the amendment.  This matter was considered by a committee in Great Britain and it was felt that it was necessary to introduce these words into the definition for the purpose of tightening up the law.</P>

I instanced the case where a house becomes vacant and the landlord allows an adjoining occupier to take over and says: &ldquo;If you can arrange things as I would like them, we can split the premium between us.&rdquo;  It is to prevent such a third party coming in that I have proposed the amendment.

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 2, page 5, to add after the word &ldquo;house&rdquo; the following words:&mdash;&ldquo;and a part so let or about to be let of any house shall be deemed to be let as a separate dwelling notwithstanding the fact that the landlord and the tenant or tenants thereof have common user of the water supply, sanitary accommodation, bathroom, garage and fuel store attached thereto.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There again, I am up against the words &ldquo;about to be let&rdquo;.  The purpose of this amendment is to remove any possibility of a decision such as was obtained recently in England being given in our courts. I refer to the case of Neale <i>v.</i> del Soto.  This was a case decided on appeal in England.  The landlord and the tenant used in common the kitchen, the sanitary accommodation and, I think, some stores, and because of this common user it was held by the Court of Appeal that the portion let to the tenant was not let as a separate dwelling.</P>
      <P>Many lettings of flats are made to tenants with a common user of fuel stores, a garage, sometimes a kitchen, and very often sanitary accommodation. It is quite on the cards that the courts would take a similar view here, that a flat let with the common user of these facilities is not a separate dwelling.  It is in order to clarify that position that I have put down this amendment.  As the law stands, I believe it would be possible to hold that a flat with a common user was not a separate letting and the tenant would be held not to be a separate tenant.  Therefore, it would be possible for landlords to get outside the Act, by arranging for some common user of some particular part of the dwellinghouse as a whole.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy would read a book published recently entitled <i>London Belongs to Me</i>, he will find that Mrs. Josser occupied three rooms where she had her private provender and kept her home or hereditament very distinct, but Mrs. Vizzard, the landlady, never ceased to regard her as one of her lodgers and never regarded herself as a landlord.  There were seven families living in the house. Probably they all shared the same turf or fuel place and the same water supply and sanitary accommodation, with the same bathroom&mdash;if there was one&mdash;and the same garage&mdash;which I am sure there was not.  I think Mrs. Vizzard would be quite astonished if she was told that in 10, Dulcimer Street, she had ten separate residences or hereditaments.  She regarded herself as a lodging housekeeper and was fortunate enough to set 10 apartments to 10 lodgers.  I again ask the Deputy, if we insert that, what is a lodger?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We ought to proceed on the basis of the position in which we may find ourselves to-morrow.  Take a person who has been reared in one of the large Georgian houses in Great Denmark Street, and falls on evil times and reserves for herself, let us say, the study and dining-room of such a house as her own apartments, or possibly withdraws into the basement and decides to live there.  She sets some of the upper apartments to a married couple, who bring in their furniture and do for themselves.  She sets the drawing-room and another room to another married couple, who bring in their furniture and do for themselves. She sets three bedrooms on similar terms and possibly two back bedrooms or the rooms on the top floor to another married couple on the understanding they will bring in their furniture and do for themselves.  That <Col N="811" /> woman remains proprietress of the house.</P>
      <P>Deputies must remember that nuisance in law has to be a very substantial thing before it can be made a statutory ground for terminating a a statutory right.  Under this legislation tenants will have statutory rights, and their right to go to the courts will not lightly be set aside.  But surely a respectable woman is entitled to live undisturbed in her own house without having to bring into a court of law any one of her enants who has been guilty of what, in the eyes of the law, would be deemed to be a statutory nuisance? Suppose one of the parties is habitually intoxicated.  Suppose one of the parties quarrels violently with another respectable tenant in this lady's house. Suppose that any one of the 101 domestic upheavals that can take place in a house divided up into lodgings should take place, and that respectable woman, from the point of view of the good name of her house, wishes to end an intolerable situation.  Is it suggested that we should lay it down in our legislation that she cannot go to one of her tenants and say: &ldquo;Unless you can get along with this other tenant, one of you must go, because I cannot have the house turned into a bear garden.  You allege that it is the fault of the other lady and the other lady alleges that it is your fault.  We cannot all remain here in a state of permanent chaos and, therefore, in all reason, I must say to you that you shall have to take a month's notice and find other accommodation?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Oireachtas intend to say that we will give to all the warring factions in that house a statutory right?  Are we to tell a woman who is concerned with the good name of her house &ldquo;No, you must keep these people who are hollering at one another up and down the staircase of your home, in perpetuity?&rdquo; Remember that until one perpetrates a series of acts&mdash;an isolated act will not constitute a nuisance&mdash;which will justify you in going to the court and proving to a judge that certain people are guilty of a nuisance within the meaning <Col N="812" /> of the Act, there can be no peace in your house, in your own dominion, for your home has been taken from you because you are poor and run down and you have to take in lodgers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that you should not interfere with a person who is in circumstances which require him or her to take lodgers into the house.  If you want to deal with a person who buys a house in order to rent it, that is one cup of tea; but if you want to go to a person's own home, the sacrosanct character of which he or she has been obliged to compromise by taking in lodgers&mdash;and nobody likes taking in lodgers&mdash;and say to that person: &ldquo;We will enter your home and require you to run that home in accordance with certain statutory provisions which were designed to prevent profiteering in house property,&rdquo; that is utterly going beyond the beyond.</P>
      <P>Should we give consent to the fantastic proposition that everyone who owns a house is an avaricious and tyrannical landlord?  Surely it is not suggested that every woman who takes in lodgers is a public enemy?  Most of these ladies are extremely inoffensive individuals.  Admittedly, there are tartars among landladies just as there are tartars to be found in every other section of the community.  But to treat the whole body of landladies as if they were public enemies is to me quite an unjustifiable intrusion on the rights of a peculiarly defenceless body of people. Will anyone suggest to me that the landladies of this country constitute such a powerful vested interest as to make it necessary for the Oireachtas to intervene, to exercise powers of control over poor people who are using the one method available to them to eke out a livelihood?  It seems to me that these proposals are quite daft. Will anyone argue that a poor woman is to be controlled by Oireachtas Eireann in the manner here suggested?</P>

      <P>It is obvious to me that Deputy Dillon, out of his affection for Mrs. Josser, is speaking from the depths of his ignorance of the law in <Col N="813" /> this matter.  This provision has been part of the law since 1914.  I will refer the Deputy to Section 37 (1) (b):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... any person (being the tenant, any individual residing with the tenant, or any of the tenant's lodgers or sub-tenants) has been guilty of conduct which is a nuisance or annoyance to adjoining occupiers, or has been convicted of using the premises or allowing the premises to be used for an immoral or illegal purpose.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see how we can deal with the tenement problem at all if we are not to regard these as separate lettings.  I think that judgment is a very serious one, and, if it were accepted here, we would have to amend the legislation to deal with it.  I propose to accept the principle of this amendment.  As I say, it provides only for the case in which the landlord resides on the premises, but there may be other types of houses in which the owner does not live.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would explain how we can deal with the ordinary person living in a tenement. Even if an owner who had set a house in tenements lived on the premises, we would have to continue to regard them as constituting separate lettings for each of the tenants.  I do not think the fact that the person who owns the house lives there ought to make a difference. It would be different if there were furnished apartments, but this is a question of the letting of unfurnished rooms in big houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister can see a difference.  I do not propose to go into elaborate argument as to the finesses of various judgments under the Rent Restrictions Acts defining the types of houses.  We all know that there are volumes of them, and every man who goes into court to get a decision under that code or the workman's compensation, goes into a lottery, not knowing what will come out of the <Col N="814" /> bag; but, as rational people in this House, and not lawyers, do we not see a difference between the woman who is constrained by circumstances to set a few rooms, and the tenement landlord who buys an old house in Gardiner Street, Gloucester Street or North Great George's Street, sets it out in rooms, and sends a rent collector to screw the rent out of the people?</P>
      <P>It may be said that it is hard to distinguish between them in terms which will be arguable in a court of law, but we must go as near as we can to it, and provide that where a landlord permanently resides in the house, this general code of rent restriction will not apply to the lodgers he takes in.</P>
      <P>It may be that there are exceptional cases where tenement owners live in the tenement houses, but I have never met a tenement owner who lived in one of his houses or would live in one of them for ten minutes.  He usually lives in Rathgar or Rathmines, collects his rents and goes home there, and he would never dream of living or allowing a members of his family to live in one of the tenements from which he collects rents.  There may be exceptions. If there are, it might be a very good thing for the tenement system. If we could persuade them to live in the houses, the tenements would be a great deal better than they are.  But if our refusal to impose this code upon the ordinary respectable woman setting rooms in her house forces them in, it is an additional reason for rejecting Deputy Coogan's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let the Minister not be stampeded, for the sake of double-locking his precautions against the tenement owner who wants to abuse his tenants, into inadvertently turning the lives of many respectable old women in this city into misery.  The Minister will agree that, whether you have your own family or lodgers in a house, unless there is some head to the house, pandemonium will break out, and if a woman, trying to keep her house decent, respectable, orderly and regular is liable to be set at defiance by her own tenants and told <Col N="815" /> that they will not go for her until she can prove a statutory nuisance within the meaning of this Act, we know perfectly well that she can never succeed.</P>

      <P>Without in any way suggesting that the Deputy and I differ fundamentally in principle, the Deputy will agree with me that the business of going into court and proving that a person has been guilty of an annoyance or a nuisance sufficient to justify the, court in stripping that person of the statutory protection which this Oireachtas has given is very difficult, because the tenant is always the favoured party and the landlord the persecuting party.  The tenant always has the sympathy of the court.  I attach importance to this because it might result in doing inadvertently great injustice to many people.</P>

The obligation is on the landlady to prove that a tenant has been guilty of an annoyance or of whatever the other word is.  That is a very difficult thing to do, and I urge the Minister most strongly not to be rushed into this, but to consider it very carefully and to make up his mind that, whatever concession he intends to make to Deputy Coogan's amendment in favour of tenement houses as popularly understood, that is, houses owned by the landlord who collects rents on them while living elsewhere, he will reserve absolutely the rights of landlords or landladies who live in their own houses and have to live with their tenants, so that they will not be subject to all the restrictive provisions which this code of law sets out.</P>

      <P>The phrase used was &ldquo;accepting in principle&rdquo;, and I understand the Minister to be equating the cases in which the owner of a premises lives on the premises and in which the owner does not so live.  If that is the situation, the Minister ought to reconsider it still further.  There is no decision that I know of in regard to the taking in of lodgers, except in cases in which the owner of the house is in occupation.  There has been a decision which has not yet been applied here&mdash;it is an English decision&mdash;in respect of a person living on the premises who lets out a certain part of the premises.  The court has held that that is not a separate letting, that that is taking in lodgers; but I must say that Deputy Coogan's amendment does not cover the position, because a more recent decision still has gone against the one on which I think the amendment is founded and has cut it down.</P>
      <P>The mere provision in common of water supply, sanitary accommodation, bathroom, garage or fuel store is no longer the point of the decision. The point is whether any of the living rooms are let in common.  What does the Minister think?  Does he think he ought to object to people taking in lodgers, or that people who do take in lodgers should be in the position that they will have the protection of the rent restriction code?  If so, where does he think we should draw the line at the taking in of a lodger?  I suggest that any decisions given so far only apply the phrase of taking in a lodger to the case in which the landlord is in occupation with the tenants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Coogan has talked about clarifying the law.  I do not know if anybody is very clear as to what the law is at the moment.  In any event, this appears to be near it: if you have a tenant who is protected, and that person dies, there is no doubt that if that tenant is a man and if his widow is then in occupation of the premises that widow can succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It also appears to be the case that a child may succeed. It would appear to be the case that there can be no succession beyond one member of the family.  Deputy Coogan's amendment here does not make it too clear, on my reading of it. He said that the interest of a statutory tenant shall be deemed to have determined upon the death of the widow or widower or such other member of the statutory tenant's family as shall have succeeded.  When he says &ldquo;such other member&rdquo;, I do not know if the Deputy means the singular to include the plural, and that it should go along the whole line of the number of children who are left.  That is a position which a lot of people would like to see arrived at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we come to the Minister's amendment No. 101, he very definitely stops at a particular point.  He sets out here in a series of numbered paragraphs that if the statutory tenant leaves surviving him his wife, who was residing with him at the time of his death in occupation of controlled premises, then she retains possession under the terms of the Act; but, if the statutory tenant does not leave a wife so residing, such member of the statutory tenant's family so residing, or&mdash;<Col N="822" /> the Minister is very precise&mdash;where there is more than one such member, such one of them as may be agreed upon by the court shall be entitled to retain possession.  If the tenant was a woman, the same conditions shall have effect with respect to her husband and family.  As I read it, the Minister says in his amendment: If the tenant is a man and he leaves a widow, the widow becomes the tenant; but after that jump to her there is no further jump.  I take it that that is the meaning of the Minister's amendment. But if the tenant be a man, whose wife predeceases him, and he dies leaving a family, then one member of the family will succeed.  In other words, what happens is that the control of the premises lasts for an extended period to correspond with the life of one member of the family, and only one.  I think that is the meaning of the Minister's amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Martin O'Sullivan has amendments which I think are aiming at a sort of perpetual succession down along the family.  Deputy O'Connor, who is very precise in his amendment No. 123, provides for a line of succession. He brings in people who are relatives by affinity or marriage of the tenant.  He wants to extend it down along not merely the life of the widow who may succeed, but of any child or children who may succeed, or of any relatives who happen to be in occupation, I do not know at what time.  I do not know if Deputy O'Connor refers to those who, being relatives by affinity or marriage, are in occupation at the date of death of the tenant.</P>

      <P>I know there is considerable hardship in some cases. There is a case being heard, or about to be heard by the courts, in which the tenant died leaving a widow who died shortly afterwards.  There is a large number of young children in that house, and as the law goes at the moment it looks to me as if&mdash;the widow having lived later than the man in occupation, but not having lived to this point&mdash;those children are not protected by the Rent Act and may be put out.  The opinions I have heard <Col N="823" /> expressed would be in favour of extending this down along the members of the family.</P>

Suppose Mr. X and his wife are living in a controlled house.  Mr. X dies; his widow lives a bit after him, and then the widow dies.  As I understand the Minister's amendment, if Mr. X had seven children one of those children would be selected, and for the life of that child the premises would be controlled, but no further.</P>

      <P>He can sell with vacant possession.  Let me leave that out for the moment.  If the landlord does not want to sell, the house, after this Act is passed, remains controlled, and the rent is fixed, so the only question is: will he leave in the house the <Col N="824" /> children of the people with whom he used to deal, or will he put them out and put in other tenants on the same terms and conditions?  The Minister says there may be a sale with vacant possession.  Who is going to buy? Again, let us look at the circumstances which necessitate this extension of the Act.  They are that there are not sufficient houses being built for a certain class of the community.  There are not sufficient houses that those people can get, that is those who want to rent houses.  If one of those houses comes on the market, it is going to be sold. You are certainly not going to get one of the tenant class, so to speak, to buy; they will not have the money to buy.  You are going to induce somebody from a sort of higher stratum of the community to come down and buy. When you do that, you remove one house from the already scanty number available for letting.  I do not think that should be allowed.  I see no great point now in having houses de-controlled. In the new circumstances, it seems to me that, once you do not stop at the widow or widower who is left when the tenant dies, once you move out to any member of the family, you really should move along the whole line of that family.  I have yet to hear why Deputy O'Connor decides to allow for people who are relatives by affinity or marriage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the husband dies, leaving an invalid wife, and if she has a sister of hers, an aunt of the children, in to look after them, and that sister is in residence at the date of death of the children's mother, I see no reason why it should not be extended to such <Col N="825" /> a person.  I should like very much more to accept Deputy O'Connor's amendment if he, in return, would agree not to be very insistent, in so far as he can put pressure on the Minister, on having exempted from this the premises which were in course of being erected on the 8th February, 1944.

      <P>There are two points in the amendment I have put down, one of which, so far as I know, is not covered by existing law or by any provision in this Bill or in Section 1.  That is the case of a woman who is a statutory tenant and who dies, and where the succession does not automatically fall to the husband.  It is an extraordinary thing that the husband has no right of succession in that case, whereas the wife has automatic right of succession.  The second point is the right of succession so far as the children are concerned.  Deputy McGilligan mentioned the matter of perpetuity. As the law stands, the right of succession passes only once, and that is to the widow or the children, as the law provides.  The Minister mentions one member of a family.</P>

You may have a number of boys or girls, as the case may be, who may be getting married and living in that house, and when one dies, the right of succession immediately ceases, and the landlord steps in. Accordingly, like Deputy McGilligan, I favour the widest possible extension of the right of succession so far as members of the family are concerned.</P>

      <P>In tabling this amendment, what I had in mind was the position under the existing law.  We talk of an interest of a statutory tenancy.  The interest of a statutory tenant is merely the right that during his lifetime he cannot be disturbed or put out except in certain statutory conditions.  The purpose of my amendment was to direct attention to the fact that there were these two viewpoints, and to decide now, once and for all, whether that purely personal right&mdash;which is not a tenancy at all, but merely the right to hold on by virtue of the Act, as distinct from by virtue of his tenancy&mdash;should be handed down in perpetuity.  I should like to say that I have an open mind in the matter&mdash;it cuts both ways&mdash;but it was for that reason that I put the thing down at all. As the law stands, I believe there can be only one succession.</P>

      <P>I think that, while the Minister's amendment goes a good way to meet the case, Deputy O'Connor's amendment is better.  In that connection, I may say that there is a case pending at the moment where the <Col N="827" /> wife died and the husband died almost immediately afterwards.  In that case, the children might not come in, and I am sure the Minister wants to make this as wide as possible, so as to include the children.  On the other hand, in the case of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Deputy O'Connor's amendment, there could be a case of bringing in some old person in order to get the tenancy.  However, with the exception of those cases where efforts might be made to extend the actual idea of the Act, I think that a wide definition is better than the Minister's amendment, and while it goes a good deal further than the other proposal, it will not include a family on the death of both parents.</P>

What does it matter?  Once the house is controlled, the rent is fixed, the statutory conditions are fixed, and if the landlord has people there who have not gone into arrears of rent, and could not be put out on that ground, or who have not created a nuisance that would have allowed him to get a court order to get rid of them, why should they not be allowed to remain in their own house, and not be put out?</P>

      <P>Surely, it will be realised that this perpetuity business deprives the landlord of one very valuable right?  The code of rent restriction is now becoming so comprehensive that many a landlord, where he is able to terminate a tenancy, would desire to retire altogether from the profession of landlord and sell the house to a tenant purchaser.  This perpetuity principle will greatly vitiate that right of the landlord to sell his house.  So long as we have this kind of Dáil Eireann&mdash; and I am including all sides of the House now&mdash;rent restriction will go from bad to worse.

I want to make this point to the Minister, rather than to my legal friends in the House&mdash;that this effort to codify the Rent Restrictions Acts and Emergency Powers Orders is, in fact, creating confusion, because we have now rent restrictions under the Act of 1914 and the later Act, and under the Emergency Powers Orders.

The Bill is designed to make better provision for restricting the increases of rent.  The provision we are making for restricting the increase of rent is described in the definition section and, as the Chair will observe, runs to a page-and-a-half.  I am submitting to the House that we could make better provision for restricting the increase of rent, if, instead of having one-and-a-half pages, an amendment of two lines were inserted stating that under this Act a fair rent shall be such as a Circuit Court judge shall decide or, in the case of tenants, such as a district justice shall decide.</P>

      <P>The word &ldquo;premises&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;premises used for the purpose of any business, trade or profession or for the public service&rdquo;. We have definitions of &ldquo;business premises&rdquo; and &ldquo;controlled premises&rdquo;, but Section 3 states, &ldquo;this Act applies to every premises&rdquo;, the only exclusion being those in the latter paragraphs of sub-section (2).  I do not know if that makes a change in the old code.  People have brought cases before the courts concerning lean-to sheds.  In one case brought to court, the contention was that it was a dwelling-house.  The court decided against that conclusion.  I am not sure if the court decision would hold in the new circumstances concerning &ldquo;business premises&rdquo;, in view of the direct statement in Section 3 that &ldquo;this Act applies to every premises&rdquo;, subject to the exception in sub-section (2).</P>
      <P>I am not sure, but I think that the decision in the lean-to case turned on the question whether there was a roof on the place or not.  The other and more important matter is this: Taking the Minister's amendment No. 8, as passed, the word &ldquo;tenant&rdquo; is now defined in this way: &ldquo;Unless the context otherwise requires&rdquo;, it &ldquo;includes in relation to any premises a statutory tenant and includes any person from time to time deriving title under the original tenant and also includes a subtenant&rdquo;.

      <P>When we get the reprint of the Bill, it will, I think, have those words at the bottom of the page appearing in it.  According to the definition, &ldquo;tenant&rdquo; includes a statutory tenant and includes the person deriving title from time to time under the original tenant.  You have to write in there, instead of the words &ldquo;original tenant&rdquo;&ldquo;statutory tenant&rdquo;.  How can you derive title from a statutory tenant?  I do not suppose it is intended that anybody should derive title from a statutory tenant.  The only persons to carry on, in addition to the statutory tenant, are those we have discussed&mdash;the wife who remains on after her husband or, if the wife has predeceased her husband, who was tenant, a child or children.  I do not assume that the provision that &ldquo;tenant&rdquo; shall be deemed to include statutory tenant is then going to carry forward the tenancy and mean that a person can derive title from a statutory tenant.  A person can derive title by purchase.  It is not the Minister's intention, I take it, to allow statutory tenants to sell their rights but that might be contended owing to the peculiar mixture of words which we have here.  I draw attention to the matter though I am not sure that what I say is correct.  A contractual tenant can derive title under the ordinary law.  Why then put in the words to which I have referred?  They may cause some complication.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 8, after the word &ldquo;premises&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;notwithstanding the fact that the rent at which they are let includes payments for the use of furniture&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>At present, furnished lettings are not controlled except in a limited number of cases in which it can be shown that the charge in respect of furniture amounts to 25 per cent. of the rent. My purpose in moving this amendment is to have considered by the House the problem of furnished lettings.  Any old shack can, in a sense, be described as a furnished flat.  You put in a few tables and chairs and put up a few plywood partitions and you say that that is a furnished flat.  Owing to the acute shortage of houses, many flats are being let furnished and exorbitant rents are being charged for flatlets and shacks of the type I have mentioned. It has been put to me by many people that the time is opportune for the State to step in and effect some control of furnished lettings&mdash;at least a greater degree of control than that proposed in Section 3 (2) (g).  The problem of furnished lettings is not as acute here as it is in Scotland and England but it does crop up.  Legislation has been passed for Scotland and I understand from a recent pronouncement that legislation is about to be passed for England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Scotland, they have got over the difficulty of furnished lettings by taking the valuation of the flat or flatlet unfurnished as the basis for control. There, they have a system of annual valuations.  From that valuation roll the rent is calculated, and in all cases of furnished lettings the rent of the flat or flatlet is fixed on an unfurnished basis.  The charge for furniture or other service, such as light or heat or water, is calculated independently of the rent and is added to the rent. There is a provision that, in the event of disagreement between the landlord and the tenant, the court may fix the proper value of the furniture or other <Col N="834" /> services.  It is possible to evade the provisions of this Bill entirely by resorting to the expedients adopted in Great Britain&mdash;to throw in a few articles of furniture and let the flat as furnished.</P>
    <P>In that way, they can evade control and keep within the provisions of the Act.  I suggest, therefore, that serious consideration be given to this problem of the furnished flat.  A proper approach to the problem would be to have the rent calculated on the basis of an unfurnished letting and that any charge for furniture or board or attendance should be calculated independently of the rent.  In case of dispute, provision might be made for resort to the courts.  In amendments Nos. 39 and 56, I go further and propose that these charges be treated as lawful additions to the rent.  In other words, we get the position that all flats would be let unfurnished.  A furnished flat would be let on the basis of the valuation of the flat and the value of the furniture and additional services would be calculated.  These would be added to the rent as lawful additions. In case of dispute, the matter could be settled by the court.  I feel that there is a necessity in the present emergency and in the present shortage of houses for control of furnished lettings almost to the same extent as exists for control of unfurnished lettings.</P>

      <P>My amendment, No. 22, would practically have the same effect as Deputy Coogan's amendment except that on Section 4, I am submitting an entirely new amendment on the question of furnished flats.  The Minister justified this afternoon and also on the introduction of the Bill, the attempt to control rents on the grounds of the evils which flow from the conditions under which tenement dwellings are let and I think he will agree that some of the lettings which are sought to be controlled here also constitute a social evil.  These furnished apartments, houses or flats, are occupied mainly by newly married couples and by other equally deserving sections of the community such as business girls, who, in order to avoid the drabness associated with lodgings, club together and take a flat.  The <Col N="835" /> hardship in their cases is also very serious.  Deputy Coogan made a point which I want to underline and that is that the beneficial clauses of the Bill could be very largely negatived by a landlord insisting that the letting would be such as to carry with it furniture. There is a very big problem in Dublin in this respect as far as newly-married couples are concerned. One can understand that at a time such as that, when the main consideration of a newly-married couple is to get into premises which they can regard as their home, they may take on commitments which they cannot live up to afterwards and which they will regret.  The fact remains however that they do enter into such tenancies and that under present conditions they are excluded to a very great extent from the reliefs which this Bill would otherwise make available for them.  I would strongly appeal to the Minister to accept the scheme which we put forward in our several amendments and which will provide that a furnished flat shall be dealt with as an ordinary separate dwelling and that arrangements will be made for an assessment of the value of the furniture to be added to the rent.  I think in all equity we should also provide that tenants of such premises will be entitled to recover excess charges in the same way as other tenants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was notorious, of course, to everybody, certainly before the war, that there was a certain type of bamboo furniture which was largely sold to landlords for use in houses which they wished to describe as furnished houses to get them out of the provisions of the Rent Restriction Acts.  It is notorious that in every county in Ireland, when a man bought a small house for letting, he put a few decrepit sticks of furniture in it and it became a furnished house for the purposes of the Act.  I could never see why a Rent Restrictions Act should have permitted that practice.  Deputy Coogan's proposal, however honestly conceived, seems to open the door to a very much wider abuse.  Deputy Coogan said we should adopt the Scottish <Col N="836" /> system by which they deem a flat to be an unfurnished flat, fix a rent on that basis and then let the landlord if necessary, in default of agreement, apply to the court for a rent for the furniture and services supplied with the empty flat.  If you accept the doctrine that it is legitimate to refer to the court for the fixation of a rent for furniture service in a flat, why not accept the principle that you should refer to the court for a fair rent for the flat itself? If you are going to adopt Deputy Coogan's proposal&mdash;and it sounds a sensible one to me; the Scottish are no fools and they do not attempt to put plans into operation that are not likely to work&mdash;why not go the whole hog and get rid of this mess through which we are trying to battle our way at present?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputies are to be congratulated on having got into a Rent Act this whole question of furnished lettings which is apparently quite clearly happening.  I do not see, with respect, how it can be prevented once you have brought in paragraph (g) in sub-section (2).  That paragraph does prevent a landlord who throws in a few sticks of furniture, pretending that it is a furnished letting because if the court comes to the conclusion that the proportion of the rent to be assigned to the furniture does not reach a certain figure, it shall not be regarded as a furnished letting.  Deputy Coogan goes much further and so does Deputy Martin O'Sullivan.  I see no great point of principle in the objection. If we do this incidentally it will be a remarkable thing.  Ordinarily we lag about five or seven years behind legislation in Scotland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this proposal we would be lagging a few years behind what they have done in Scotland, but if we carry it at this moment, we shall be running in line with the proposals in England <Col N="837" /> where they have decided to bring in legislation to apply to England what is already in operation in Scotland.  The only difficulty that they have found with regard to the Scottish system is that it necessitates the setting up of a number of tribunals and there is some difficulty as to the variation in rents that are fixed for premises and furniture for different districts.  That is a small matter, but there would be some variation as between Cork and Dublin, for instance.  I have no doubt the courts could tackle that question.</P>
    <P>I do feel that there is a great deal of force in the wider amendment of Deputy O'Sullivan.  He decides to exclude only dwellings where a charge is made for board and attendance, because where you have board and attendance, that is lodgings and not a letting of part of the premises at all. If we are going to deal with the rents of premises generally, I think we might as well deal with the rent of furnished lettings.  This country seems, for reasons which I cannot fathom, to have committed itself to a low wage policy.  So long as you are in that position, so long as you allow, notwithstanding a soaring cost of living, the middle classes to be deprived of their old emoluments&mdash;you have definitely cut their emoluments in half &mdash;I do not think in justice you can avoid giving them this concession.  So long as the cost of living is high and so long as wages and salaries are not allowed to rise to the new value that money has secured in this country, you must see that not merely are unfurnished houses controlled but that the protection of the same kind is extended to furnished premises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very difficult subject.  In the British case, it is dealt with, not in the Rent Restrictions Act, but in a separate Bill that they are bringing in.  I have seen a copy of that Bill, and in it there is no security of tenure.  I see great difficulties in dealing with furnished lettings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know cases where some member of a family may have gone away for, say, a year or two, leaving a spare room with furniture available in the home.  The owners of the premises may <Col N="838" /> be prepared to let that room for a year or two and I do not see why they should not have the right to get possession if they want it.  I do not think that would be in the same class as an unfurnished letting.  I have listened to all that has been said here.  I will consider it but, at present, I am not inclined to include furnished lettings. This rent restrictions code is troublesome enough without bringing in something which has not been in it already.  Furnished lettings were controlled only to the extent that no fictitious letting could be made by supplying a few sticks of furniture, and things of that kind.  That is already dealt with and I am not disposed to deal with this question any further at present.  I will look into it and see if I can do it.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether things are as bad as Deputies have represented.  I think those who are going to the trouble of making genuine flats to accommodate people who need them, in a time like this when there is such great scarcity of living accommodation, are doing a very good service and if we are going to be restrictive on them we may stop them altogether.  If we could build houses overnight and house everybody, it would be quite another matter, but we all know that what Deputy Martin O'Sullivan says is right.  Newly married people especially are inclined to pay more than they are able to afford but if there were no place at all for them the position would be worse than it is at present. All these things have to be considered before we decide to bring furnished lettings within the scope of the Rent Restrictions Bill.  I will look into it and if I see that I can meet the points that have been made here, I may do it, but at present at any rate, I am not disposed to bring furnished lettings into this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">

      <P>I had no intention when I referred to furnished lettings of letting into this Bill, say, a letting of a furnished house for one month in the summer or a short letting of that nature.  I know that as the amendment is framed it would be possible, perhaps, to include that.  That difficulty <Col N="839" /> could be got over by drafting, prescribing some minimum term of months or years in the case of furnished lettings and at the same time giving some rights to the tenant of a furnished house or flat.  I think you could get over the difficulty which the Minister has in mind by fixing a minimum term&mdash;six or twelve months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have often been anxious to find out what are the arguments against this.  The Minister has advanced two, as far as I can understand him.  One is, he takes the case of a family who, say, through certain members disappearing, find themselves with a few rooms over their requirements and they let those and then, he says, if the family gather in again, what is the situation?  If you fit these people into the rent code proper then the owner of the premises can claim before the court that he requires the rooms for himself or his family.  If he made a <i>bona fide</i> claim and backed it up with evidence that the court found proper, he could get the rooms back. In any event, that could be attended to.  Maybe the rent code would have to be strengthened to meet that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the &ldquo;greater hardship&rdquo; clause not come in there? Suppose it could be shown that the person in possession had the greater need, what would be the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know there is a suggestion&mdash;one that I will try to ventilate by an amendment&mdash;that we should have in this code something like what there is in the 1931.  Landlord and Tenant Act, that even with regard to unfurnished houses, where the person wanted the house and it could be called good estate or good house management for him to have it, he should get it. There are people at the moment who are forced to patch up dilapidated houses who, if they could get the tenant out, would make partial reconstructions and make proper premises of them.  Even though the premises are still controlled, that could be attended to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other point the Minister made I cannot see eye to eye with him at all. <Col N="840" /> Think, he says, of the good people engaged in turning places into flats and letting these.  We have a funny segregation. The landlord, the man who owns a house that he wants to let unfurnished is a bit rapacious&mdash;an ordinary business person going to get as much out of the scarcity as he can. I will not use the word &ldquo;apacity in connection with that man.  He is just a good business person.  According to the Minister he is a rather decent sort of chap and he is not going to be rapacious.</P>

      <P>I do not think human nature is going to change because the man in one case is letting an unfurnished house and in the other case is letting the house as furnished lodgings or premises.  These being the only two arguments, I think the Minister should give very serious consideration to this matter.  I am not denying the difficulties and I am not denying that the whole rent code as we know it may not be proper to apply to furnished lettings but certainly some slight adaptation of the rent restrictions code will fit the furnished lettings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make only one point, as the Minister is making up his mind finally on the question.  I wish to advert to his statement that the grievances in relation to the question of furnished flats may not be as extensive as had been represented. It may be of interest to the Minister if I read extracts from a letter which I received yesterday in connection with this particular subject and which deals with two cases:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Case A: A girl clerk, renting a one-roomed furnished flat, was given notice suddenly by her landlady on the grounds that she required the room for her own personal use.  The girl is alone, without parents&mdash;unable to pay the cost of legal advice or to find time from her work to consult a solicitor.  Within a week the one room is let by the landlady for greatly increased rent to two girls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The supervisor of a Government Department informed a lady that <Col N="841" /> several girls had complained of this and had no redress.  This method is widespread and is causing great hardship when girls are almost turned out on the street to seek accommodation and without means to obtain legal aid.  A solicitor, when consulted, admitted that if the tenant did not leave, conditions would be made intolerable for them by the lanlady.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Case B: A tenant (girl) in the same position renting a two-roomed flat, in bad repair, held under agreement since 1937.  The method adopted by the landlady was to inform the tenants verbally that owing to increase in valuation of their flats and consequent increase of rates, the rent would have to be increased. No receipts for rent are ever given. When inquiry was made at the rates office, it was found that for eight years the house was not returned as being made into flats and no increase in valuation had been made. Written notice to increase the rent is never given or legal notice to quit, but the tenants are required to comply with the demands and, if they do not, they are told to go.  Were they to remain, conditions would be made intolerable for them.  These are cases where the landlady lives on the premises and can, consequently, interfere with the liberty of occupation though the tenants have committed no breach of agreement or misconducted themselves in any way. There should be provision whereby the landlord should be forced to submit evidence of previous rent and/or the legal rent payable under this new code.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I mention that letter as indicating that a number of people in the city at the present time are seriously perturbed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it all sums up to this, that if it were possible under the Land Act of 1881 to fix a fair rent for every agricultural holding in Ireland, it ought to be possible to give general discretion to the court to fix a fair rent for furnished and unfurnished lettings in this country.  That would relieve the Minister of this endless argument and wipe out many injustices.</P>

      <P>The reason I put down the amendment is that the Bill generally is obviously for the benefit of tenants.  The point is that as many tenants as possible should be included and the limits should be as few as possible.  In any event, under the 1939 Act in Great Britain the valuation in London is fixed at £100; in Scotland it is £90; and in places in England other than London it is £75. Here the figures are being fixed at £60 and £40.  I suggest that they should be £75 and £50.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this amendment can be defended in a word.  The Emergency Powers Order fixed rent restriction as applying to houses which were in occupation on the 7th day of May, 1941. Deputy O'Connor is constantly reaffirming that this Bill is only for a period of five years and only includes houses that were constructed up to the relevant date referred to in this Bill.  If it is not the intention gradually to draw into the scope of this legislation all houses that have been built or are to be built in this country for all time, I suggest to the Minister that houses built between 7th May, 1941, and 8th February, 1944, cost just as much to build as the houses that are to be built immediately after the passing of the Bill.  If it is just to exclude from the rent restriction code the houses to be built immediately after the passage of the Bill, we ought to exclude from the operation of this Bill the houses built during the period when the impact of scarcity and rising prices had increased the cost of house building.  If that date is deemed to be the 7th May, 1941, for the purposes of the Order, then I suggest that it is only equitable to leave it for the purpose of this Bill. <Col N="844" /> Otherwise you are bringing in that small group of houses that were constructed between May, 1941, and February, 1944, while you are omitting from the Bill all houses that have been built from February, 1944, onwards on the ground that they were built in a period of far higher costs than the prewar houses which the Bill covers.</P>
    <P>That is the whole case.  I would expect, when I am speaking on behalf of landlords to this House in its present humour, to secure for them equity, not to speak of justice; but if either one or the other were to be accorded to landlords, then this concession should be made.  I would have some hope if the Árd-Fheis were over, but the Árd-Fheis is still going on in the Mansion House and I have very little hope indeed.</P>

      <P>I am not talking about the amendment, but about the original date in the Bill&mdash;because there was some property in which Deputy O'Connor was interested; that Deputy O'Connor being a person interested in building societies had persuaded him that this was the proper date.  Deputy O'Connor is &ldquo;sitting pretty&rdquo; in this, because the further the date is pushed back the better he is safeguarded.  I want to hear the case for making it the 8th February, 1944.  Why should it not be what we ordinarily do&mdash;the date upon which the particular piece of legislation appears, the date on which the First Reading was taken?  If we want to have clauses inserted for the benefit of individuals with property, let us be quite open and frank about it and let us know where we are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Deputy McGilligan <Col N="846" /> says: &ldquo;Well, now, if the Minister is going to hear one expert and allow his judgment to be swayed by that, I suggest he should say to himself: `This is Deputy O'Connor's opinion, but I have not talked to all the other building societies, which is a thing I would have done if I wanted a building societies point of view'.&rdquo;  I gathered from what Deputy McGilligan said that it might be suggested that the amendment proposing 7th May, 1941, instead of 8th February, 1944, suited Deputy O'Connor very well and, therefore, Deputy O'Connor sat mum.  It may suit him, but I wish to make it clear that he had nothing whatever to do with it.  I put down this amendment without consulting any Deputy, and Deputy McGilligan says he wishes to hear a cogent argument for it.  There is no one else who can make that argument but I, as no one else knows what was in my mind, and no living creature knows the argument I want to make for it.  As I understand it, in the original code this date, 7th May, 1941, was taken as being a kind of Rubicon between the houses built on the basis of pre-war costs and the houses built after costs had begun to soar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the date named in the Order.  At any rate, I take it to be the acceptance of the Rubicon between the houses of pre-war costs and the houses built under rising and inflated costs.  It seems to me unfair to take the small segment of houses built in the period of inflation from 1941 to 1944 and to make them subject to this code, when we are excluding all the post-1944 houses on the ground that they were too dear.  If 1941 was the right Rubicon when the Order was made, it is still the right Rubicon between the pre-war building costs and the war building costs.  It is for that reason and for no other reason that I alone, uninspired by anyone else, put down this amendment.  As far as I am concerned, that is the only case I can make for it, and it has no reference to the views of any building society, with whom I had no discussion or consultation whatever.</P>

The fact is that, if we had thought of the effect of the Order when making it originally, we would, when making the amending Order, have put in the same date as in the original Order, 7th May, 1941, but what we did was only to make it from the date the Order was originally made.

      <P>Now, the 1st February, 1944, is the date on which this Order was promulgated.  The Order referred to a date, 7th May, 1941, but that was in respect of the rent that, so to speak, had been fixed by arrangement between the parties on the 7th May, 1941.  It is quite a fair thing to say that, if we are bringing premises under control, we will look at the rent fixed by agreement between the parties and take the rent at some date&mdash; though why it should be this particular date I do not know.</P>

      <P>Then it is not so? So there is no exclusion of premises that were built after the 7th May, 1941. The date is only there for the purpose of the rent, that is, if the rent was in operation on that date, you take that rent.  That mistaken impression regarding the Order seems to be Deputy Dillon's foundation for this amendment. It is now recognised as a mistake, that is, it is not the date of exclusion. I want to know how we are going to exclude the houses built after the 7th May, 1941.  Some one has coerced the Minister into fixing that date and I would like to hear the argument publicly made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied there is as much case for excluding houses built from the 7th May, 1941, as there is for those built from the 8th February, 1944, because the costs were at least as high then as at the later date.  As far as I know, for a couple of years after the war started things were very scarce and probably cost as much.  I do not know how many houses are concerned. No one made representations to me about them.  As far as Deputy O'Connor is concerned, he, as a man of experience, told me it was going to affect a very important building concern here, which was providing houses for the people, and that the building would have to stop if the control were applied <Col N="849" /> to houses which were just being built. That meant the stoppage of building and I was not prepared to let that happen. That is why the amending Order was made.  If anyone else had made the case here, it would have been the same, but Deputy O'Connor happened to have knowledge of the matter and happened to be there.  Maybe I should not have mentioned his name, but I had nothing to hide.</P>

      <P>I do not think Deputy McGilligan wants to hear any argument.

Deputy McGilligan has sought to implicate me in a personal way as owner of this society.</P>

I have a holding in it&mdash;I do not deny that&mdash;but it is very far from being anything like part ownership.  It was I who asked the Minister, at the time some building was in contemplation, whether there would be any chance of getting an Emergency Powers Order whereby these buildings, if put up, would be excluded, so as to ensure that the control would not apply to them.  The Minister did that, as regards a certain number of houses. It was not a great number&mdash;about 24 or 25 were built.  The Minister made that amending Order&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As to what would happen on the death of the tenant, he said something about our prescribing a medicine for others that we did not want for our own people.  That is not so, because, as I say, the company with which I am connected always relets a house if the occupying tenant dies or moves out.  The company never sells a house.  Its principal business is the building of houses for rent, and it never takes advantage of increased prices to sell a house.  On several occasions houses could be sold, but the policy is to rent houses, and that policy is being continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is helpful when a Deputy with practical experience like Deputy O'Connor says: &ldquo;I am building houses; I know the circumstances and, if a certain course is pursued, a certain thing will happen&rdquo;.  The House is indebted to Deputy O'Connor for openly stating, from his personal experience, what he knows will be the reactions of his colleagues in certain circumstances.  Bear this in mind, that Deputy O'Connor speeks freely and frankly.  He says: &ldquo;How can you ask people to build houses for rent if you apply rent restrictions to them? Surely, Oireachtas Eireann will not subscribe to the shameless fraud that we here, passing this Bill into law, believe this is the end of rent restrictions? Will Deputy Martin O'Sullivan subscribe to that&mdash;suggest that to anybody contemplating building houses?  Do we not all know that whoever is Minister for Justice in four or five years' time will be brought under the same pressure to produce an analogous Bill to control rents?  Does Deputy O'Connor believe that a democratically constituted Dáil is likely to put up a stiff resistance to a move in that direction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We may as well face the fact that we will have rent restrictions for all time and the sooner we get to the point of the 1881 Land Act and have fixation of <Col N="851" /> fair rents the better; then you will get somewhere where you can hope reasonably to control rents and have building. It will not be a business of going to court and pinning the man who builds a house down to a hopelessly uneconomic rent, thus forcing him to sell. There will be a position in which both parties can go to court and get a fair rent fixed, in some cases the rent being raised and in other cases the rent being lowered.</P>
    <P>The Minister should mark well the useful and cogent words of Deputy O'Connor.  How can you expect anyone to build houses for rent if they are to be subject to rent restrictions? Does not that lend point to what we have said, that this kind of law if it is to be projected indefinitely, will end all house-building for rent?  Let us face the problem seriously and establish a tribunal to fix fair rents; then both parties will get a fair crack of the whip and you may have a reasonable hope that people will build houses in the belief that the owner as well as the tenant will get every consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Connor came to me and explained the position of his society, but I am informed by my advisers that, six months before Deputy O'Connor mentioned the matter to me, a deputation of builders came to the Department and made the very same case.  As a matter of fact, the draft Order was being prepared at the time Deputy O'Connor came to me. I think Deputy O'Connor did a very good service in conjunction with the other people who came.  I just want to clear that point up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is accepted that reference to Deputy O'Connor was not intentional in the form in which it was first regarded, because I have a similar case to the one mentioned by the Deputy.  A builder built houses and had them ready for letting in 1940. He was trying to let them at £7 per house.  The houses are on the north side of the city.  He could not get sufficient tenants at £7 per house and in order to let the houses he reduced the rent to £6 10s.  At that rent he let all the houses.  As time went on certain <Col N="852" /> of the tenants left.  The rates at that time were £6; now they are £18.  The result is that the builder has decided to sell whenever he can.  There is no company and the builder has not sufficient capital.  He does not go in for the letting system in the same way as the firm mentioned here.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that any private builder, or any person who has not capital or who has not a large number of shareholders behind him, will be forced out of this business.  This man told me&mdash;and he speaks for another man in a similar position&mdash;that when any house becomes vacant he will sell it.  I do not know whether the Minister will consider pushing the date back further.  The position is that all people who have built houses up to 1941, or at any time since the cost of building materials increased so steeply and rapidly, will be forced out of the letting business and will have to sell.  It is only an exceptional company or a firm which has a large number of shareholders that will be enabled to remain in the letting business.  I think what Deputy Dillon has said is likely to happen, that these people will cease to act as landlords and will be forced to sell.</P>

      <P>Is not the speech we have heard from Deputy O'Connor just what Deputy Dillon has described &mdash;is it not a complete refutation of the whole basis of this legislation?  We are bringing in premises with a valuation of £60.  There is no doubt that a great case can be made for that on the basis that there is a scarcity of houses of this particular type, and the people who own them will make hay while the sun shines.  But then we have provision made for getting what is called a lawful rent.  We have sections carefully built up here which are supposed to give a person who puts money into the building of a house, something in the nature of a fair return.  Deputy O'Connor, speaking from his experience, says that it would not meet the houses built since February, 1944, and apparently the Minister is now of the opinion that these carefully balanced provisions will not meet the houses built since <Col N="853" /> 7th May, 1941.  Is not that a condemnation of the whole Bill?  Does not that mean that the provisions made in respect of a person who has built a house will not give him an adequate return?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are on a descending scale.  Deputy O'Connor says you cannot bring in houses built since February, 1944, as the cost is so enormous the rent would not be adequate. The Minister now says the date should be pushed back to 1941.  The same ought to apply to reconstruction.  Is the cost of repairs being met in these provisions?  We are taking a step where we definitely abandon any hope that people's needs in regard to houses will be met by the private builder who will build houses for rent.  The only way the private builder will ever be brought into operation again will be by saying: &ldquo;We will control every house no matter when built, and we will give subventions to private people who build, so that when the house is built it will be let at a rent which tenants subject to a low wage policy can pay, but we are certainly closing the door on enterprising builders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea behind fixing the rent at that date was that it was assumed, and, I think, rightly, that up to that time builders had material on hands and those who were letting houses were letting them at adequate rents.  They were covering themselves for their outlay and getting a reasonable <Col N="854" /> profit.  What we are doing here is giving people who have to build in the new conditions the right to a fair return on their money.  I dare say that the whole rent restrictions code from the very beginning may have restricted the building of houses for letting, but to the extent that that building was possible between the two wars, it ought to be continued, because we are not going to impose any restrictions on it, unless, as I said on the Second Stage, conditions again arise in which people try to take advantage of a scarcity and seek to charge exorbitant rents in respect of houses from which they were satisfied to get a proper or fair return before emergency conditions arose.  I think that is justified and it is being done everywhere.  We cannot avoid it, however restrictive of building operations it may be.</P>

      <P>The object of this amendment is to ensure that the exemption from the control provided for in paragraph (d) will not extend to houses provided by local authorities under the Housing Acts and subsequently sold by them. It is intended that the exemption in favour of local authority dwellings should apply only where the local authority is for the time being the landlord.  In other words, if a person buys such a house, it will be controlled and will not get the exemption which the local authority had.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <P>If they are exempt from the whole code, the rents can be raised, and, whether the rents are in arrear or not, the people can be evicted.  One of the biggest mass evictions in this country in recent years took place in one of the northern countries of this territory when the local authority decided to pitch out all the tenants.  They did so, and it was then discovered to everybody's amazement that the local authority had all the powers of the old landlords. Can anybody tell me why that should be so?  The Minister's amendment shows that there is something by way of glaring contrast.  He says that if a local authority sells a house, if a house erected by the Dublin Corporation is bought by the tenant purchaser or by somebody else, that person letting that house will be controlled, but that the local authority, while it remains the landlord, will not be controlled. Why?  If an ordinary tenant does not pay his rent, being controlled, he can be put out.  If a tenant destroys the property or gets in people who are a nuisance, he can be put out.  Why should a local authority be put in this favoured position?  If they are letting the houses at uneconomic rents, very good.  They have done so, but, if the rent is not being paid, the tenant can be put out.  That is one of the few rights which the landlord or owner of controlled premises has.  He has certain other rights, but I have not yet heard any argument as to why a local authority should be put in the position of the old-time landlord and allowed to evict without cause.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan has been unfair in his statement.  He said that a public body was carrying out a mass eviction.  He should tell the whole story when he makes reference to that particular case.  A local public body has never been known to increase the rent of its property, and I invite any Deputy who has any association with a local authority to instance a single case of a local authority increasing rents.  The reason these people have been threatened with eviction is that they have refused to pay the rates.</P>

I thought one of the points at which we were aiming in a rent code was that, so long as a person paid whatever rent was fixed, he remained on.

Therefore, local authorities must want something more than that, because they have that power even if the premises are controlled.  They want something else, and in fact, they have evicted people for something other than non-payment of rent, as I am instructed, and I propose to object to this amendment because I object to the paragraph, and that is one way of getting at it.</P>

      <P>While it is true that local authorities do not habitually raise rents, cases have come to my notice, in which, on the installation of electric light, a basic increase has been made in rent which many tenants would challenge as being properly related to the actual cost of light consumed, and in respect of which I think that if a local authority were subject to the rent restrictions code, these people would have a status to go into court and say: &ldquo;The local authority purports to raise my rent from 14.8d. to 18.10d. a month. They justify the 4.2d. on the ground that it is payment on a flat rate for light.  Our submission is that 2.4d. would cover the light and the balance is in fact an effort to increase the rent to the relief of the rates.  Admittedly, these cottages were built and a sum was borrowed to finance their erection. Its payment is financed partly by rents and partly by rates.&rdquo;  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, in view of the enormous and ever-increasing burden of national taxation, Dáil Eireann is of opinion that a Select Committee with power to send for persons, papers and records be set up to inquire into the <Col N="859" /> cost of administration in all State Departments with a view to ascertaining what economies can be effected and how waste and over-lapping can be eliminated.</P>
    <P>The reason why we have tabled this motion is that many people are taking serious notice of our national expenditure and of the increasing burden of national taxation.  The proposal in the motion is for the setting up of a Select Committee to see what economies can be effected.  It is the belief of many people that there is very serious over-lapping and serious wastage in many Departments.  The facts concerning national taxation at the moment are definitely disquieting.  For over ten years now our budget has been unbalanced. During the last ten years expenditure has been in excess of revenue each year, according to the Statistical Abstract for 1943.  The State debt has grown alarmingly from year to year.  The cost of servicing State debt is becoming a really heavy burden. If something is not done to check it, it will become a serious handicap on the future working of the State.  In 1924, the State debt was £13,993,000, the dead weight part of it being £10,399,000. In 1937, it had increased from practically £14,000,000 to slightly over £73,000,000, the dead weight part of the debt being £37,250,000.  In 1940, it had increased from £73,000,000 to close on £94,000,000, the dead weight part of which was £53,500,000.  As regards the statistical material that is available to us there is one thing lacking and that is that no official balance sheet has ever been published by the Department of Finance to show what the State debt really is from year to year.</P>
    <P>The increase in the growth of State debt and in dead weight debt has become definitely alarming.  The servicing of debt in 1926 was just under £1,000,000.  By 1932, the figure had gone up to £1,500,000.  In his Budget statement last May, the Minister for Finance told the House that the servicing of debt was costing £4,000,000 a year.  It may be argued that a lot of useful things are being done with this money, but I hold that if we had kept down the debt over the last number of <Col N="860" /> years we would be in a very happy position to-day.  If, for example, we had this £4,000,000 which the servicing of State debt is costing the country to play with we could do many useful things, and could increase many services that are very badly needed. When, from time to time, demands are made for more social services and for the execution of public works of many kinds, the usual answer that we get from the Minister for Finance is that money cannot be saved and that these things cannot be done without putting further taxes on many articles that are already taxed to capacity. If we had that £4,000,000 to play with, many useful things could be done with it.</P>
    <P>There has been, for instance, an increase in the number of civil servants. In January last the House was told that the number of civil servants in the country was 30,333.  That means, according to the census taken in 1936, that there are 23 civil servants to every 1,000 occupied persons.  The Banking Commission in its report drew attention to the abnormal increase in the number of civil servants.  In 1927, the total number was in the neighbourhood of 9,000, and to-day the number is 30,333.  Taking the activities of any Department of State that I am interested in.  I must say that this very steep rise in the number of civil servants does not point towards efficiency. From time to time I have occasion to deal with the Land Commission. That Department is understaffed at the moment, and even though I believe it was not understaffed before the emergency, it expects to have some of its staff returned to it.  Certainly, the increase in the Civil Service, not only in the Department of Lands but in every other Department, does not seem to be making for more efficiency.</P>
    <P>The decline in agricultural output is down by 11 per cent. and in industrial output by 24 per cent., while at the same time the physical volume of money has increased.  The balance of our sterling holdings shows a very steep increase, our Exchequer issues are abnormally high, while our State and local debts are increasing.  I would like to have an explanation from the <Col N="861" /> Minister for Finance as to where exactly he thinks all this is leading. Many people throughout the country are alarmed at the trend things are taking.  We are definitely going into debt year by year.  The servicing of debt is costing a very great amount, and Government Departments are, in my opinion, costing much more than they ought to cost.  As regards the Departments, here are a few figures which I desire to give.  In 1930-31, the Department of Finance was costing £54,851; in 1943-44, the cost had increased to £78,737.  The Office of Public Works in 1930-31 was costing £85,492.  In 1943-44, the cost of it had risen to £143,840.  The Civil Service Commission in 1930-31 cost £11,273, and in 1943-44 it had increased to £23,724. The Department of Agriculture was administered in 1930-31 for £435,867, and in 1943-44 it had increased to £1,352,844.  The Department of Lands was serviced in 1930-31 for £544,851, and in 1943-44, even with a reduced staff, it cost £1,277,000.  The Department of Industry and Commerce in the year 1930-31 cost £87,270, and in 1943-44 it had increased to £258,918.  The Secret Service went up from £1,409 in 1930-31 to £20,000 in 1943-44.</P>
    <P>The general procedure in both Houses of the Oireachtas does not permit of the detailed examination of various items.  It may be said that the Public Accounts Committee can go into all this.  They can, but they are powerless to effect any curtailment.  Their broad function, put in a nutshell, is to see that the money voted by the Dáil for a particular purpose is spent in that particular way.  The select committee envisaged in this motion would have power to send for persons, papers and records.  They would have power to make a full and thorough investigation, and to make representations to the Government as to where expenditure could be saved.  I move the motion for that reason, coupled with the fact that my experience has been that, although the cost of administering State Departments has increased, the efficiency of that administration has decreased rather than increased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second this motion.  It seeks to supply what I think is a long-felt <Col N="862" /> need.  It seeks to provide that the expenditure of the State and the administration of our public Departments be subject to close scrutiny by a select committee of this House.  Such a committee as we envisage it would have power to examine in close detail every item of expenditure.  It may be said that this House, in dealing with the Estimates when they come before it, has the same power.  But a committee such as we envisage would have further power.  It would have power to send for any particular official who is dealing with any particular matter which the committee questions, and to send for documents and papers in relation to the administration of that Department. This committee could go into close detail, and find out if each and every Department of the State is functioning efficiently and economically. Every business, whether it be large or small, must be subject to scrutiny from the top.  We, as the elected representatives of the people, are the directors of the State and of the administrative machinery of the State.  It is our duty, as directors of the entire administrative machinery, to examine the working of the entire administration with as close attention as is paid by the directors of a business firm to an examination of the working of all its departments.  We claim&mdash;and that is the reason for putting down this motion&mdash;that a democratically elected deliberative assembly such as this is not fully qualified to go into the details of administration with sufficently close attention to find out if there is waste or over-lapping; to find out if there are officials who are redundant; to find out if there are officials who are not giving full return, or if they are employed in such a way that they cannot give full return to the State; to find out if there is over-lapping&mdash;if there is an office at one side of the street dealing with a matter which an office at the other side of the street is dealing with at the same time.  If there is duplication, overlapping and waste, that ought to stop.  It would also be the function of this committee to see if money voted even for purposes apart from the payment of salaries and expenses of officials is voted wisely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="863" /> Glancing over the Estimates for other years I happened to glance at the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture for 1937, and I found that a sum of, I think, £80,000 was voted in that year as a subsidy on the export of calf skins.  I am certain that if a small committee of this House were to examine that question carefully they would definitely come to the conclusion, that that subsidy was unwisely spent; that the provision of a subsidy to ensure the slaughter and waste of calves, and the export of the skins to some other country, possibly at no price whatever, was unwise.  As Deputy Blowick has pointed out, there is attached to this House a Public Accounts Committee which examines the expenditure in detail from year to year.  But the Public Accounts Committee is handicapped in that its function is merely to see that the money is expended for the purpose for which it was voted by the House.  It has no function to consider whether the money was wisely or unwisely voted.  If this House, in its wisdom or unwisdom, were to vote £1,000,000 to-morrow for the erection of a colossal statue of the Minister for Finance in the centre of the city, and that expenditure subsequently came before the Committee of Public Accounts, who found that the money had been duly spent and the statue duly erected, then the committee could not even comment on the wisdom or unwisdom of that expenditure.  But the committee which we envisage would examine the Estimates before they are presented to this House.  They would examine them before a decision is taken on them, and would make their recommendations as to whether they are wise or otherwise.  This committee would go closely into the entire expenditure. Glancing again at the 1937 figures for the Department of Agriculture, I find that the salaries and wages of the officials of that Department amounted to £172,000 in that year.  The estimated figure for 1946 is £245,152. That is a very substantial increase.  It is typical of every Government Department. It is typical of the entire State expenditure.  If we go back to 1929, we know that in that year the State <Col N="864" /> expenditure amounted to about £20,000,000 as against £47,000,000 for last year.  A very substantial portion of that increase is due to an increase in administrative expenditure.  Has that expenditure been justifiable?  Are we certain that the State is getting value for all this expenditure?  Are we certain that every official of the State has work to do and is doing it efficiently? We can only get assurance on that matter by examining administration in detail.</P>
    <P>The Minister may tell us, of course, that it is one of the functions of his Department, and a very big function of his Department, to keep a very close eye on the expenditure in our Government Departments.  The Minister's predecessor, in his Budget statement this year, and also in his Budget statement last year, referred to the struggle which he had in order to keep down expenditure.  He referred with alarm to the increase in the volume of expenditure. He told us that there were almost pitched battles in the Cabinet between him and the Ministers of other Departments in connection with their demands, and that he found himself frequently fighting delaying actions and frequently had to give ground.  But I do not agree that the Department of Finance is capable of dealing with this question fully.  The proof that they have not been very successful is in the enormous increase in expenditure over the past ten years, or even over the past 15 years.  It is an alarming thing and a disquieting thing that while in every privately-owned business or business concern there is somebody whose main function is to ensure that there is no waste&mdash;and that somebody, generally, is the owner of the business &mdash;you have not the same thing in connection with the Government.  The private individual, the owner of the business, will see that, as far as possible, there is no waste or inefficiency in the running of his business; and why?  Simply because self-interest demands that he must keep a close eye on such matters or else he will find himself in the bankruptcy court.  But in a democratically-governed State there is no person holding the same position as the owner or the directors <Col N="865" /> of a business, because experience has shown that in a country such as this there is not a widespread public opinion in support of economy.  Why? Because the ordinary citizens of the State are not, so far as central State expenditure is concerned, direct taxpayers. They pay indirectly, and they are not as alert to the need for economy as they would be if they were paying a direct contribution out of their income.  Experience has shown that the ordinary people, who are not direct taxpayers, who are not in the income tax-paying class, are more concerned with securing moneys from the State than they are with securing economies.  We remember that when the present Government were in a minority in this House and wished to recover popularity, one of the first things they did was to vote £2,500,000 for family allowances.  They were, therefore, meeting a popular demand for increased social services, and the danger that I see, and which many people see at the present time, is that while you have that popular demand for increased expenditure you have no check upon inefficiency or waste in Government Departments.</P>
    <P>There is nobody who feels that we must get the last ounce of value out of money expended.  The ordinary citizen will say: &ldquo;Well, the Government is spending a lot more money, perhaps, than their predecessors, but a lot of us are getting some share out of that expenditure.&rdquo;  Thus you have a state of mind which makes for lax control and for apathy in regard to seeing that State Departments are run efficiently. I said that that is the position as far as the indirect taxpayer is concerned. He is not unduly concerned about high taxation, or high expenditure.  If we look at the Agenda for the Government Party Árd Fheis, we see that it was crowded with demands for increased expenditure; but there was no demand, as far as I know, at any rate, from any branches of the organisation for a tightening up of efficiency in the State Departments.  That Árd Fheis has been referred to in the official organ of the Government, I think, as the only body which is in a position to give constructive and intelligent criticism of Government policy, but in all this constructive <Col N="866" /> and intelligent criticism there was no demand for efficiency in the running of our State Departments.  Now, as far as the direct taxpayers are concerned&mdash;those in the income tax-paying class&mdash;it might be said that they would be very anxious about the position.  To a great degree some of them are, but even in that class&mdash;and they are a minority in this country&mdash;there are many who feel that Government expenditure benefits them to a considerable extent.  Take for example, the business man in the ordinary town or village.  That man might say: &ldquo;Well, I am paying a very high rate of income tax.  It is a severe blister, but the Government is spending a lot of money on various social services, and a good deal of it is coming back across my counter and I am getting considerable benefit from it.&rdquo;  Thus you find that the number of people who are keenly interested in securing economy and efficiency in Government administration is narrowed down to a comparatively small minority.  Perhaps, the people who are most insistent at the present time on a better standard of efficiency and economy in our public services are our industrialists.  They have been for some time making demands in that direction, but I think everyone will agree that our industrialists are in a peculiar and delicate position, and they will not bring extreme pressure on the Government to cut down expenditure.  I cannot imagine any of the Irish industrialists marching four deep up Molesworth Street with brass bands, and banners proclaiming: &ldquo;Cut down income tax or else.&rdquo;  I think they would be very slow to do that.</P>
    <P>Thus we have a position in which we have a huge governmental machine, with a huge staff of 30,000 officials, and over that huge machine we have no body which is keenly and vigorously alive to the need for dealing with it, and no one with power to go into the details with the Minister.</P>
    <P>I might refer to the fact that a considerable amount of the increased expenditure has been due to the social services.  We might dwell upon that aspect, but this motion does not seek to reduce essential social services.  It seeks to ensure that these social services <Col N="867" /> are administered efficiently, and that officials will not waste their time, and public money, in many directions. The economies which are desirable could be secured only by having a close and detailed examination of every branch of governmental expenditure. That is not possible in this House.  It is only possible by having a committee, similar to the Public Accounts Committee, but with this distinction, that it would deal with moneys before they were expended and not afterwards.  If the proposal is accepted, I think we will be making democracy more efficient in this country.  The viewpoint is frequently expressed that democracy is clumsy and inefficient; that it is not able to deal with the immense and complex machine which it is nominally supposed to control; that bureaucracy has taken things completely into its own hands, and that the elected representatives of the people are powerless. One way to make control by representatives of the people more effective, to make democracy work more effectively, would be to sub-divide some of the functions of this House, and to place them in the hands of a committee, such as is envisaged in the motion.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be inclined to ask this question: Do you envisage this as a permanent committee, or, simply as a committee to examine the accounts, present a report and then disappear? Personally I think that one of the functions of the committee, having gone into the accounts, and into the matters set out in the motion, would be to recommend whether or not it would be desirable to have such a committee permanently in the same way as the Public Accounts Committee.  I strongly hold that such a committee should be a permanent feature of our governmental machinery, and for that reason the Minister would be very wise to accept the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a good deal to be said in favour of this motion and I hope the Minister will accept it.  I suppose every Deputy appreciates the difficulties and the problems which a Parliamentary Committee such as this <Col N="868" /> will have to face up to.  Nevertheless, we ought to bear in mind the circumstances under which we live and remember that a period of depression is almost inevitable after every war.  History has shown clearly after all wars that there is bound to be a downward trend in values, and a reduction in the amount of money in circulation. One might describe that process as the road back to normal conditions. That road back is likely to be very difficult and thorny.  Although there may be an interregnum for three or four years in a country like this, which is mainly devoted to food production, we know very well that when conditions in other food-producing countries become normal, the volume of world competition is bound to have the effect of reducing the value of food produced here, and to react on our trade.</P>
      <P>Deputy Blowick and Deputy Cogan have given figures to show the continuous rise of expenditure and of national indebtedness, culminating in staggering figures.  In his Budget speech last May the Minister for Finance gave the national income as £131,382,000, of which £37,500,000 was local debt, and the cost of servicing as approximately £4,000,000.  So far as we are concerned the other side of the picture in pre-war days showed that agricultural output fell by 11 per cent. since 1938, and industrial production by 24 per cent.  So far as national indebtedness generally is concerned, it may appear that our capacity and our national income are sufficient to bear these charges, but if what I envisage happens&mdash;and I think the House will agree that it is inevitable that a falling back follows a reduction of national income&mdash;the question arises, whether the security of the State could continue to bear the cost, because the security consists of the national capacity of this country to produce.</P>
      <P>That is an aspect of our national, economic position that ought carefully to be taken into account.  The Minister for Finance has, in a number of recent Budget statements, given expression to uneasiness and disquietude regarding the rising costs. This year he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="869" />&ldquo;As regards the Civil Service, the growth to which I have referred in previous years still continues and, on the 1st January of this year, the total number of persons employed reached the peak point, so far, of 30,333 civil servants.  This was 787 higher than the number on the same date last year and 1,252 above the 1943 figure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One would expect that, before 1944, we would have reached the peak point with regard to any increase in State services due to emergency conditions. Still the curve regarding the Civil Service continued to show an upward trend.  The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The cost of the service has risen in a still more disquieting measure. The annual outlay on remuneration of civil servants is now estimated at £7,300,000.  The corresponding estimates for 1943 and 1944 were £6,100,000, and £6,470,000 respectively. The increase in the rates of ordinary and emergency bonus was the main element in the expansion here... The figures of cost I have given, so far, refer to the salaries, wages and bonus of civil servants, including part-time employees... They do not include payments for overtime or travelling and subsistence expenses.  Nor do they include payments to persons remunerated on a piece-work, task-work, capitation or free basis or to persons employed on schemes of work of a temporary nature, as none of these persons can be regarded as a civil servant.  Adding all these payments to the £7,300,000 I have already mentioned as the amount which we are now spending on Civil Service remuneration, we arrive at a total figure of over £8,100,000.  I can remember a time when the entire cost of government for the 32 counties of Ireland was not much more than that sum.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The cost of the Civil Service for the last financial year was £8,100,000.  To get a complete picture, we must refer to the number of civil servants.  In 1932 the number of civil servants was 21,793.  In 1939 the number was 26,775. Apart altogether from the emergency, there was a very steep rise in the number of civil servants employed as between <Col N="870" /> 1932 and 1939.  In 1941, the number of civil servants employed was 27,400; in 1943, 29,081; in 1944, 29,446, and in 1945, 30,333.  That does not include some persons who were working in a temporary capacity.  The cost of salaries, wages and allowances over the same period was: 1932, £3,819,542; 1939, £5,065,117; 1941, £5,480,785; 1943, £6,100,000; 1944, £6,740,000; 1945, £7,300,000.  Add travelling and subsistence allowances to that figure and it is brought up to £8,100,000.  The Minister has expressed alarm and concern in recent years in his Budget statements regarding rising costs and the cost of administration.  In his last Budget, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As I said last year, it is the expansion of State activity itself rather than the growth of the Civil Service that causes me the greater concern. I look upon the restless activity of the State as the disease and the growth of the Civil Service, however distressing, as merely one of the symptoms.  But I would remind those who regard the symptom as the greater evil that we cannot have the disease without the symption. Government policy has raised the tempo of activity in every Department of State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is typical of the references made by the Minister in recent years to the problem of the cost of administration. But nothing has been done about it, though, so far as I remember, some sort of inter-departmental committee was set up early in the emergency to see how far economies could be effected.  The House has not been informed of the result of the inquiries made at the time and it is not reflected in any of the statistics.</P>
    <P>The Deputies who tabled this motion are doing a service in bringing this matter to the attention of the House and in suggesting that something definite should be done before the burden becomes oppressive and out of all proportion to the national income. I have said before that, so far as this Party is concerned, we would not at any time criticise expenditure aiming at the stimulation of production.  That is, after all, a necessary pre-requisite to better social conditions, to social <Col N="871" /> security and the other admirable things which we all desire.  The community has to pay for social services and social security.  The cost of those services must be related sooner or later to the national income.  Expenditure on stimulating production is, therefore, economically sound.  The greatest criticism that can be levied at our expenditure at present is that so large a percentage of it is directed to other than productive schemes.  Now that we have to travel back to normality by a very difficult and thorny road, we should face up in a realistic way to the problems which require to be tackled. We should see how far expenditure can be curtailed and ensure that a larger proportion of it is devoted to stimulating production.  I do not want to labour the question unduly.  The former Minister for Finance has, as I have said, expressed his concern about this whole problem and I take it that the present Minister is prepared to do something about it.</P>
    <P>In a reply to a question put down by Deputy McMenamin on the 4th February, 1942, which appears in a tabulated form in the Official Report, the number of civil servants and State officials and the cost of such officials are given under different headings. For instance, Secretaries of Departments, chairmen of boards of commissioners and heads of Departments of State, numbered in 1932 15.  In 1939 the number was still 15 and in 1941 it was reduced to 14.  Assistant secretaries in 1932 numbered 14, in 1939 the number had risen to 25, and in 1941 it was 24.  Principal officers in 1932 numbered 22, in 1939, 44, and in 1941, 46.  Assistant principal officers numbered 30 in 1932, 58 in 1939, and 60 in 1941.  Junior administrative officers in 1932 numbered 24, in 1939, 43, and in 1941, 49. Higher executive officers numbered 176 in 1932, 202 in 1939, and 221 in 1941. Junior executive officers numbered 429 in 1932, 620 in 1939 and 604 in 1941. In the different categories there is a steep rise over the period.</P>
    <P>One thing which has struck me about this whole problem of administration is the necessity of expediting the work <Col N="872" /> in Departments, getting quicker decisions and improving the machinery generally in each Department.  I must say that I do not know very much about it, but it often struck me that there is not a sufficient distribution of executive responsibility in each Department. Files appears to be travelling up to the one individual to make an executive decision all the time.  The executive responsibility is placed on one individual and the system has the effect of simply glutting up the lanes through which the files have to travel to that one man.  The British Government found many years ago that they had to change that system in their Departmental work and to divide executive responsibility to a greater extent.  I think a step of that kind would definitely make for economy and that instead of having one executive officer you should have three or four dealing with decisions.  If they made mistakes, you would have a way of dealing with them.  Certainly it seems unreasonable to have all the work of a Department travelling towards one man while the junior officers are employed in making notes on the files as they travel up to him.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies are familiar with the manner in which the machine functions and with the way in which matters travel up to one man to make a decision. It seems necessary, in view of the volume of work that has to be handled in our Departments nowadays, and the expansion of social and other services to the community, to have more expeditious decisions.  Expeditious decisions, I feel, mean a reduction of work for the Department in the long run.  If you can get rid of a file and get a decision on it promptly it will mean that the work will be done much cheaper.  I may be altogether wrong in that idea but it has often struck me that a more divided responsibility, so far as executive decisions are concerned, would lead not merely to more expeditious decisions but to economy.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any necessity to go into any great detail on the subject matter of the motion.  So far as the proposal to set up a committee to examine into problems of this sort is <Col N="873" /> concerned, there is nothing new about it.  Britain, America, and other countries have dealt with this problem in a somewhat similar manner.  I think President Truman was chairman of a committee in America that sat for some months examining how departmental work and, as a matter of fact, war production generally, could be speeded up, and departmental decisions made more expeditiously.  Surely, if this Parliament is the supreme authority so far as expenditure is concerned&mdash;remember every penny spent in administration must be voted in this House, and must be properly accounted for to this House through the Committee of Public Accounts&mdash; this proposal should meet with approval. I think it is economically sound that no Minister can, without the consent of the House, expend beyond the sum of money voted for the financial year.  If the House has power to control expenditure in that way, surely it is not unreasonable to suggest that the House should get an opportunity of setting up a committee of this sort to examine into national expenditure and indebtedness at the present time?  Considering the circumstances in which we now live, and facing realistically the problems with which we shall be confronted in the next four or five years, if we take time by the forelock and have a careful examination made by sending for executive officers, documents, and economists if necessary, to find out where economies can be effected, and where administrative costs generally can be tightened up, it will have beneficial results.  I have pleasure in supporting the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind, this is one of the most popular motions that could come before the House.  If it did nothing else except to call attention to the expenditure on the Civil Service in this country, it brings us nearer to a true realisation of the position.  Deputy Hughes commented on the increase in the number of higher executive officers from the year 1932 to the present, but that increase was only to be expected. We had in 1932 a nation that was staggering, industry dying out, agriculture said to be dead, and social services gone by the board or severely reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="874" /> All these services have been brought to life again.  New industries have been started, housing schemes trebled, unemployment assistance and widows and orphans' pensions provided for. To administer all these services it was necessary to recruit extra officials. Social services have increased by leaps and bounds.  As a matter of fact, if you take the Estimates for 1932 and compare them with the Estimates for 1939, the big change becomes at once apparent.  Compare for instance the housing position in 1932 and 1933.  We need not go very far to see the need for increased officials to deal with that service.  Then any Deputy who for the last few years has had occasion to go round to the Department of Supplies, as most of us had, can see where the increase arose there.  Of course it was an abnormal increase, an increase that was necessary for the war period.  Now that the necessity has passed, we can expect that the officials will disappear also.</P>
    <P>Then we have to consider the large number of officials who had to be brought into the service on account of the campaign that was carried on here against tillage.  People got the idea that they had a certain amount of support in their attitude towards tillage. That meant that inspectors had to be brought in by the Department of Agriculture and sent around to inspect, and there had to be prosecutions in an endeavour to secure that the people would be fed during the emergency. That is why more officials were called. As regards expenditure: not so many years ago we had to fight a general election on the issue that more expenditure for the Civil Service was considered necessary.</P>
    <P>As I have said, it is an important motion, although I do not know that setting up select committees or commissions to inquire into anything is going to do any good in this country. I do not believe it is.  I have already given my views on that matter in the House.  In my opinion, a select committee or commission will report just as the particular Department that sets it up wants it to report&mdash;nothing more and nothing less.  I have no belief in them; I never had and never will have.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="875" /> They just go in and do as they are told.</P>
    <P>If a select committee is appointed in the morning to inquire into this matter, how is it to be constituted? Is it to be a select committee of civil servants?  Are they to find whether there are enough civil servants or whether they require more or less?  Are they to inquire as to whether their salaries are high enough; as to what economies can be effected?  It is rather a joke.  I do not see any great use in it anyway.  I do not believe in setting up any man as his own judge. If that kind of committee is set up, I should like to hear from Deputy Blowick or Deputy Cogan, who is going to constitute the committee.  Is it going to be a select committee of members of the Oireachtas, such as that proposed in connection with the method of election of the Seanad? Where is the committee going to come from?  Whom is it to be composed of?  I should like Deputy Cogan and Deputy Blowick to tell me.  Is it to be a select committee of the House?</P>
    <P>From past experience, I cannot place any reliance on such committees. Some of the recommendations made by select committees of this House that were set up from time to time would not lead anybody to place any reliance on the findings of such committees.  I do not want to labour the question.  I have given my views as well as I can.</P>

    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Worthy of consideration. The arguments he has advanced would seem to be against the motion.  I should like to direct attention to portion of a statement made by the Minister for Finance in introducing his Budget this year.  Speaking of the tendency of legislation generally, of coming to this House seeking subsidies, social services, palliatives of all kinds, he said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I could give many instances to <Col N="876" /> drive home my argument that we cannot have more State services without more State servants.  To think otherwise is a pure delusion, and those who in this House, in the Seanad, in the local boards and elsewhere make speeches and propose motions in favour of additional measures of social security, guaranteed markets, guaranteed prices, minimum wages, further land division, extended afforestation and regulation of a hundred and one activities are all, in effect, advocates of a larger and more costly Civil Service, of what in other moods some of them would call a bigger bureaucracy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That statement of the Minister for Finance, introducing this year's Budget, contains a very strong condemnation of Government policy looked at solely from the angle of finance.  I should like to put this point of view to the House: The tendency of all legislation in recent years has been to set up new machinery.  Every time we introduce a measure providing for some subsidy, some palliative, some social service, the inevitable result is a Civil Service demand for staff to administer that particular service.  As long as the House is so minded, so long, as far as I can see, will the increase in taxation continue.  There are undoubtedly Departments of State in which it was essential to provide necessary social services to combat existing social evils and in so far as Government policy was directed towards remedying existing social evils, I am sure no Deputy would question the expenditure involved or the provision of the necessary staff to administer the particular service.  But, when everything that comes to this House involves, directly or indirectly, a demand of some kind for extra staff, then we have to sit up and ask ourselves where we are going because, in the ultimate, it is we who, by passing these measures, authorise the increased expenditure.  It is futile for Deputies, particularly Deputies on the Government Benches, to come here and say they support this motion while in actual fact they are the people responsible for imposing extra expenditure upon the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="877" /> The Minister went further.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There are, I admit, spheres in which the extension of Governmental activity was and is inevitable, in which the results aimed at are in the public interest, and can be achieved only by the Government, or can be much more effectively achieved by it than by any other agency.  But are we sufficiently critical in judging whether this condition is fulfilled in each particular case?  I am convinced that we are not, that, on the contrary, most of us&mdash;and this is true of all Parties in Dáil and Seanad&mdash; whatever theories we may profess, show in practice a bias in favour of Governmental action and against leaving desirable reforms to the initiative of persons and organisations outside the charmed circle formed by the Oireachtas and the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, in connection with 99 out of every 100 measures which come before this House we have hardly one word of criticism from the back-benchers of the Government Party.  We have no critical analysis of the Government measures and we certainly have no effort on their part to check the spiral of increased expenditure and increased taxation. We have made some effort to try to point out the error of their ways but without success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We never hear you.  You are dumb.  That is why we have to talk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Deputy must not have been here on many occasions. Again, I will quote the Minister:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;My remarks on these matters in previous speeches have evoked such a poor response that I do not feel hopeful of being able now to impress the House with a sense of the dangers we are incurring.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All I will say to that is that he had a right to try to impress his views first of all upon the members of his own Party, and, having converted his own Party to his views, then I am sure that, if he came to the House, he would have the full support of the House <Col N="878" /> behind him in the views that he had expressed.  As he further says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We cannot continuously increase the power of the central Government without restricting the freedom and undermining the morale and the self-reliance of the citizen.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To-day we have reached this position as a result, that everybody in this country, poor and rich, is looking to the State for something, and, when they look to the State for something, it is generally to the Deputies on the opposite benches, they look.  The business man is looking for a subsidy.  The worker is looking for some measure of relief.  The unemployed are looking for a greater measure of relief for their benighted condition.  Does it not all boil down to this: that the Government policy up to now has been what I might describe in common language as a stop-gap policy?  When an emergency of some sort arises, they are like the improvident and neglectful farmer who does not look after his fences in time.  He sticks a bush in a fence for the time being, and says: &ldquo;That will keep them out overnight, anyway,&rdquo; and then carries on in a merry, reckless fashion until all the fences are down.  Then the Minister went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Those most hostile to totalitarianism are often the warmest and most persistent advocates of direct State activity in many spheres. State control carried far enough is totalitarianism.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I agree with every word the Minister has said in his Budget statement&mdash; every word of it is true&mdash;and I hope the present Minister for Finance has made a very close study of the implications contained in its passages, and that we shall see a new departure in financial policy.  It is futile to attempt to stop gaps; it is futile to attempt to provide palliatives for every evil.  You have to face the broad issue that the Government policy has never been directed towards providing full employment for our people, and until that policy is faced up to broadly, you will have Minister after Minister coming to the House to provide another measure of relief for some unfortunate people <Col N="879" /> who cannot find a living in their homeland. Thousands of our people are forced to emigrate; thousands of our people cannot get employment here.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, I hold it is futile to be attempting to provide medicine which will not care the disease.  You need a surgical operation; you need to cut out the canker that is at the root of this thing.  You need, in other words, to face up to the serious economic position in which this country finds itself at the moment.  We have to find, if at all possible, a method by which we can keep our own people at home and put them into productive employment on the land and in industry.</P>
    <P>I will go further and say that, in attempting that, the Government will certainly need to consider some measure of protection, some measure of assisting the policy of full employment. My suggestion on that point is that they should endeavour to find the measure of protection or subsidy, whatever you like to call it, that will be needed from some other source than State funds.  In other words, if a particular industry feels that it needs some form of protection in its infant stages, the subsidy should come from the industry itself.  The industry itself should be so financed that it can find within itself the measure of relief it needs.  I am not going to particularise any industry, but if a particular industrialist feels that he cannot compete with an outside competitor in the early stages of his development, by all means let him have some form of protection, but let that form of protection be directed solely to putting him on his feet.  But, once he is on his feet, let him fend for himself.  That should apply to all forms of economic activity. It will be possible to find within the framework of any industry, whether it is agriculture or a manufacturing industry, a method by which what I have in mind can be carried out, so that the industry can get the protection it needs without coming to the Exchequer for a subsidy.</P>
    <P>Now, as I say, our present financial and social policy is leading rapidly to the pauperising of this country.  We <Col N="880" /> have become a nation of beggars.  We have become a nation of job-seekers, of subsidy-seekers, or relief seekers, and seekers for all kinds of palliatives, and the people on the opposite benches are the very people who are responsible for that state of affairs.  As I listened to the figures quoted by Deputies Cogan and Blowick and also to the figures quoted by Deputy Hughes, I was highly amused.  I do not think it is necessary to go into any detailed figures to convince any intelligent person that the cost of administration in this country has increased out of all proportion and that the service we get for the increased cost is if anything, less efficient to-day than it was ten or 20 years ago.  I do not think it is necessary to go into the cost or into the personnel of the different Departments to convince any reasonable person that our policy is tending in such a direction that, at some stage or another, we must arrive at a definite full stop.</P>
    <P>We have at the moment reached saturation point and we cannot go much further in the direction of taxation. Supply Services, which not many years ago cost somewhere about £20,000,000, to-day cost well over £40,000,000&mdash;£46,000,000, to be accurate. The cost of administering this country in 1913-14&mdash;the whole 32 counties&mdash;was somewhere between £11,000,000 and £13,000,000&mdash;it was £12,000,000 exactly, I am informed.  To-day, the cost is well over £50,000,000. We have to ask ourselves whether we to-day are any better off, with our home Government, with our independence, than we were in 1913-14.  Is the taxpayer to-day getting a better crack of the whip?  Is he getting any more out of the country to-day than he got in 1913-14?  I need not remind Deputy Corry that the local rates have gone up within the last ten years or so, in some cases to five times what they were.</P>
    <P>Judging by the demands being made in legislation coming before the House, I cannot see how taxation is going to stop even where it is.  I am a member of a local authority, the Dun Laoghaire Borough Corporation, and I know full well that the schemes we have in hand <Col N="881" /> and in contemplation at the moment make it almost inevitable that our rates, which at present are 18/6 in the £, will not stop short of 30/- within a few years.  The Minister may say that we can afford to pay, that the ratepayer has never paid enough for housing, public libraries or other social services.  He may also be able to justify an income-tax of 7/6 or 8/- in the £.  We are not fighting a war, we have not fought a war and, judging by the statements made at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis, we are not likely to fight a war.  I put it to the Minister that there are many Departments of State in which it is possible and highly probable that the pruning knife could be used and expenditure cut down.</P>
    <P>We took over an administration from the British Government at a time of crisis and we had to take whatever machinery was at hand then and carry on.  We never really got down to the job of deciding for ourselves whether that imperial machinery imposed upon us suited us at all or not.  We have patched it and we have introduced new machinery here and there but, taking it by and large, we are still carrying on the old imperical basis.  In fact, we have gone worse: we have added Ministers and Secretaries and Departments of State at an alarming rate. Whatever may be said of the bad British Government in the past, it is certain that they ran this country with a Chief Secretary, an Under Secretary and a few individuals down at the Castle.  They were sufficient for Ireland under the Lord Lieutenant and were able to run the whole show.  Now we have Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries, Secretaries, Assistant Secretaries, and so on <i>ad infinitum.</i></P>
    <P>I say seriously that we have never examined this position from the purely Irish point of view.  We are running an Army on an imperial basis, on the basis that we are prepared to undertake the defence of this country against all comers.  Has anybody ever seriously stopped to think of that?  I am sure they have, although they will not admit it in this House.  How long could we defend ourselves against a foreign power under existing conditions <Col N="882" /> of war?  I would say 24 hours; though some Deputies might disagree with that and say a week.  I wonder if we ever asked ourselves whether it is worth all this expenditure.  I am not singling out the Army through any objection in principle to the Army or anything like that, but I hold it is a State service in which a very serious reduction could be made in expenditure. Furthermore, I hold that the present defence policy is all wrong that instead of an Army on the infantry footing, we should have something like an air force and a submarine service, if we as an island State are serious about our defence.</P>
    <P>That is one particular Department where we should ask ourselves whether we should undertake this job of defence at all or not.  Would it not be enough for us to have, not an army but a gendarmerie, to assist the unarmed police force in times of necessity? A reserve of 1,000 men would make up the kernel or skeleton of a larger army which could be brought together in times of crisis.  We have also to consider whether it is desirable to have a professional army on the present lines, whether we should not have a volunteer army, in which every citizen would serve.  That may be cheaper in the long run.  I have not gone into this point, but I say seriously that these are matters which should receive the earnest consideration of the House.</P>
    <P>I have had experience of the police force over several years, and know that we took over the existing machinery of the R.I.C. willy nilly, as we were driven into the position of having to fit out a force without delay and carry on on the same lines as the R.I.C.  If we had had time to think things over at that time, I hold that an entirely different police force would have been established here.  However, by virtue of the circumstances that existed then, a police force on that model was brought into being.  It has continued since and, like every other service, it has increased and extended every year.  I hold that we could have devised a much more simple system, that we could have got a less complex and a much cheaper system.  Even <Col N="883" /> though we have now proportionately much less in numbers than the R.I.C., we are still over-policed.</P>
    <P>I am sure any police officer in this State would agree that a better and cheaper system can be devised, and I seriously suggest&mdash;as I did before to the Minister for Justice&mdash;that the time has arrived for considering these problems. In a few years time, the old members of the Gárda Síochána who came in in 1922/24 will be going out on pension and the time is opportune to try to devise a cheaper and more efficient system.  By increased radio and increased transport communication, coupled with a simpler system of policing the countryside, that could be achieved.  The Minister says it could not, but we have never tried it.  The police service is a sample of the circumlocution which Deputy Hughes has described.  You get, from the Guard to the Commissioner, a process of submission right up and a process of transmission right back.  Of course, the cute fellow in the service contents himself with submission and the cute <Col N="884" /> fellow on top contents himself with transmission.  They never let themselves go outside the two words.</P>
    <P>It is the same in the Civil Service; it goes from the clerical officer to the junior executive officer, to the higher executive officer, to the assistant principle, to the principal, to the assistant secretary, to the secretary. The whole lot of them, one after the other, say: &ldquo;I think you should see this&rdquo; or &ldquo;Submitted for your information&rdquo;, and so on.  In nine cases out of ten, the fellow below always tries to find out what the fellow up above is thinking and the fellow who is near the Minister is wondering what the views of the Minister would be.  The result is that initiative, executive responsibility and everything that goes with it are killed and we get complete stagnation and impasse.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. to 3 p.m. on Thursday, 8th November, 1945.</P>
