      <P>Last night I was expressing satisfaction that the Minister for Agriculture had accepted the oft-repeated request of this Party for the stabilisation of as many of the products of agriculture as it is humanly possible to stabilise.  If we are to ensure that this nation will develop, it is essential that agricultural production and industrial production must expand. There is only one way in which you can promote the expansion of agricultural production and that is by giving the producer an incentive to produce. This fundamental fact has been repeated so often that it might be considered unnecessary to state it now, but there are people in this country who believe, or profess to believe, that the farmer is not entitled to fair remuneration for his work; that the farmer must conform to the ordinary laws of supply and demand; that he must take whatever the laws of supply and demand give him by way of reward, and that the State must not interfere to any extent in order to assist the basic industry of this country. Those people base that assertion on the claim that practically everything in this country comes from the land and, because that is so, it is not in the power of the State to help the farmer; that the farmer produces everything the State possesses and, therefore, the State cannot help the farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was pointing out last night that everything the Department of Agriculture has been doing to assist agriculture over the past 40 or 50 years has been to a great extent based on some form of subsidisation.  When we come to the live-stock industry, we find that the State is providing subsidies of various kinds for the improvement of pedigree stock, making provision for premium bulls, for the nomination of mares, and in various other ways public money is being utilised to subsidise the agricultural industry.  If the people who claim that you cannot help the agricultural industry by subsidies are consistent, they should demand that all those schemes for the improvement of live stock, for the increased utilisation <Col N="683" /> of lime and all the other schemes which have been in operation, should be abandoned.  They should go further. They should, if they want to be logical, claim that such assistance as the agricultural grant for the relief of rates should be abolished.  Why do not those people, if they are consistent, come here and demand that all forms of State assistance to agriculture should be abolished?</P>
    <P>There is no consistency or logic behind the assertions which are so frequently and so dogmatically put forward in regard to agriculture.  If we are to help agriculture and to help the nation, we must get the fundamental facts right and the fundamental fact is that the nation depends upon production&mdash;the production not only of agriculturists but of industrialists.  It is true to say that the industrial and non-agricultural population depends to a great extent on the farmer, but it is equally true to say that the farmer depends to a great extent upon those engaged in other forms of production. For example, to quote a simple instance, where would the farmer be without the blacksmith?  There is interdependence between all sections of our people and no one should claim that the farmer will be assisted by putting other sections of the community out of production.  If you want to help the farmer and at the same time put other sections of the community out of production, you must get rid of those other sections and put them out of the country entirely.</P>
    <P>About half of our population&mdash;or a little more than 50 per cent.&mdash;is engaged in agriculture, while the remainder is in the professions and in industry.  Do those who claim that the State should not assist the non-agriculturists in any way also claim that we should put them out of the country? If we do not put them out and if they are not assisted and encouraged to produce, the farmer will have to carry them on his back and they will contribute nothing to the general pool of productivity.  These are such simple facts that one would imagine that they could not escape being accepted.  However, I believe that some members of <Col N="684" /> this House who seek to discourage both agricultural and industrial production have a definite and clear-cut logical policy.  They claim that our economic problems should be solved by exporting our surplus population, even to a greater extent than we have done in the past.  Tens of thousands of our people have gone abroad during the past 20 years to seek a living.  There would probably have been an increase of more than 500,000 in our population since the establishment of this State if we had been able to solve the problem of emigration.</P>
    <P>If we are to make an endeavour to keep our entire population at home, we can make that endeavour only by encouraging, first of all, the primary industry, agriculture; and, secondly, by giving a certain amount of support and assistance to other industries.  It has been claimed that no worth-while industry has ever grown up in this country except under free trade.  The fact of the matter is that most of the secondary industries got their first fillip from Grattan's Parliament, which provided protection for them.  Having been given that start, they have continued to develop.  Other industries can be established now in that way and will continue to develop, so that, co-operating with agriculture, our people may become more prosperous and self-supporting.  Therefore, it is satisfactory to see that the Minister realises the importance of giving the farmer a fair return for his produce.</P>
    <P>The Minister raised questions as to how prices of certain commodities, such as dairy produce and pigs, could be guaranteed.  As long as production in dairying and in the pig industry does not exceed the requirements of the home market, it is obvious that no difficulty will arise; but when we reach a stage where there is a surplus to export, a new problem will have to be solved.  It was stated here recently by Deputy Dillon that that problem cannot be solved, that though there may be only 5 per cent. surplus of dairy produce or pigs for export, the price of even that small surplus must govern the price of the commodity in the home market.  I have pointed out that that would be an absurd position, if it were allowed to develop.  Two ways <Col N="685" /> naturally suggest themselves in which we can prevent the price of dairy produce being depreciated when there is a small surplus for export at a lower price.  First of all, the marketing of dairy produce must be centrally regulated. If we are to have security of price, that principle must be accepted. Then, if the price of the small exportable surplus happens to be lower than the economic price for the producer, a fund must be created to subsidise the export, either by raising the price on the home market or by obtaining a fund from another source.  Since we export commodities in order to bring in other commodities, I suggest to the Minister that the money required for that fund might be obtained by imposing a levy on some of the commodities coming in.  I believe that that is merely a matter of implementing the proposal for a secure price and, so long as the principle is accepted, I think there is no insurmountable difficulty.</P>
    <P>I am of opinion that we should not confine the security of price to a few agricultural commodities such as dairy produce and pigs.  Wool, for example, is a commodity which it should be easy to regulate and control, and it is a commodity for which there is a very substantial home market.  I think it will be accepted that the sugar been industry will continue, and also that it will be accepted that a substantial area will continue to be devoted to the growing of wheat during the post-war period.  Those two products, also, can certainly be guaranteed.  In addition to that, we have one of the most important branches of agricultural industry, although it is sometimes regarded as a small branch, and that is the poultry industry, which is steadily increasing in importance.  Poultry production and eggs, I think, should be safeguarded by security of price.  The Department of Agriculture are making big efforts at the present time to promote increased production of eggs. The Department, in their propaganda, promised the farmer that if he increases production he will get a higher price, and that the greater the production the greater the price.  Now, I should like to know how much security is behind that promise.  Is it simply a <Col N="686" /> vague hope, or is it something based upon the firmest assurance, either that the Department are satisfied that the export price will not decline, or that, if it does happen to decline, they are prepared to take such measures as may be necessary to safeguard that industry and give security of prices? I think the Minister should give us a definite assurance in regard to that point.</P>
    <P>If the commodities I have mentioned are safeguarded, and if the farmer can rest assured that he is going to be reasonably remunerated for his production in those lines of productivity, then, at least, the farmer will have a safeguard in regard to his income, and can plan ahead for the future with some confidence.  The people who oppose security of price for the farmer say that the farmer wants nothing from the community; that all that he wants is free trade.  That is all that they can offer to the farmer instead of security of price.  They say: &ldquo;Give up your demands for security of price or for fair prices, and, instead, demand the removal of all taxes that would tend to increase your cost of production.&rdquo; Now, of course, if you are to accept that view, you must go out and demand the abolition of all taxes of every kind, because all taxes do add to the farmer's cost of production. Even what are regarded as luxury taxes, such as those on tobacco and cigarettes, add to the farmer's cost of production, because members of his family, as well as his workers, pay those taxes indirectly, and they add to the increased wages.</P>
    <P>So that we farmers are asked to abandon a demand for something that would give us security and, having abandoned that demand, to place all our hopes upon advocating something which cannot be attained, because if you were to abolish all taxes upon the raw materials of agriculture, which are, in fact, all industrial products, since practically every industrial product is in some way or another the raw material of agriculture, we, the farmers, would be faced with the cost of supporting, out of general taxation which we would have to pay, those who are already engaged in industry and commerce.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="687" /> That is the answer that is given to us when we ask for a fair price, and I think it is a fraudulent and dishonest answer to our claim.  I should like to make this point perfectly clear.  Suppose we were to secure the things that Deputy Dillon, for example, demands; suppose we were to get all the raw materials of agriculture wiped out: that is, all taxation on industrial production wiped out; would we not be back in exactly the same position as we were in 1931, because at that time there were very few taxes upon the raw materials of agriculture?  I happened to be depending for my living out of a small farm in 1931, and I cannot say that I should like to go back to the conditions which prevailed at that time.  I remember, at that time, taking fairly good bacon pigs to the market and selling them at £3 each. I do not think there is any large measure of prosperity for agriculture if it is based on the level of prices that prevailed in 1931 and subsequent years.  What assurance have we that, unless some measure is taken by the State, the conditions which prevailed in 1931, 1932 and 1933, may not again prevail after the war?  The small concession we are being offered in the way of reduced tariffs, and so on, would do very little to offset a complete collapse in the price of every commodity which the farmer produces.</P>
    <P>We will be told again that when we seek that the State should intervene to assist agriculture we are making beggars and mendicants of the farmer, that we are depriving him of his independence. The very Deputy who asserted that was the same Deputy who claims to have advocated family allowances.  If acceptance of State assistance, aid, or help reduces the citizen to a condition of beggary or pauperism, then surely the acceptance by every parent in this country of a family allowance deprives him of his independence and makes him a beggar and a pauper.</P>
    <P>I think that nobody will accept that view.  We are an independent community, and it is the duty of an independent community to co-operate together in every way to improve the <Col N="688" /> condition of the country, and it is particularly the duty of the State to promote whatever activities are in the best interests of the State.  There are two ways, and only two ways, in which the State can secure that: first of all, by seeing that production is increased, and, secondly, that it is increased along the right lines.  Now, there are only two ways in which that can be achieved.  The first is the totalitarian method of taking the citizen by the throat and compelling him to do whatever the State thinks is in the best national interest.  The second way of achieving it is by providing some inducement or incentive to the citizen to produce along the lines which the State desires.  We must adopt either of those two lines.  We must either provide inducements or impose compulsion all round on the farmer, compel him to produce certain crops, compel him to produce in a certain way or to keep a certain type of stock, and in order to do that we must have an army of inspectors to see that the farmer carries out all these compulsory regulations, and behind that army of inspectors an armed body to enforce these regulalations, and concentration camps into which the farmers could be thrown if they did not carry out the wishes of the State.  That is the alternative to offering decent inducement, decent incentives, to the farmer and other sections of the community to do what is in the national interest.</P>
    <P>It might be said that the farmer is not entitled, for example, to a subsidy in order to encourage him to cultivate the land more intensively.  We of this Party put forward a demand for a subsidy on tillage similar in some ways to the subsidies provided in Great Britain.  The answer to that demand was that tillage pays and why should the farmer be subsidised for doing something which pays him in the ordinary course of events?  The fact is that, in normal years, on a great many of the farms and a great many types of land tillage did not pay.  Permanent pasture paid better.  And why? Anyone who has any knowledge of farming knows that there are two ways in which it can be carried on.  It can <Col N="689" /> be carried on very intensively with high costs of production and a high return, or it can be carried on on the basis of the safer course of low production costs, less intensive farming and lower output, but it might perhaps be found in many cases that the farmer would make a surer profit on the basis of low costs and low output than on the basis of high production costs and high output.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the temptation to a great many farmers, as clearheaded business men, is to adopt a system of less intensive farming, lower costs and lower output.  It is possible to farm a very large farm with very little labour if a system of permanent pasture is adopted, and quite possible to make a reasonable profit&mdash;perhaps on some types of land a higher profit than would be made by an intensive system. In order to tilt the scale in favour of intensive farming, we of this Party suggested tillage subsidies.  There is absolutely no difference in principle between the subsidising of tillage and the subsidising of lime or fertilisers. Both are directed towards increasing the output of the land&mdash;not by compulsion, as some people would urge, but by inducement, a reasonable inducement.</P>
    <P>It must not be suggested that a tillage subsidy would place a burden on the community.  To be justified, a subsidy of any kind must pay for itself out of the increased production it brings about.  That is the governing principle which must direct State policy in regard to subsidies for production. I have no doubt whatever that the subsidising of lime repays the community, because, although the money must be found out of taxation, the effect of the increased use of lime is increased output from the land, and it is that increased output which pays the cost of the subsidy.  The same applies to the subsidising of tillage&mdash; an increased output from agriculture would, over a period, cover the cost of the subsidy.  I do not know why the Minister has turned down the demand for a tillage subsidy.  He has, I am sure, observed how successful that system has been in Great Britain, because, even though we may look <Col N="690" /> forward to a system of farming in this country based to a large extent upon the promotion of cultivated grass, even under that system, there must be a very large measure of tillage.</P>
    <P>It has sometimes been said, perhaps by people who do not know a lot about agriculture, that permanent pasture is the curse of this country.  I would not say that.  I would say that bad permanent pasture is the curse of this or any other country.  Permanent pasture which gives a very low return is bad not only for the farmer but for the State, and everyone will agree that an improvement in our grassland is one of the most important branches of agricultural development which ought to be tackled at once.  Nature has been described as a good mother. That is true, but nature is a damn bad farmer.  Deputy Hughes pointed that out yesterday when he said that the natural tendency of all land, if left to nature, is to deteriorate.  Weeds, scrubs, bracken, furze and all other kinds of non-agricultural plants spring up when land is left to itself.  Though not so noticeable in ordinary pasture, a lot of herbage which does not provide any feeding value whatever grows up where land is left neglected.</P>
    <P>We will be told that this country cannot afford tillage subsidies, derating or any of the things the British farmer has obtained, because our country is poorer than England.  We ought to get away from this inferiority complex.  In proportion to our population and resources, we are one of the richest countries in the world.  I do not think there is any country which, in proportion to population, possesses more external assets than this country, or possesses more undeveloped internal assets than this country, and we should, therefore, be able to plan for the future with confidence. There is room for expansion in agriculture to the extent of 50 per cent. at the very minimum.  One can imagine what a 50 per cent. increase in the total output of the agricultural industry would mean to the entire community&mdash;not alone the farmer but the commercial and industrial population&mdash; and I, therefore, welcome the assurance the Minister has given that stability of price will be made possible <Col N="691" /> as a result of the post-war planning committee's report.</P>
    <P>I fear, however, that the Minister may be inclined to confine that protection and security to too narrow a group of agricultural products.  I want to warn him that if he does, he is going to meet with an insistent demand from this Party to have the number increased. I want again to stress the point that in providing a tillage subsidy, the Minister would not alone be assisting agriculture but would be giving assistance to every section of the community.  In this connection, he would be doing what Deputy Dillon so frequently advocates, and that is he would be lowering the costs of production. The farmer's costs of production would be brought down, and by doing that the Minister would enable food to be sold to our community at a cheaper rate and would enable us to export those surplus products, the price of which cannot be controlled, at competitive prices.</P>
    <P>Another very important measure, one to which attention should be urgently directed &mdash;I do not know if the planning committee have taken it up&mdash;is the cost of distribution.  A very important factor governing the farmer's costs of production is the cost of distribution, not only of the things which he requires but of those things which he has to sell.  There is too wide a margin between the price the farmer gets for his produce and the price the consumer has to pay.  There is also too wide a margin between the manufacturing and import prices of the things which the farmer requires and the price which he has to pay.  Agriculture is a great industry, and yet it is forced to buy most of its products at a retail price.  When people talk about racketeering industrialists, it might be well to point out that there is racketeering also amongst other sections of the community, particularly those who come between the farmer and the consumer&mdash;those who have the handling of his agricultural supplies and his agricultural produce.  During the recent rise in live-stock prices, it is well known that people who are not actively engaged in agriculture at all, people simply engaged in the cattle <Col N="692" /> trade and, to a very small extent, employed in production, reaped profits far greater than the farmers had been able to make over a period of one and a half years.  Uncertainties and fluctuations in prices are to the advantage of the middleman and the trader, and operate to the disadvantage of the producer, particularly the small producer. We all know that it is difficult to regulate and control the distribution of agricultural produce.  It is difficult to cut out and eliminate profiteering, but that is something that will have to be tackled in a very businesslike way.</P>
    <P>I want to express satisfaction that we are continuing to expand the facilities for education in agriculture. I think nothing is more desirable than that those who are engaged in our main industry should have the highest expert, scientific and technical knowledge that can be obtained.  I feel that in addition&mdash;perhaps it is more important than the giving of that technical training&mdash;it is essential that our young people should have a feeling of confidence that they will not be let down. We know that prior to the last European war there was growing up in this country a feeling of confidence in agriculture. For a number of years there had been steadily improving prices in agriculture.  Conditions had become somewhat stabilised.  The last European war improved those conditions immensely, perhaps even to too great an extent.</P>
    <P>But since then we have passed through a period which has had the effect on our young people of making them feel that agriculture is not an industry at all, that it is something from which an intelligent person should try to escape.  When we are told that we should go back to the conditions that prevailed then, that we should go back to free trade, that we should go back to the happy condition which prevailed in 1931, let us cast our minds back and think of the outlook which prevailed amongst our people in 1931.  It was an outlook of despair and hopelessness, an outlook which was taken advantage of by the then Opposition Party to win over the entire farming community to their policy.  I believe that if the farmers had not been in a condition of despair <Col N="693" /> at that time they would not have been so easily misled by the Party that came into office soon after.  We are being asked to go back to those conditions. I say most emphatically that we will never go back to them, but will take whatever measures are necessary to ensure that the farmer has price stability with that security which will give him confidence to expand his production, as well as confidence for our young boys and girls to get the most advanced technical knowledge so that they will make up their minds to live and work in this country.  It was stated recently in this House by Deputy Dillon that we have a surplus of brains in this country, an exportable surplus, and that our policy should be to export the best brains of our people to other nations to build up other nations.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Dillon tried to be logical&mdash;he does not usually do so&mdash;he would suffer in entertainment value.  If he wants to be logical, there is only one conclusion to the policy he has advocated of restricting agricultural and other development&mdash;that is, to export our surplus population.  We must plan a bigger, stronger and better nation or we must plan for emigration.  I say that the man who stands for emigration stands for murder &mdash; the murder of his own country&mdash;because a nation which continues to export its population, as this country has been exporting it, over a period of years, is doomed to wither and decay.  I think that I have made quite clear that, so far as our Party is concerned, we welcome any measures which may be <Col N="694" /> adopted to give the farmer security. It is foolish and ridiculous to assert that, when there is a small surplus in any industry, you cannot regulate the price of the products of that industry. That is absurd.  You can regulate the price of butter through organising the industry to ensure that the small surplus will not pull down the price.  The same can be done in regard to bacon and other products.</P>
      <P>In this connection, I should like to make clear that we have a market here for the greater portion of our agricultural produce.  Anybody who reads our statistics of imports and exports will see that, even during the inter-war period, we had a market here for more than three-quarters of our agricultural produce&mdash;that is, if you set against our agricultural exports, our agricultural imports.  When people belittle the Irish market and seek to represent that it can consume only a fraction of the products of our agriculture, they are simply being ridiculous. I believe that, with an increasing population, we can have a much larger market for our agricultural produce and, what is necessary to export, we can export by a reasonable exchange of services with some other country.  It would be desirable if the Prime Ministers of this country and Great Britain were to sit down together and arrange for a reasonable exchange of services instead of exchanging what I might call verbal &ldquo;doodlebugs&rdquo;.</P>

He has been leading them around in circles with stupid and silly economic ideas which have brought them into the state of confusion and decay in which they now find themselves.  I am sure that his influence will never extend <Col N="695" /> to the Farmers' Party.  We stand for a bigger and better agricultural industry.  We stand for an industry secure in the assurance of reasonable prices, secure in the assurance that it will never be let down, betrayed and left to face the insecurity and instability which prevailed in the period before the war. With that assurance, agriculture should grow and develop.  Without it, it must decline.

      <P>In regard to wheat-growing, for example, Deputy Dillon told us, over a long period, that, if we stuffed the stomachs of the Irish people with wheat, they would not be able to consume all the wheat we could produce here.  That was Deputy Dillon's pet assertion.  During the past few years we have been producing all the wheat we were able to produce and we have not had to stuff anybody's stomach.  We had, in fact, to import considerable quantities of wheat to supplement our own production.  Deputy Dillon used the same argument last week in regard to bacon.  I think that it is time he woke up to the fact that he has been trying to mislead the people, and it is time that the people woke up to the fact that he has been trying to mislead them.  If we had followed <Col N="696" /> his example and if he had succeeded in inciting the young people to blow up the sugar factories, what would be our position as regards supply of sugar?  From what country would we get sugar?  The same applies to other industries; we should not have the cement industry or many other industries which have proved their usefulness, if we had followed Deputy Dillon's policy.  The Shannon Scheme, for example, would be almost worthless if we had not had electric bulbs.</P>

      <P>I approve of the policy of giving the farmer a decent return for his labour.  I approve of the policy of subsidising certain products of agriculture. We are offered as an alternative to accepting that policy, that we can get lower taxes on certain commodities with the result that we shall wipe out certain industries.  I am sure that Deputy Dillon in face of the fact that he was publicly repudiated by Deputy Hughes last night will not endeavour to advocate again the abandonment of subsidisation.  Deputy Hughes made it clear that he was not standing behind Deputy Dillon in his attitude towards subsidies.  If Deputy Dillon wants to advocate the abolition of subsidies, he must first of all start off with the abolition of children's allowances&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Are we to have no more premiums for bulls or boars or no more schemes for the subsidisation of agricultural educational arrangements?  Are all these to be abolished?  You cannot have it both ways.  If you want to abolish subsidies, if you say subsidies are of no assistance to agriculture, you must abolish even the subsidies for the relief of rates.

      <P>Deputy Dillon will have an opportunity of giving expression to his opinions later in this debate.  I am sure he will have something very strong to say about the racketeers who batten on the farmer.  I agree with Deputy Dillon that all racketeers should be dealt with in the sternest possible manner, whether they be industrial racketeers, commercial racketeers or black market racketeers, but I want to make it clear that all the racketeers in this country are not engaged in industrial production, that there are some very efficient racketeers engaged in distribution. I want to bring to Deputy Dillon's notice one particular case of racketeering which was brought to my notice by a very decent farmer.  A decent farmer in the early stages of the war wanted to improve some farm buildings and he decided to purchase some galvanised iron.  He went to his local shopkeeper, a hardware merchant, and asked the price.  He was told that the price of the galvanised iron was 35/-.  The farmer said: &ldquo;That is a ridiculous price; it is double what it was a short time ago.&rdquo;&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; the merchant replied, &ldquo;there is a war on and prices have increased.&rdquo;  The farmer was not satisfied and went to a big wholesale merchant in a provincial town, where he thought he would get the galvanised iron much more reasonably.  He went to this big merchant and asked the price and he found it was 55/-. The farmer said: &ldquo;That is outrageous. I can get the same stuff locally for 35/-.&rdquo;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the merchant, &ldquo;if you can go to your local shopkeeper <Col N="699" /> and buy this galvanised iron at 35/- and bring it in to me, I will give you 45/-.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is typical of the racketeering that has gone on, and that has always been going on, in this country.  It may interest Deputy Dillon to know that the merchant who wanted to make that corner in an essential supply for the farmer, who wanted to make that huge profit out of galvanised iron and who wanted to prevent other merchants from selling at a reasonable price to the agricultural producer, still flourishes in the town of Ballaghaderreen. Deputy Dillon can put that beside the accusations which he has made.</P>

      <P>I have dealt with the Estimate and I have made it clear that this Party will stand for a sound policy for agriculture, based on an expansion of the industry, on security of price, on a fair return for farmers and for efficiency.  That efficiency can only be brought about by security.  If the Minister listens to the advice offered by this Party, he would not go far wrong in regard to our agricultural policy.  If it was in the power of this <Col N="701" /> Party to impose the policy which we advocate we would do so, but as long as a majority in this House thinks otherwise, we can only advise the Minister.  I remember when the Minister was in the minority, and when we tried to impose our policy on the House, the first Deputy to walk proudly into the division lobby behind the present Minister for Agriculture, was Deputy Dillon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>Time, we are told, is a great healer, and I am glad to see that we are now able to talk in a practical way about agriculture and come to a sound decision about it.  We heard a good deal from the last Deputy about the position in County Dublin, but where would agriculture find itself if it was depending on Dublin?  I think we have listened to a good deal of nonsense about this industry.  One would think that the future of agriculture rested upon the views of a few Deputies, when as a matter of fact there are in every Party good, sound practical farmers who earn their living by farming.  I always held that the claim of one Party to have a monopoly of all the brains was pure nonsense and was only leading people astray.  I was glad to hear the Minister's statement, and I listened also with satisfaction to the remarks of Deputy Hughes.  Sound advice was given which, if followed, would lay the foundation for a great agricultural industry here.  I hope that future agricultural debates will follow on the same lines, and that we will get away from much of the nonsense and stock arguments about doles and subsidies that we had in the past.  We must try to reach the happy medium, remembering that many things are right in their own way in an emergency situation.  If agriculture was prosperous we could do without sops or subsidies.  What we want is more hard work, and more commonsense, and then we will not have to look to the Government or to anybody else for help because agriculture will be able to stand by itself.  We have had experience of subsidies.  I admit that they had to be provided when there was a big change of policy, but it would be better if agriculture could stand <Col N="702" /> without any artificial manæuvres.  We are reaching a stage now when we will have to have an agricultural policy that will stand the test of time.  That was the policy of a former Minister for Agriculture, the late Mr. Patrick Hogan, and I think it is the policy of our present Minister for Agriculture. We must have a stabilised agricultural policy that will enable the industry to progress.  If we could reach that goal we would be doing good work.  Many farmers are at present uneasy about the future of their industry.  They did good work for the nation during the emergency by providing food for the community, notwithstanding the fact that the prices they got for some of their produce left little profit.  When there is a European war in progress agriculture has a chance, but when war ceases the position will be altered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that the farmers have done what they were called upon to do during the past five or six years, and that it is the duty of the Government to provide every facility to help them to tide over the post-war period.  I believe that a lean period is approaching.  There is generally a drop in prices after a war and, in all probability, they will reach bedrock in the near future.  Now is the time to stabilise the position.  The principal way to do that is to provide markets for farmers' produce.  Many things will also have to be done by farmers themselves if the industry is to develop.  They will have to be more thrifty, to work harder and to make better use of land that is now lying waste, especially on headlands.  Markets must be found and also transport to deal with agricultural produce so that when there is a surplus in one county a sale will be found for it in an adjoining one.  At present we find that while there may be a glut of potatoes in one place, in another county there is scarcity.  That is due to the want of marketing and transport, because potatoes may be rotting in one district at a time when they cannot be procured in another district although people are willing to pay good prices to get them.  The object should be to have a central market for the distribution of farming produce.  Farmers hope to be able to get supplies of <Col N="703" /> fresh seeds in the immediate future, because they are not getting the return per acre that they should get from their work.  Nobody is to blame for that.  The fact is that they cannot get new seeds.  I ask the Minister to take steps to have fresh supplies of seed wheat, oats and barley secured for the next season's crops.  I believe if they had new seeds there would be a great difference in the return of their crops. I also consider that much of the land that has been worked for the last few years will have to get a rest, and that the Minister will have to review the whole policy regarding the intensive cultivation of wheat.  From practical experience I believe that there has been too much taken out of the land in recent years, and that it must get a rest; otherwise harm will be done to it.</P>
    <P>We were very glad during the emergency to have a vast degree of fertility in the good land of this country.  Had it not been for that fact, we would not have been able to feed our people during the last six years.  The first thing that we should do now is to restore as soon as possible that fertility.  I suggest that we should leave a reserve of that type of land for future crises such as that through which we have passed because it appears very likely that there will be another war within the next ten, 15 or 20 years, and perhaps sooner. Therefore, we should try to restore fertility and to maintain it.  We should also try to maintain our bogs for future crises and future generations. I do not believe that we should revert to grass farming, but I believe we should be reasonable.  The farmer has exhausted his land and he should be given a chance to rehabilitate it.  It is very unfortunate, both for the farmers and for the nation that the practice of stall feeding has disappeared. That was a great source of manure for the farmer.  It was a matter of indifference to him whether he got fertilisers from Europe or not if he was stall feeding.  He was always able to have plenty of good rich manure and, in my opinion, no artificial fertiliser can equal it.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that stall-feeding is a <Col N="704" /> thing of the past and cannot be restored, but we should try to get our farmers to in-feed all live stock in the winter.  I believe with the Minister that far too many fine young healthy cattle are allowed to lie out in the green grass from October to March in an improverished condition.  As a German once said, they are being fed on beef steak.  That is a wrong system. It would be of immense value to the country if all the live stock were kept in the farmyards, where they could make a vast amount of farmyard manure and where their healthy condition would be maintained, and they could then be turned out early in May and June.  We should make every effort to develop the production of farmyard manure.  There is no other hope for the farmer. Fertilisers are not what some people advertise them to be.  They may act as an artificial stimulant to a crop but, at the same time, they take far too much out of the land and, eventually, weeds and dirt will be springing up, whereas if farmyard manure were intensively used, there would be far better results.  I know, of course, that there are times when certain types of fertilisers are required.  I am a firm believer in basic slag for cleaning up land, growing new grass and getting a fresh start.  It certainly is very good, but I would stake all my belief on farmyard manure. Unfortunately, during the last ten or 15 years our farmers have gone out of the production of farmyard manure.</P>
    <P>Farmers should co-operate more than they have been doing.  Very few middle-class farmers are able to buy the machinery which they require and a little co-operative farming would make a vast difference to them.  In my locality I started in a very small way.  I have got six small, middle-class, thrifty farmers together and we make every effort to get the machinery that we would not be able to buy individually. We have purchased a reaper and binder, a turnip sower, a corn drill, a sprayer for potatoes and we are making an effort to get a threshing mill.  It is only through that means that our farmers will be able to get the machinery that they require to carry on their farming.  A man with <Col N="705" /> 20 or 30 acres would not be in a position to buy a reaper and binder or such machinery, but if five or six combinded they would be able to purchase them and it would make a vast difference to the locality.  I find that the idea we put into operation is spreading and other farmers in the vicinity are grouping together to buy machinery.  What we have done in the last four or five years has been of immense benefit to all of us because we are able to have corn crops sown in time, reaped in time and saved. None of us is being left behind because the co-operative unit we have started is not too big and if my wheat is ready for threshing or reaping to-day, the next man will be able to get the reaper to-morrow and we are, all of us, able to have our corn saved and put in proper trim.  If such little organisations were spread throughout the country, they would be of immense value to the whole agricultural community. I know the Minister is keen on co-operative farming and I would ask him to make an effort to develop that system throughout the country.  It is essential to agriculture and it helps to create a community spirit.  I know, of course, that if a man of the wrong disposition or of a cranky nature gets into a co-operative unit he can upset the whole apple-cart but when small units are being formed they can make sure to keep the cranks out and things will run smoothly.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a matter concerning Meath.  I would ask the Minister to take a special note of it.  In the last few years dairying has become the practice in County Meath.  At present, vast numbers of the farmers in Meath are going in intensively for dairying, that is, buying cows and supplying milk direct to Dublin.  I would ask the Minister to tell us, when he is replying, whether or not there is a future for that class of dairying in County Meath because I know many farmers who have taken 20 to 40 acres of grassland and have gone into this business and who are deeply involved in the banks, borrowing money for the purchase of cows and for the erection of buildings.  They are doing fairly well at the present moment but if there is no future for them the Minister <Col N="706" /> should let these people know because if that is the case they are going to be in trouble.  That would be a pity because they are good, thrifty farmers.  I hope there is a future for them.  At present it is a profitable thing and it is giving employment but I should not like to see them going heavily into it if there is no future for it.  These people had been engaged in mixed farming and they have gone out of that.  It is my belief that when the creameries come back to the position they occupied pre-war, these unfortunate people in Meath will suffer.  If dairying is resumed in the south of Ireland, the creameries will be able to wipe out all of us, as they did in the past.</P>
    <P>I think our fairs throughout the country are not what we would like them to be.  The fairs as we know them should be abolished and the live stock should be sold at those centres by salesmen.  The greatest curse to the ordinary farmer is the tangler and the middleman.  They have the fairs destroyed.  They come in groups of four or six and they meet the farmer a mile or two up the road and try to persuade him, by hook or crook, to sell his live stock before he reaches the fair.  They stand over him all day and do not allow him to sell.  One may go away but another will come.  They all belong to the same group and they are giving many of our innocent farmers a raw deal.  I would ask the Minister to introduce some system of salesmanship at these fairs and not allow these tanglers to abuse the unfortunate farmer and to slip it across him.  Sometimes a farmer will sell a bullock that is worth £20 for £15 to these people, who tell him that it is a bad fair and if he does not sell at that price he may not be able to sell at all and then those people may go in and sell the bullock and make a profit of £5 on it.  There should be proper salesmanship at the fairs so that the farmer would get his true value.  If these people to whom I refer came individually, they could be dealt with but they come in groups of five and six and they destroy a fair and hold it up. It is time that practice should be stopped.  Every man should live and let live.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="707" /> In County Meath, there is and there will be in the future a vast amount of land division, and rightly so, but at the same time we have too many men on the land who are not land-minded, and who are making no effort to work it as it should be worked.  Young students in agricultural colleges who, at great expense to their people, have gone through the courses there, come back and find that they have no opportunity of using their knowledge. Instead of bringing colonies from North, South, East and West into Meath, I think we should have a colony of those young students, who would be able to impart to the community about them the knowledge they acquired in those colleges.  Any of those students should be in a position to go to the Land Commission and say: &ldquo;I am a first-class farmer.  I am willing to work a farm.  Give me a chance.&rdquo;  The Land Commission should give those men preference. There should be one or two of them in every parish, or in a group in every county, to be a leading light to the community around them.  If those men are seen to be successful, there is no reason to think that the other farmers around them will not adopt the same methods.</P>
    <P>The agricultural position has been debated here, year in and year out, and we have not got very much results. Everyone has been trying to score off everyone else.  I do hope that that kind of thing will stop, and that we will talk commonsense at all times. What we want is stability and commonsense, and I am afraid we have not got them.  We are talking at random.  Some people on the Farmers' Benches think that nobody else knows anything, and that if we do not take what they say as gospel it is a poor day for the country.  Let the farmers, who know their job, tell us what to do.  We will take advice from those who make a success of their own farms.  The only man who is entitled to speak in dogmatic terms is the man who has made a success of his own farm, and many people who have talked in that way here are not a success.  I have <Col N="708" /> heard people ask: &ldquo;Did you hear what so-and-so said in the House?  Go down and see the farm he has&mdash;why does he not work that properly?&rdquo; We have heard stuff here in the last hour or two, and if we followed it, it would be &ldquo;cheerio to agriculture.&rdquo;  I do not mean that for everybody.  Some men spoke here with profound knowledge. They are experts.  They are entitled to be listened to attentively, but those who talk balderdash, and who will not put into practice at home what they try to force down our necks here, have no such right.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the farmers of this country have done their job, and done it well.  They deserve the best from the nation.  They deserve from this House and from the Government all the co-operation and guidance they can give them.  I do not mean to stand for sops or subsidies if we can do without them, and we can do with out a great deal of them.  The Government would do well to derate agricultural land, and say to the farmer: &ldquo;Work hard and we will give you a guaranteed market.  We cannot give you fixed prices at all the time, because we have not complete control over that matter.&rdquo;  We know that changes in the world market or in the British market would have reactions here. We know that if the price of cows went up £7 or £8 in the British market, the same would happen here.  We have not the control we would like to have.  All markets hang on one another and we, who have an exportable surplus, cannot completely control market conditions. Fortunately for us, the people who buy our cattle and ship them across the water are not the narrow, bigoted politicians that we hear of in England.  The business men who come across to the Dublin market are decent, honest men.  If they see good quality stuff, and they want it, they will buy it.  But we cannot stabilise the markets.  We are part of the community of the world, and we must take what comes, but the Minister should make every effort to foresee and forestall the effects of changes in world conditions, or in conditions in Britain &mdash;changes brought about by outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in England, for instance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="709" /> After that, the farmers must do a lot for themselves.  They have a great deal to learn.  I do not mean that they have a great deal to learn about agriculture, because any ordinary farmer gains a lot of knowledge by practical experience, but we have to learn to pull together, to work with one another and to be honest with one another.  There is too much bickering and narrowness.  That is half the cause of our troubles.  There is too much narrowness; there are too many jealousies and hatreds.  If one farmer gets on well, there are others who will say that he did so by roguery and robbery.  If a man gets 200 acres of land by hard work and thrift, we find some of his neighbours saying: &ldquo;That fellow has 200 acres of land.  Why should he have that, while I have none?&rdquo; We hear that all too often, in spite of the fact that the man's success was due to honest work.  That is the spirit which has created such turmoil in our country.  We should learn to give credit where credit is due. The man who succeeds by hard work, and who is in a position to give employment, is one of our greatest assets, and should not be hounded down.  The farming community should realise that their own interests lie in coming together and helping each other in a co-operative unit, so that they can buy the machinery and implements which they cannot get individually.  That would be a vast improvement in our whole position. We should also reclaim all our waste land, such as big headlands and dykes which are giving no return.  All that can be done by hard work and by availing of the farm improvements schemes.</P>
    <P>The Government has done a fair amount by providing facilities for improving yards, haggards and so on, but I would suggest that they should go a step further.  Our farmers should be provided with granaries for storing grain from October to March or April.  Farmers who have the finest crop of oats or barley are handicapped by the fact that they have no place to store the grain, and so they have to sell it.  A man with facilities for storing 800 or 900 barrels comes <Col N="710" /> along and buys it at perhaps 25/- a barrel, and in the following March or April he is able to sell it at £2 10s. 0d. or £3.  I think the Minister for Agriculture would be well advised if he introduced some scheme to ensure that every farmer will have a granary for 100 or 200 barrels of grain.  That would make all the difference to the farmer and to the nation.  Every farmer would be independent when the sowing season came.  He would be able to say: &ldquo;I have so many barrels of wheat which I can sow, or which I can exchange with somebody else in order to get a change of seed, so I will not have to go out and pay through the nose for seed which is not as good as what I had myself.&rdquo;  I would ask the Minister to try to devise some such scheme, because the ordinary farmer with 25 or 30 acres of land cannot afford to spend £60 or £100 on putting up a shed or store. It should be done for him through the Land Commission and put on his rent for 50 or 60 years.  If he got a store worth £100 capable of holding 200 barrels of oats or wheat, it would make all the difference in the world, because in an ordinary shed with a cement floor which is reeking with damp when the crops are left on the floor you could see them growing after some time.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Minister is making every effort to stabilise things and that every Party in the House is contributing the best it can.  At the same time, our farmers will have to contribute also.  As I said, I am not a believer in doles, sops or subsidies, but I should like to see the overhead charges in agriculture done away with and agriculture given a free hand to develop and it is my belief that it will develop.  Our farmers want very little help.  They are well able to adapt themselves to any kind of new machinery, if they are able to buy it. There is not any type of agricultural machinery that a farmer will not learn to use in a week or two.  When the reapers and binders came in at first, the ordinary farmer shook his head and said: &ldquo;How could I work such a thing as that?&rdquo; At the present time the reaper and binder presents no <Col N="711" /> difficulty to him.  He can work it; he can take it asunder and put it together again.  The same thing applies to tractors or any other type of machinery. The farmers can adapt themselves to them very quickly.  In future I expect that the use of machinery will be intensified. That is only right because, when you are in the machine age, it is better to be in the machinery line. With the huge price that has had to be paid for horses for the last few years, I think the country will be flooded with machinery from Great Britain and America.  I hope we will get that machinery at a reasonable price.  As I say, the farmers will be able to adapt themselves to modern methods of agriculture and that will mean a vast improvement.</P>

      <P>Judging from the speeches we have heard up to the present, everybody seems to agree with the agricultural policy that is being carried out at present.  Deputy Hughes spent a full hour last night talking on agriculture, and I must say I listened to him with a feeling of regret.  Deputy Hughes is a practical man and some years ago I used to listen to him expressing his views with a certain amount of pleasure.  But, as I have already told him, he has been reading too many books.  Now he is dragging in experts from all over the world and he has contracted a little of Deputy Dillon's disease and talks about a profitable export market.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hughes also talked about millions of tons of lime at an economic price.  What does he mean by an economic price?  The cost of production, plus profit?  The Cork County Committee of Agriculture wrote to the Minister for Supplies this year complaining of the increase in the cost of lime and they were told that the increase was quite justified owing to the increased cost of other commodities. If there is no other way of <Col N="712" /> dealing with the matter except by a subsidy, I suggest that we buy the lime and buy everything else at the full economic cost, the cost of production, plus profit, and that we apply the same rule to the things we have to sell.  That is my complaint with regard to the Department of Agriculture.  The Deputy also reminded us that we had a wet climate, he talked about some American experts who went to South Africa and dealt with the erosion of the soil there and the dust bowls.  He spoke about the views of experts in other countries and used their knowledge instead of his own; and he has good knowledge if he would only use it.  He knows very well that the only dust bowl you will ever see in this country is the dust bowl these experts are creating in his brain.  What is the good of telling us about experts that went to South Africa?  What has that to do with this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard Deputy Dillon on other occasions talking about a profitable export market.  I wonder where he will find it.  I think the best tribute that could be paid to our agricultural policy and the manner in which the Minister has done his work was paid to-day by Deputy Cogan when he told us that he was working a farm of land in 1931 and had carried on that farm since and that he would not like to go back to the conditions which obtained in 1931.  The difference between the policy in regard to agriculture in 1931 and the policy of to-day is the difference between a guaranteed price in the home market and total dependence on a foreign market.  That is the difference between our policy and the policy of Deputy Dillon&mdash;the home market for our own people as compared with dependence on a profitable export market, as Deputy Dillon put it.  I have not seen a profitable export market since 1925.  I think that was the last year we had what you might call a profitable export market in which the Irish farmer could sell anything at the cost of production, plus a profit.  Deputy Cogan told us that he would not like to go back to the former conditions.  In these days Deputy Cogan worked in the field for 7/- a week.  Now when he works in <Col N="713" /> the field he will get 40/- per week.  The cost of labour then was 7/- per week, and to-day it is 40/- per week.  That is the difference between having and holding a home market and total dependence on a foreign market.</P>
    <P>We have also been told by Deputy Dillon that we were mendicants of the Irish Exchequer.  That was a nice way to put it.  He attacked the Clann na Talmhan Party for hobnobbing with Irish industrialists.  I have always contended that the more Irish industry increases, the more factories are built and the more factories are working, the larger the market there will be for what we produce on the land and the better outlook for the sons and daughters of those who have to live on the land.  I am glad that Clann na Talmhan have adopted that attitude, which is entirely different from the attitude adopted by previous Farmers' Parties which we had in this House from time to time.  It is a sensible attitude.  We are prepared to pay for our agricultural machinery, for our ploughs and harrows, etc.  We are entitled to have our products bought on the same principle as Irish industrialists are selling their machinery and other products to us, namely, the cost of production, plus profit.  Let the same principle work for us.</P>
    <P>I had a rather amusing experience about a month ago in that connection. Some constituents of mine asked me to go with them to the Department of Supplies.  They are milk retailers in Cork City and they were looking for a larger margin.  I went with them, they put up a case and I thought the situation was rather funny.  Those men, who fill the gap between the producer and consumer, could go to the Department to get an increase of their margin; they could go in and put up their case, giving their costings.  I was in the position that I was one of the producers of the milk that they were selling and yet I possessed no right to go before any tribunal or any other board to have a price fixed on my costings, plus profit.</P>
    <P>I was glad last night to hear the Minister saying that in the future it would be his job to give us a guaranteed market, a fixed price for wheat, <Col N="714" /> beet, dairy produce, bacon and other farming products.  He covered a fairly considerable field.  He definitely guaranteed to the Irish farmer that no longer will he be dependent on a foreign market.  I would like the Minister to take an active interest in fixing a reasonable cost of production for the producer.  We want at least 3 or 5 per cent. on our capital.  I think we should, be given something like that.  Then agriculture and the new Irish industries can go hand in hand.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows very well that the price of beet is not economic.  He knows that as well as I do.  He knows that since the price of beet was fixed there has been a change in the costings of machinery parts.  He knows that the cost of plough parts, various agricultural implements and manures and labour has increased.  At the same time the price of beet has not advanced.  If the price of lime is increased we are entitled to a corresponding increase in the crop to grow which we have to use the lime.  It is all very well to refer to the consumer. We are not taking into consideration the manufacturers of the buckets, the corrugated iron, or things of that sort. They tell us their prices and we have to pay them.  Their prices, if I am to judge by what I saw in the Department of Supplies, are fixed by a costings board and they are given the cost of production, plus profits.</P>
    <P>I submit that the agricultural community are also entitled to a prices board, before whom their representatives can state their cost of production, and they should be paid the cost of production, plus a margin of profit.  I could not pay a better tribute to the Minister for Agriculture than was paid by Deputy Cogan to-day when he referred to the development of agricultural production since 1931.  Agricultural production has undoubtedly progressed since then.  The Deputy said he would not like to go back to the conditions that obtained in 1931.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Not from '31 to '40.  The Minister has assured us of the holding of the home market for the Irish farmer, <Col N="715" /> the market in which at least we can work out what a fair price should be, the market that is not dependent on the fluctuations in outside countries. It is a market in which we have not to compete with the surplus stuff from other countries, subsidised or otherwise.  That is the difference between the policy that has been carried out here and the policy advocated by some Deputies to-day.  We have been told by Deputy Dillon that we are the mendicants of the Irish Exchequer.</P>
      <P>There has been talk of subsidies.  The estimated amount for agriculture is £1,255,000 and fully £1,000,000 of that represents subsidies, because you cannot call them anything else.  Agricultural education is a subsidy.  If we come to the big things here, we find that the subsidy on fertilisers has gone down from £455,000 last year to £150,000 this year, presumably on account of the improvement in conditions. The Minister told us he is going to work this thing of fixed prices.  He also began to talk of reduced costs.  He said the price of artificial manure should be reduced and that we would have more machinery and an improvement in dairy herds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want now, as a definite policy, that the cost of production of agricultural commodities should be fixed by some tribunal before whom the farmers' representatives will be entitled to go.  The Beet Growers' Association should be allowed to appoint their representative to deal with prices and costings, and if there is any reduction in those prices, we should be shown how that reduction is arrived at.  That position prevails with all Irish industries. It prevails with the millers, in the steel mills, and with the manufacturers of farming implements and machinery.  All those people are entitled to show their costings and to get a definite cost of production, plus profit.  We are asking only for what we were guaranteed in the Constitution of this State&mdash;equal rights for all citizens.  Why should a man who happens to be the manufacturer of a spade or shovel be entitled to go before a costing board and get the price fixed, while a manufacturer of <Col N="716" /> food or a producer of food is told that the price will be fixed for him and that he has no right to go before any costing board.  That is my demand on behalf of the farmers of my constituency, and I go even further and make it on behalf of the farmers of the country as a whole.  I think it is the only equitable and reasonable way of fixing things up.</P>
    <P>If there is a surplus, let it go for whatever it will fetch, but as far as the home market is concerned, we claim that the Irish farmer is entitled to that market in full.  We claim that the Irish farmer is entitled to the cost of production, plus profit, and when that has been made up, if there are to be reductions in future in prices, those reductions should be made in the self same manner and should be made fairly and squarely.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister would state the total number of applications made last year under the farm improvements scheme and whether all those applications were met.  I consider that the sum of £58,000 for farm improvements is considerably low, taking into account all the things a farmer can do to lay out his farm and which this Government is prepared to help him in doing.  The farmer who wishes to repair the avenue to his house, to repair his bóithrín, can get 50 per cent. of the labour cost of doing it; if he wants to erect a silo, or if he wants to knock down or build up a fence, he can get 50 per cent. of the labour cost also.  There are very many things which a farmer can do to improve his holding and this Government is now giving large grants to help him in that work and that is why I am amazed that the sum is so low.  I would ask the Minister to state if all the applications were met in full, as I would be very sorry to see any cutting down in this connection.  Every farmer who is prepared to avail of these benefits should get them in full.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the policy which we have carried out has proved so successful. It has saved this nation in its time of need; it has saved our people from starvation for the past six years; and it seems to carry with it to-day the blessing of practically every <Col N="717" /> Deputy in this House, with very few exceptions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before touching on matters of general policy, there is one detail which I make no apology for bringing to the attention of the House. It relates to the problems of flax growers in County Monaghan.  During the war, it was decided rightly by the Government that the production of flax was a matter of urgency, as, in addition to other advantages, it was possible to exchange flax with the British Department of Supplies for binder twine and that was the only means by which we could get sufficient quantities of binder twine.  One of the conditions the British Government made in connection with the reciprocal agreement was that we should produce a certain volume of flax and, if we failed to produce that volume, certain of the terms of our agreement would lapse.  Therefore, the farmers of West Cork, of Monaghan, Cavan and the traditionally flax-growing areas in the country, were exhorted to make a very special effort to produce the maximum quantity of flax that they could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Flax, in the absence of adequate supplies of potash manures, can be a very exhausting crop on the land.  Part of our reciprocal agreement with Great Britain was to give us a quantity of potash manure to assist in the propagation of this crop.  To cut a long story short, many farmers threw themselves into the task with a will and did produce a very large crop of flax.  One of the technical difficulties of producing flax is that when you have pulled the crop&mdash;and, in Monaghan, it has almost all to be pulled by hand, as modern flax-pulling machines are very difficult to come by&mdash;it has to be retted and it then has to be brought to a scutch-mill and there scutched into fibre and tow.  The increase in flax production was so remarkable that the capacity of existing scutch-mills was taxed to the very limit.  When a farmer brings in his own crop of flax, the yield of flax and tow is greatly affected by the skill with which the crop has been tended and saved.  Therefore, every farmer wants the produce of his own flax and is not prepared to accept an equivalent quantity of flax <Col N="718" /> and tow from some other man's product. The miller is, therefore, under the obligation to scutch each parcel of flax brought in to him and to keep the resultant flax and tow on one side for the farmer from whose flax it was extracted.  The storage accommodation at the mills is strictly limited and, in addition to that, flax and tow are a peculiarly inflammable article and the insurance companies will not write fire insurance policies for flax mills which are carrying large stocks of flax and tow on the premises.  Deputies will have seen that some mills were burned down, accidentally, and anyone familiar with this business will realise that the danger of accident is ever present.</P>
    <P>The system of disposing of flax and tow is that markets are held, at weekly intervals usually, in centres throughout the country and the farmer goes to the mill himself, or sends his agent, carries his flax and tow from the mill to the market place, where the flax buyers await him, and there is then a system of inspection, weighing and sale.  That gives rise to this peculiar difficulty, that there is very little demand for road transport for flax except on market mornings, and then everybody wants road transport. Deputies will fully realise that it presents the transport companies with a very considerable problem, to mobilise transport in the restricted area of the flax-growing country in sufficient quantity to deal with the market morning demand.  The result has been that, for the last few months, a great many of the millers, had they depended on the public transport companies to provide road transport to bring the flax and tow to the markets on behalf of their customers, would have failed to get the flax and tow to the market.</P>
    <P>Faced with this difficulty, some of the mill-owners, knowing that neighbours or relatives had lorries which were not licensed for the transport of merchandise, went to those neighbours and asked them to turn out the lorries and oblige them by taking the flax and tow to the market.  Otherwise, the miller might lose the business, as those farmers might go elsewhere to have their flax scutched, in the hope that <Col N="719" /> some other miller may get it to the market more expeditiously than the miller with whom they had been dealing. In a number of cases neighbours and friends did place lorries at their disposal; the flax and tow were brought to the market and sold, not only to the advantage of the farmer and the mill-owner concerned, but to the material advantage of the State, as the sale of that flax and tow implemented the terms of the agreement we had made with the British Government, under which we were to get considerable benefits of a reciprocal character.  That went on for some time, and then the Gárda Síochána realised that a technical breach of the Road Transport Act was taking place, because persons who had not merchandise licences or who had restricted merchandise licences were carrying flax and tow for reward, and the Gárdaí prosecuted them.  Several such persons have been substantially fined, and the publicity attendant on these cases, of course, has had the result that all other persons who would have been glad to help, categorically refused to carry flax because they might be fined and, possibly, have their petrol ration taken away. Representations have been made to the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Industry and Commerce. Now, I want to make no attack upon either Department, because I believe that both Departments realise the gravity of the situation and are applying themselves, perhaps somewhat slowly, to resolving the difficulty, but the latest information I have is that a solution has been found, and I should like the Minister for Agriculture, categorically to confirm this, with a view to enabling the people of County Monaghan and the flax-growing areas to take full advantage of the solution that has been worked out.</P>
    <P>I understand now that if any scutchmill owner in a flax area wants flax and tow carried to a local market, he should notify, in County Monaghan, the Great Northern Railway Company, or, in Cork, I suppose, Córas Iompair Éireann, and they will provide public <Col N="720" /> transport wherein to carry the flax and tow, and that, in any case where these transport companies fail to provide the requisite transport, if the mill owner will get in touch with the Department of Industry and Commerce, the transport section of that Department undertakes to guarantee that transport of some kind will be made available forthwith so that the flax and tow can be got to the market in time for profitable sale.  It is very important that official confirmation from the Minister should be expressly given so as to avoid any misunderstanding or confusion in these areas. I think it is right to remind the Minister that it is necessary to emphasise that mill owners should not, in the first instance, apply to the Department of Industry and Commerce; that their first application should be to the transport company; that it is anticipated that in every case the transport company will be able to make the necessary provision, but that only in the event of their failing to do so should representations be made to the Department of Industry and Commerce, and that then the Minister, on their behalf, is prepared to guarantee that they will ensure that the transport is forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Now, Sir, anything approximating to acrimony in this House is to be deplored.  I believe that the very essence of Parliamentary procedure is hard hitting, but I have always been brought up to believe that where you vigorously attack a Minister or a Deputy the general understanding is that you are not attacking him in his person, but attacking his policy, and that if you say that the Minister for Agriculture is an incompetent person, it is a reflection upon his administration and not designed to offer personal affront.  Unless that convention obtains, Sir, I suggest that Parliamentary debate would be impossible. Therefore, as I understood it, a regular understanding obtained on all sides that, trenchant as our attacks upon one another might be, they related to our public activities and were so to be interpreted.  Accordingly, to us it was understood that it was nothing shocking to hear two Deputies denouncing each other most vehemently <Col N="721" /> in the House, and yet meeting in the Lobby afterwards and being very friendly, with one another.  But if that desirable convention is to obtain &mdash; a convention without which Parliamentary debate cannot be carried on&mdash;there must be a rule that the personal affairs of Deputies should not be canvassed across the floor of the House.</P>

      <P>I do not want to give offence, but Deputy Cogan, to-day, purported to give an incident which was alleged to have taken place in my shop.  There is no foundation good, bad or indifferent, for the story he told.  He was probably misled by some mendacious gossip-monger who sold him on that story.  Now, intending no disrespect to the Deputy, what he says about me will not affect me amongst my own neighbours amongst whom I have been brought up and have spent all my life.  I merely want to direct the attention of Deputies on all sides of the House to the danger of allowing that standard of talk to grow within this House because, if it does grow, this House will become a bear-garden.  All of us here are here, not in our private capacities, but in our capacities as public representatives. For what we do in our public life we are answerable here and must be prepared to take hard knocks and give them back, without ill-feeling or without recrimination, but no honourable man will sit silent and hear his private affairs canvassed scurrilously by other Deputies.  I beg of Deputies to reflect and to realise that if to-day the things in Deputy Dillon's shop are to be canvassed, to-morrow the doings in Deputy Cogan's kitchen will come under review.  Such a progress would simply mean that the Parliament of this country would degenerate into a dirty dog-fight.</P>

That is all I want to say about it, save to go on record as stating that the story recited by Deputy Cogan here to-day, the allegation made by him, is without a shadow of foundation and is false from beginning to end.</P>
      <P>We can turn now to matters of general policy.  I understand that the Taoiseach will to-day make a statement on the contribution which this country hopes to make to the relief of want in Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That will call to the minds of all of us the necessity for providing from our land the principal contribution we can make to that most worthy object.  That means increased production, but it means more than that.  It means increased production for export from this country, because after we have provided for the needs of those who are in distress, of those who are hungry, of those who are miserable, we must think of our own people in the years that lie ahead. We have to say to ourselves that if we want for our own people in the years that lie ahead a reasonable standard of life, that reasonable standard of life <Col N="723" /> must be derived from some source within our own dominion and when we come to ask ourselves what resources have we from which to get a good standard of living for our own people, we must be driven to the conclusion that there is really only one source, that is, the land.</P>
      <P>That thesis will become a tedium in the ears of Deputies.  In other countries, the silver-mining interest, the gold-mining interest, the coal and iron interest all compete one against the other for the solicitude and goodwill of the Legislature, each clamouring that they are the most important, that they make the greatest contribution to the public welfare; but in Ireland there is nothing to compete with the land.  There is no Deputy representing any interest or centre of activity in this country who can compare the claims of his centre of activity with the claims of the land as a source of national income and a source of livelihood for every section of our community. If every section of our community, not only the people who live upon the land and work upon the land, but everybody else in the country, are to get their living out of the land, must not that land be used in such a way as to produce a profit, a real profit, and not a profit which accrues only to the man living upon the land but a profit which accrues to the nation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the land is to be worked profitably and if the productive capacity of the land is such that it will produce infinitely more food than our people can ever consume, assuming that every citizen in the State had enough and some over for his own nutrition, must we not address our minds to the task of how we can sell the surplus produce of the land in our foreign markets and get a profit on it?  We cannot fix the price in our foreign markets, and I rejoice to see that the Minister for Agriculture has come at last to realise that one of his vital duties is to reduce costs of production, because the farmer's profit consists of the difference between the price he gets and his costs of production.  If we cannot raise the price and thereby increase <Col N="724" /> the farmer's profit, the only method left to us is to bring down his costs of production.  What is the use of talking of reducing the cost of production if we allow industrial interests to levy 1/- per cwt. on Indian meal, and more in some years, which the farmers have to use in the production of bacon, eggs and all meat products, a part of which they must export and sell on the foreign market of Great Britain?</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that if he has at last come to realise that the essential of successful agriculture here is to reduce the costs of production in so far as within his power lies, his first duty is to ensure that all taxes, quotas and restrictions be taken off the raw materials of the industry. Will any reasonable section of our community object to that, if they remember that every person establishing a tariffed industry in this country demands, as of right, from the Minister for Industry and Commerce that his raw materials shall come in free of taxes, restrictions and quotas of any kind?  If they want machinery to make any industrial product, there is no question about it&mdash;they simply ask for a licence and they get it, provided the enterprise is one approved by the Minister's Department.  Is it unreasonable to ask that if these people are to get their machinery free of all restrictions, those who are using machinery on the land should be entitled to the same consideration?</P>
    <P>Remember that the industrialist sells his finished product on a tariffed market, a guaranteed market, a market where his selling price is determined, not by what his goods will fetch but by his costs of production, plus a margin of profit for himself which is fixed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and quotas sufficiently rigid are imposed on imports to ensure that the total output of that man's factory will be purchased by the consuming community at a price fixed not by the consumer's willingness to pay but by the Minister's determination of what the industrialist's costs are, after he has got his raw materials and his machinery free of all taxes.  Remember that the persons who are required to pay that price are the very farmers <Col N="725" /> whose raw materials are taxed, whose machinery is taxed and whose products are sold on the most free-trade market in the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, in reminding the Dáil in his Budget speech of the moderate aid which, through the Red Cross, we have been able to give to those suffering from the conditions created by the war, informed you that.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;An interdepartmental committee has been for some weeks examining the question of the possibility of our aiding in the relief of the people on the Continent now in distress owing to the war.  The committee (he said) was asked to make a report to the Government on the help that could be made available by the people of this country, and how such foodstuffs and other materials as we might be able to provide could be conveyed to the countries most needing relief, and how best they might be distributed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He went on to say that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the problems involved are not easy of solution and that there are many difficulties to be overcome before any of the food that might be made available here can be transported overseas.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He said he was&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;certain that all Parties in the House and the whole community would earnestly desire that this country should give such assistance as may be practicable, not merely in money but in the form of food and other essential commodities, supplied even at the sacrifice of reducing our own consumption.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies do not need to be reminded of the terrible conditions prevailing over most of the European Continent. <Col N="726" /> Millions of people are already starving and many millions more are threatened with starvation.  The exodus from Germany of prisoners of war and displaced persons is raising new problems in all the countries on her borders.  And I am reliably informed that the danger of even more widespread distress and famine is very grave indeed.  Every country that is capable of doing so is endeavouring to relieve this state of affairs.  Great Britain, the United States and other members of the United Nations group who are in a position to help are beginning to put their large-scale plans into operation, but even when their plans are realised to the full extent, there will still be a great deal left undone.  Two of the neutral States, Sweden and Switzerland, especially are playing a large part in relieving the people of the neighbouring countries.</P>
    <P>Here in Ireland we have made several efforts to contribute our small share, but we have encountered so far insuperable difficulties, mainly difficulties of transport.  In January, 1943, we tried to get permission to send food to Greece.  We found that at that time the Swedes had been bringing two food ships a month from Canada to Greece, and that no further shipments could, for various reasons, be allowed.  In January, 1944, we tried again and received the same answer.  In May, 1943, the Irish Red Cross were able to send to Spain on an Irish ship a relatively small quantity of food and blankets for the relief of refugees there (1,000 blankets, 100 tons of sugar and some potatoes, milk powder and dried peas), and, this year, after considerable delays, a very small quantity of concentrated food for local relief was sent to the Vatican.  At the end of 1944, and early this year, we endeavoured to obtain transport on behalf of the Red Cross to send 2,000 tons of food to France.  The difficulties from the transport and military side proved to be insurmountable, and, after several efforts, the project had to be abandoned.  That is all we have been so far able to do in regard to food supplies.</P>
    <P>In 1944, we offered to bring 500 <Col N="727" /> French children to Ireland, but the French authorities, who at first seemed to favour the project, later decided that they could keep the children in their own territory.  During 1944 also a request was received from the American Government that we give shelter to 500 Jewish children from distressed areas for a certain time. We agreed to do so, but, in the new circumstances, we do not know whether those concerned will be in a position to carry out their original plans.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember that nearly a quarter of a million pounds has been granted for relief in a large number of places through the Red Cross by the State or directly from the Red Cross.  Deputies are also aware that an Irish hospital unit is about to be established at an early date in France, and I should like to say how very glad we all are to be given an opportunity of sharing in the work of helping, in however small a way, a people who have always shown such friendship to this country. I should like to add that the French authorities and the French Red Cross gave a most cordial reception to our Red Cross delegates and gave them every possible assistance in preparing for the installation of the hospital unit.</P>
    <P>I now come to what we propose to do in the future.  I have here a list of articles of food and clothing, and of live stock to the value of some £3,000,000, which, provided no unforeseen circumstances arise, we are ready to send to Europe for the relief of distress, assuming that we are able to obtain the necessary transport.  I wish to make this offer publicly here in the name of our country, so that countries in need may know what we have to offer, may communicate with us and may help us to secure transport, for this is the real difficulty.  Some countries may prefer to purchase, but I should like, in the name of the Dáil, to have it understood that our people are ready to provide those necessities of life.  It will involve a reduction in our ration of some commodities, but the sacrifice involved will, I am sure, be readily accepted by our people to help fellow-beings in dire distress.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="728" /> A number of requests have been received from private, charitable organisations for permission to export second-hand clothing or other commodities for relief purposes.  It is not possible to give unrestricted facilities. Some limit must, therefore, be set on the quantities to be made available. There must also be proper co-ordination to prevent waste of effort and waste of material in overlapping.  In order to secure this and to allocate the collection of relief supplies among the various private organisations concerned, it is proposed to ask the Red Cross Society to form a committee for the purpose of co-ordinating and, perhaps, directing these activities. The Red Cross Society, which will give credit publicly to the individual organisations concerned, must be regarded as the central collecting agency for the relief of distress abroad.  That society will, of course, take due account of the wishes of a particular collecting organisation in regard to the distribution of its quota, but it should be remembered that the receiving Governments abroad, or the receiving organisations selected by these Governments, may not, improbably, desire to distribute goods received by way of relief to certain areas and groups as being those in greatest need.</P>
    <P>Some of the items we are prepared to supply in the period from May to December, 1945, are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Live cattle, for immediate slaughter &mdash;20,000 head.</P>
    <P>Draft horses&mdash;1,500.</P>
    <P>Bacon, specially hardcured &mdash; 16,000 cwt.  This would involve a reduction in home supplies.</P>
    <P>Canned meat&mdash;10,000,000 lbs.  This could be provided over and above exports to Great Britain, at present amounting to 22,500,000 lbs.  The supply for export would depend on the necessary tins and solder being obtained.</P>
    <P>Butter (creamery)&mdash;20,000 cwt.  This could be made available by maintaining the ration at 6 ozs. a week throughout the entire year instead of increasing it, as was done last year, to 8 ozs. a week for three months in the <Col N="729" /> winter.  Boxes would be available to transport the butter and the quality could be maintained if chilled before dispatch and distributed quickly on arrival on the Continent.</P>
    <P>Dried milk (full cream)&mdash;1,000 cwt.</P>
    <P>Condensed milk&mdash;5,000 cwt.  This would involve a reduction in supplies to the home market.</P>
    <P>Cheese&mdash;5,000 cwt.  This would also involve a reduction of home supplies.</P>
    <P>Sugar&mdash;200,000 cwt.  This quantity can be obtained from stocks of refined beet sugar held by the sugar company and its release could be effected by reducing the ration for domestic consumption not later than the first Saturday in June&mdash;2nd June&mdash;from ¾ lb. per week to ½ lb. per week, a corresponding reduction being made, as from the same date, in the allowance of sugar to hotels, restaurants, etc., for catering.  It is not suggested that any reduction should be made in the allowance of sugar for manufacturing purposes or for hospitals, nor is it proposed to withdraw the special allowance which, heretofore, has been permitted to growers of beet.</P>
    <P>Blankets&mdash;100,000 blankets could be released for Europe as a first instalment.</P>
    <P>Textiles&mdash;Though the position with regard to textile supplies for home consumption is by no means good, it should be possible, without any special tightening of the clothes rationing, to release 100,000 lbs. of cross-bred worsted hosiery yarn in the form of 16,000 dozen knitted undergarments for children or a proportionately smaller number of knitted undergarments for adults.  It should also be possible to provide 20,000 dozen woollen socks and 5,000 dozen woollen gloves, as well as 50,000 lbs. of hand-knitting yarn.  These are the only releases of garments made from textile materials which could be recommended.</P>
    <P>Baby Foods&mdash;A quantity of 50 tons of groats and patent barley could be spared and five tons each per month of other baby foods.  These foods would be packed in paper bags and early distribution would, probably, be desirable to prevent deterioration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="730" /> Stoves and Cookers &mdash; About 500 stoves and cookers and field kitchens could be exported.</P>
    <P>That is the list, so far.  As has been pointed out a number of times, transport is the real difficulty.  My object in making known publicly that these supplies are available here is to try to secure that this difficulty will be overcome.</P>

      <P>I think that it would be true to say that it is the universal wish of the people of this country that, whatever can possibly be done to relieve suffering or starvation in any part of the world, we are the first who should make the effort.  It is true to say that, comparatively speaking, we have been living on the fat of the land and in the lap of luxury while the world was undergoing torture.  Any and every effort made by Parliament, the public and the various organisations of the country to come to the assistance of those in distress will be welcomed.  I presume that an opportunity will be given us to consider the details of the scheme at some later time.</P>

      <P>I take it that the proposals and the method of distribution of the articles selected have been arrived at as a result of prolonged and serious consideration, based on information with regard to ways and means. There is just one suggestion which I should like to make.  If we propose to assist others by rationing&mdash;even drastic rationing&mdash;here at home, I do not think that any complaints will be made or that any restlessness will be produced, provided our rationing results in equal treatment.  Being an agricultural country, where the great areas are the producing areas and the tiny areas are the consuming areas, a flat-rate system is not an equal system of rationing.  In any new rationing code we may have as a result of an admirable endeavour to export more and consume less at home, the ration should be balanced as between the people living, say, in slums and the people living where the article is produced.  Flat rate rationing of butter, for instance, in the butter-producing household and the household <Col N="731" /> in the denser areas is not an equal system.  Whatever we do, we should aim at equality at home.  The greater the sacrifice by each, the cleaner and the better we shall feel for having made it.  On behalf of this Party, I welcome the proposals and, if we are asked to co-operate or assist in any way in the effort, we shall gladly do so.</P>

      <P>Never in the history of the world was there such widespread devastation and hunger, particularly on the Continent of Europe, as there is now.  As we are a people who were always noted for hospitality and charity, it is right that we should support the proposals put forward by the Taoiseach.  Almost 100 years ago, we, in this country, experienced something similar to what many countries in Europe are undergoing now.  We were very grateful then and are still grateful to the countries which came to our aid and who gave us succour at that time.  Even if that had never occurred, I believe that the proposals before the House would receive a very cordial welcome.  On behalf of the Clann na Talmhan Party, I wish to say that the proposals have our cordial and wholehearted support and that we are very glad the Taoiseach and the Government have taken this step.  Through the mercy of Providence, we have been spared the horrors of a war which ravaged the whole of Europe, with the exception of a few neutral countries, which have, no doubt, felt the effects of the war in other ways.  I think that everybody, rich and poor, and particularly the poor, will welcome this gesture, and will, be prepared to make any little sacrifice or contribution that may be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think every Irishman and woman with sympathy for suffering humanity will cordially welcome the proposals for the export of commodities to Europe in order to relieve the appalling plight of the people there.  Under Providence, by the unity of all Parties and with the assistance of a united people, we in this country have been spared the horrors of war, and the devastation <Col N="732" /> and slaughter which have been the accompaniments of that war.  Even on the meagre newspaper information which is available to-day, it must be obvious to all that the position in Europe from the point of view of availability of foodstuffs is truly appalling to-day.  Later in the year, however, if all the prognostications can be relied upon, the position promises to be even more terrifying, with the strong probability that chaos and disease will radiate from the heart of the Continent of which we are a portion.  In this country, there are, as the House knows, many people who have not all they want, but even so, they are infinitely better off than the peoples of Europe, whose sufferings from hunger have been multiplied by the loss of their homes, the loss of their positions and the loss of loved ones in the catastrophe through which Europe has passed.  If war had come to us in this small island, it would have brought in its train death, destruction and intense suffering for all our people.  We would have had to bear a very heavy cross for a generation, and immeasurable sacrifice would have to be made by our people for a long period to come.  Thanks to Providence, we have been spared the horrors of war and, in thanksgiving for that dispensation, we here ought to try within the limits of our resources to help in every possible way suffering mankind in Europe.</P>
      <P>I feel sure that those who have least here will strive to give most, in the effort to make an adequate contribution to the relief of the sufferings which are being endured by the people of Europe.  By our action in this matter, we again demonstrate to the world the sense of Christian values which inspire our people to-day, just as we did when our missionaries brought light and knowledge to a dark Europe in the generations which have now passed from us.  I think the whole country will welcome the proposals which have been submitted to the House.  I think each and every Deputy will lend his influence and support to ensure that national enthusiasm will be behind the proposals which have been formulated by the Taoiseach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I permitted to say this word?  There is something peculiarly gratifying about the atmosphere of this House when it combines in a generous impulse, and I think that atmosphere obtains at the moment.  I think it is a matter of satisfaction to all of us that we have been able to take this first step to help in the relief of our afficted neighbours in Europe, and to indicate that we are prepared to go further if our resources permit. My record, perhaps, peculiarly fits me to say something which might well be misunderstood if it came from other sources.  The whole world, emerging from the maelstrom of war and the hatreds engendered by war, may be misled into forgetting that all men are our neighbours, and that a hungry German is as much deserving of pity as a hungry Pole, and that if a woman or her children are afflicted in the territory of the Reich, they are as much a charge upon our charity and love as would be an oppressed and afflicted person in Poland, Holland, Belgium, Denmark or Norway.  I trust that the spirit of charity and duty, which I believe moves every Deputy in this House is but a reflection of the spirit which will move those responsible for the executive task of relieving suffering in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without further elaborating that simple thesis, I want to make one practical suggestion to the Taoiseach. It is quite likely that our help in the way of material goods will continue over this harvest and possibly into the next.  I am sure a great many Deputies would like to be in a position to make suggestions, but there is really no use standing up in this House and making suggestions if, in fact, expert advice would demonstrate that these suggestions were impracticable. Therefore, I suggest to the Taoiseach that a special Committee of the House might be set up to examine this question, which would have access to expert advisers of the Government from the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Supplies with a view to putting forward suggestions and, in collaboration with informed experts, to proceed with them or abandon them as their practicability is determined.  Generous impulse may <Col N="734" /> suggest that we should attempt all sorts of impossible things and if these suggestions are properly turned down, grave misunderstanding could arise amongst those who have not heard the full reason why they have been turned down.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear mention of one item, baby foods, which will be badly needed.  The raw material of one variety is oats.  The capacity of this country to produce first-class oats is well-nigh inexhaustible, and co-operation could ensure a very much larger output than is at present forthcoming. That is just the type of matter on which consultation with experts might produce very valuable results.</P>
    <P>Subject to those general observations, I desire to go on record as being whole-heartedly in support of the Government in this policy of providing relief for Europe and in being resolved to do my part to explain to our people, in the event of its becoming necessary to reduce existing rations, the reasons why the Government had made these reductions, and the solemn obligation there is on rich and poor in this country to do their part according to their ability to help the Government in conveying to afflicted Europe, friend and enemy alike, the limit of what we are able to send.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I am not surprised at the way in which the offer has been received from all sides of the House.  It is exactly what I expected.  Of course, at best, I am sorry to say that what we will be able to do will be only a drop in the ocean.  If transport, which is again the main difficulty, can be got over, then I think we can organise in a very much better way than we could otherwise do. But we do not know what we can send, so that there is no use in trying to collect and to make available commodities which cannot be transported. This is but a first step.  We tried privately to get something done, but finally came to the conclusion that it was only by a public statement, indicating to all those who would be concerned our readiness to help, that we could hope to make the progress which is necessary.  If transport facilities are <Col N="735" /> made available, then, knowing what transport will be available, we could set about getting a regular succession of these supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion that a committee of the House be set up, I will certainly consider that, although ordinarily the Government should represent the whole nation in a matter of this particular kind, in which everybody wants to feel that he has a personal share.  I would be very glad to consider that suggestion if it is going to be of real value.  It may or it may not be.  We shall see.  There was also the suggestion that we ought to try to see that any hardships that may have to be borne will be put on shoulders that can bear them best.  In this matter, I have my own original views, that we should try, if possible, to get that done freely by individuals.  Of course, it would be very much better if you could put the burden on backs that you knew could carry it.  If we could organise in that way, it would be very much better than Government action.  That is what was examined originally.  Those who know better than I do, and who have a good deal of experience of work of this sort, tell me that these ideas are really impracticable; that the method of organising would be too difficult, and that the <Col N="736" /> only way is by a method of rationing. I do not think it will be possible at all to do it as a sort of different rationing system for country areas which are producing and for cities which are not producing.  The Minister for Supplies is present and he knows more than I do about these matters, but looking at it without any expert knowledge, I think that is not practicable.  However, the idea is naturally one that should be followed up to see if it cannot be put into practice.  Of course, it is the right way to do these things. During the whole time of the emergency, burdens had to be borne.  We would like to have distributed these burdens better than they were distributed, but there are things which you cannot do, even by elaborate human organisation.  If the burdens have not been equally distributed, it is because the real difficulty was to devise a method of distribution in the way one would like.  I repeat, I am not surprised at the manner in which this proposal was met, and I am sure the Dáil represents the country as a whole. I should like to say also, that if the poor, by any system of rationing, have to bear their share, as was said on a previous occasion, there are no people more generously ready to bear it.</P>
