      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether, in view of the anticipated return to this country of a large number of insured Irish workers in the immediate future, any representations have been made by the Government of Éire to the British Government to secure for workers of Irish nationality who have been contributing to unemployment insurance over long periods in Great Britain that such workers should receive benefits in Great Britain, or, alternatively, that some reciprocal arrangements be made to ensure that these benefits will be paid in Éire on the return of these workers to this country.</P>

      <P>Proposals under which benefit in respect of unemployment insurance contributions paid into the British Unemployment Fund could be paid to Irish workers who are unemployed on their return to this country have been made to the British Government and are, it is understood, under consideration.  The question of the eligibility for unemployment benefit in respect of such contributions of Irish workers while resident in Great Britain is a matter for the British Ministry of National Insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Unemployment Insurance Acts in this country any rights to unemployment benefit possessed prior to departure by persons who, during <Col N="1026" /> the emergency, leave this country for employment and who return not later than 12 months after the expiration of that period will remain unimpaired.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will arrange to make a supplementary allocation of kerosene, for lighting purposes, in exceptional cases of illness where no alternative lighting is available and hardship ensues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to consider the grant of supplementary allocations in cases where an invalid is confined to bed and requires day and night attendance, but each case must be determined on its merits.  The supply position does not enable me to give any general undertaking that supplementary allowances will be given in all cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether, in view of the acute difficulties experienced by citizens resident in large houses in lighting such houses, he will increase the domestic kerosene ration to permit of one lamp for every five rooms at least.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The method of distribution of the domestic ration of paraffin oil has been devised to meet the needs of the majority of households and I could not agree to amend the scheme on the lines suggested by the Deputy.  The ration is being increased to two gallons from and including next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the very small number of persons who find themselves resident in large rambling houses, one of whom recently wrote to me complaining that he was sitting in a vast room writing to me by the light of one candle, would the Minister consider examining each case on its merits and, where equity demanded it, giving some supplementary allowance so as to relieve this very acute hardship during the winter months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that the Deputy's suggestion is impracticable. In any case, the increase of the ration <Col N="1027" /> to two gallons should go a long way towards removing any such cause of hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider a case on its merits and if it revealed any peculiar hardship, in view of the fact that the scarcity of kerosene tends to become less acute, deal with it on the merits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I think the only practicable basis of allocating the available supply is that of a flat rate per household.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purpose of a permanency, but the Minister will agree that kerosene is becoming more plentiful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The probability of the ration having to remain, say, next winter, is unlikely.  Therefore, for the few months outstanding, could the Minister not contemplate some slight concession to persons circumstanced as I have described?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be practicable to do so.  The consideration which the Deputy referred to is only one of very many which would have to be taken into account if an attempt were to be made to distribute the supplies on the basis of individual needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the hardship involved under present regulations to newly married couples going abroad to live, he will now consider granting permits to such people to export their wedding presents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the prohibition on the export of wedding presents involves hardships on newly married couples going abroad to live. It will, however, be appreciated that the object of this prohibition is to conserve supplies for use at home and that the types of articles usually given as wedding presents, namely, furniture, linen, blankets and other household goods, are still in very short supply and cannot be allowed to be exported. The whole question is, however, under continuous examination and, as the general supply position improves, the present restrictions will be modified subject to precautions against the abuses to which this type of export is open.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

      <P>I could not agree with Deputy Hughes that only a small quantity is involved.  It would not be practicable to carry out complete investigation into every case where application was made.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes (for Mr. Larkin (Junior))</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will indicate the basis on which the present price of margarine is fixed and whether he would consider reducing such price in view of the exceptional increase it represents on pre-war prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The price of margarine is based on the costs of raw materials, manufacture and distribution.  The bulk of the raw materials, which represent the main item of cost, are imported and their price is outside my control.  Their present cost is much higher than their pre-war cost.</P>
      <P>The price of margarine is kept constantly under review and quite recently the retail price was reduced from 1/10 to 1/8 per lb.  If and when the opportunity presents itself further reductions will be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider suspending the regulation whereunder people must register with individual merchants for margarine because, certainly in rural Ireland, a great many people will not bother to register, as their purchases of that commodity are not regular?  If the margarine were allowed to be sold at a fixed price to such persons as require it on the same basis as soap in exchange for coupons, without registration, it would greatly facilitate a more equitable distribution of the commodity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt that.  The distribution of the available supplies to shopkeepers would not be practicable without some knowledge of the number of customers whom a shopkeeper has to supply.  The reason why consumers are required to register with shopkeepers is to facilitate the distribution of the available supplies to shopkeepers. There is not sufficient margarine, and there is not likely to be sufficient in the near future, to permit of the substitution of another method of distribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely exactly the same liberty applies to soap.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely those who have coupons should, in exchange for those coupons, get supplies of margarine?  I know a shop in rural Ireland where 200 people are registered for margarine and not a single registered customer ever buys it, whereas large numbers of unregistered customers ask for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether, having regard to the decision to provide for the payment of increased bonus related to the present cost of living to persons affected by Emergency Powers Order No. 260, he is now prepared to sanction the payment of corresponding increases to the employees of local authorities in the lower income groups, and, if so, whether he will say if such sanction will be notified without delay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The circumstances of the employees of local authorities are in general quite different from those of industrial workers employed in ordinary private employment, who are subject to all the vicissitudes associated with such employment.  Accordingly a proposal which applies to one category does not necessarily apply to the other. Persons engaged in industrial employment who may be affected by the amendment of Emergency Powers (No. 260) Order, 1943, do not become entitled automatically to the payment of a bonus but have to make application for a hearing at a tribunal in accordance with the procedure under that Order. Moreover, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health has to give careful consideration to the burdens which projected increases in expenditure, whether of remuneration or otherwise, impose on the local ratepayers before he sanctions such increases.  It would, therefore, be premature to state at this stage what my attitude would be in relation to the particular matter referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Since Order 260 has been belatedly amended and no change has taken place in the cost-of-living figure for the last two years, <Col N="1032" /> and as the Minister has, in effect, been governed by that Order in relation to local employees, does he not consider that this is a matter of urgency which should be dealt with immediately?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state if the office of public analyst in County Clare is now vacant; if he will state the terms and conditions as regards salary and appointment, fees, etc., governing this post; further, if he will state who makes the appointment, and what is the period allowed for leave of absence from this office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the negative. The Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, empowers the local authority, in this instance the Clare County Council, to appoint one or more qualified persons to act as public analysts as the circumstances may require, the period of appointment to be determined by the local authority with the approval of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health. <Col N="1033" /> Public analysts are required under the Act:&mdash;(1) to analyse for any purchaser requiring such analysis any article of food or drug and to furnish such purchaser with a certificate of the result of the analysis; (2) to report quarterly to the local authority the number of samples analysed under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts during the foregoing quarter specifying the result of each analysis.  The appointment to the office of public analyst in Clare was made by the Clare County Council, and the remuneration is on the following basis&mdash;a payment of £100 a year to cover analysis of samples up to 250; 7/6 per sample for analysis of samples in excess of 250 but not exceeding 500; 7/- per sample for analysis of samples in excess of 500 but not exceeding 1,000; and 6/- per sample for analysis of samples in excess of 1,000.  As the remuneration is on a fee basis to cover professional services rendered and as the demand for such services is intermittent and may vary greatly over different periods it has been neither practicable nor necessary to fix definite leave periods for public analysts.</P>

    <P>The National Health Insurance (Great Britain) Reciprocal Arrangements Order, 1924, provides for the continuity of insurance of persons who having been insured in this country become resident and employed in Great Britain and of persons who having been insured in Great Britain become resident and employed in this country.  The position of a person with a British insurance who returns to this country depends on whether he takes up insurable employment and whether he joins the National Health Insurance Society.  If he takes up employment and joins the society the reciprocal arrangements apply to make the two insurances continuous, he is transferred accordingly to the society and benefit becomes payable by it.  If he takes up employment but does not join the National Health Insurance Society his British insurance and membership of the British society subsist until the <Col N="1035" /> end of the second half-year following the half-year in which he takes up employment here and benefit is payable by the British society during that period.  If he does not take up employment here his British insurance continues for the &ldquo;free period&rdquo; allowed by the British Acts (an average of 21 months) during which he remains subject to the provisions of those Acts. These Acts provide that a person shall not be entitled (save in the first six months of temporary residence in certain countries including Ireland) to any benefit during any period when he is resident, whether temporarily or permanently, outside the United Kingdom.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that an Irishman employed in England having 18 months stamps on his card and coming back to Éire and having another 18 months stamps on his card is not eligible for benefit in either country because he has not been employed for two years in either country, although he has been working for three years&mdash;18 months in one country and 18 months in the other? Will the Minister remedy that position?</P>

Is not the right to levy taxation still reserved to Dáil Éireann, or has it been taken over by the Government, to be performed by Executive Order?  This is a tax on turkey producers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a tax.  We have a company here in this country which buys turkeys, eggs and poultry for export.  They get a certain price for those things from the Minister of Food in England, but I do not see why that company should be bound to follow the Minister of Food in his prices.  I think they are quite justified in paying whatever they think is fair for what they buy here and in getting whatever they can for what they sell.</P>

With reference to the last part, I need hardly remind the Deputy that any increase in the remuneration of civil servants would result in a corresponding increase in the bill for the public service which <Col N="1039" /> has to be met by the community.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Preventive officers are appointed solely by promotion (following Departmental examination) from the grade of assistant preventive officer and 39 such promotions have been made since 1st January, 1932. What the Deputy has in mind may be the recruitment of assistant preventive officers.  Officers of this grade are normally recruited by open competitive examination.  Six appointments to established posts of assistant preventive officer have been made since 1932, following certification in accordance with the provisions of Section 6 of the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1924, as amended by Section 3 of the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1926, i.e., in the public interest.  The preventive staff also includes a number of temporary <Col N="1040" /> assistant preventive officers (formerly called temporary preventive men).  Between 1st January, 1932, and 7th June, 1937, in order to meet the situation created by the large increase in the number of import duties, 113 such officers were recruited under a scheduling order made by the Civil Service Commissioners, i.e., otherwise than by competitive examination.  Fifty eight of that number are now serving as established assistant preventive officers, having passed confined competitions, and ten are still serving in a temporary unestablished capacity. No temporary preventive staff has been recruited since 7th June, 1937.</P>

      <P>As the reply contains a tabular statement, I am having it circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The gross remuneration paid to collectors of income-tax is computed on a &ldquo;units of work&rdquo; basis and varies somewhat from year to year.  It includes a modified cost-of-living bonus.  Expenditure in respect of staff, accommodation and travelling expenses is defrayed by the collectors from the gross remuneration.</P>
      <P>One collector has a competent knowledge of Irish.  Some of the collectors are stated to have a good knowledge of the language, but information as to the precise number is not available.  I am asking the Revenue Commissioners to arrange that in future a good knowledge of Irish shall be regarded as an essential qualification for the post of collector of income-tax in so far as candidates born on or after 1st January, 1916, are concerned.</P>
      <P>The gross remuneration shown in the tabular statement is in each case the amount payable for the current year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether representations have been made to him, requesting that lectures or talks might be given in schools to discourage cruelty to animals; and whether he would favourably consider permitting facilities for such lectures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has always sought to impress on teachers the desirability of inculcating in their pupils a spirit of kindness towards animals and, in view of representations made to me some years ago regarding the matter, I took occasion to remind the teachers of this aspect of the training of the children in the principles of charity and mercy.</P>
      <P>From time to time, teachers are urged to avail themselves of every opportunity afforded in the courses of school work to instruct their pupils, not only to avoid cruelty to animals but to treat them with consideration and kindness.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether, having regard to the decision to provide for the payment of increased bonus related to the present cost of living to persons affected by Emergency Powers Order No. 260, he is now prepared to sanction the payment of corresponding increases to teachers in the lower income groups; and, if so, whether he will say if such sanction will be notified without delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will state the number of appointments to the office of (a) county registrar; (b) District Court clerk <Col N="1044" /> made since 1933; the number of such appointees who possessed a knowledge of Irish sufficient for the discharge of their work through the medium of that language; and the names of the appointees with the county or district to which appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is, as regards county registrars, 16, and as regards District Court clerks, 47.  Of these, seven and 38, respectively, are known to have a sound knowledge of Irish and to be able to read and write the language well, and I have no doubt that a number of them are capable of discharging their duties entirely through Irish.  A statement setting out the names of the appointees with the county or district to which they were appointed will be circulated with the Report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether his attention has been directed to Article 40 of the Constitution, Section 6, paragraphs 1º (ii and iii) and paragraph 2º and whether he is aware that the British Legion were prohibited from holding a parade through streets remote from heavy traffic by order made by the Gárda authorities, and whether he will investigate and report to Dáil Eireann on this interference with law-abiding citizens' fundamental rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. H.M. Dockrell Mr. H.M. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if the ban on the ex-servicemen's parade from Smithfield to the Memorial Park on Sunday, 11th November, was made with his knowledge; if he will state why longer notice of the ban was not given to the Legion headquarters, and if he is prepared to make a statement on the circumstances leading up to this action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking questions Nos. 24 and 25 together.  As regards No. 24, I would remind Deputy Dillon that Section 6 of Article 40 of the Constitution, to which he refers, states specifically that the rights thereby guaranteed are exercisable &ldquo;subject to public order&rdquo;.  I am satisfied that the limitations imposed on the exercise of these rights in the present instance were imposed in the interests of public order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Dockrell, I was aware of, and approved of, the action of the Gárda authorities.  The suggestion that unduly short notice was given <Col N="1047" /> to the promoters is not well founded. The first intimation that a parade from Smithfield to the Memorial Park was contemplated reached the Gárda authorities on 25th October: their reply, from which it was clear that the parade would not be allowed, was sent on that day week, viz 1st November. On the whole I think that the Gárda authorities have dealt with the matter in a very reasonable way.  The facilities granted for the remembrance ceremonies were better than they have been for a number of years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister please state what are his grounds for anticipating a breach of public order such as is envisaged in Section 6 of Article 40 of the Constitution in connection with the application of the British Legion for permission to march with furled flags from Smithfield to the Garden of Remembrance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In these matters I am advised by the Gárda authorities. They advised me that there was danger of a disturbance of the peace; they had every reason to believe that there was such a danger and on that ground they would not allow this procession to be held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Who did they fear was going to disturb the peace?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that, but the Gárda have sources of information that the general public have not got. They advised me that they had every reason to fear there might be a breach of the peace, especially following the disturbance that took place outside Trinity College earlier this year.  The Gárda authorities had reason to fear that there might be a serious disturbance, and consequently, it was decided not to allow the procession to be held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I addressed this question originally to the Taoiseach, in view of the fact that constitutional rights were involved.  It was transferred to the Minister for Justice and, therefore, I am constrained to address this supplementary question to him. Section 6 (2) of Article 40 provides:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1048" />&ldquo;Laws regulating the manner in which the right of forming associations and unions and the right of free assembly may be exercised shall contain no political, religious or class discrimination.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I never said these men contemplated a breach of the peace. The Deputy need not read that into my reply.  I said the Guards had reason to fear a breach of the peace if that march took place.  The Deputy need not read anything else into my remarks and Fianna Fáil or any other organisation does not come into it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether his attention has been called to Press reports attributing certain remarks to the district justice sitting in the Metropolitan Children's Court on 2nd November, 1945, and also to an officer of the Detective Branch of the Gárda Síochána, which seriously reflect on the residents of Crumlin and on messenger boys employed in that area; whether he has caused inquiries to be made to ascertain whether, in fact, such remarks were made, and if they were whether he will consider indicating that they ought not to have been made and that members of the judiciary and Gárda Síochána should refrain from making remarks which cast reflections on residents in a particular area, or on persons earning their livelihood in a particular vocation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made inquiries into this matter, and I am informed that the remarks to which the Deputy refers were made with reference to the associates of a messenger boy who appeared before the Children's Court on charges of larceny from his employer. There appears to be some doubt as to whether the remarks were quite accurately reported in the Press, and the Deputy will, no doubt, appreciate that remarks taken out of their context frequently give a different impression from that which they are intended to give.</P>

There may, for instance, be cases in which the trees concerned are roadside trees the felling of which is prohibited by Emergency Powers Order, No. 169.  Moreover, the Forestry Act of 1928 imposes upon me certain duties as regards securing the replanting of any land cleared of trees and I am not prepared to waive all such consideration merely because the timber is said to be intended for use as fuel.  However, I can promise the Deputy that every such application will receive the most favourable consideration possible.</P>

      <P>That the Ceann Comhairle direct the Clerk of the Dáil to issue his writ for the election of a member to fill the vacancy which has occurred in the membership of the present Dáil consequent on the vacating of his seat by Deputy Seán T.

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first of five motions, as a result of which one-sixth of the total electorate will go to the polls to elect five members to this Parliament of 138 members.  The responsibility for these must be regarded as entirely the Government's. The country has had practically a general election this year in the form of the Presidential election.  Last year, it had a general election, and, the year before, it had a general election.  Now one-sixth of the electorate are to go to the polls as a result of these motions to elect five members.  It is no doubt a reflection on the condition in which our parliamentary institutions are that, at this hour of the day, we can be doing such a thing, just as to-day we shall be discussing again what additional tinkering is to be done with the Seanad in order that we may have a Second Chamber.</P>
      <P>On 24th October, the Government intimated that they intended to move the resolutions with regard to the vacancies which had been their seats and, on the following day, Deputy Norton, the Leader of the Labour Party, and I, had a conference with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, at which we discussed the desirability, in the present circumstances of the world and of this country, of obviating the Party clashes and minor issues which would be raised for the electorate in going through five by-elections, involving, as I say, one-sixth of the total electorate.</P>
      <P>At that discussion, we gave our impression of the seriousness of the situation and pointed out how much better it would be if the mind of the country as a whole could be devoted to a clear examination of the problems before the country and of the policies which ought to be pursued with a view to solving the problems which exist for the people, without the divergencies and dissipations which arise out of Party jockeying at by-elections.  I think the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice were quite as wideawake to the problems which exist and which are likely to continue to exist, and perhaps increase, as we were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising out of that discussion, however, it was agreed that it would be <Col N="1058" /> advisable that the Leaders of the various Parties should meet on Wednesday last for the purpose of further discussing the matter.  The question arose between us and the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice as to the opinion of the Clann na Talmhan and the National Labour Parties on the matter and the point arose as to whether the Taoiseach or we should approach these two Parties with a view to ascertaining what their attitude was.  On the suggestion of the Taoiseach, I personally approached the National Labour Party and the Clann na Talmhan Party to find out whether they would be willing, through their Leaders, to be represented at the conference which was to have taken place last Wednesday.</P>
    <P>The National Labour Party were agreeable, but Deputy Blowick, the leader of the Clann na Talmham Party, was not in a position to tell me, but said he would let me know by the end of last week whether his Party would be prepared to take part in a conference of the kind.  That was communicated to the Government, but before I could have had any communication from the leader of the Clann na Talmhan Party as to their attitude, the Government Whip indicated that the Government proposed to go ahead with these elections.  They had not ascertained what the attitude of the Clann na Talmhan Party was and did not intend to do so.  In these circumstances, these writs are now being moved and the by-elections are being launched.</P>
    <P>Since then I have had an opportunity of both seeing people in various parts of the country and meeting representatives of the Fine Gael organisation in formal convention.  Anything I saw there convinced me, even more than I was convinced before, that the interests of the country are not being served by asking one-sixth of the electorate to go to the polls at this time on issues which, the Government Party will say, will give the people a chance to criticise Government policy, but which are not issues at all, because on no main aspect of anything affecting family life, production or national security is there any clear Government <Col N="1059" /> policy at the moment.  However, I find the people are concerned to try to lift the veil over the situation outside and to see what is likely to happen in the world that will affect them.  They find themselves, with the war ended, facing problems to-day almost bigger than those which war itself involved.  The excitement and pressure of war blunted our people's imagination.  They were not able to see what was in front of them.</P>

I say that I find the people generally concerned to try to make out what is likely to happen in the world that is going to affect them.  I am also trying to get clear what are the main problems in this country that affect the life of a working man who is rearing his family, on any aspect of our national life, socially, economically or politically.

      <P>In very serious circumstances I am proceeding, as best I can, to indicate the situation in which the elections are going to be carried out-the elections for which the writs are being moved.  I submit to the Chair that I am entitled to discuss the circumstances in the country as well as the effect of the by-elections at the present time.  I am not going to discuss the matter at length.  I think my statement would be a little bit clearer if it could be accepted that I was not going to discuss the matter at length. This is an important matter, and what I say is that I find many people desiring to have it brought to their notice in as clear a way as possible, what the real problems are that affect them. They desire to be able to see through Parliament the policies that are being pursued, and that are going to help them.  They desire to know in what way they themselves, under the guidance of Parliament, can help to solve their problems.  I find that my associates in the Fine Gael Party, as well as the members of the Party organised through the country, are distracted between their responsibility on the one hand, quietly and thoroughly to size up the problems that are there, and to suggest solutions for them, and on the other hand to take the traditional step of acting as a Party in the country by showing their position and protecting their flanks against comers of all kinds. They find themselves in a very serious dilemma because they find themselves forced either to desert their first responsibility of quietly thinking over the problems of the country and suggesting solutions, and on the other hand of going on the hustings to discuss matters of minor interest, things that are brought up in all kinds of side-ways for the purpose of influencing the public mind which has been dulled by the serious nature of the problems around us as well as being bewildered by the propaganda carried on.  We had the Minister for Justice going to the County Mayo and saying that it would be a very serious thing, as regards our external affairs, if the Government were defeated in the by-election in Mayo.</P>

      <P>That was the statement made by the Minister.  It is in these circumstances when we consider how serious our problems are, that I have certain things to say to the Government, that I have certain things to say to other Parties as well as to my colleagues and supporters in the country.  The one thing that I am convinced of is that no national purpose would be served by our contesting any of the by-elections that are mentioned here, except the one in Clare.  The vacancy there is ours. Although we have a system of proportional representation in this country, we have Clare at the present moment completely unrepresented except by the Government Party.  It is represented by the Taoiseach, by a Parliamentary Secretary, by an elected representative as well as by a nominated Senator and an elected Senator.  Through proportional representation every section of the people is supposed to be reflected in the Parliament, but, at the moment, Clare is completely unrepresented except through the Government Party, and it is intended by the Government's action in these by-elections that the Government representation shall be strengthened.  The vacancy in Clare is ours, and we have the right to protest that the representation which, in the spirit of the Constitution, is ours should be taken from us by the Government. With regard to the other constituencies, I feel that it would be contrary to the national spirit to insist that we should contest these by-elections. In the first place, the Government, as I have said, speaking through the Minister for Justice, intimated to the people that, if any of these by-elections are lost, the Government would be injured, and that damage would be done to us in our external affairs.  We are concerned to know what are the external affairs that the Government is working on at the present time.</P>

      <P>I have certain reasons for indicating why, although the writs are being moved, we do not propose to contest these elections.  I indicated earlier in my speech that it was tentatively arranged that there would be a conference between the various Parties in the House upon the general circumstances.  It might strike the Government, when they consider what I am saying, that it would be well if they went back to the idea that we had when Deputy Norton and myself were discussing this with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice.  They might consider that it would be desirable to withdraw these motions, and proceed to discuss the matter with the heads of the Parties.  The Government have certain responsibilities, and they have certain powers.  We are not going to allow any action of ours in the country to come between the Government and its sense of its responsibility, or the weight of its responsibility.  We are not going to do anything to lessen the powers the Government have.  We are not going to put it in the power of the Government to say that the powers they have to deal with a serious situation are being injured or taken from them.  We do not want to go and misrepresent the Government Party in any way.  As far as the Opposition Parties are concerned, these by-elections are a temptation to Opposition Parties to jockey not for power in this Parliament because there is nothing in any of these by-elections, or that may take place, that would give the Opposition Parties power in this Parliament, but to jockey for power in the next Parliament &mdash; a Parliament in which, if the problems of this country for the next three years are not clearly faced, and if united and vigorous action is not taken to face them, no Government, perhaps, will be able to be of any assistance to very many hundreds of thousands of people in this country.  If we fritter away our energies and obscure by petty Party action of one kind or another both the problems of the country and the <Col N="1063" /> policies that have to be applied, then we are going to lay in store very serious difficulties for the people who will be ruling our next Parliament.</P>

      <P>But, Sir, if the statement made by the Minister for Justice has the approbation of the Taoiseach, I submit that the existence of that state of affairs would be good reason for not issuing the writ.  If it was merely, as the Minister now himself says, the odoriferous tail of a dishonest red-herring then we can ignore the Minister for Justice and proceed to the issue of the writ.  I want to say most categorically that in my judgment the day we cease in this country to contest by-elections as they present themselves, on that day Parliamentary democracy ends in Ireland.  But I want to sound this note of warning, and let the Taoiseach mark it well.  He is the greatest politician in Europe, I do not deny it, but I ask him to examine his conscience and to consider has he done his work too well.  In seeking to consolidate himself in power, in seeking to weaken the normal political opposition of this country, has he not only destroyed the political opposition, has he destroyed Parliamentary democracy in this country?</P>

For 25 years, whenever a Parliamentary vacancy occurred, automatically the writ was issued and issues were joined <Col N="1068" /> on the hustings and the people asked to give their decision.  Now, for the first time in 25 years, demurrer is made and, in the course of the demurrer, it emerges that in a certain constituency there will be no contest because no candidate will stand.  What does that mean?  I ask Deputies to ask themselves this question: is it due to an inherent superiority of policy or is it due to utterly extraneous reasons which, if pursued, are going to destroy Parliamentary democracy in this country and establish individual or Party dictatorship?  It is at a crossroads such as we stand at now that honest men can ask themselves that question.</P>

I want to go on record as saying with the fullest sense of responsibility that the day we cease in this country, by agreement or by legislation, to fight by-elections, on that day Parliamentary democracy in Ireland is dead.  I do not think I am trespassing on your indulgence if I ask those who, in thoughtless folly, clamour for political victory over opponents and are prepared to win it by any means, to stop a moment and think that, in their desire to destroy those who oppose them, they may destroy something infinitely more precious.  I warm the House, and I think the Taoiseach, whether he likes to admit it or not, in his heart must admit, that at this <Col N="1069" /> moment Parliamentary democracy in this country stands in real danger.  I am making the submission that it is not because our people have turned their backs on the system; it is not because our people distrust it or want some other system in its stead.  I am making the submission that Parliamentary democracy, which our people are capable of working&mdash;as capable of working as any people in the world, as willing to work and as anxious to work as a great instrument of human liberty&mdash;is breaking down in this country because into our political life are being carried the horrible, rotten and destructive elements of corruption and intimidation.  It is these things that are making it impossible for our people to work Parliamentary democracy. I am sick of being told that it is speeches made in this House that are calculated to prejudice our relations abroad.  It is not speeches it is actions that count.

      <P>I am adverting to that. There have been so many references made here in previous speeches that it is difficult to know where we are. Deputy Dillon has warned the Fianna Fáil Party as to the road they are following.  I think he is very foolish if he thinks his advice will be taken. Deputy Mulcahy expressed regret at a statement of the Minister for Justice made in a constituency where there is to be a by-election.  There is nothing to be surprised about in that statement. In the absence of an American letter and a Churchillian intervention, something like that had to be resorted to.  Is there anybody here so guileless as to expect that these by-elections would be fought without the introduction of such a matter as the Minister for Justice put forward in Mayo?  We have had a long experience of Fianna Fáil tactics.  Whether democracy will fail or survive, they are going to be dominant.  The Taoiseach wants 100 out of 138 seats, otherwise he cannot carry on democracy successfully.  I think this discussion is beside the point.  If the Irish people swallow the dope that the defeat of the Fianna Fáil Party at a by-election will have shocking reactions on external relations, it is good enough for them.  I think anything I can say will not <Col N="1071" /> abolish that, except to let the political machine work, but whether it is eventually good for the nation is a matter for the nation to decide.  That is my contribution and the only point I make is that these things are best said on the hustings.</P>

      <P>As one of the Independent group, and in view of the fact that we may have a division on this matter of the moving of these writs, I would like that, in giving my vote, there would be no misunderstanding.  I was rather surprised at the speech made by Deputy Mulcahy, Leader of the Opposition. I had the feeling that he was talking with his tongue in his cheek, as I can scarcely credit that, at this stage, Deputy Mulcahy&mdash;who, in my view, which I still hold, is a democrat to the backbone&mdash;should advocate in any way, even indirectly, that these by-elections should not be held.  I feel that not alone Deputy Mulcahy but many other people are considerably overrating our importance so far as it relates to external relations.  I am wondering what John Bull is really thinking about us or what Uncle Sam cares about us. Are we not overrating our importance in such matters?</P>
      <P>I feel, with Deputy Dillon and the Leader of the National Labour Party, that these elections are entirely necessary and essential in a democratic State such as this, whilst I do feel, too, that we are losing our anchorage to democracy, or rather dragging at that anchorage, as recent events have shown.  However, these matters should be raised on the hustings and not here. I hope I am in order in stating the reason I intend to vote in favour of the holding of the elections&mdash;if there is a division&mdash;as I would not like my vote to be recorded without my giving an explanation in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Reference was made by the Leader of the principal Opposition to various meetings.  Deputy Mulcahy has stated properly that he and Deputy Norton came to see me as to whether these by-elections should be held.  Our attitude, in the main, is that they could not be prevented, even if there were a desire to do so, as you could not have any arrangements <Col N="1073" /> which would exclude people, who may not be represented here at all at the moment, from putting up candidates. I was anxious to know the views of the Opposition as, after all, it is the Opposition rather than the Government which is the more interested.</P>
      <P>The Government's position is to try to defend the general principles of democracy in this matter.  The Opposition are the people who generally show the desire for by-elections, as they regard them as an opportunity of shaking the Government.  If the Government in office has a majority already, there is nothing particular for it to gain in a by-election.  Its position is to defend itself rather than to attack.  The view was taken by some of the other Parties, the same view as I had, that the Opposition would be the principal people interested and pushing for a by-election, and I think it was stated in the papers that one of the Parties&mdash;Clann na Talmhan&mdash;said they did not propose to have any coalition arrangements of any sort.  Consequently, the elections have to go on, no matter who desires it or who does not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not something new introduced now by the Government.  This method of dealing with by-elections has been here since proportional representation was introduced.  The whole question of by-elections comes under this.  If there has not been a change of opinion in the people since the previous election was held, up to the time of the holding of the new election, then the chances are that the Party which is strongest is likely to secure the seat, though a combination of other Parties, under the transferable vote, might defeat them.  However, the whole question raised by Deputy Mulcahy's suggestion was whether there should be a different method for by-elections or not.  That is a point which could not be discussed here now, in connection with the existing vacancies, without having very serious consequences. Therefore, we bring forward the motion that the writs be granted in regard to three of the vacancies which occurred in our membership.  We do that because it is our duty to leave these vacancies there only for as short <Col N="1074" /> a time as is reasonable.  The first of these occurred, I think, last February, so there has been a vacancy in that constituency since then.  Other vacancies have occurred following on that and we felt it was right that the vacancies should be filled now.</P>
    <P>I do not understand at all what the Leader of the Opposition has been driving at, nor can I see what Deputy Dillon has been driving at.  What are we doing but continuing the practice, in having these writs moved for by-elections? The Opposition may not like the elections and may feel they are not likely to win them, but that is not our fault.</P>

      <P>The people are given an opportunity to vote for anyone they please.  They can put up any candidate they please.  If the people think that the policy for which the Government stands is so vastly superior to that of any of the Opposition Parties that the people will support the Government, well, where is there any departure from democracy in that?  Many of us have seen constituencies where public opinion was so much in favour of one particular side that they were not even contested.  There is nothing new in a constituency not being contested.  It simply indicates that those who opposed the Government policy or the policy of the candidate put up found themselves so weak that they had no chance of success.</P>
      <P>It is very remarkable to see the change of attitude in the person of the Leader of the Opposition from his attitude when he was pressing for elections.  Most of us remember when he was pressing very hard, even at times when there were greater anxieties, to have elections held.  They were pressing very hard and telling us we were very strange people if we could not have these elections and have them without any disturbance whatever of the public interest&mdash;without any danger to the public interest.</P>
      <P>I have nothing further to say.  I think there can be no charge laid at our door of doing anything unusual or strange.  We are doing the normal, proper thing.</P>

      <P>As regards this motion, the position is somewhat unusual as to the forms and substance of the amendments proposed.  The amendments tabled might really be divided in the main into two alternative <Col N="1077" /> propositions, the first to substitute a Government-appointed Commission for the Joint Committee proposed in the motion, and the second to modify the membership of such Committee.</P>
      <P>The main discussion would take place on No. 1 amendment.  It would not be desirable&mdash;in fact, I am nearly sure it would not be possible&mdash;to telescope the discussion of all these amendments. We shall have to have separate decisions.  A decision which will be taken on amendment No. 1 will close the main discussion.  Then there are specific points in amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 4, modifying the membership of whatever Committee is there.  I think amendments Nos. 3 and 4 really deal with the same point.  A decision is, therefore, required on amendment No. 2 and a decision on amendments Nos. 3 or 4, but scarcely on both; if one is decided I think the other would be equally decided.  A debate will thus take place on the motion and on amendment No. 1, and will be closed by the proposer of the main motion.  That amendment will then be decided, after which amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 4 can be decided and, finally, the question put on the main motion without further discussion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will remember that a short time ago a motion was proposed calling for the setting up of a committee to examine into the method of electing Senators. I have, in accordance with the decision then arrived at, put down this motion. It is proposed that 15 Deputies will represent the Dáil.  We would like to have a smaller number, but 15 was chosen so that all Parties might be represented, roughly in proportion to their strength.  If you take the smallest Party and give it one representative and give one representative to three or four Parties roughly of the size to which you could give only one representative, then you would have, in the same proportion, to give three to Fine Gael and the Government side of the House would have to be given eight.  That would mean a total of 15. I do not think you can give anything like representation to the various Parties with a smaller number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1078" /> Having decided then on the number for the Dáil, the question is what should be the number for the Seanad. There are two views.  One might say the Seanad as a separate House should get equal representation.  If that were to be adopted you would have an already large number doubled.  It would seem that to give them representation in proportion to their relative numbers&mdash;60 members in the Seanad and 138 in the Dáil&mdash;to give them seven representatives would appear to be fair.  That brings us to a committee of 22, with the chairman.  That is a fairly big committee but I think for this particular purpose it is not too big.  Sometimes people may be absent at meetings elsewhere and, in any case, if there were any special reason why the committee would think it wise to do so, they could appoint a sub-committee to go into details or give continuous examination to any particular aspect of a question as it arose.  I am explaining to the House how these numbers arise and why the Government have put down the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;expedient&rdquo; and substitute the following words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;that a Commission be set up to consider and make recommendations for the selection of a Seanad.</P>
      <P>That the Commission be nominated by the Government after consultation with the Leaders of the Opposition Parties.</P>
      <P>That the Commission consist of nine persons of whom not more than four shall be members of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As one of those responsible for the original motion, which was to the effect that the Government be asked to appoint a committee to make suggestions with regard to a different system of electing the Seanad, I should like to say that that motion was accepted by representatives of all Parties in the House and was accepted by the Government. The next step is the Government's proposal to have 22 members, confined to the Dáil and the Seanad. <Col N="1079" /> I agree with the Taoiseach that if we are to build up this committee on a blend of mathematics and politics you could not possibly have a committee that would be mathematically fair to every element represented in this House on a scale smaller than 22 members.</P>
    <P>But those of us who have experience of committees, whether in the Dáil or outside, are aware of the fact that, if you want business done and if you want anything like agreement, the smaller the committee is the better and the more likely it is to succeed, even in a political House such as this. Some seven years ago, when the major Parties implementing the Constitution under which we now live wanted to appoint the first President&mdash;and surely that is about the hardest thing on which to aim at agreement, an appointment such as that&mdash;we did not look for 22.  We got a committee of four and in the course of three or four hours there was agreement about it.</P>
    <P>When the country was in the midst of a real emergency and when we wanted agreement with regard to various steps in connection with the Army, its recruitment and so on, and even with regard to the political questions which arose from time to time during the emergency, we did not try to cement mathematics and politics. We wanted to achieve something and, because the sincere intention was to achieve results, the committee in that case was particularly small.  I think the number was nine.  The Taoiseach knows as well as I know what will be the outcome of a committee of 22, strictly regimented, with everybody carrying a Party label going into the room.  There will be at least half a dozen reports and the result of it all will be that the Government will do then what they could do without any committee, that is, merely frame their own proposals for the future Seanad and bring them here.</P>
    <P>I have not tabled this amendment with a Party or political outlook.  My idea is that, if we want to get results, the committee must be small, and the more and the greater the distance we depart from political regimentation, <Col N="1080" /> the more likely we are to get a Seanad with which we will all be pleased. Secondly, I do not want to see proposals made with regard to the future Second Chamber by political Parties only.  In my amendment, I suggest a committee of nine and that not more than four of that number should come from the Dáil or Seanad&mdash;that the five others should be outsiders.  We had a vocational organisation commission which went very thoroughly into all questions associated with vocationalism in this country.  There were no political complications and they gave years to their work and made recommendations. Surely from that commission we could get two or three people interested in this particular question, that interest of theirs being in no way complicated or obscured by political Party affiliations.</P>
    <P>It is with these ideas in mind that I propose a much smaller committee and the very minimum representation from Dáil Éireann.  I should not be disturbed if the four from the Dáil came from the Government, or if they came from Clann na Talmhan or Labour Parties, or, perhaps best of all, if they came from Independent units here, but the other five should be outsiders.  I suggest that it is at least a matter worth considering between Party leaders before committing ourselves to any particular figure, and, above all, before committing ourselves to having these proposals made exclusively by Senators or Deputies.  I should like a good mixture, a kind of impartial breath of outside opinion.  If there are outside opinions, if outside people are present, the committee, be it nine or 22, is less likely to work all the time along Party lines and Party furrows. I saw the effect of outsiders on committees appointed by the Government of which I was a member, and I urge strongly&mdash;I do not demand that the Government or anybody else should adhere rigidly to the figure or the scheme set down here&mdash;that the proposal should be postponed and that there should be a discussion between all Party leaders as to whether it is best to have this committee exclusively composed of members of the Dáil and Seanad or to have reasonable representation of people outside.  That is, I <Col N="1081" /> think, a bigger thing than the question of numbers, but I definitely feel it is a mistake to confine this planning committee to political representatives, to members of the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    <P>In addition, if we hope to achieve results, to get proposals which would have the confidence of all, the personnel should go about their work in a spirit of harmony rather than in the spirit of so many troops from different belligerent armies entering a room, and the number should be small.  The powers of the Seanad are very slight now and the possibilities of a Seanad interfering with or obstructing the plans or policy of Government are more or less entirely remote.  Whether the figure is nine or 22, or less than nine, if there is any anxiety in the mind of Government with regard to majorities, let them have a majority on whatever committee is appointed whatever its size may be.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Taoiseach to have a committee which will not be entirely a regimented committee from Dáil and Seanad, to have some outsiders of experience who, perhaps, have given far more study to the building of State institutions than any of us within the Dáil or Seanad has ever given.  If we open the door a little to outsiders of that type, we are more likely to get a Seanad which will fulfil its purpose and have the confidence of all.  The State as a State is very young, and it is not to the credit of any of us that, in 20 years, we had twice to destroy the Seanad and look for some other type of Chamber.  Surely our third attempt will be more fortunate than the previous two, but if we approach our third attempt on the basis of mathematically&mdash;arrived&mdash;at Party politicians going into a room in a sparring attitude, nothing can come of it that will be any more lasting than what went before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Higgins that this is a matter which must not be approached as purely a matter within the political arena.  In order to arrive at a correct conclusion as to what my decision on the motion should be, I have, first, to make up my mind whether the selection <Col N="1082" /> of the committee shall lie solely within the Dáil or Seanad, or whether outsiders should be introduced.  We have had experience of outsiders before and somehow the results do not seem to have been entirely satisfactory.  If it is decided that the selection shall remain within the Oireachtas, I see nothing whatever wrong in the proposed committee&mdash;in fact, it could not be otherwise on the basis of the representation of Parties&mdash;but I might underline what Deputy O'Higgins has said, that the matter should be approached with the sole object of getting a Seanad which would give satisfaction throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I may be an innocent abroad, but I see no reason why a number of individuals drawn from this and the other House could not devise such a body, and I am reinforced in that view by the experience I had only recently, and, indeed, on a number of prior occasions, on the public authority with which I am associated.  Recently in the Dublin Corporation we had a situation which might very easily have given rise to circumstances similar to those now before this House.  There might have been sharp cleavages between the three different Parties with regard to securing better administrative machinery for the corporation.  They did there what is precisely before the House here, that is, they selected a fairly large committee, representative of the three large Parties, and, in fact, of the Independents also, who numbered only three out of a total of 45, and that committee was an outstanding success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The various Parties decided that their main objective was better machinery rather than political advantage to one side of the House or the other.  With that object in view the three Parties gave way on various occasions, and eventually introduced a unanimous report.  We have better machinery now than we have had for a number of years.  Speaking out of my comparatively recent experience, I see no reason why the experiment suggested in this motion should not be proceeded with, and if the same dispositions are evidenced I see no <Col N="1083" /> reason why we should not obtain the same result now as in the other instance.  It seems to me that it would be a reflection on the capacity of the members of this House and of the other House if it were not possible for them to select from amongst themselves individuals who were competent to examine the question, and who were prepared to pursue the aim that is envisaged in the motion, that is, to give us a Seanad of which the country might be proud.  For these reasons my colleagues and myself would be prepared to proceed with the motion.  The alternative would be that, if the machinery was not working along the lines Deputy O'Higgins desires, there would be the advantage of being able to come back to the House and discuss the position.</P>

      <P>This motion was not put down hurriedly.  We gave it a certain amount of thought.  Deputy O'Higgins will remember that at the end of the discussion I asked what sort of a committee was envisaged.  Those who spoke in favour of the motion on that occasion did not talk much about the kind of committee that was envisaged.  At the end of the discussion when I asked some questions, Deputy McGilligan's statement seemed to indicate that the committee he had in mind was a committee of this House.  He mentioned something about sending for papers and records, but the motion here is for a constructive committee to get work done, and not for an inquiry into anything that happened in the past.  On that consideration the first thing that occurred to me was whether it should be a commission or committee.  I thought that a committee would be better.  We had a commission before and if there was any question of the nomination of a commission <Col N="1084" /> and if, for instance, the Government were bringing forward proposals we would be told that the members of it were hand-picked.  I came to the conclusion, largely for the same reasons as those mentioned by Deputy O'Sullivan, that a committee would be better.  I do not agree with people who are always running down the personnel of the House and talking about rabid politics.  We have our political differences, but I think that the members of the House are as capable as any group you could get to consider a matter of this kind.  They have a good deal of experience behind them.  The Leader of the Labour Party spoke about experiences here after the general election, of canvassing and so on. There has been experience of the existing method over a period of time and, consequently, those who obtained that experience know the dangers that have to be looked out for and are better fitted, it seems to me, to deal with this question than complete strangers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to outsiders, there are people who have been writing on this subject and when the committee sits it can invite them to give their views. You have groups of people who have given attention to the subject.  They could be invited to put their views before the committee.  The committee could ask for proposals from any group of people that they considered would be able to give them views.  The final framing of the proposals, I think, had better be left to the committee itself.  When the committee reports it will then, of course, be the responsibility of the Government to introduce the necessary measures.  The Government may or may not agree with the findings of the committee.  It will be the Government's duty to sponsor whatever proposals it puts forward, proposals which it thinks are best in the national interest.  I would be very happy indeed if our position was that we could agree on the proposals that were put forward.  That would be the ideal position from our point of view, but it may happen that we would not be able to do that.  I think, therefore, that, having given due weight to the views that have been put forward by Deputy O'Higgins, the only really <Col N="1085" /> workable solution is the motion which I have put forward.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be read a Second Time.  As the House is aware, this Expiring Laws Bill is an annual one and requires to be enacted before the end of the present calendar year.  It proposes to continue for a further year the statutes set out in Parts I and II of the Schedule.  These do not differ from the statutes appearing in the Schedule to the 1944 Act.</P>
      <P>Of the seven Acts now appearing in the Schedule, provision has already been made for the repeal of the Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Act, 1925, which will go when the Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Act, 1939, comes into operation.  It will hardly be feasible, however, to bring the 1939 Act into operation until manufactured articles and goods required by local bodies are in regular supply and it is necessary accordingly to continue the 1925 Act for a further period.</P>
      <P>A Rent Restrictions Bill is at present before the Dáil and when enacted it will replace the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1923.  As, however, it is possible that it may not be passed before the end of this year it is necessary to continue for a further period the 1923 Act, in order that the existing protection for tenants may be continued.</P>
      <P>The position regarding the remaining Acts has been reviewed to consider whether legislation might be introduced to give permanence to any of them in their present form or in an amended form.  Any such legislation is not, however, thought to be feasible at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be appreciated that the Schedule of enactments to be continued has shrunk considerably over a number <Col N="1086" /> of years and we are now left with a mere handful of Acts which as opportunity presents itself will be further diminished.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 72:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete from the word &ldquo;the&rdquo; where it occurs secondly in line 14 to the end of the paragraph, line 16, and substitute therefor the following words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the expression `small premises' means controlled premises which are situate in an appointed area being a county borough or the borough of Dun Laoghaire the rateable valuation whereof does not exceed £10 and which are situate in an appointed area elsewhere than in a county borough or the borough of Dun Laoghaire and the rateable valuation whereof does not exceed in amount such sum as the Minister may from time to time by prescribed regulations made under this Act fix or determine&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to direct attention to a situation which may arise when the Minister comes to extend the provisions of the Act outside the county boroughs.  I want to bring to his notice by way of this amendment the position which obtains in small towns, and, for that matter, large towns throughout the country. There are many towns where the rateable valuation of business premises is exceedingly low and profitable business concerns are carried on in such premises.  It would be well to have some power in the Minister by which he could fix the valuation for particular premises when he comes to extend the operations of the Act outside the county boroughs.  I know several businesses carried on in small villages and towns where, I am sure&mdash;I have <Col N="1087" /> not the precise figures&mdash;the rateable valuation of the premises does not exceed £10.  I doubt if it is the Minister's intention that these people who are engaged in profitable business should be treated, as it were, as poor persons.</P>

      <P>In line 14 to delete the words &ldquo;controlled premises&rdquo; and insert in lieu thereof the words &ldquo;controlled (1923 Act) premises&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The effect of this amendment is to restrict the application of Part III, that is the Part dealing with small premises, to 1923 Act cases.  As I think I explained on Second Reading, my main object was to deal with the tenement dweller.  I know that in the £10 valuation class and perhaps a little under that valuation there are premises, perhaps, small houses, which are occupied by people who do not require the same protection and facilities as it is proposed to give the poorer dwellers in tenement houses.  If we restrict the application of this Part to 1923 Act cases, we will be eliminating the possibility of that type of house coming in, that is, the more recently constructed houses which are occupied by people who are in a better position than those living in tenement houses. As everyone realises, special facilities are given here which I think ought only be given to the very poor who occupy tenement houses.  I think the amendment ought to commend itself to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot.  As a matter of fact, I think in the two or three cases we have mentioned already there was some heat engendered unnecessarily. There was the question of the Associated Properties and the Artisan Dwellings Co.  We are all aware that houses of that type are occupied by people who are better off than those who are forced to live in tenements. They are covered already in Part II, but they do not get the special facilities proposed to be given to those other poor people in tenement houses.  I do not anticipate any case of hardship.  I think we will cover them all if you agree to what I am proposing here.  I think it is a big improvement.</P>

      <P>In line 15 to delete the word &ldquo;ten&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;fifteen&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The beneficial clauses of this Bill are so obvious and the Minister's intention to include as wide a scale of tenants who may be suffering is so clear that I am wondering whether his ceiling figure of £10 is correct.  I am aware that a number of these premises would run £1, £2 or £3 over that valuation. I fixed the figure at £15 in order to include a number of cases which, I think, the demarcation line of £10 will rule out in the hope that the Minister <Col N="1089" /> will, in any event, raise the figure of £10 a little.  There are a number of flats situated at the very top of houses throughout this city.  I know one case on the north side where a flat at the very top of a house is rated at £15 valuation and is occupied by people whom, it might be said, we are anxious to cater for here.  There are obviously other cases of that kind.  The intention of the amendment is to ensure that a large section will not be ruled out by the figure of £10.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>From inquiries I have made I am satisfied that the vast majority of the people concerned will be dealt with under the £10 valuation figure.  In fact, I think it is a bit too high.  People with flats of £15 valuation are scarcely tenement dwellers who require to be helped and to whom special facilities should be given.  Deputy O'Sullivan may know whether they are or not.  I imagine that people who occupy a flat valued at that sum would scarcely be very poor.  After all, they are covered by the ordinary rent restrictions.  I do not want to give people who do not require it the help and extra protection which are being given in this particular Part.  If anything, £10 valuation is on the high side.  The Deputy knows that we have made definite provision for a separate valuation of each letting.  I am providing for that further on.  I think a flat of £15 valuation would scarcely be occupied by people who require the extra protection this Part gives. Consequently, I do not think the Deputy ought to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2), line 24, before the word &ldquo;particulars&rdquo; to insert the word &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a very small point.  It is to avoid having all sorts of particulars collected by District Court clerks.  It is to prevent miscellaneous particulars, which may not be pertinent to an application, having to be taken by the clerk if the applicant insists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the amendment would make for more formality and rigidity than is intended.  The idea was that a person may not be familiar with forms and that the court clerk should get from the person concerned the particulars with regard to the tenement.  If we prescribe the kind of particulars that should be given, it might make for a certain amount of rigidity.  I would rather leave it wider and more open, so that the clerk can ascertain from the tenant exactly what the position is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is to make the administration uniform.  If certain particulars were prescribed, it would perhaps help the tenant and also the clerical staff.  What I had in mind was that only certain particulars should be taken, such as the rent, the nature of tenancy, the type and size of the premises, the situation, age and condition of the premises, the name of the landlord, the poor law valuation, and who pays the rates.  Otherwise you might have all sorts of miscellaneous particulars being furnished, and it would be impossible for a clerk to deal with them in an efficient manner.</P>

      <P>This is to prevent the hob lawyer appearing on the scene or the mischievous gentleman who is perhaps imposing himself on poor persons as interested in their welfare and who organises some sort of association to protect their rights and get applications organised and presented to the court.

      <P>I would like to deal with one point in the Minister's amendment, as I have an amendment to it.  I cannot understand why the Minister has decided to exclude the designation of solicitor from the list of persons to be &ldquo;outside the Pale&rdquo; in this respect.  I agree with the protection <Col N="1092" /> given by the Minister, which is absolutely desirable, as Deputy Coogan says, to prevent undesirable individuals who, seeing the going fairly good, may attempt to exploit poor people.  Seeing that the earlier stages of this procedure are confined to the elementary process of going before the District Court clerk, I see no good reason for cutting out solicitors in this particular clause.  There is no professional work involved.  The individuals will be bound to find&mdash;as they have found&mdash; social organisations and public men who will carry out this elementary duty. Certainly, there should be no need for a special prerogative for solicitors at this stage.  There will be plenty of room for them afterwards.</P>

      <P>I imagine that not many of these people would be able to afford to employ solicitors, but I do not think I would be justified in excluding solicitors, whose business it is and whose profession it is to act if people want to employ them.  I provide that those employed must be recognised legal practitioners.  I would be going too far if I did not make it possible for them to be heard, though I do not anticipate that many of them will be employed by the type of person with whom we are concerned.  I would not be entitled to rule out those whose profession it is to represent clients in court.</P>

      <P>To delete sub-section (1) and to insert in lieu thereof the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Every application referred to a district justice under Section 28 of this Act shall be dealt with by him as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>(i)  that the premises are small premises to which Section 8 of this Act applies, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  that the premises are small premises to which Section 9 of this applies, the basic rent whereof has already been determined by the court, and that the amount of that basic rent is ascertainable,</P>
      <P>he may by order determine provisionally&mdash;</P>
      <P>(I)  the lawful additions to the basic rent of the premises, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1094" /> (II)  the lawful rent (in this part referred to as &ldquo;the provisional rent&rdquo;) of the premises;</P>
    <P>(c)  in case it appears to him that the premises are small premises to which paragraph (b) of this sub-section does not apply, he may by order determine provisionally&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the basic rent of the premises under Section 9 of this Act,</P>
    <P>(ii)  the lawful additions to the basic rent of the premises, and</P>
    <P>(iii)  the lawful rent (in this Part referred to as &ldquo;the provisional rent&rdquo;) of the premises;</P>
    <P>(d)  if the premises are not separately valued under the Valuation Acts, he may for the purposes of this Act apportion to the premises such part as he thinks proper at the rateable valuation of the property in which the premises are comprised.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to delete sub-section (1) of Section 29 and to substitute an entirely new sub-section.  It is the first of a number of amendments which, it is hoped, will considerably improve Part III of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The main objection that might be urged against the existing provisions of Section 29 is that the provisional rent which the justice would fix under a provisional order must obviously be an inadequate rent, since it would not include anything for rates or repairs. Despite this, under sub-section (2) of Section 30, that inadequate rent would become immediately the rent to be paid for the premises and would remain the rent to be paid until either the landlord had come into court under Section 31 or, in default of his so doing, the provisions of Section 32 had come into play.  This would be, on the one hand, unfair to the landlord and, on the other hand, would be apt to cause confusion and possibly dissatisfaction among tenants when they would be told after a month or two that the provisional rent which they had been paying since the provisional order was made was too low and would have to be increased to bring it up to the strictly lawful rent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1095" /> Another serious objection is that there would be a very strong inducement for landlords in every case to come into court to try to upset prosional orders, since the rent (even though it was only provisional and temporary) which they were obliged to accept under such an order was obviously too low and did not even include provision for the rates, not to mention repairs.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the new sub-section which the amendment proposes to insert have been framed to meet all these objections.  The main feature of the new provisions is that in fixing the rent under a provisional order, the justice first settles the basic rent, when it is not already known, then determines the lawful additions and finally shows in his order the full lawful rent payable.  This scheme has obvious advantages: the provisional order makes the position quite clear to both landlord and tenant and, since the rent fixed under it will be a far closer approximation to the strictly lawful rent than a provisional rent fixed under the existing sub-section could possibly be, there is a far better prospect that the landlord will accept the position and that thereby the trouble and expense which applications under Section 31 would entail for everybody concerned&mdash;the justice, his staff and the tenant as well as the landlord&mdash;will be eliminated or reduced to a large extent.</P>
    <P>The new provisions have also the advantage that they provide a far more precise and scientific method for dealing with cases under Part III.  Thus, if it is disclosed, in the course of the inquiries which the justice causes to be made, that the case is a Section 8 case, that is, one in which the standard rent had been fixed by the court under the 1923 Act, then all the justice has to do is to take that standard rent, add 20 or 25 per cent. (as the case may be) to it in order to arrive at the true basic rent, determine the lawful additions and so fix the full rent to be paid.  The same procedure will be applicable if the case is a Section 9 case in which the basic rent has already been determined by the court. <Col N="1096" /> This procedure is provided for in paragraph (b) of the proposed new sub-section.  The register of standard and basic rents which it is proposed to have compiled under the proposed amendment to Section 54 should be of considerable assistance to the Justice in finding out whether a case comes within paragraph (b) and, if it does, what the standard or basic rent of the premises is.</P>
    <P>If the case does not come within paragraph (b), the justice deals with it under paragraph (c) by first determining the basic rent in accordance with the provisions of Section 9 (as now amended), then determining the lawful additions and finally the lawful rent to be fixed as the provisional rent.</P>
    <P>The provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) have the further merit that, in the matter of the recovery of excess payments of rent, the cases fall automatically into their proper category and the question whether or not there is a right to recover overpayments depends on the provisions of the Bill generally applicable in that matter.  Under the existing draft it had been necessary to deal with the matter in an arbitrary fashion in Section 32 (1) (c) by deeming every case to be a Section 8 case, thus giving a right to recover overpayments in cases in which such a right would not exist if the case had been dealt with by proceedings in the ordinary way under Part II of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Finally, paragraph (c) of the new sub-section gives the justice the power, which it is clearly necessary that he should have, to apportion the rateable valuation of the property which comprises any premises which are the subject of proceedings before him.  This provision is necessary now for the particular reason that the justice in the process of making his provisional order is required to determine the lawful additions.  One lawful addition will be that in respect of rates and, in order that the justice may be able to determine the amount of the rates attributable to, say, a single room, he must be able to apportion the valuation of the whole house.  The provision for apportionment will, moreover, it is hoped, <Col N="1097" /> meet certain criticisms which were levelled at Part III by some Deputies on the Second Reading of the Bill.  A number of Deputies were doubtful, as the Bill originally stood, whether the Justice had the right to apportion, but I think it is made quite definite by this amendment.  I think the amendment will make a very big difference and improve that part of the Bill very much.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment, as I read it, entails a tremendous amount of work upon the District Court staffs. An application will be heard in the court and, in practice, it will be the duty of the clerk to prepare the material for the disposal of the application by the district justice.  I can visualise a situation arising in a large town where the district justice's office will be inundated with applications.  In view of all the calculations which the clerk will have to make, and all the items which he will have to take into consideration to decide the proper category into which a particular application may fall, I can see a tremendous increase in the work of the District Court offices, particularly in large towns and cities.</P>
      <P>The Bill, as at present framed, does not set up any machinery for dealing with this extra work.  Already the District Court clerks are whole-time officers.  Some of them are on very small salaries.  The Minister is aware that the District Court clerks are very dissatisfied with their salaries and allowances.  They are prevented by law from embarking on any other business; in fact, a penalty will be imposed on them by law if they embark on any particular business.  Under this Bill we will throw a tremendous amount of work on these officials.  I wonder if the Minister has considered whether it is equitable to throw any extra work on them in view of their miserable salaries and allowances.  I cannot see any clerk in a given town such as Waterford or Kilkenny being able to cope with this work.  I suggest the matter should be considered from this angle before we approve the section.</P>

      <P>I consider that the <Col N="1098" /> amendment suggested by the Minister will greatly reduce the volume of work that will go to the District Court under this part of the Bill.  It makes it clear that the district justice will determine the basic rent in accordance with Sections 8 and 9.  That was not quite clear in the Bill as originally drafted. It is now quite clear and I would remind Deputy Coogan that when the district justice is given the power to fix the basic rent and make lawful additions if necessary, it will mean that tenants will get the benefit of the Act under this part, but they will not get a reduction greater than under any other part.  The effect will be that a greater number of tenants will simply have notice served on the landlord and a greater number of rents will be arranged by negotiation. I do not think the volume of work that will go to the District Court will be anything as great as it would have been if the Bill remained in its original condition.</P>

      <P>I do not see the slightest necessity for or advantage of this elaborate procedure in the Bill.  I made the point that I wished to make on this part of the Bill on the Second Reading.  I asked where the scheme came from and I do not think I was told.  Apparently the scheme was not properly thought out because it has had to be amended very drastically in the way now suggested.  One very simple method of doing all this would be an ordinary summons before a district justice by a tenant and let the district justice determine the matter in open court between the parties for the first and last time.  Why there should be any necessity to go into the District Court or into the clerk privately and have another hearing before a district justice, with possibly a further appeal, I cannot understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing elaborate about the procedure I suggested&mdash;an ordinary summons for the landlord to appear in the District Court in order to have a standard rent determined.  That can be a printed form.  The parties can negotiate outside court.  If they cannot agree the issue will be knit to a narrow point which can be determined in a few minutes by the district justice <Col N="1099" /> with all the material available before him.  He will make these private investigations and determinations without any proper assistance and in 99 per cent. of the cases there are bound to be hearings before the District Court again.  I cannot see any justification for this part of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether there will be any rush to avail of the facilities granted to poor tenants under this part of the Bill, but if there happens to be a big rush and the clerks and the district justices are not in a position to deal with them, we shall have to provide some help for them.  I do not know whether there is anything in the statements made that there are people in tenements who are paying big rents and who will be afraid or nervous to go to court and, therefore, will not avail of the benefits to be obtained under this legislation. I do not know if that will be the case.</P>
      <P>We are told that, although the tenants can issue a summons to the landlord, they will not be prepared to do so.  That may or may not be true. If it is true, I want to give them an easier way of doing it.  As to where this emanated from, I do not think that is a matter for Deputy Costello or anybody else.  You may take it that it came from me.  We have to get the best possible advice and we have sought advice from those who know a good deal about this problem.  We have sought various opinions and tried to get an easier way for these people to deal with their landlords, if they are in the position in which I am told some of them are.  As to who told us, or where it emanated from, that does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit that this is a new thing.  It may not work, but it will not fail for want of staff.  I am quite satisfied that once the Minister for Finance agreed to this provision he will not deny any help that may be necessary if there is a big rush.  We have to see whether there will be such a big rush to avail of the provisions of this section.  We do not know about that.  Our anxiety is to help the people who, we are told, will not go into court for the reasons <Col N="1100" /> I have set out.  They may be afraid to do it, afraid of costs or afraid of going into a public court.  We are providing what is undoubtedly a new way, but I think it is worth a trial.  I will not say that this is the most satisfactory thing that could be devised but it is as good a way as we could devise. I admit we found flaws in the section as it stood and as a result of the debate on Second Reading we have tried to meet the various points raised. The whole object of Parliament is to try to improve any draft brought in. We think our original proposal is considerably improved in this present proposal and I suggest it is worth giving it a trial.</P>

      <P>My objection to this scheme is not based primarily or principally upon the volume of work that it may throw upon the District Court. That is a matter that may affect the taxpayer, but if it tends to the public good then there will be no objection from me.  My objection is one on principle.  I do not ask out of mere curiosity where this scheme emanated from.  It is no satisfactory answer at all events for the Minister to say it is there anyway.</P>

      <P>Coming from the Minister, but that is merely a statement that the Government says: &ldquo;The Minister on his Ministerial responsibility is bringing this in and that is all we are going to tell you about it.&rdquo; That is certainly a new angle on democratic government.  I asked where it emanated from in order to see what experience and what knowledge the persons responsible for the scheme had and whether they had any authority to make it.  The working of a scheme of this kind put forward tentatively for the first time would largely depend on whether or not the people responsible for devising it had any experience or knew what they were talking about. It was for that purpose, and for no other, that I asked the question.  I want to know the authority behind it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the Minister stands over it, that it is his responsibility, but merely to say to Deputies who make a <Col N="1101" /> point against it: &ldquo;It is there anyway&rdquo;, is certainly a new way of meeting Parliamentary criticism.  I presume it is a fact we have to face that we are to be told when we debate a Bill in the Dáil and raise any objection: &ldquo;It is there and you may do what you like about it&rdquo;, but from the point of view of the working of a deliberative assembly, it is a new light on the Ministerial attitude.</P>
    <P>I have criticised this scheme because I think it is entirely too elaborate and wholly unnecessary.  I do not think it is an easy scheme.  If there is a problem in relation to people being afraid to go into court to have their rents fixed&mdash;and I do not know that there is such a problem, though there may be some such people&mdash;there are any number of solicitors and any number of charitable organisations, including the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, who are prepared to help poor tenants in the matter.  But leaving that aside, the point I am making is that this is entirely over-elaborate and is not an easy method.  It does not get over the difficulty which the Minister says he is instructed exists, or may exist, that people will not go into court.  They have to go into court under this provision.  They have to stand in a queue at the District Court clerk's office and face an appeal by the landlord in court.  How does that get over the difficulty?</P>
    <P>The suggestion I made was that they should go into the District Court office and get a printed form of two lines: &ldquo;You are hereby directed to attend at the District Court on such and such a date to have the standard rent determined in respect of such and such premises&rdquo;.  Nothing more is necessary. The landlord has to come in and have it determined by the district justice in a few moments.  That is a simple, easy scheme, and why we should have all this elaboration with a consequent possible additional burden on the taxpayer, I entirely fail to see.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 86:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (1) and insert in lieu thereof the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  The landlord of any premises in respect of which a provisional order has been made may, within three months after the service of a copy of the provisional order upon him or his agent, apply to the District Court to revoke or modify the terms of the provisional order <Col N="1104" /> and thereupon the following provisions shall have effect:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  if on the hearing of the application it appears to the court&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  that the premises are not small premises, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  that the premises are small premises to which section 8 of this Act applies, or</P>
    <P>(iii)  that the premises are small premises to which Section 9 of this Act applies, the basic rent whereof has already been determined by the court, and that the amount of that basic rent is ascertainable,</P>
    <P>the court shall revoke the provisional order with effect retrospectively from the date of the making thereof;</P>
    <P>(b)  in any other case, the court may as it thinks proper, by order&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  confirm the terms of the provisional order without modification, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  confirm the terms of the provisional order with such modifications as the circumstances may require;</P>
    <P>(c)  if the terms of the provisional order are confirmed, whether with or without modification, then, as on and from the making of the confirming order, notwithstanding anything in any other provision of this Act,&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the said confirming order shall have effect as a final determination by the Court of the matters to which the said confirming order relates,</P>
    <P>(ii)  the provisional order shall cease to be in force, and</P>
    <P>(iii)  for the purpose of the application of Section 20 of this Act the tenant shall be deemed to have entered into an agreement with the landlord to pay in respect of the premises a rent equal to the lawful rent of the premises as determined by the confirming order;</P>
    <P>(d)  on the hearing of the application <Col N="1105" /> the court may make an order for the payment, in such manner as the court may direct, of any amount due by either party to the other in relation to the premises, whether on account of rent or under any provision of this Act.</P>
    <P>This amendment is largely consequential on the amendment (No. 80) of Section 29, which we have just discussed. The new provisions differ from the provisions in the existing sub-section (1) mainly in that, since the Justice must under the new Section 29 determine a provisional basic rent, all that is required on an application by the landlord under Section 31 is that that provisional basic rent, and, of course, the provisional lawful additions, should be either confirmed or varied, according to the evidence that is adduced on the hearing of the landlord's application.  Paragraph (b) of the new sub-section provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>Under paragraph (c), the confirming order, whether made with or without modification, has effect as a final determination by the court of the matters to which it relates and the provisional order thereupon ceases to be in force. The object of sub-paragraph (iii) is merely to restore, as it were, the normal landlord and tenant relationship and so bring Section 20 into play again, so that such adjustments as may be necessary from time to time in the amount of the rent may be made in accordance with the provisions of that section.  If, for example, the rates are increased, the landlord will be able to serve a notice on the tenant increasing the rent accordingly, while, in the converse case, the tenant can serve a notice reducing the rent in the event of a fall in the rates.</P>
    <P>On the landlord's application under Section 31 for the revocation or modification of the provisional order, the court must revoke the order if it is shown (a) that the premises are not, in fact, &ldquo;small premises&rdquo;, or (b) that the case is really a Section 8 case, or (c) if the case is a Section 9 case, that the basic rent has already been determined by the court.  These provisions of paragraph (a) of the new sub-section <Col N="1106" /> are substantially the same as the provisions of paragraph (a) in the present text.</P>
    <P>A minor change which the amendment effects is an extension of from one month to three months of the time within which a landlord may apply to the court under Section 31 for revocation or modification of the provisional order.  It is considered fair that the landlord should be given a reasonable time within which to take action.  The reason why the period was limited to one month in the existing text was that, since the provisional rent under Section 29 would have been, as I have already explained, an inadequate rent, it was desired to limit as much as possible the maximum period during which that inadequate rent would be payable. With the new provisions of Section 29, that reason for restricting the period no longer exists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point I wish to raise on this Section. The Ceann Comhairle intimated to me that my amendments Nos. 87, 88 and 89 were not in order inasmuch as the effect of them would be to impose a charge on public funds.  The point that I want to raise is this, that it is only on appeal to the Circuit Court that costs can be certified so far as the tenant is concerned.  Apparently, the District Court has no jurisdiction as regards costs.  The section only refers to costs.  I would point out to the Minister that a tenant might have to bear a good deal of expense by bringing a valuer or a witness to court.  There is no provision in the section to enable him to recover these expenses.  I regard that as a serious defect in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Bill becomes law landlords, realising that there will be an overriding period of six years during which overpayments may be recovered, may argue to themselves that, years <Col N="1107" /> hence, they may be faced with an accumulation of arrears and decide to take the initiative by going into court themselves. In the first instance they may go to the District Court, where there will be a full-dress hearing.  The tenant will have to employ a solicitor and may bring forward witnesses.  All that will have to be gone over if there is an appeal to the Circuit Court.  But my point is that, if the initiative is taken by the landlord, the tenant will not be able to recover his expenses.  That is a serious matter and I wonder if it has been brought to the Minister's notice.</P>

      <P>I think that what Deputy O'Sullivan has said is true, that while the normal procedure under this part of the Bill will be for the tenant to apply in the District Court, if the landlord takes the initiative in the Circuit Court, there is no protection in the Bill for the tenant's expenses.  In a number of cases, due to their anxiety to avoid the accumulation of arrears, landlords may take the initiative in the Circuit Court and even appeal from it to the High Court.  In title cases there is nothing to prevent landlords from taking the initiative in the Circuit Court.</P>

The district justice, after hearing the case, is satisfied that the tenant is not paying too much.  The tenant appeals from that decision.  In that case I do not think he is entitled to any further help from the State. The district justice, after giving the case a fair hearing, has decided that his rent is a proper one.  If such a tenant wants to go further with his case then that will be his own look out. We are not going to encourage tenants to appeal.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that we are not on the same point.  As I have said, even though the valuation is under £10, there is nothing to prevent a landlord from starting proceedings in the Circuit Court.  In the normal way <Col N="1109" /> the landlord would not be allowed more than District Court costs in the Circuit Court.  In a case of that kind the tenant will have to pay the expenses and costs merely because the landlord has taken the initiative.</P>

      <P>What Deputy O'Sullivan has in mind is the case of a landlord taking the offensive, if you like, to torpedo Part III of the Bill by applying to the court to have a standard rent fixed.  In such a case, when a tenant becomes aware of his rights under Part III of the Bill, he will have found that the landlord has already moved, and the tenant will then have to pay his costs.  The object of Deputy O'Sullivan's amendments was to prevent that happening.  It is hardly likely, but there is a possibility.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), to delete paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) and insert in lieu thereof the following paragraphs:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the terms of the provisional order shall be deemed to have been confirmed by the District Court by order under sub-section (1) of Section 31 of this Act and the provisions of paragraph (c) of the said sub-section shall apply accordingly;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1110" /> (b)  an appeal shall not lie to the Circuit Court from a confirming order which is deemed to have been so made.</P>
    <P>This also is consequential to a large extent on amendment No. 80 to Section 29 and amendment No. 86 to Section 31.</P>
    <P>Section 32 makes provision for the case in which the landlord does not apply within three months in accordance with Section 31 to have the provisional order revoked or varied.  The amendment proposes that in such a case the provisional order shall be deemed to have been confirmed under sub-section (1)&mdash;that is the new sub-section (1)&mdash;of Section 31 and paragraph (c) of that sub-section shall apply accordingly.</P>
    <P>The provision at (b) in the amendment is entirely new.  It seems reasonable to provide that, if the landlord has not availed of the provision of Section 31 to have the provisional order revoked or varied, he should not be allowed an appeal to the Circuit Court when that order is deemed to have been confirmed.  So far as the tenant is concerned, Section 29 (2) deprives him of any right of appeal against a provisional order and there does not, therefore, seem to be any good reason why he should be allowed an appeal later on when the order is deemed to be confirmed in default of action by the landlord.</P>

      <P>In an appeal from the decision of a district justice in this part of this Act a District Court valuer or special valuer who has given evidence in such case shall not give evidence for either party on appeal.</P>
      <P>I move this amendment because it is possible that if a valuer gives evidence in the District Court and if he is brought as what may be regarded an expert witness on appeal, some inducements may be held out by either party or both parties to give a particular kind of evidence.  If a person who gives evidence in the District Court has a promise of subsequent fee in the event of an appeal, which is also more or less guaranteed, he may feel disposed to give evidence which would assist the particular party appealing. These valuers are primarily officers of the court and not witnesses for either party.

      <P>My amendment is designed to deal with a grave social evil which, as we see it in operation to-day, has very definitely the effect of classing parents who desire accommodation for their children as being untouchables.  That unfortunately is <Col N="1116" /> the position as we see it, particularly in Dublin.  In the case of local authorities, the position is quite different. Local authorities let their houses on the basis of the family.  In all cases that I know of family considerations are the predominant factor.  But, on the private side, the procedure seems to be the very reverse.  I know that a number of people throughout the city are perturbed about the growing tendency latterly in connection with the ban on children.  If we are sincere in our claim that children are the greatest asset of the nation, then on an occasion of this kind we should take steps to remove a pernicious ban of that description.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a similar amendment down, No. 100, which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No order for the recovery of possession of controlled premises shall be made solely on the grounds that the tenant has broken or not performed any obligation in the contract of tenancy prohibiting him from keeping and maintaining on such premises any children or young persons being members of his own family or such as are dependent upon him.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is intolerable under present conditions of society, and, particularly, having regard to the emergency shortage of houses, that young married couples with small families can be turned from door to door because they refuse to sign agreements of this character. Apart altogether from the legal aspect, I think that the policy adopted by certain landlords, particularly of flats and flatlets, is, from the moral point of view, the most reprehensible policy that we can visualise and a policy that we should endeavour, by legislation, to prohibit.  I do not want to open the door too wide, but I am strongly of opinion that, where possession is sought for a breach of a covenant against children, the court should have power to refuse the application for possession.  If the problem were met in that way, I think we would get out of this difficulty which we have and which is particularly acute in Dublin. I have had many complaints in regard to the matter.  I commend my amendment <Col N="1117" /> and Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment, which are more or less on the same lines, to the Minister for consideration. I do not want to rush this matter, but I think the whole problem of young married couples hinges on this and that there is grave need for bringing in some legislation of this kind to enable them to establish homes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment.  Possibly Deputy Coogan's amendment is better worded, because it provides that possession shall not be granted in any case where the application is made solely on a clause prohibiting children.  I do not know how widespread this is but, judging from the number of people who have approached me, it must be fairly general.  When we have already made so many changes in this Bill, it is no harm to insert a further drastic clause, which would prevent landlords from incorporating such an unchristian clause in a letting agreement, that no children should be allowed to reside with the tenant or tenants.  If the Minister does not accept the exact wording, he should accept the principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, I have great sympathy with any persons who may find themselves in the position that they cannot get a place to live or that they have to leave the place they are in because they have children, but I do not think that any of the amendments here will help in that position at all.  I agree that there is a problem, but I do not think it is anything like as widespread as we might be led to believe from the speeches of the other Deputies and from articles which appear in the Press.  I have made inquiries amongst several well-known solicitors in the city, asking them if they ever came across a tenancy agreement, a written agreement, in which there was a condition that the tenant was not to have any children living on the premises.  I also made inquiries from estate agents, rent collectors and other such people with life-long experience of tenancies, but they never came across a single case of the kind nor have they ever seen an agreement with such a clause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1118" /> If we could assume that there ever was such an agreement, I am satisfied that no court under our jurisdiction would enforce such a clause.  I have too much respect for our judges and justices to think for one moment that they would allow a tenant to be evicted because he broke a condition of that kind.  Such a condition would be entirely contrary to our Constitution. I made inquiries as to whether the effort ever had been made in the courts, but I could not find one case where a landlord sought to evict a tenant by reason of a breach of a covenant of that kind.  Therefore, I do not think this amendment is going to help one bit in regard to this problem.</P>
    <P>The real question here it not one of landlords imposing conditions, but a question of a party who has premises to let&mdash;and this applies particularly to a flat or part of a house&mdash;refusing to let them.  There is no doubt whatever that very many people would prefer to give the letting to a tenant who has no children rather than to one who has children.  That is a big problem, but it will not be affected by any amendment we may make in this Bill. The only way to deal with the problem effectively would be to establish a bureau to carry out all lettings of vacant premises and prohibit landlords from making a letting except through the bureau.  Then the bureau could be given a direction to give preference&mdash;as in the case of the corporation&mdash;to families with children.  That would be of some material help to people looking for premises.  While I do not think these amendments will be of any help, if the Minister is considering any of them, I would say, with the greatest respect to other Deputies, that the amendment proposed by Deputy Coogan seems to me to be about the most suitable.</P>
    <P>My real experience in regard to flats&mdash;to which these amendments mostly refer&mdash;is that, instead of wanting to get into them, married people with children want to get out of them. I have hundreds of applications from people who took flats when they married, and, now that they have children, they say: &ldquo;For goodness sake, <Col N="1119" /> get us some place, and out of this cursed flat.&rdquo;  The real way in which we can solve that problem is by providing houses for young married people as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy O'Connor, I feel that, if such a provision against children were in an agreement, it would be declared by the courts to be contrary to public policy; but the reason behind the amendments will not be met by the insertion of amendments to this Bill.  The difficulty will arise before the letting is made, when the landlord makes inquiries as to the type of tenant who is seeking his premises.  It is then that he can exercise the discretion against people with children, and there is nothing which we could put into this Bill which would prevent that.</P>

      <P>I think the House is agreed that this practice of refusing accommodation to, or terminating the tenancy of, people who have children at the time of the contract, or who have children born to them in the currency of the tenancy, can be met in very large measure by a slight amendment of Deputy Coogan's amendment. Deputy Coogan's amendment says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No order for the recovery of possession of controlled premises shall be made solely on the grounds that the tenant has broken or not performed any obligation in the contract of tenancy prohibiting him from keeping and maintaining on such premises any children or young persons being members of his own family or such as are dependent upon him.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If we took out of that the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo; and then the words &ldquo;has broken or not performed any obligation in the contract of tenancy prohibiting him from&rdquo;, it would make the amendment read:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;No order for the recovery of possession of controlled premises shall be made on the grounds that the tenant is keeping and maintaining on such premises any children or young persons being members of his <Col N="1120" /> own family or such as are dependent upon him.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then it would be open to a tenant who was faced with proceedings under the Rent Restrictions Act for recovery of the premises on other grounds to go into court and say: &ldquo;The other grounds cited are fictitious and I am prepared to demonstrate that the real grounds are that the landlord does not want us because we have two or three young children.&rdquo;  That would throw it over on the judge or district justice to determine, on the merits, whether the landlord was making a <i>bona fide</i> case that he wanted the house for his own accommodation&mdash;or one of the various grounds on which the landlord can recover possession, other than the payment of rent&mdash;or whether he was stating a technical ground for getting the tenant out, where in truth he did not want children and wished to dig them out in order to let the premises to someone who had no children.</P>
    <P>We are all agreed that it is extremely difficult effectively to prevent the evil complained of, without, on the one hand, unreasonably interfering with a person's right to his own property or, on the other hand, creating situations which none of us contemplate or desire.  Would not the House think that it is desirable to place in the hands of a judicial person power to determine whether there was a flagrant effort being made to keep people out because they had children? Would not the House agree that, if any landlord so abuses his property as to stipulate that no one will live in it but childless families, bachelors or old maids, we consider that to be a misuse of property?  I would be glad to know if the Minister or Deputy Coogan thinks that a slight amendment of Deputy Coogan's amendment might not meet the case and transfer the obligation for its precise interpretation, for meeting each case on its merits, to the judge hearing the case.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy O'Connor, I have been making inquiries amongst people familiar with the letting of houses&mdash;both solicitors and house agents&mdash;as to whether they ever came across a case in which there was a <Col N="1121" /> clause prohibiting children.  I have not found any, nor do I think that any such case ever was decided in the courts.  I have gone very carefully into this matter as, like everybody else, I know the problem is there and that people with houses to let prefer to get people without children, if they can.  I think we discussed this on the Second Reading.  People do not say they are refusing the tenants because of children, but say the premises have been let already to someone else.  I have been advised by the Attorney General, whom I asked to go into this whole question.  I asked him if he thought that Section 37&mdash;the one which places restrictions on the landlord's right to gain possession of controlled premises&mdash;required any amendment.  He is quite satisfied that it does not, after considering all the other reasons which the landlord might advance.  If Deputies will look at page 20, lines 22 and 23, they will observe: &ldquo;and in any such case, the court considers it reasonable to make an order&rdquo;.  We have all this talk about the special circumstances of the case and the greater hardship in that particular section, but the overriding provision, the Attorney-General said, which will protect the tenant, is in that provision. I am also advised that there is in the Constitution&mdash;Deputy Dillon, I am sure, will appreciate that, because he is a very strong man on the Constitution&mdash;Article 41, which specially recognises the family.  It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The State recognises the family as the natural, primary and fundamental unit group of society, and, as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It would be against the Constitution to put in such a provision.</P>

I have not heard of a case in which it was in any agreement and I have the best advice, that of the <Col N="1122" /> Attorney-General, for saying that anyone who has children cannot be put out because of that, and the court has complete discretion under the provision I have read.  Consequently, this proposal is not necessary.  I admit the problem is still there, and I do not know how it is to be solved unless we can resort to some arrangement.</P>

      <P>Yes, to get them in When we were discussing local authority houses I mentioned that people with the greater number of children have the first claim.  Unless something of that kind can be devised for private property&mdash;and I do not see that that is likely to happen&mdash;how can we insist on the owner of a house making provision for a family?  How are we to get over that?  I am advised that anything put into that is unnecessary, and why put anything in it if it is unnecessary? There has been a lot of talk about this matter, but we have to face the facts. We cannot devise machinery, and we cannot settle the problem by putting this in the section.  If it could be done, I would have no objection.  We are reasonable people here, used to dealing with problems of one kind and another, and there is no purpose served in trying to persuade ouselves that to put that in will solve the problem which we know exists.  Deputy O'Connor made the case that I would have made.</P>

      <P>The Minister and Deputy O'Connor remind me of a certain gentleman who went to South Africa, and who had a peculiar history there.  Every time he went in search of the Boers he managed to know that the Boers were east and then he always went west.  When the Minister and Deputy O'Connor looked for their problem they, like the late Sir John French, went in the wrong direction, knowing they would not find the Boers there, and they showed masterly inactivity. Where will they get anything about it in the De Vesci or the Pembroke estate offices?  You will not find anything there.  If you read the <i>Evening Mail</i>, the <i>Irish Times</i>, the <i>Irish Independent</i> or any other Dublin <Col N="1123" /> daily or evening newspapers, you will find in 99 per cent. of cases &ldquo;Flats to let&mdash;adults only&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>That is the problem.  We are not trying to create an imaginary problem; we are trying to deal with a problem that exists.  If those people do get in and families come along afterwards, the landlords start a racket with them and make their lives an absolute hell. It is not always because they have children that they are put out.  The landlord comes along, moved perhaps by some crank in the premises, some other dweller in a flatlet, and he starts a racket about some nuisance or some annoyance, and the next thing is an ejectment.</P>
      <P>I know you will not find in the court records any case where the occupant of premises was put out because of children.  I want to get to the stage where we will get them in, not out. If they are in I do not care by what strategy or subterfuge they have got there.  If they are in, I want to ensure that the landlord will not be in a position to turn them out.</P>
      <P>I do not know what view the courts will take.  It has never been tested, and there is no purpose served by anticipating.  Perhaps on grounds of policy they might say the landlord was not entitled to possession.</P>

I do not want to engender any heat.  I want to bring the matter to the notice of the Minister and the Government in the hope that something will be done now.  It is futile to tell people that the solution of the problem is the building of more houses when you know there is not a hope of building houses in adequate numbers during the next five years. Something will have to be done.  I cannot see houses being built for the next five years unless in a very limited way.

I do not say that we can do a whole lot, but we can indicate our policy in a particular direction, and we can show that we disapprove strongly of the present practices of landlords.  The problem applies largely to the flat and the flatlet; it does not apply to houses in the ordinary way.  It is only a matter of finding out how we can improve the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think here is some force in Deputy Coogan's representation. There is some use in the Legislature going as far as it can go to meet an evil in that, after all, taking the De Vesci estate, or large land owners of that kind, provided there is nothing on record in the legislation of the country, they are mostly run by solicitors, perfectly honourable men, who recognise that their first duty is to their <Col N="1125" /> employers, the land-owning trust, whatever it may be, and, in the absence of any express declaration on the part of the Legislature that a certain course of conduct is desired, they are bound by professional honour to do the best they can for the estate owner for whom they are acting.  A firm of solicitors, finding in the legislation of this House this kind of amendment: &ldquo;No order for the recovery of possession of controlled premises shall be made on the grounds that the tenant has been or is keeping and maintaining on such premises any children or young persons being members of his own family or such as are dependent upon him&rdquo;, would be entitled to say to the managers of the De Vesci estate: &ldquo;Possibly it would pay the estate to have no one but childless people in their flatlets, but it is clearly contrary to the general tenor of the legislation in the country&rdquo;, and I do not believe the proprietors of this estate would wish, in violation of the general trend of social legislation in the country, to make a stipulation which is clearly frowned upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am no very great enthusiast for the poor old Constitution, except in its capacity as a popular red herring, but Article 45 of that Constitution is headed: &ldquo;Directive Principles of Social Policy.&rdquo;  The Taoiseach justified that here by saying: &ldquo;None of the provisions of this Article are enforceable at law, and I do not intend they should be, but they are written in here to give full notice to everybody that that was the way in which the mind of the Legislature is running.&rdquo; If I were the tenant of a house, and a plot which Deputy Coogan envisages, a plot which, I think, is not at all far-fetched, were hatched against me, if some cranky old gentleman upstairs were persuaded to go into court and say that he is kept awake at night by the yowling of infants, or that Mrs. So-and-so was a very quarrelsome person, and he could not live with her; or the piano was being played too much, I would say: &ldquo;The truth of it is that it is not the piano which is upsetting this old gentleman, and not my temperament, but the fact that the De Vesci Estate want me out of the flat because we <Col N="1126" /> have four children.  I can prove to the court that there has been no conduct constituting a nuisance on my part, except that, on occasions when the baby has been sick, it may have cried during the night, but I cannot help that.  I did not want the baby to cry any more than the old gentleman upstairs, but that is the real ground on which they are trying to put me out.&rdquo;  By reference to the amendment which I suggest, I think the court would say: &ldquo;We are satisfied, having heard all the evidence, that there is no real nuisance here, beyond the nuisance inseparable from a crying baby, and we are going to determine that the real ground on which it is sought to get these people out is that they have children, and accordingly we will not eject them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As to getting children into a flat, I think Deputy Coogan probably agrees with the Minister that there is no legislative method by which you can do that, but I seriously suggest that, where you have a large estate, responsibly managed, it will materially affect the general attitude of those managing it if the Legislature goes on record with an amendment of the kind I suggest, and that they will make up their minds that it is one of the liabilities of large landlord properties to accept the inconvenience of having large families accommodated in their premises if they intend to remain in the house-letting business.  I do not suppose we can expect the Minister, having come into the House unprepared to accept an amendment of that character, to change his mind without mature reflection and consultation, but I do put it to him, as my last word, that he should look at Deputy Coogan's amendment and consult with his advisers as to whether it might not be useful to put in my suggested revised version of it.</P>
    <P>There is only one danger in it, and I suggest that the Minister should weigh that danger against the advantages I envisage.  It is hard enough to get into a flat now if you have a family, but if you give exceptional protection to the person with a family, landlords may say: &ldquo;Bad as it was to have them before, when they were not in a privileged <Col N="1127" /> position, if we let such into our premises now, it does not matter what nuisance they commit, or how outrageous their conduct becomes, they will go before the court and say that it is because of the children we want to get them out, and, judges being naturally sympathetic to that kind of person, they will refuse to listen to any allegation of nuisance against parents of families at all&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If that apprehension is well-founded, let us be careful lest, in trying to help such people, we in fact hinder them. I am not clear as to the relative merits of these two considerations.  The Minister and his advisers will be able to weigh them up, and, if he thinks, bearing that danger in mind, that the amended form of Deputy Coogan's amendment would serve a useful purpose, he might consider doing something on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I also ask the Minister to reconsider it.  While I agree that the real difficulty in this case is to get tenants with children in, there are difficulties in relation to a number of estates in a particular place which I have in mind.  It is a place like Dun Laoghaire where a lot of landlord houses&mdash;in most cases, absentee landlords&mdash;are let in flats.  They are formed into either trusts or companies, and, in a large number of cases, are being managed by agents or by solicitors. While they are not actuated by any wrong motives, their first concern is for their clients.  They want to preserve the property and children will usually create a certain amount of damage for the repair of which the agent or firm of solicitors is responsible. I hesitate to quote the Constitution again because I always feel it is like the devil quoting scripture to suit himself, but it might be some indication of the Legislature's view.  I do not see how it would in any way harm the general tenor of the Bill if the Minister accepted the amendment.  It may be innocuous, but there does not appear to be any serious objection to accepting it.</P>

      <P>I can assure Deputies that I did not require this debate to bring this matter to my attention.  I am well aware of the problem and should like to solve it if I could, but I particularly asked the Attorney-General to consider Section 37 from the point of view of whether it gave adequate protection to people with children and his considered opinion is that it does.  I do not think it is proper to bring into a Bill a provision which is unnecessary.  As to my coming in unprepared to accept the amendment, I think it would be a wrong attitude for me to adopt because there would be no point in having a debate at all if I came in with my mind definitely made up.  I hope my mind is open to receive worth-while suggestions, and in fact certain points were brought out on Second Reading with which I dealt on this stage, and I think the Bill has been improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, however, a possibility that if we inserted this in the Bill, we might do damage to people with families. Those who select tenants might take every precaution to ensure that there would not be children, whereas they would not be so careful now.  I will look into it again in the light of what has been said, but I assure the House that I have given this my personal consideration.  My advisers have also considered it, and we asked the Attorney-General to go very carefully into it.  I have not heard anything which makes me feel I should accept the amendment, but I will consider it further.  If I come to the conclusion that I ought to accept the amendment in principle I will do so on Report.  I wonder whether the acceptance of it would not do more harm than good.  I do not think Deputy Coogan was fair in what he said, that he knew the enemy was west.  We are genuinely trying to find out where there are such cases.  We know the problem that is there as well as he does.  I had to go to my advisers for information.  Where else could I look for it?  We had to go to house agents and solicitors who have a lot of experience in the letting of houses.  That is where we went for our information.  That was not going east when we knew we would get our information <Col N="1129" /> by going west.  I repudiate that particular suggestion.</P>

We see from advertisements in the newspapers that when flat-owners are looking for tenants they look for &ldquo;adults only.&rdquo; If one turns to the column in the newspapers where advertisements from domestic servants out of employment appear they indicate that they also are looking for &ldquo;adults only.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is designed to protect the tenant who has given notice to quit on the presumption, shall we say, that he has made an agreement to get <Col N="1130" /> another home.  In such case the landlord should not have the right which is vested in him in the words &ldquo;contracted to let premises&rdquo; where the tenant's new agreement subsequently falls to the ground.  Seeing that the house is controlled, no great hardship will fall on a landlord if that particular provision is ruled out.  What I have in mind is the case of a man who gives his landlord notice to quite, and subsequently finds that the arrangement that he has entered into for a new home does not materialise.  In such a case he should be allowed to retain his old home.</P>

A man surely ought to consider his position seriously before he gives his landlord notice to quit.  A landlord may be depending on the rents of his houses.  He will want to have them let all the time.  If he gets notice to quit and enters into an agreement with a new tenant, I imagine that he would be leaving himself open to an action at law and to damages if he failed to carry out the agreement.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any necessity for the amendment.  It is unlikely, I think, that a man would do what the Deputy suggests, that is, to buy a house already occupied in the hope that the court would give him possession of it.  Deputies know that under Section 37 there are provisions to protect the tenant.  The overriding one is that of &ldquo;greater hardship&rdquo;.  I know one case myself where a man got a written undertaking from a person that he was letting into a house for one year.  The undertaking was that that person should leave the house at the end of a year.  The owner wanted the house for a son who was getting married.  The case went to court and, despite the written undertaking, the court held by the greater hardship clause, and left in possession the person who had undertaken to leave it at the end of the year.  No one would buy a house in the hope that the court was going to give him possession by evicting a tenant.  I think that such a person would be an optimist.  The amendment is not necessary and I am not prepared to accept it.</P>

Now he wants to make provision for an employee of a tenant.  I am anxious to hear what explanation the Minister has to make of this particular provision.</P>

      <P>That has been taken word for word from the 1923 Act.  It has been in existence for 22 years and I have never heard any complaint as to how it worked.  I have simply incorporated this provision in this Bill.  It is a copy, word for word, of the provision in the 1923 Act.</P>

      <P>The fact that the Minister has copied it from another Act is no justification for it and no indication that it has merit behind it. Here is a case where you can have collusion between an employer and an employee to rig up a bogus tenancy. In so far as one employee is concerned, you can understand the arrangement but, where the Minister proposes to extend it to the employee of a tenant, it seems absurd.</P>

      <P>Anyway, I took it for granted that it had worked, as there had been no complaints about the particular section.  There is the provision about the greater hardship, which is the principal part of the whole section, and makes any abuse of the kind Deputy O'Sullivan visualises very unlikely. A person could not be got out by any subterfuge of the kind he imagines if it could be shown that a greater hardship was being inflicted on <Col N="1133" /> the person being put out.  The court is not very easily shifted from that position.  It is not necessary to alter it.</P>

      <P>The point is one which has been referred to by the Minister.  As I understand, this provision obtains so far as business premises are concerned and why not, therefore, in the case of private dwellings?  It was, I understand, in the 1923 Act.</P>

      <P>The provision about alternative accommodation was, I think, in some of the earlier Rent Restrictions Acts but in the 1923 Act it was dropped and the question of greater hardship was brought in.  It is generally considered that that leaves the court in a much better position to deal with the case.  In the case of a dwelling, to try to show that there is alternative accommodation equally suitable as the place the tenant is being put out of is a matter of great difficulty.  It is felt that the court has much greater freedom to act according to the merits of the case by the provision of greater hardship, added to the other clause at the end of the section &mdash;&ldquo;and, in any such case, the court considers it reasonable to make an order&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>It is all very well if the Minister says to us that the Attorney General has advised him that the words &ldquo;and in any such case the court considers it reasonable to make an order&rdquo; govern the whole of Section 37.  That is a weighty opinion.  But, as Deputy Moran points out, if you look at paragraph (f) you will see that it is introduced by descriptive words, &ldquo;in the case of business premises&rdquo; and then the section goes on.  It may certainly be argued that these words &ldquo;in the case of business premises&rdquo; control <Col N="1135" /> what remains of the section.  It does not say &ldquo;and in any case referred to in this section&rdquo; or &ldquo;in any case covered by this section&rdquo;.  It says &ldquo;and in any such case&rdquo; coming after the words &ldquo;in the case of business premises&rdquo;.

Then there are all these paragraphs down to (f)&mdash;&ldquo;in the case of business premises&rdquo; and then you have the words &ldquo;and in any such case&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Case&rdquo; first comes into the section in connection with paragraph (f) and I think it might be powerfully argued that therefore the word &ldquo;case&rdquo; in the last sentence has reference to (f) inasmuch as that is the first place the word &ldquo;case&rdquo; appears.</P>

      <P>On Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment No. 99, he wants to put in &ldquo;and the court is further satisfied that alternative accommodation reasonably equivalent as regards rent and suitability in all respects is available&rdquo;. That is the alternative accommodation phrase.  Deputy O'Connor is perfectly correct in saying that that phrase was in earlier Acts but was left out of a later Act and substituted by this phrase &ldquo;greater hardship&rdquo;.  That may well be so and that the courts, when discussing &ldquo;greater hardship&rdquo;, make it an item of their consideration whether there is alternative accommodation available.  Deputy O'Sullivan wants to ensure that that alternative accommodation will be a <i>sine qua non</i> of any order and that no consideration of greater hardship will be allowed to operate if they are not sure that alternative accommodation is available reasonably equivalent as regards rent and suitability in all respects.  You get that in as one item and, after that is satisfied, the court moves on to consider &ldquo;greater hardship&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>If you were thinking only of a landlord who requires the premises as a residence for himself, I certainly think that it would be a line-ball case.  It is an equal hardship.  If the owner of a house wants to get back into his own premises, he should get back, if it is a line-ball case.  But, where you add on &ldquo;or for any person <i>bona fide</i> residing or to reside with him or for some person in his whole-time employment or in the whole-time employment of some tenant from him&rdquo;, it seems that you are stretching this &ldquo;greater hardship&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I have not made my point clear.  I should like to make this Bill more favourable to the landlord if it were only a question of a houseowner requiring his own premises as a residence for himself and his family.  But when you extend that, and you add that he should be entitled to get possession because he wants it for somebody who is residing or is to reside with him, or for some person in his employment or in the employment of some tenant from him, then I think that it might be an obligation on the landlord in these latter circumstances: (1) to show that there is alternative accommodation for the occupier, and (2) that it is a greater hardship to refuse an order for possession than would be entailed by granting it.  I think the Deputy has a lot of merit if he joins his two amendments together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the application of the section, there is one danger, as there was in the old legislation, and that is the question of letting for temporary convenience. Section 45 deals with that, but it does not put the position any further than it was in the old legislation.  If you get an agreement under which a tenant admits and declares that the letting is for the temporary convenience of the landlord and himself, such agreements have been upheld, and it is a way of getting outside the provisions of the Act.  It may well be a way of getting outside the provisions of this Bill.  I suggest to the Minister that we should examine that loophole and that some provision should be made that the agreement would have to specify either what the temporary convenience actually was, what the purpose of it was, or that that particular danger should be guarded against, as it has been used as a method of circumventing former lettings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I have had experience of special provisions like that under the legislation that exists.  In practically every letting agreement, where you intended to give the landlord a chance of recovering his premises when he wanted them, you put in a provision that the letting was for the temporary convenience of the landlord. There were cases in which such <Col N="1139" /> agreements were upheld in which the tenants admitted and declared that the letting was for the temporary convenience of the landlord, although in fact no such reasons existed at the time of the letting.  When a tenant wants to get into a house he is prepared to sign an agreement with any provision in it.  I suggest that, under this Bill, the very first attempt by members of my profession, in order to endeavour to get clients out of this Bill, will be to work this old gag of temporary convenience lettings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the matter was entirely different.  I understood there was some decided case&mdash;I do not remember it&mdash;to the effect that the court will not be satisfied merely with an agreement which states that the letting is a temporary convenience one, but will examine into the circumstances and must be satisfied that, in fact, there is a temporary convenience.  The point the Deputy refers to, of some tenant who, in order to get into premises, has been induced to sign an agreement containing a statement that it is a temporary convenience letting, does not affect the matter.  He will have to inquire fully into it.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to enlighten me as to the effect of sub-section (3):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Nothing in sub-section (1) of this section shall affect the operation of Section 26 or Section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931 (No. 50 of 1931).&rdquo;</P>

      <P>To add at the end of the section the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3) On the death of the statutory tenant of controlled premises the following provisions shall have effect:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a) in case the statutory tenant leaves him surviving his wife, who was residing with him at the time of his death, she shall be entitled to retain possession of the premises under the same terms and conditions <Col N="1141" /> as the deceased statutory tenant;</P>
    <P>(b)  In case the stautory tenant does not leave a wife so residing, such member of the statutory tenant's family so residing or, where there is more than one such member, such one of them as may be agreed upon between them or as may be selected by the court in default of agreement shall be entitled to retain possession as aforesaid;</P>
    <P>(c) in case the statutory tenant was a woman, paragraphs (a) and (b) of this sub-section shall have effect with respect to her husband and family as they have effect with respect to the wife and family of a statutory tenant being a man;</P>
    <P>(d) in any case to which none of the foregoing paragraphs applies, the interest of the statutory tenant shall determine at his death.</P>

      <P>The Minister proposed to give us quite a lot of information on this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed all this on Section 2.  This amendment is the corollary to amendment No. 8, which proposed the deletion of portion of the definition of the word &ldquo;tenant&rdquo; in Section 2 (1).</P>
      <P>The new sub-section proposed for insertion in Section 39 defines precisely and explicitly the rights of succession on the death of a statutory tenant.  It is a substantial re-enactment of the existing law on the point, subject to two amendments.</P>
      <P>First, the case of a widower of a statutory tenant is provided for. Deputy Coogan mentioned on Second Reading that the existing provisions in the 1923 Act did not cover such a case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, under the amendment the right of succession to a statutory tenancy is extended beyond the person who first succeeds.  It has been decided under the 1923 Act provision that the right of succession did not extend beyond the first successor.  The Town Tenants' Tribunal recommended in their agreed report that the law on this point should be changed as is now <Col N="1142" /> proposed in the amendment.  This is done by making it clear that the person who succeeds becomes a statutory tenant in as full a sense as the original statutory tenant and subject to the same terms and conditions, so that when he or she, in turn, dies the right to retain possession will pass to the person (if any) next entitled to succeed under the provision.  I think that makes it pretty clear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That will not allow in the sister of a tenant.  If there are two sisters living in a dwelling-house and one of them, who is the statutory tenant, dies the tenancy does not flow to the other and there have been cases where the surviving sister has lost the tenancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that this amendment should be made applicable to all tenants of premises which are controlled by these Acts.  I can see no reason why the benefit of this provision should be confined to a statutory tenant.  The contract tenant who retains possession under this Bill should be on the same basis.  I also suggest that, as in the case Deputy Cosgrave mentioned, sisters and nieces should be protected.  I was consulted recently in a case where the mother of the family was tenant and on her son getting married he brought the wife in to live with her.  The son died and the son's widow was told that if the mother, who was very old, passed away, the widow would be put out.  I looked up the law and found that that was right, that she would have to go. I do not think the position would be very much improved by this section.  I would recommend the Minister to widen the scope considerably so as to protect any member of the family.</P>
      <P>There is an objection to that course, in that it might in some cases result in smaller families being allowed to retain premises.  There may be a number of old people living together, brothers or sisters, and the last surviving might be allowed to maintain premises when a bigger family wanted to get them.  However, if we are going to err, it would be better to err in trying to avoid hardship to the old people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1143" /> I would also recommend to the Minister that there should be a provision that no tenant whose premises were controlled under this Bill should be allowed to leave the benefit of his tenancy by his will.  That would be an entirely new feature of tenancy in this country.  We have never tried to interfere with a person's right to dispose of property, but I do not think a tenant should be allowed to dispose of his tenancy by will, as he might thereafter leave it to some outsider who never was in the premises at all. We would then have the extraordinary position that no one was entitled to the tenancy at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Being of opinion that measures for social security for our citizens constitute the first and most urgent consideration in our post-war planning, <Col N="1144" /> Dáil Éireann requests the Government to introduce proposals for the establishment of a scheme of social security, in which all the existing social services shall be unified and co-ordinated under a Ministry of Social Services, and all persons in gainful employment brought under the provisions of a comprehensive scheme of social insurance.</P>
    <P>This is a double-barrelled motion. First of all, it requests the Government to initiate and establish a social service scheme for our citizens.  The second part of the motion is cutting across Government policy and it asks the Government to change a system that has been in existence for the past 22 or 23 years, and establish a Ministry of Social Service.  There is this reason for that suggestion.  At the present time we have social services divided between two Departments.  The Department of Industry and Commerce looks after workmen's compensation, family allowances, unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance.  Then we have the Minister for Local Government, who is responsible for widows' and orphans' pensions, old age pensions, national health, the dispensary system, hospitals and public bodies throughout the State.</P>
    <P>We will try to convince the Government that, in the interests of all concerned in this State, it is desirable to have a separate Department for social services and allow the Minister for Local Government to devote his time to purely local government work.  We recognise that in this post-war period public bodies have considerable responsibility in relation to house building, sewerage and water schemes, and we feel that the Minister should be more in touch with those local bodies in order to give them advice and assistance wherever they may be needed.</P>
    <P>If you view the position to-day you will observe the unnecessary duplication of Ministries.  You will see that you have one set of citizens in receipt of unemployment insurance, through the Department of Industry and Commerce, and you have others in receipt of widows' and orphans' pensions, controlled by the Department of Local <Col N="1145" /> Government.  We recognise that since Dr. Ward was appointed as Parliamentary Secretary some progress has been made in regard to sanitation and public health.  We believe that greater responsibility should be placed on a particular Minister.  The citizens will then realise that there is one person solely responsible for looking after services from which they may be deriving benefit.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote the case of a workman&mdash;I am familiar with a couple of such cases&mdash;who meets with an injury in the course of his employment. That aspect is controlled by Industry and Commerce.  We find that after his accident the workman has to submit each week a certificate of his inability to work.  After 13 or 14 weeks the insurance society will write to a local doctor.  To my own knowledge they send five guineas for a report on the injured man.  The doctors in some areas find that the man is capable of light work, but his previous employer refuses to give him any light work.</P>
    <P>What is the position of a poor individual of that type?  He may be brought before the local courts and his benefit is stopped.  His solicitors are unable to bring a case into court for another three months.  That man has nothing to exist on unless he gets home assistance.  During a period of two or three months his mind is tortured, apart altogether from the illness following his accident, as to how he will provide for his family.  He may receive 10/- or 15/- a week by way of home assistance pending a settlement by the insurance society.  Very often we find that before the sitting of the court the man will be prepared to take a small amount by way of compensation sooner than go into court.</P>
    <P>That finishes him.  There is no one to look after him, no one who will try to cure him or give him hospital treatment. We say that such a case should be the responsibility of a Minister for social services.  He should be in a position to see that a workman who is injured while in employment will receive fair compensation, and should be adequately protected by a scheme of national insurance.  Not alone should <Col N="1146" /> he receive compensation, but he should be given proper hospital treatment.</P>
    <P>What position do we find in the country?  We have a dispensary system which is, in our opinion, out of date. The dispensary doctors are not adequately paid.  In some cases they have to look after populations of 5,000 and upwards and they have to travel long distances in remote portions of the country.  In some areas the dispensary doctor has a maximum salary of £300.</P>
    <P>The doctor has to depend on red tickets.  We have one section of the community receiving red tickets, but there is another section, including small farmers, small tradesmen or shopkeepers in rural areas and others with limited means, and they do not receive adequate medical attention.  Very often the man with a small income is unable to pay for adequate medical attention and the result is that his disease develops.  It is only when he is in the last stages that he is brought to a Dublin hospital and the first question asked about him is: &ldquo;What means has he?  Has he £40 for an operation, or £30?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The result is that his whole life-savings are gone and his case is so far advanced that the operation fails to cure him.  If we had a Minister for Social Services, medical aid would be available for all sections&mdash;the small farmer, the agricultural worker and the business man in the rural area. These sections of the community would take advantage of the medical services available, and, if these services had been available in the cases I have mentioned, many of these men would be alive to-day.</P>
    <P>With regard to old age pensioners, the majority of workers are receiving a cost-of-living bonus which now amounts to 15/- a week, but the poor old age pensioner in the rural area is expected to live on a maximum sum, which he receives only if he gets nothing from a relative, of 10/- per week.  We are told that there is an extra half-crown available, but in my county only one out of five receives that extra half-crown.  The public body does not provide anything additional to pay that extra half-crown to old people in the area, and we expect <Col N="1147" /> these old people to exist on this miserable pittance, although it costs the State four times as much to maintain a criminal.  On that basis, we hold that some improvement in social services is necessary.</P>
    <P>We come then to the widows of non-insured persons who are expected to exist on the 5/- a week because their husbands, by reason of illness or otherwise, were unable to become insured. The amount which these people receive has to be supplemented by the rates and a deduction is made in respect of every shilling earned by a daughter or son who goes to work.  In other words, if the son or daughter goes out to work for 5/- or 6/- a week&mdash;and I have known cases of it&mdash;they forfeit the 5/- a week widow's pension.  Directors of factories and large employers of workers are all anxious to put social services into operation.  We see large insurance companies taking advantage of the position and guaranteeing pensions, sickness benefit and so on at a certain age, and the greater the delay by the State in putting such social services into operation, the more we will get into the position in which there will be only the casual or the unemployed worker to insure, because employers of labour are, as I say, insuring their workers for pensions and other social services at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said here some time ago that the scheme we proposed would cost a very considerable sum of money.  We recognise that, but I am sure the Government realises that any money would be well spent if it resulted in an improvement in the position of the people and in giving them some security.  Take the case of blind persons of whom we have a large number at present.  The State grants a small allowance, but again fails to provide a trade for the blind boy or girl.  I admit that, in the case of deaf and dumb people, there is a school where a trade is provided, but, in the case of the person afflicted with blindness, there are no such facilities. In County Wicklow, a blind person over 15 and under 30 years of age receives 12/- a week.  A married man under 30 years of age receives 15/- a <Col N="1148" /> week and a married man over 30 years receives 2/6 per week additional for each child, but no arrangements are made to fit the children to earn their own livelihood.</P>
    <P>With regard to national health insurance, a man receives 26 weeks full benefit, and, after 26 weeks, gets 7/6 a week until he reaches the age of 70, and again no provision is made for the treatment of illness.  He is allowed to linger on until his national health insurance benefits cease and he gets the old age pension.  There is no provision whatever for curative treatment, except in relation to the treatment of tuberculosis in its early stages which is now being made.  Hospital treatment will be given only on a temporary basis. Small farmers and others are not availing of the red ticket system and they have not got the money to bring in a private doctor.  The doctor is not brought in until the patient is in the last stages, when, perhaps, it is too late to do anything for him.  It all arises from the fear of the exorbitant fees charged by professional men in Dublin, even before an operation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said the scheme would cost over £26,000,000.  I do not deny that we have made progress and that certain benefits have been given.  I do not deny that we have schemes of widows' and orphans' pensions and family allowances, and I do not propose to contrast what other countries are doing.  What may suit an industrial country may not suit an agricultural country like ours, and we can evolve our own scheme which will give security from want to our people. The Minister said that we were advocating something like the Beveridge Plan and that it could cost £39,000,000. We never advocated the Beveridge Plan.</P>
    <P>At the time the Minister made his statement, 14th November, 1945, about the Beveridge plan, it was not proposed to put all of it into operation at the one time but rather by stages.  We are submitting that all classes, civil servants and others, should contribute to this fund for social services as well as every person engaged in employment. We say it is the duty of the Government to provide the people with <Col N="1149" /> gainful employment instead of unemployment assistance as at the present time.</P>
    <P>The Minister, of course, pointed out the cost of the present schemes.  We are not wedded to the Beveridge scheme or to that outlined by Dr. Dignan.  We do not care what you call the scheme so long as a scheme of social security is put into operation. We approve of the abolition of the dispensary system.  According to returns published by the Government, we find that public assistance and poor law expenditure are costing £2,540,312 a year; unemployment insurance, £1,361,488; national health insurance, £914,672; widows' pensions, £809,451; old age pensions, £3,815,000; children's allowances, £1,548,000; unemployment and emergency schemes, £1,250,000; free milk and school meals over £1,000,000, making a total of about £13,234,000. Dr. Dignan, in his scheme, estimated that we are spending each year over £4,000,000 on health services; £11,000,000 on social insurance and £3,000,000 on social services, making a total of £19,500,000.  The citizens, by their State contributions paid directly or indirectly in taxation, provide every penny of that sum.  You have these relief schemes detached from one another and you have duplication of staffs. You have inspectors for widows and orphans, and more inspectors for family allowances.  The means test is applied by these inspectors in the case of poor persons, of old age pensioners, and the non-insured contributor looking for a widow's pension.  There is no means test in the case of family allowances. Seeing that all other nations are trying to better the position of their citizens, and seeing what the present schemes are costing, we think that all these services should be put under one Department so that better results would be obtained.  With contributions from all in gainful employment it would be possible to provide a service which would remove the stigma of charity from individuals looking for home assistance.  The fears of people in times of sickness and unemployment would be removed if given the grants that they are entitled to expect from the State.</P>
    <P>People talk about giving something <Col N="1150" /> for nothing.  We are not suggesting that.  At the present time over £19,000,000 are being paid, directly or indirectly, by the people through taxation or out of the rates for the services they are getting.  We believe in Dr. Dignan's plan that a sum of something like £20,000,000 would give the people security, assuming that all hands were engaged in employment.  I ask the House to consider the present position of the small man with a horse and cart working on the roads or of the small farmer or agricultural labourer. They have been praised for their work for the country in the last six years.  What return have we given them for that?  The sections I have mentioned are the worst treated in the community at the present time.  In the rural areas widows and orphans are treated differently from widows and orphans in the towns, while the old-age pensioners do not get the same benefits as those in the urban areas.  There is always the excuse that it costs more to live in a town than in a rural area. I ask Deputies to picture the plight of an old man in a cottage in the country trying to exist on 10/- a week, with the extra half-crown allowed in some counties.  The small working farmer has not the money to call in a doctor when he gets sick.  Therefore, he is neglected.  He does not get medical aid as a rule until it is too late or until his condition has become known to the clergy or other people in his area. When I asked a hard-working farmer in a hospital why he did not get the doctor earlier his reply was that he had not the money.  He said he was afraid that he would be sent to a Dublin hospital and that he had not the money to pay for an operation.  A lot of these men will not look for medical aid on a red ticket.  In most cases it is too late when their poverty becomes known to the local board.  A number of valuable lives are lost owing to the fact that those people did not get necessary medical attention.</P>
    <P>While recognising what the Government has done during the last five or six years we are appealing to them to scrap the present dispensary system. We recognise the improvements that have been carried out in the last six <Col N="1151" /> years.  We think there should be a scheme to give medical treatment to all sections of the community engaged in employment.</P>
    <P>Abolish home assistance, and provide that the public bodies contribute their share to supplement the sums granted to sick people and persons unemployed. We are not advocating a scheme that would apply in the case of a big industrial country.  We do say that we can afford a scheme of social services, and that we can give a lead to other countries at a cost that will be only a few million pounds more than what we are paying to-day for the half-social social services that we are giving.</P>
    <P>The Government may say that we are proposing to cut across their policy by advocating the setting-up of a separate Ministry.  We believe that is necessary.  We believe that if the real feelings of the representatives of the country were tested it would be found that the people would support a scheme to abolish the dispensary system and would approve of the setting up of a special Ministry to be solely responsible for the administration of these social services.  Each Department at present has enough work to do and should devote its whole time to it.  Members of the House who have experience on public boards are aware that the Department of Local Government and Public Health is divided into different sections.  I believe the Minister for Local Government should be more in touch himself with the feelings of the representatives on public boards.  All Parties will have to cooperate in a big post-war housing scheme and sewerage scheme.  We expect immediate attention from the Minister, who has experts to advise him, and we expect him to assist the public boards. At the present time responsibility is delegated to a Parliamentary Secretary, but the Minister is responsible and he is regarded by the public boards as being solely responsible. In respect of amenities such as pasteurisation, dispensary, and other social services, it is our opinion that it is better to have one Minister <Col N="1152" /> solely responsible and to have another Minister for Local Government to look after and to assist public bodies in the work that they have to do.</P>
    <P>The question has been raised by all Parties in the House, and public bodies have sent resolutions in regard to the matter, of initiating some social security scheme in this country.  This is the place in which to ventilate our grievances.  I am not doing it for any purpose other than that I believe it is necessary to suggest these schemes to the Government with a view to bringing to their notice the effects of the legislation they pass and the expectations of the people in regard to it.  I hope that it will be possible to keep the debate on this motion along the lines that we desire it to take, and that no advantage will be taken of it of a political kind.  We are not particularly concerned as to who will bring in the scheme provided it is brought in.  We will be satisfied if the scheme meets with our approval and if there is an effort made to implement it.</P>
    <P>We regret certain statements that were made here and elsewhere that we have less benefits in this country than other people enjoy.  Great Britain is preparing a much more ambitious scheme than any scheme which I think could be initiated here.  However, we here are free to evolve our own plans in accordance with what we believe are the wishes of the people, in accordance with the dictates of the people.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Government have taken the matter seriously, and I hope that as a result of suggestions made on this motion, a comprehensive scheme will be devised which will be productive of the benefits we all desire.  I think every member of the House desires to see a scheme initiated which will remove the fear of want from the majority of our people.</P>
    <P>The big industrialists at the present time have made arrangements in this regard, and surely the State, with the responsibilities they have to the community, should see to it that a scheme is brought in which will benefit all sections of the community.  We hope it will not be assumed by the Government that we are asking for something for nothing.  We suggest that all persons <Col N="1153" /> in gainful employment should contribute.  I am sure that no person in gainful employment would object to paying an increased contribution if he knew that in return for that contribution he would derive greater benefits, that his friends would derive greater benefits.  I am sure the working farmers would not object to paying their share if they knew that in return they would be guaranteed hospital treatment and other benefits that the ordinary worker in industry receives at the present time.  We are all in favour of the scheme.  Most Reverend Dr. Dignan brought out a scheme and estimated the cost at over £20,000,000.  At present we are paying over £19,000,000 for services which we admit are necessary but which we suggest will have to be improved for all sections of the community.</P>
    <P>I hope contributions will be made to the debate which will give the Government some idea as to the nature of such a scheme.  All sections are in favour of some such scheme being put into operation.  That being so, I am sure the Government will have the active co-operation of all sections of the House.  If we do nothing else but bring to the Government's attention the serious plight of the people that I have referred to, the motion will have done some good.  We have introduced the motion, not for any ulterior motive or for any propagandist purpose, but because we recognise the position.  The people must be content, and to make them content it will be necessary to give them the services we suggest.  I appeal especially to the Taoiseach to remember that, in addition to the social services that we have mentioned, such as increasing the amount of national health benefits and workmen's compensation, other services are required.  We should not rest there. That is why we suggest separate Ministers. We will first have to try to get every fit person to work.  Then we must deal with prevention of disease.  In that connection, also, we will want a separate Minister.  If we are to have the healthy nation we all desire, we should have some Minister whose duty it will be to consider the question of increased sickness benefits and to prepare some scheme of prevention of the <Col N="1154" /> many diseases which unfortunately occur at the present time.</P>
    <P>We recognise the duty of the Government.  We recognise their difficulties, but we can get over those difficulties now.  Millions of pounds were voted for the Army.  That was necessary expenditure, and there was no question about it.  Now our people require a guarantee for the future; our old people require greater assistance. We will no longer have that expenditure on the Army, and therefore we can initiate a scheme without increasing taxation, to give these people the security they desire.  We will not give them the excuse that is being given at the present time about our neglect of our people.</P>
    <P>We say that this is an opportune time for dealing with this matter.  We have young men coming out of the Army and, when they are idle after coming out, they will not be contented with the allowance granted to them. There is also the danger of men coming across from another country and bringing certain ideas with them, forgetting that this is an agricultural country.  They may try to expound their views.  Then a large number may be demobilised from the Army with no prospect of employment. We say that it is a matter for the Government to provide gainful employment for these people and, under the insurance scheme, give them benefits that we desire for our people.  I hope the contributions by speakers to this debate will show that all sections in the House, even Fianna Fáil Deputies, are desirous of having a scheme of social security for our citizens.</P>
    <P>This motion has been on the Order Paper for a long time.  Since it was put down I know that a committee has been inquiring into the position.  I do not know whether that committee has reported or what it has reported.  But that committee may receive some suggestions as a result of this debate which will enable the Government to introduce a scheme which will be not alone just, but will be a credit to the nation and to the Parliament to which we are all so proud to belong.</P>

      <P>I cannot compliment Deputy Everett, who has spoken of his optimism, when he asserts that he feels that the Government will make favourable response to this motion, even although, as he correctly adds, it has been on the Order Paper for quite a while.  When the Deputy put down this motion we were still in what can be called the war period.  We are now in the post-war period.  The earlier terms of this motion speak of the first and most urgent consideration in our post-war planning.  What sign has any Deputy got in this House that there is any such thing going on as post-war planning?  All that I am aware of is that the material which might enable Deputies and the public to form some line about plans for the future has been so far withheld from them.</P>
      <P>In the last Budget speech to which we listened we were promised certain financial information, information upon such things as the inflation which had taken place, notwithstanding the standstill Order which was supposed to prevent that.  We also got certain indications as to how far the national income had advanced, and we were told, so far as it had advanced at all, that it was a purely monetary phenomenon. We were given some indication of the increase of prices in this country by the mere statement that wholesale prices had advanced between 1938 and May this year, the date when the Minister spoke, by 98.1 per cent. Further information was promised to us and it is understood this information reached the hands of the Government, but apparently it was so unsatisfactory to them that it has not been published yet, but has been sent back, I understand, for reconsideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A committee on agriculture was set up during the war.  They produced one or two provisional or temporary reports.  The main report, it is understood, is in the hands of the Government for a long time, but the country has not heard of it yet.  We were given <Col N="1156" /> some indication of a scheme with regard to drainage.  When we were discussing the Money Resolution then, we found that, while it was to cost something like £6,000,000, we were hurriedly assured that this would be spent at the rate of £250,000 each year, so that we have to wait 24 years before whatever is projected&mdash;and we do not know what that is&mdash;in connection with drainage is completed.</P>
    <P>One commission which was set up pre-war, or in the early stages of the war, reported a couple of years ago in connection with housing, but did no more than state the problem.  They indicated the difficulties that there were in the solution of the problem. Since the date of the report, no Minister has told us what the Government's proposals are in connection with housing.</P>
    <P>I think the only thing that can be called a scheme with regard to the post-war situation in this country that we have seen is in regard to rural electrification. It is notable that that did not proceed from a Government Department.  What they did with regard to the scheme was to hide it from the public for the best part of a year and a half and then to delay for at least a further half year before they brought in certain enabling legislation. So far as anybody is aware, nothing has been done to any great extent towards fulfilling even any single one of the plans that were regarded as essential if we are to have rural electrification in the post-war period or any time remotely connected with the post-war period.</P>
    <P>Deputy Everett asks that we should still consider as a part of our post-war planning something in connection with social security.  So far as the motion speaks of unifying and co-ordinating existing social services, the case has already been made for that.  Everybody who has any contact with the public realises that, while there are a lot of things called social services and plenty of money being spent upon them, these are under the control of all sorts of different people.  Deputy Everett referred to the number of inspectors and the number of people who <Col N="1157" /> have to traverse this country piling up administrative expenses in order to see that the same person will get whatever is due to him from a large number of these things that are called social services. I think a mere recital of what these social services are, a description of the Ministers under whom they are, and a look at the Estimates to see the number of administrative officers and inspectors associated with them make immediately a case for unification and co-ordination.  Without a doubt, not merely could there be any amount of money saved by cutting out all the over-lapping and the waste and the extra expense of having a vast number of people travelling around the country examining the same person or the same person's family from different aspects, but any amount of irritation could be saved to the people who are supposed to get these benefits.  In the end, I think it would be found that under a co-ordinated scheme what money has been provided and has to be paid by the taxpayer in some form or another would eventually reach in a more liberal way the beneficiaries under these schemes than it does at the moment.  It is always the trouble that, when you seek to interpose in something that is moving&mdash;and in so far as this deals with human activities we have always to regard it as not static but alive and moving&mdash;and when you try to interfere with all the arrangements there are at the moment, you have to make a short-term plan as well as think out something entirely different for the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Everett will get everybody's agreement that the existing social services should be unified and co-ordinated. It is when I come to the end of his motion that I begin to wonder what he means, and until I get his meaning I do not know if I can support him.  He speaks of introducing a Ministry of social services, as if we had not enough Ministers and Ministries, and as if the addition of some individual person would make for simplicity instead of making for more complexity and confusion.  Then he tails off by saying that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... all persons in gainful employment should be brought under <Col N="1158" /> the provisions of a comprehensive scheme of social insurance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I believe that all social insurance should be removed as far as is humanly possible from a Government Department.  I wonder if people realise what happens under some of those benefits we have at the moment under ministerial control.  I have standing out before my mind one case in which I was engaged on the legal side.  An unfortunate man who paid for years into the National Health Insurance Society became completely broken down in health and applied for a contribution. It was refused on the ground that he was fit for work.  He took a preliminary appeal and went before some arbitrator who sat in the City of Cork.  That person found he was completely and entirely disabled.  The report was sent back to the Department of Local Government and Public Health, which immediately countered by demanding an appeal on their side. The appeal taken by them was heard before one of their own officials, who proceeded to hear what was called an arbitration, in the City of Cork.  He summoned the applicant before him and heard his story.  Incidentally, I should state that his opening remark, as stated in affidavit in Cork, was that &ldquo;he was not going to be troubled by the laws of evidence in this inquiry&rdquo;&mdash; and he showed what he meant by that pretty soon.  In any event, he heard the applicant, and then he asked the applicant's doctors to come and state the case for him.  The first doctor thereupon made a submission to the court, which he did by writing, that the man should be removed from the room, because he (the doctor) had not yet told the man how bad he was and feared the result on the person's health if he were to speak of it publicly.</P>
    <P>The patient was removed and the two doctors then disclosed a deplorable condition arising from the state of the man's heart.  They gave their evidence and waited to be cross-examined, but no cross-examination came.  Those who were attending on the man waited to hear some contrary evidence produced, which they could then tackle by way of question and answer, but no one was introduced. <Col N="1159" /> The inspector went off home with the evidence he had heard&mdash;and the only evidence given was that of the applicant and two supporting doctors.  The next thing that came from Dublin was a statement that the man was completely well and entirely fit for his work.</P>
    <P>I know, of course, that the courts upset that on the first hearing, but the State went to the point, when proceedings were taken against them, of entering a defence against the proceedings and carrying them over the Christmas holiday.  It was only when the New Year dawned that they decided to throw in their hand and give this man benefit.  I know that that is a very extraordinary case, but I know also that there are cases which deserve an application to the court quite as well as that did and which, possibly, would succeed if they were brought; but the situation we have with the National Health Insurance Society and its system is such that very rarely can one get one of these outrageous cases brought before the courts to get the mind of an independent court working upon it.</P>
    <P>I wonder if Deputy Everett realises where he is going when he speaks of having this Ministry of social services.  It is quite clear that, in any discussion about social security, the name of His Lordship the Bishop of Clonfert must be at least present in people's minds, if it is not brought into the discussion.  One knows that, for merely suggesting a scheme, he has been put out of administrative life, as far as the Government can achieve that, though as far as we know his suggestions have not yet received the consideration which a great bulk of the people believe they should have received.  Would Deputy Everett like to have all the social services grouped together and put under the Minister who decided that, because the Bishop of Clonfert addressed a general meeting of the National Health Insurance Society, he should be treated in the way he was treated? Would Deputy Everett like that Minister to be in charge of social security and have all the social services grouped under that Minister?  I think <Col N="1160" /> I have only to ask the question, at least in these parts of the House, to know what the answer would be.</P>
    <P>Leaving out of consideration the way in which a Minister will treat the scheme, where are the people looking for any social security to get their safeguards?  Deputy Everett has talked of the Beveridge scheme.  There was a Beveridge scheme, drawn up by a person of that name.  After a lot of debate, that was transferred into what was called a British Government White Paper on Unemployment and Social Security&mdash;and there is a vast difference between the two.  The Beveridge scheme was built upon the recognition of the responsibility of parents for families and was an attempt to put those individuals into a position in which they could carry out and fulfil their responsibilities to their families. A White Paper with regard to social security is an attempt to pull everything in under the control of Government Departments and gives none of the safeguards that one gets, for instance, with regard to workmen's compensation, in having an independent tribunal, safeguards with regard to health, individual doctors to whom one can resort and all the varieties of safeguards there are under the free working of insurance schemes as opposed to the narrow, cloistered sort of control there is bound to be if a Government Department is in charge.</P>
    <P>Then I ask myself further how far this idea of social security is going to go.  I know that the length it has gone in England, even though there is only a scheme so far, is disturbing many people who believe they have the proper conception of life, even though they have not a formal Constitution of the pious type we have.  In a debate recently in the English House of Commons a member of that House who was a doctor referred to the decline in the marriage rate in England.  She referred to the refusal of women to produce the most valuable commodity in the world, the embryo worker, and the comment was that, apparently, in England the law assumes that the normal rate of wages paid is insufficient to enable parents to maintain children, to provide against ill-health and give <Col N="1161" /> them their education.  The comment occurs in a criticism I have read of the schemes they have over there, &ldquo;that social idealists apparently nourish the hope that John Smith's child will become in truth John Bull's child, a cherished part of the country's capital&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Long ago there was a war fought in America.  It was, in part, fought against the slave system.  After that war had been fought, after many years had passed, there was found a certain number of workers in America who regretted what they called the disappearance of the security of the plantation, because they found, when they looked back on the old plantations, that even if people were what they called slaves and could be sold out of serfdom into another serfdom, they were really well treated as long as they remained in a plantation, and their wives and children were provided for. It was even known that there was something in the nature of widows and orphans being looked after.  Of course, the person who regarded the widow as the possible producer of further embryo workers sought to achieve that end by methods that were not entirely desirable. But the position was that the people were content with the plantation conditions.  They could get certain security.  Is that what we are aiming at in all this drive for social security?  A book recently issued in England on the necessity for rebuilding family life in the post-war period has this note:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The State has nowadays assumed many of the former responsibilities of parents, protecting, feeding and educating the young leaving to parents only those that relate to conception and pregnancy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is that the road that Deputy Everett and those who talk about putting social security under a Ministry want to travel?  Is not there another conception, a conception that men ought to be allowed to work in the area in which they are born and that, by their physical exertions, they ought to be enabled to earn sufficient to provide for themselves and for whatever family they choose to rear?  I want to bring <Col N="1162" /> the Bishop of Clonfert into this picture from that angle.  He has published his scheme in the form of a pamphlet and in a foreword to it on the first page he says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Christianity does not demand that people who could and would provide for themselves should be left destitute to give the rich opportunity for being charitable.  On the contrary, it lays down that every man should get the opportunities to provide for himself and that, if he is denied them&mdash;if he cannot get work, for instance, at a wage that will enable him to live and pay social security contributions&mdash;he has a grievance, a grievance that charity cannot altogether remove, for, in the words of Pius XI: `Charity cannot take the place of justice'.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In his preliminary remarks on the original scheme for social security, in the third paragraph, he says this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In a Christian State, a <i>family</i> wage is the solution of the social problems of the worker.  This means a wage sufficient at least to meet <i>all</i> the essential needs of the home&mdash; house, clothes, food, education, etc.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Lower down he says we are in a society in which the employers are not paying a family wage.  He does admit that possibly some of them could not afford, even if they were willing, to pay a family wage, and he continues:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This may explain the trend of the State to-day to relieve parents of their responsibilities and of the very disturbing factor we find in Ireland of so many people relying on the State for almost all things.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I suppose the State <i>must</i> step in and assist but the less it interferes with the rights of the family the better, and it must always be understood its help is only supplementary and subsidiary.  It cannot be too strongly urged that for a livelihood men are to depend on their own initiative and exertions and not on the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>How far are we approaching that, or how rapidly are we getting away from it?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1163" /> I have often referred to the astounding paragraph that is in the Housing Report, where the 36,000 families that I have often spoken of were brought under observation.  A statistical sample of that was taken, covering one-third of them.  It is stated by the authors of that report that it was sufficiently big to enable the conclusions to be regarded as well-founded and, examining the sample which they say can be related to the whole 36,000 families, they found that 45 per cent. of those particular people had a family wage in 1938 of £2 a week and under, and that £2 is related to, as that report pointed out, the purchasing power of £2 in 1938.  If we take the 98 per cent. increase in wholesale prices, referred to by the Minister for Finance in his last Budget speech, it means that £2 has a buying power nowadays of £1 and, therefore, 45 per cent of 36,000 families in the City of Dublin have a family wage at present representing a purchasing power of £1 a week.  The Government policy is to carry that on.</P>
    <P>I was amusing myself, when Deputy Everett was speaking, thinking that supposing we did get a Minister for social services and he was taking the view that really what you wanted was to give people an opportunity to provide these things for themselves, would he not before long develop into a Minister who would oppose the standstill Order?  Would not the main policy he would have to promote inside the Government be the raising of the standstill Order?  How it is expected people are to provide for the health and the education of their children and for invalidity and old age, everything that is spoken of as social security, with the wage policy the Government has pursued is something that no member of the Government has yet attempted to explain.</P>
    <P>Of course, we have the signs that are obvious under our eyes to indicate what is happening.  Without any apparent shame, the Taoiseach was in a position to confess to Deputy Norton within the past fortnight that the number of work permits given to people to fly from this country since the war started was something in the neighbourhood <Col N="1164" /> of 191,000.  These 191,000 people found it was not possible to live here.  I want that figure related to another figure. We are a 3,000,000 community.  We have a lot of aged people.  We have not the usual proportion of young people under 16 in that community.  If one goes to the 1936 Census Report and takes up the division of our people according to occupation, one finds the whole group of people gainfully employed is somewhere in the neighbourhood of 1,125,000.  Of that 1,125,000, about 250,000 are employers and another 250,000 are people working on their own account.  It is not likely that many employers left this country in the past four years and, although it is possible some of the people working on their own account left, I think it is certain that the vast majority of the 191,000 who got work permits came from the people who were neither employers nor people working on their own account and they were a tot of something in the neighbourhood of 650,000.  That meant that two out of every six workers left this country in the last four years.  Why?  Because not merely had they been enabled to keep themselves on the other side, but they could save enough to send over here, to those who, by the standstill Order, were deprived of getting that money by their own efforts here the wherewithal to buy what they required.</P>
    <P>There is no sign, as far as I can see, of the Government relaxing its standstill policy at all.  A lift of three shillings or four shillings is given here or there&mdash;generally when there is something of political importance about&mdash; but, so far as we can understand from the speeches of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, he has the view that those who are gainfully occupied, so far as they are workers who get wages and so far as they are middle-class people who live on salaries, are going to be kept as nearly as possible to the 1939 wage, notwithstanding that the same Minister recognises that post-war costs will be far beyond those which impacted on these people in the pre-war period.</P>
    <P>The same Minister came in here with his arrangements about rural electrification.  He told us that the Electricity Supply Board had, as it <Col N="1165" /> must, built its scheme upon the prices ruling before the war, and he gaily announced to us that, of course, it was inconceivable that these prices would ever again occur, and, when making his Estimates in the Dáil, he took the report based upon 1939 prices and multiplied by two.  He thought that was a fair way of projecting himself into the future when considering the possible expenditure upon electrification in this country.</P>
    <P>But when it comes to the people who, as I would ask, are going to be allowed to provide themselves, by some scheme of social insurance, with all the benefits which people ought to have in the modern life, the Minister thinks they can be scaled down to the 1939 position, and then, presumably, be asked to fend for themselves.  It should be said in honesty that that is not Government policy.  The Government policy is not to let people pay for themselves so far as these social benefits are concerned. The Government policy recognises that if you have a man screwed down to a 1939 wage, he cannot fend for himself in a variety of ways, and hence we have a system of this, that and the other dole, such as unemployment assistance, and, even more recently, the family allowances.</P>
    <P>Remember the cynicism with which family allowances were brought into this House.  Any time they were ever spoken of by those who were in favour of these payments before the scheme was made effective here, they were spoken of in terms of raising the birthrate or inducing people to marry at an earlier age.  In any event, they were designed to ease the life of the married couple.  The Minister cynically told us he did not believe the bringing in of the Vote for family allowances would increase the number of marriages by one.  He did not think it was going to help towards the beginning of greater families, of more numerous families; but there it was, and, of course, it was quite clear that it was the Minister's way of making up for some of the devastation he himself had caused.  That apparently is the policy: keep wages down, and then add on a little benefit here and a little benefit there and then set up an administrative <Col N="1166" /> scheme which will take from the beneficiaries, or the supposed beneficiaries, of these family allowances and other matters, a machine which will run so harshly that you will in the end save a considerable amount of what the public were told the scheme was going to cost.</P>
    <P>I suppose nothing has been so completely canvassed in the country in years past as this matter of the means test, which is applied even in respect of such little additions to some of the benefits the State gives people as they have secured by their own efforts.  By sacrificing something in their lives, people have been enabled to make little savings, but when it comes to giving any of these benefits the fact that the person was a good worker, an industrious person, a thrifty person, goes against him.  If there were a scheme of social insurance, that means test would not be there.  If there were a scheme of social insurance, with the independent safeguards I have spoken of, with the scheme as far removed as can be from Government Departments and Government inspectors, the more likely it would be that people would enjoy the full flow of the benefits which we are told from time to time they are getting.</P>
    <P>I can see no chance of the State, as at present being worked, giving the type of social security I should like to see people having.  I can see the State possibly, as a subterfuge, adopting something like what Deputy Everett puts up, and saying: &ldquo;We will guarantee all these things, and add something here and there, and then we will take it back from the people, because we shall have our ruthless type of administration. We shall scrape, pare and be niggardly, and we shall save what we can on these people, relying on the fact that they are up against a Government Department and none of them can get out into the clear and get the full benefit guaranteed to them by some independent tribunal, some independent actuary, somebody who is apart from Government Buildings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One last point with regard to the Beveridge scheme.  The Beveridge scheme, was a scheme for social security.  It provided not merely that <Col N="1167" /> there should not be more than a certain percentage of unemployment in England but something more&mdash;that there would be a great increase in the national wealth in England.  Sir William Beveridge was quite definitely of the opinion, and expressed himself to that effect over and over again, that unless a very full-blooded expansion policy was operated in England, people would not be in a position to fend for themselves in the way of social security against the various giants he spoke of.  They have at least a liberal view about expansion and wages in England.  They have it equally in America.  What they have and their liberality in that matter should be contrasted with what we have here.</P>
    <P>President Truman recently addressed manufacturers in America.  He told them that, now that workers were coming off the heavy wage payments which they used to get through overtime rates and through working extremely long hours, he was afraid of the repercussion throughout the whole State of America of the reduced purchasing power.  Unless, he said, the worker had as much to take home as he had before, there was going to be a very serious repercussion right through the whole economic fabric of America and he gave his orders that wages should be increased immediately and automatically.  So long as wages had not advanced equally with the cost of living, he said that, wages should be increased thereafter and he would not allow any increased prices by the manufacturers who had to pay these increased wages, unless they could prove to him that there was a necessity to get increased prices even if they were asked to pay lower wages.  But, on the lower level, if there was any trade or occupation in respect of which the wage rate, although it might have advanced, was found not to have advanced to the full point of the increase in the cost of living figure, it must be raised to that point.</P>
    <P>The President, in trying to get that view of his over to the public, used these significant words.  He said &ldquo;I am asking that wages should be increased. <Col N="1168" /> I am not thinking only of employees who want to get these increases&rdquo;. If they are reduced in their wages, remember, he said, that the grocer at the corner, the person who sells provisions, the small man everywhere, the small huckster shop, will feel the effect, and you will have, equally with a reduction in the worker's rate of pay, a reduction in the amount of money that is going into these shops with a corresponding reduction in the amount of money that goes to the employees in the shops. For the purpose of keeping the whole American economy geared to a high point he insisted on these increases.  That is expansionism.  I do not think that even President Truman would say it was expansion at all.  He would say that was keeping things on the level.  Expansion is something beyond that.  There was the change over from war to ordinary industry, and he was trying to get the wheels of industry geared as quickly as possible.  In any statements from British or American politicians, statesmen and economists, you will find running through them this one thing: that if you do not keep a high level of purchasing power out through your workers, then you are going to lead to the old bad times of slumps, and that the slump will be immediately on them.</P>
    <P>What is our policy as opposed to all that?  To keep the worker geared down; not to let him have as much in his pay packet as will equate the increase in his cost of living; put him, as we have put him, on half wages. Under that sort of system you are going to get something new in the way of an expansion policy in this country. You cannot run social security on grinding down wages and throwing out little doles here and benefits there. The only Christian way in which this thing can be done is by putting the individual who is able and willing to work in the position that, through his efforts, he can get enough to provide himself with social insurance.  I have all the while remarked that, when we are interposing into the middle of a moving situation, we must make allowances for those already badly placed, and should move out towards the other situation.  We should put people in <Col N="1169" /> the position in which they can fend for themselves.</P>
    <P>I have seen quoted over and over again the phrase of Lenin that the person who controls the ration books of the population controls their votes. That is a matter that disturbs most people who are looking on the trend of events here to-day.  If people were put in the position where, in their various occupations, they could get enough wages to provide themselves with social benefits then they are free men, able to exercise the rights of a democratic system in a free way without any coercion being brought on them or even persuasion from the fact that a lot of their pay comes from Government Departments, and that possibly even a lot of the niggling inspections that are done by officials may be eased if only they can get the ear of a Government Deputy.  The tendency is there, the tendency to keep the people on a low level, and then provide them with benefits from the Government as if it were the Government were paying them out of their own pockets.  Then when an election comes, they are told: &ldquo;Oh, if you change individuals, these little benefits may disappear at the same time.&rdquo; That is the Irish equivalent of controlling the ration books of the population so as to control their votes.</P>
    <P>Dr. Dignan got a certain amount of publicity for his plans.  He never yet got proper publicity for his idea that it was an insurance scheme that he was at and not a Government scheme.  He wanted the whole thing put into the hands of some body that seemed to be independent, although he found to his cost that he was not as independent as he had expected.  Action is taken against him.  Still the idea was there, that the thing should be worked through an independent insurance body, and that everything the people required in this way should be built up out of their wages and out of contributions from their wages.  He went on to say, as Sir William Beveridge has said, that, unless there was more employment and a higher standard of living, and that depends on a higher standard of pay, the scheme that <Col N="1170" /> he put forward as a suggestion could not even be considered.  Like Sir William Beveridge, he had an idea. He, in fact, put that idea far more prominently than did Sir William Beveridge that this was an individual matter.  He built himself around the family, and the member or the members of the family who were the main individuals in regard to that family. His idea was that it was through giving them better benefits in the way of wages that they would be able to accumulate for their children, for their own old age, and for periods of sickness through an insurance scheme, the things that he thought they required in the present framework of what he called ordered Christian society. Deputy Everett must know that as far as the Government are concerned, they have put Dr. Dignan into the outer darkness, yet, with a happy optimism, he proposes to the House that the Government will make some response to accept this resolution of his.  I think he will find that he will be fobbed off with the usual promise, that he will be told that there is post-war planning, although no details will be given.  He will be told, in the words of the old proverb, that if you live long enough you will get grass, or something as sustaining as that.  But if he hopes that he is going to get any sign of repentance on the Government's part in regard to a low wage policy, I believe that he is living in a time of completely unfounded optimism.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Position of Public Analyst (County Clare).</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>To-day I asked a question of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  I consider that the reply was far from satisfactory. That is the reason why I asked permission of the Chair to raise the matter on the Adjournment, although I do not like bringing the Minister back into the House at this hour.  I asked, in the first part of the question, &ldquo;if he will state if the office of public analyst in County Clare is now vacant&rdquo;.  The answer to that was, &ldquo;The reply to the first part of the question is in the negative&rdquo;.  From my information and according to Press reports, it appears that the former public analyst in County Clare, not very long ago, wrote to the county manager in that county&mdash;not to the county council&mdash;directing the county manager to appoint in her place, during her unavoidable absence, a certain assistant to that position.  Nevertheless, <Col N="1172" /> the Minister's reply to-day to the first part of the question, is that the position is not vacant.  I do not want to bring in the name of the individual concerned even though she is the first lady of the land, but I do not think that it should be allowed that an individual holding an appointment in this country should write to the county manager of a county saying: &ldquo;Hold open this very good position and keep it open for some time until I am in a position to return to it.&rdquo;  Do not think I am raising this matter, as some Deputies may think, for any political purpose whatsoever.  My connection with Clare is very slight and I am raising it because it is a matter that is talked of generally throughout this country.  Even though some members of the Minister's Party may laugh, I want to tell the Minister and his Party that if they, as the Government Party, allow such things to happen and continue to allow such things to happen, it is not to their credit and it will not help them in the country.</P>
      <P>The policy appears to be to make the poor in this country poorer and, to a certain extent, to make the rich much richer.  It is a terrible state of affairs if a person who is appointed to a public position by some means or other, probably because that person is the qualified person and the proper person for the position, as I believe was the case when this public appointment in Clare was made, can come along later and write a letter to the county manager saying, &ldquo;Appoint such a person in my place until such time as I can return.&rdquo;  If the Government allows such a thing to happen it is not to their credit or to the credit of this State as a whole.  That is not politics by any means.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider his reply to the effect that the position was not vacant.  The position must be vacant, because the person who occupies the position has gone on to another and cannot return for the next seven years. I would suggest to the Minister that an appointment should be made to the position in Clare without any recommendation from the person who held the appointment beforehand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I asked what was the salary attaching to that office, I got a very <Col N="1173" /> long list.  It started off with a payment of £100 a year; then it went on to certain rates of pay for certain work done.  Surely the Minister can tell us in round figures, approximately, what is the pay per year as public analyst in County Clare.  Certainly that is what I asked him.</P>

      <P>I have got it in figures and I suppose it would take the Minister himself to let me know what the total means.  I cannot find what the total salary for the position is. I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the matter.  Do not allow an individual holding such a position to get the sanction of the Minister's Department to have somebody appointed temporarily to the position until such time as the individual returns to it.  I raise the matter to give the Minister an opportunity to explain.  Is he going to allow that kind of thing to happen?  I make it plain to the Minister that I do not wish to bring the individual concerned into a debate in this House but I want to explain to the Minister that the general opinion through the country is that it is allowed in this case because it is that individual.  I do not believe it is, but I would ask the Minister not to allow it in this case or any other case because if that is allowed the next thing will be that the people having a pull or by some other means, may grab up seven, eight or ten appointments in the country and then can say: &ldquo;Put this person here and that person there, and let me be jumping from job to job until at last I reach one where I will <Col N="1174" /> not need to worry for the rest of my life&rdquo;.  That puts it, simply and plainly, before the Minister and I would ask him to tell us if it is the policy of the Government to allow that to happen? If it is, it is not a good policy.</P>

      <P>There is a great deal of conscious misunderstanding on the part of Deputy Donnellan in regard to this matter.  The Deputy has been a member of a public body&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and should know what is the relationship between persons who belong to the profession of public analyst with their public bodies.  These are not ordinary appointments.  They are not in the strict sense of the term offices under the county council.  They are appointed in the same way as a consulting engineer would be appointed or as, say, if need should arise, many solicitors are appointed to do certain work on behalf of the county council&mdash;on a fee basis.  Public analysts are like consulting engineers and solicitors. They build up a practice as private persons.  They are engaged in ordinary professional practice as consultant analytical chemists.  It happens that the public bodies, for the convenience of the public and in order to enable them to discharge their functions under the Public Health Acts, have to designate a certain person to be their public analyst and that person has to make for the general public and the public authority, analytical tests upon a fee basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to this question of salary.  All we can say in relation to any one of these appointments is what might be the gross amount that would be paid to the specified person in respect of the work which that analyst <Col N="1175" /> does under the Public Health Acts for the public authority and for private individuals.  But we would not be able to determine for ourselves what would be the amount of personal remuneration attaching to that work, because the public analyst is engaged in private practice, in ordinary private business, carrying out the practice of his profession, in the same way as Deputy Donnellan carries on his ordinary avocation as a farmer and a shopkeeper.  I could tell, if I had a look at Deputy Donnellan's books, what was his gross turn-over from year to year, but I am certain that I, or even the Revenue Commissioners, could not determine what is the exact amount of his personal remuneration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe I do not know myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is similar in the case of a person holding an appointment as public analyst.  He is an ordinary private practitioner, not a functionary of a local authority in the same way as a county surveyor or a county manager or a county secretary is.  He is remunerated in exactly the same way, for instance, as a consulting surgeon by fees per case, but with this difference, that whereas the consulting surgeon might be using all the equipment and the accommodation of a public authority, a public analyst has to provide the equipment necessary for the carrying on of his profession, has to provide the laboratory premises, has to provide the chemicals and scientific apparatus, and has to provide the skilled professional staff which is necessary to enable him to carry out the chemical research which he is called upon to undertake under the terms of his appointment.  Therefore, there is nothing more misleading than to assume that the gross amount of any fee which a public analyst receives would give any clear indication as to what the amount of his personal profit, by remuneration, might be.  That would depend upon a great many things. First of all it would depend upon the extent of his other practice, on the extent of the work which he would carry out for private <Col N="1176" /> concerns as well as public bodies, for of course, all these analysts do carry out extensive work for private concerns. They work for food manufacturers, for drug manufacturers, for people who are engaged in ordinary industrial undertakings and may want to have a water supply tested to see it it is suitable for industrial processes, or for use in boilers or who may be having trouble with the discharge of effluent into rivers and waterways. All these people come to these very highly skilled professional people who occupy the position of public analyst, and they pay fees.  In fact, what makes these appointments to be public analysts attractive to those engaged in that profession is not the amount of remuneration which they get from such an appointment, but the status which it gives them, the cachet which it puts on them when dealing with private individuals who want to utilise their services; just in the same way as if you go to a medical directory and look down the list of professional men you will see the leaders of the profession are very glad to put after their names every public appointment which they hold.  If, by any chance, one of them was married to a distinguished and brilliant lady following the profession of medicine and was by some chance selected by the people for the honour of being head of the State, would we have Deputy Donnellan coming in here and attacking him or her because, without drawing a penny remuneration, he or she did not forgo the right to describe themselves as holders of such-and-such medical appointments either under a public authority or under a voluntary hospital or some other medical institution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is of importance in connection with this profession of public analyst is the fact that before a person can be appointed a public analyst he has to have very high professional qualifications, qualifications which are possessed by very few people in this country, qualifications which, at one time, could only be obtained outside this country.  It is because the holding of an appointment of that sort is an indication, a guarantee, that the person holding it is able to carry on his <Col N="1177" /> ordinary private practice as an analytical chemist with competence and efficiency that these appointments are valued.  They are esteemed and sought for very much more for that than for the remuneration which they bring.  That explains why, when I was asked to-day by Deputy Donnellan to state the terms and conditions as regards salary and appointment, fees, etc., governing the post, I could give him only all the information at my command. I said this afternoon that the remuneration in Clare is on the following basis:&mdash;A payment of £100 a year to cover analysis of samples up to 250.  Everybody who knows anything about this profession knows that a payment of £100 would not remunerate a public analyst if, by any chance, he had only to analyse 250 samples in a year, as he has to maintain his laboratory, provide his technical equipment and his technical staff and give the time either of himself or of his skilled assistants.</P>
    <P>That is a token payment which must be made, which would have to be made in order to provide a basis.  It is only when the number of samples makes it worth while, that apart from anything else, any personal remuneration begins to accure.  Even when the number of samples to be analysed is comparatively large, the element of personal remuneration in the fee is relatively small.</P>
    <P>I gave the Deputy every possible information I could in the matter.  I pointed out that the minimum payment of £100 was quite the usual practice in these matters to provide a minimum payment to cover analysis of samples up to 250, that the payment was 7/6 per sample for samples in excess of 250 and up to 500; 7/- per sample for samples in excess of 500 and under 1,000; and 6/- per sample for samples in excess of 1,000.  Now, there was everything I could possibly give the Deputy; yet he professes not to be satisfied with that information. Was the Deputy's dissatisfaction in this matter genuine or <i>bona fide</i>?  Was it to enable him to open this matter in the hypocritical fashion in which he did?  While disclaiming any intention to particularise any person in relation <Col N="1178" /> to this matter, he was very careful, in the course of his speech, to make quite certain that any person who read the speech would identify the person he had in mind.</P>

      <P>I have just said that the Deputy said he regretted having to raise it.  He need not have mentioned any person's name or sex; but the Deputy was careful to mention the fact that it was a lady, that she happened to be married to some person who occupied an august position.  He was meticulously careful.  The Deputy's quarrel in this matter seems to be that a lady has entered into the bonds of matrimony with an Irishman, a lady who is as good an Irish lady as any man could be a good Irishman, a lady who was in the Post Office in 1916, a lady who played a noble part in the whole struggle for Irish liberty since that period, who happens to be married to the President of our country.</P>

There is a member of this House who holds one of the highest posts in the service of the local authority.  He is not a member of my Party, but he performs those duties on occasion by deputy though he is supposed to give whole-time personal service.

I did not interrupt him when he was speaking.  If the Deputy, who is so meticulous about the concerns of Clare, had devoted his attention to a county nearer to him, with which he is much more closely associated, he would have seen that what the county manager in Clare did had been done elsewhere for other people.  That question was not raised by the Deputy who sits for Galway, because the person concerned there does not happen to have any associations, good, bad or indifferent, either with this Party or with the national movement as a whole.  You, Sir, allowed this gentleman to make a general challenge to me on my conduct. He said that, because the holder of a certain office had certain associations, <Col N="1181" /> she was being singled out for special treatment.  You must allow me, with all due respect to you, to deal with that case, since you allowed it to be made; and whether it suits Deputy Donnellan or not or whether it renders anybody in the House impatient or not, I am going to shatter that canard once and for all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know to whom the Minister was referring, but he referred to an individual in Galway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>And he reflected on that individual.  Is it usual to permit a Deputy to reflect on someone who is not present in the House to defend himself?  I do not know who the individual is at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
