      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he can state the number of containers, boxes or objects left for safe keeping in the custody of banks in Eire which have lain unclaimed for the past 50 years or more and the owners of which are unknown or cannot be traced; and further if the disposal of these assets is dealt with in the same manner as are unclaimed bank balances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information regarding either part of the question, but I might point out that articles deposited with the banks for safe keeping are private property and, no matter how long they may lie unclaimed, the banks remain liable to deliver them up if valid claims should at any time be established.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if his attention has been drawn to a circular issued by the Department of Local Government and Public Health in which it is stated that work in connection with old age pensions' appeals has been impeded by the personal intervention of Members of the Oireachtas; and whether he <Col N="322" /> will cause inquiries to be conducted as to the practice obtaining in other Departments in such matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  With regard to the second part, the treatment of representations by members of the Oireachtas is not governed by any general regulation, and the procedure followed in each Department is a matter for the discretion of the responsible Minister.  In view of the great variety of circumstances, it would not be desirable to interfere with this arrangement, and it is not, therefore, proposed to make the inquiries suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the circular issued by the Department of Local Government and Public Health it was stated that this custom of interfering with judicial officers of a Government Department was introduced in April, 1932, that is, immediately after the present Government took office?  In view of the fact that this undesirable interference with one particular Government Department began immediately after the Government took office, is there not <i>prima facie</i> evidence that, during the past 12 years, there may have been undesirable interference with judicial officers of other Government Departments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the suggestions the Deputy has made are worthy of serious consideration.  I have not in mind the exact terms of the Parliamentary Secretary's circular letter to members, though I got a copy in the same way as every other Deputy, so I cannot say when exactly the present system started.  However, Deputies who have been a long time in this House remember that there was a similar procedure in operation long before 1932 or 1933, and that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health issued an Order&mdash;in 1930 or 1931; I am not sure of the date&mdash;prohibiting Deputies from interviewing the deciding officers in that Department. That prohibition Order was reviewed when this Government came into office and the present procedure <Col N="323" /> was adopted.  It was not an entirely new procedure, as something similar was in operation long before this Government took office.</P>
      <P>Regarding the other suggestion, that there has been improper or undue interference with Department officials, I do not think that is true in any Department.  At any rate, if it is true, I am unaware of it and no representations have been made to me regarding it by any Deputy or anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the fact that in this particular circular it is mentioned that the interests of those applicants for old age pensions on whose behalf no representations were made were seriously prejudiced by the representations which were being made?  Would the Minister not consider that an undesirable state of affairs, and if he thinks there is any danger of such a condition prevailing in other Departments, would be consider appointing a select committee of this House to investigate the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite a different question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite a different matter, as the Ceann Comhairle says.  The prejudice that is suffered by those claimants for old age pensions about whom no Deputy interferes is due to the fact that, owing to the pressure of Deputies, other people's cases are taken out of their turn.  Many claimants are prejudiced <Col N="324" /> because their claims are not dealt with until months after they would have been dealt with if they had been taken in the proper order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state in respect of each of the years 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943 and 1944 (or in respect of such of these years for which the information is available) (a) the junior and (b) the senior counsel briefed in State prosecutions and the total fees paid or payable to each such counsel; if he will also state in respect of each such counsel the fees paid or payable in respect of (a) original trials where the conviction was subsequently quashed on appeal; (b) appeals resulting in the quashing of convictions; and (c) retrials following such appeals; and further (a) the total sums paid by way of costs in each of the years mentioned in respect of criminal proceedings where conviction was set aside on appeal and (b) the number of such appeals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The particulars asked for by the Deputy in the first part of the question are not available in the precise form in which he has requested them, as separate records are not kept of payments to counsel in respect of civil and criminal cases.</P>
      <P>Subject to this qualification, the answer to the various parts of the question is in the form of two tabular statements which will be printed in the Official Report.</P>

    <P>(2) The basis on which permits were allocated was:&mdash;(a) During the first six months of the year permits were granted only to persons normally engaged in the hackney business whose chief source of livelihood was derived therefrom, and then only on the basis of the number of vehicles which they had licensed as hackneys on the 1st of January, 1941.  (b) From 1st July, 1944, onwards, applications were considered on the basis of (i) the normal pre-war <Col N="331" /> transport facilities in the area in which the applicant resided and the existing transport facilities; (ii) the necessity for additional hackney facilities in the area; (iii) the personal circumstances of the applicant and his suitability for the operation of a hackney vehicle.</P>

      <P>There is a certain amount of doubt as to the basis on which the cost of current will be calculated. I understood from the Minister on the Second Reading and Committee Stages that the cost will be based on the floor space.  Numbers of people are under the impression that the floor space of their property, whether or not current is laid on to the house or a division of the house, will be liable for a charge.  There is also some doubt whether the levy will be payable only on the ground floor or on all the floor space of a place such as an outhouse, which contains a loft. I would be glad if the Minister will indicate what the actual basis is, whether buildings not connected will be liable and also whether the lofts of buildings which are divided are liable, or is each light separate and if there will be a separate charge for lighting as distinct from power.</P>

      <P>Will there be any change in the policy of the Electricity Supply Board in certain rural districts? I refer particularly to charges. Certain people have found that the exorbitant charge which they would have to pay for getting their houses connected with Electricity Supply Board current makes it impossible for them to instal electric light.  I am not blaming the Electricity Supply Board in that connection.  It costs a lot of money to instal electricity in a house a good distance away from other dwellings or villages.  Under the rural electrification scheme will that policy of the Electricity Supply Board be altered?  Is there likely to be a lower charge for installing electricity? Numbers of people are anxious to know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise a point on the policy of the Minister as outlined on the Committee Stage. He gave the House to understand that he intended, in connection with power stations, to use turf exclusively for the generation of electricity.  Since I mentioned this matter before, I have got information to the effect that the largest power station in Great Britain is worked exclusively on Welsh anthracite duff, which probably produces more electric current than we do in our whole State.  This station is situated at Swansea in Wales and is known as the Tir John Station.  I understand that Irish duff contains a higher percentage of ash than the Welsh duff but that it has approximately the same calorific value as Welsh duff.  There is very little difference, the calorific value of the Irish duff being 11,000 B.T.U. and the Welsh 12,500 B.T.U.  The extra amount of duff that we would require here would be very small and, in view of the pre-war price of duff&mdash;I <Col N="350" /> believe that duff at one time could be got for something like 5/- a ton and there was a time pre-war when there was no demand whatever for duff&mdash;I put it to the Minister that before he embarks on a policy of using turf exclusively for the steam generation of electricity, he should consider making some investigations as to the desirability of using Irish anthracite duff and at least give it a fair trial.</P>
      <P>I have some figures of comparisons between Irish anthracite duff and turf, and I find that Irish duff has a minimum ash content of 19.6 per cent. up to a maximum of 50.8 per cent.  The calorific value varies from 17,070 B.T.U. to 11,550 B.T.U.  I understand that the tests in this connection were carried out on dry coal, as distinct from coal in the condition in which it is received in the ordinary way of business.  If the tests were carried out on ordinary coal, it would probably be necessary to make some allowance&mdash; from 4 to 6 per cent.&mdash;for moisture. Any experiments I can trace as having been carried out on turf appear to have been carried out on anhydrous turf, and the percentage of ash in this varies from 1.1 minimum to 3.4 maximum and the calorific value from 9,500 B.T.U. to 11,200 B.T.U.  That is in respect of anhydrous turf, but in respect of ordinary air-dried turf, as dried on the bogs here, it would probably be necessary to reduce these figures by not less than one-third to get a fair comparison with anthracite duff, so that the calorific value of Irish duff would be 11,550 B.T.U. as compared with some 7,000 odd B.T.U. for turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of these ascertained figures &mdash;ascertained by experiments on Irish turf and Irish duff&mdash;I ask the Minister to give the House some assurance that, in this matter of embarking exclusively upon turf, he is embarking upon a wise policy.  Figures have been put to us as to the probable cost of turf.  We were told at one time that turf could be produced for 10/6, but we have had to alter that opinion and the approximate price at the moment is something like 50/-.  If, under the new arrangement, the Minister could import machinery from Sweden or elsewhere and produce turf at a figure equivalent <Col N="351" /> to the cost of Irish duff, we would support him in using turf as against Irish duff, but I strongly put it to him (1) that he is embarking on a scheme without any knowledge of what the cost to the country will be; and (2) that Irish duff is an available source of power which can be used and which ordinarily would not be a marketable commodity at all.  I ask him to give some consideration to that aspect of this problem of developing power.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Bill gives the Minister power to embark on a scheme of harnessing the River Erne and also gives power to the Electricity Supply Board to proceed with investigations in regard to water power in other rivers.  I should like the Minister to inform us if that is true and that it will be possible to carry out extensive investigations in regard to the potentialities of waterpower throughout the Twenty-Six Counties.  I have already directed his attention to the potentialities of one or two of our Wicklow rivers, particularly the Avoca River, and I suggest that, if any investigations are to be carried out, he should direct his attention to that area.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave inquired as to the basis of determining the fixed charge for current supplied in rural areas.  The intention is that the board will apply its present rural tariff.  That rural tariff provides for a two-part charge, one part based on the quantity of current used and the other on the floor area of the house and outbuildings. Outbuildings for that purpose are buildings in the proper sense of the word.  One half of the floor area of the outbuildings is taken into account in determining the amount of the charge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to answer that question without knowing precisely what the Deputy has in mind.  It includes the permanent buildings on a farm only.  The supply of any rural dwelling will depend upon the amount of the fixed charge being 1/16th of the capital cost of providing the supply.  The method of determining the charge to be made for current is, of course, different.  The present method used by the board for deciding the cost of the current supplied from the 10,000-volt system, is set out in the report on the rural electrification plan.  One of the appendices gives the method of calculating the actual cost of current per unit, but, of course, the amount paid by the consumer will depend on the amount of current used.  It is not proposed to have a separate charge for lighting and power.  The system of charge will, however, mean that the individual rural consumer will pay at a higher rate for current consumed up to 600 units and at a much lower rate for current consumed in excess of 600 units.  It is a reasonable assumption that the rural household will use in or about 600 units per year for lighting and ordinary domestic purposes, and that consumption over 600 units will be mainly for power purposes, so that, in effect, the consumer will be paying substantially less for current for power than for current for lighting, but that will not appear as a separate item upon his bill.  There will not be two meters.  There will be only one meter and power will be charged for on that basis&mdash;so much per unit up to 600 units and a much lower rate over 600 units.</P>

I could not attempt to forecast the date on which it will be possible for the Electricity Supply Board to commence construction.  It will be not merely necessary for them to have a supply of equipment but also to have a reasonable assurance of continuity of supply, and the Deputy's guess is as good as mine as to when that situation will be arrived at.  I am not sure if I understood Deputy Dockrell's query as to a possible change in the policy of the Electricity Supply Board in the matter of supplying power to houses in rural areas.  It is the purpose of the Bill to effect a change in the policy and practice of the Electricity Supply Board in supplying power to rural areas.  It may answer him if I say that when this Bill comes into operation it will not be necessary for rural dwellers in the areas that are being supplied by the Electricity Supply Board under this scheme to meet any part of the capital cost of connection. <Col N="354" /> He will pay only on the basis of the annual charge.</P>

      <P>First of all it is going to take a number of years to bring the supply to all rural areas.  I am dealing now only with an area that is receiving a supply because the network has been constructed and the scheme is in operation in it.  In such an area no capital charge will be imposed upon the supplier if he comes within the criterion ratio of 16 to which I have referred.  If the capital cost of bringing the supply is more than 16 times the annual charge, then the householder will not come into the scheme and some contribution towards the capital cost would be necessary to enable him to receive a supply.</P>

      <P>This Bill does not empower the Electricity Supply Board to investigate rivers for power purposes. It has that power now.  A recent report, however, of the Electricity Supply Board indicates the rivers in respect of which investigations are proceeding.  I am not sure that I have convinced Deputy Coogan of the wisdom of the decision to generate electricity by using turf as a fuel. There is no practical difficulty about using anthracite duff as a fuel for steam raising.  The only question is whether we have anthracite duff to spare for electricity generation purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>You always had it pre-war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We had not.  Following the construction of the sugar factories and of the installation in these factories of boilers designed for the use of anthracite duff, I think it is true to say that the Irish Sugar Company was unable to get a sufficient supply of anthracite duff each year to meet its requirements.  There have, of course, been very substantial developments in boiler design for using anthracite. Before the war we imported considerable quantities of anthracite.  We imported a greater tonnage of anthracite than we produced.  There is, therefore, nothing to be gained by using up for power purposes anthracite <Col N="356" /> coal which, in the past, we used for other equally necessary purposes. If we divert for power purposes anthracite previously used for other purposes, then we will have to import more anthracite and make good any deficiency in supply that would otherwise result.  If we were producing more anthracite than we could dispose of, then there would be a case for considering its use for power purposes.  I do not think that is the situation.  I think that will never be the situation here.  The extraordinary growth in the demand for anthracite in the pre-war years is, I think, likely to continue after the war.  In fact, our problem in relation to anthracite is to step up production so as to meet the demand for anthracite rather than to devise new methods of consuming it, and to get rid of any surplus that otherwise could not be disposed of.</P>
      <P>I do not want to convey to Deputy Coogan that there is any practical difficulty in using anthracite coal for power purposes.  There is none.  The most recent boilers installed in the Pigeon House are fully capable of using all the types of coal produced in this country and are, in fact, using all the coal that they are allowed to get.  I think that anthracite duff is superior to the coal that they are allowed to import.  The decision, however, to use turf in the steam generating stations is due to the fact that turf represents an unused asset which can be developed for power purposes to an extent that has never been contemplated previously, and if we decide to rely on turf as a fuel for the steam generating stations, then we not merely have a source of employment in the country, but what is perhaps more important&mdash;a greater degree of security of supply in times of emergency such as the present.  The utilisation of anthracite coal, however, in the stations constructed for turfburning will be quite practicable, and, in fact, if at any time there is the position in which we have a surplus of anthracite and a deficiency of turf, there will be no difficulty whatever in utilising anthracite in the boilers designed for the utilisation of turf.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>On Friday, when I moved the adjournment of the debate on this Bill, I was referring, among other things, to the fact that the Taoiseach thought fit to treat the House to a very long narrative of the reasons responsible for the introduction of this Bill.  In the course of his speech he laboured the point as to what were the functions of the Legislature when the Act was being debated. In my opinion, he dismissed in a rather flippant manner the arguments put forward against the introduction of the Bill, arguments which had particular reference to the points raised as to the duties and functions of the Referee and the Advisory Committee. As to the importance that was attached to these functions and duties when the 1934 Act was going through, one has only to refer to Section 5 of the Act which provides that the person to be appointed Referee had to be a judge of the Supreme Court, the High Court, the Circuit Court or a practising barrister of ten years' standing.  That proves that the Referee was in a very important position in regard to the determining of claims for pensions under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The powers of the Referee were very numerous and of a far-reaching nature. He had the powers at present enjoyed <Col N="358" /> by a judge of the High Court or other court in the matter of sending for and examining witnesses.  In the event of any of these witnesses not giving evidence when summoned to do so, or not producing documents under their control, he could find them guilty of contempt of court and inflict whatever punishment fitted the crime.  These were the powers of the Referee and the Advisory Committee to deal with those claims.  I think it will be found that the members of that committee were not appointed under the Act just as mere ornaments; they were there to perform a duty and they had certain powers.  Amongst other things, they were to sit with and advise and assist the Referee in determining the many claims that came before him.  The committee consisted of two officers who had held high rank in the Army in 1921 and there was also under subsection (b) a member appointed by the Minister for Finance and under (c) a member appointed by the Minister for Defence.  That proves that, when this Act was being passed, it was very necessary that the committee should sit with the Referee in determining the claims.</P>
    <P>Certain things have happened since, owing to the judgement of the Supreme Court&mdash;which, by the way, according to the Constitution shall be final and conclusive.  It was decided by the judges in this particular case that the Referee had acted other than in accordance with the terms of the Act. Amongst other things, they found that the committee did not sit with the Referee when he was trying these cases.  The Taoiseach, in the course of his speech, made very little of that fact.  I should like to point out to the Taoiseach and to members of this House who support the Bill that the Act was the child of his own creation. Section 5 and 6 were inserted in the 1934 Act by the then Government of this country, which is the present Government.  Therefore, those who had recourse to the Supreme Court were only exercising the rights conferred on them by the Constitution. As everyone knows, they succeeded in their case and the judges granted a conditional order, in addition to the <Col N="359" /> costs of the High Court and the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>I would respectfully suggest that the Taoiseach, before the Government introduced this Bill, should have made some explanatory statement notifying the House that the Government had, at least, made certain inquiries as to the reasons why those responsible for carrying out the provisions of the Act failed in their duty, with such serious consequences not alone to these claimants for pensions but also to the people of the State in general.  Acts are not passed just for fun in this House; and this was a very important Act dealing with the expenditure of very large sums of money.  The least the Taoiseach should have done was to tell the House that the Government had taken some steps to find out who was responsible for the state of affairs that existed then and exists now.  I think he owed that to the House and to the people; but instead he takes the easy way, by introducing a Bill which, to a very large extent, renders null and void a decision of the highest court in this land&mdash;a court, as I have stated, whose decisions, according to the Constitution, are final and conclusive.</P>
    <P>That is really the issue on which the members of this House have to vote in this debate.  I know that the position is somewhat obscured by the fact that this whole question of pensions may not be so highly rated in certain parts of the country.  Even the Taoiseach may be getting somewhat impatient, on account of the annoyance he has received from those who have made claims for pensions.  As I have said here on many occasions, I am one of those who was not attached to any of these organisations and had no communication whatsoever with them; but, as a member of this House, I am quite conscious of the fact that every citizen is entitled to justice and to have recourse to the law.  If the judges give a decision in his favour, then I hold that no Government has the right to deny him the advantages of that decision, received in open court.  If these men had not succeeded in their cases there would not be a word about it&mdash;the thing was finished.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="360" /> As regards the Advisory Committee, the Taoiseach laboured the point that it was not necessary that they should sit corporeally with the Referee.  I asked the Taoiseach were they to be there in spirit or what.  The fact that the conditions governing their appointment were on a par with the conditions governing the Referee's appointment proves that they were a very important body.  For example, they acted in a similar capacity to a medical officer who sits with a judge engaged in trying a workman's compensation case. The medical assessor is there to assist the judge as to the extent to which the efficiency of the particular individual is impaired in regard to his future earnings, and the assessor more or less gives his opinion to the judge so as to enable the judge to give a just decision when he comes to assess compensation for the workman.  Does anyone think that the medical assessor is of such little importance that it does not matter whether he is present or not? In the same way, in the case of a collision between two boats at sea, although there may be a judge appointed to try the case, yet there are also two nautical assessors appointed, men experienced in all maritime matters.  The fact is that the Supreme Court held that the whole proceedings were <i>ultra vires.</i>  Even the counsel for the State very properly did not contest that fact.  They relied more or less on the section of the Act which states that the decision of the Referee is final and conclusive.  If the foundation was wrong, everything which flowed from it was wrong and, consequently, the cases were lost.  I think it is wrong for the Government to take this step.</P>
    <P>We have been told about the length of time and the great expense which would be involved if the Government were to retrace their steps and start afresh on an examination of these claims.  At whose door rests the responsibility for that position of affairs?  Certainly not at the door of those who made the claims.  I would go so far as to state most deliberately and with a sense of my responsibility to the people of this State that it would be much more manly, and possibly better in the long run, if the <Col N="361" /> Government would decide on that course and go through these claims again.  I am not convinced that these claims would take such a long time to go through, unless the men lie down on their job altogether.  Most of those making claims have already been examined and there is no reason why, in order to keep the Government right so far as the law is concerned, some means like that should not be found so that these men would be given an opportunity of again putting in their claims.</P>
    <P>We should be very slow in this State to do anything that would deprive a man of the justice to which he is entitled.  The tramp on the street, the murderer, the assassin, is entitled to justice.  We have examples of that across the water which we might follow with great advantage to ourselves. Certain things happened there and the men concerned got the rights to which they were entitled.  The Government of that country does not take a shortcut in doing things.  They go through the whole paraphernalia of the law. They are so jealous of the rights of the ordinary citizen that they take good care that nobody can say that he did not get a fair trial so far as any crime with which he is charged is concerned.</P>
    <P>This Bill has for its object practically the setting aside of the judgment of the court, except in so far as it affects those who took their cases to the courts.  I maintain that that is wrong. It is bad to show any differentiation as between any of the claimants.  It is thoroughly dishonest and pure hypocrisy on the part of the Fianna Fáil back-benchers, who felt constrained for reasons best known to themselves to take part in this debate, to state that they were prepared to vote for the Bill and, at the same time, ask the Minister to devise some means, fair or foul, that will sabotage his own Bill before it reaches the Statute Book.  I think that is dishonest on the part of any public representative.  It is symbolic of running with the hare and hunting with the hounds.  It is characteristic of the man who tries to serve two masters; and I have yet to meet the man who can do that.  Therefore, I say that it is utterly wrong for <Col N="362" /> Deputies to state that they intend to support the Bill and, at the same time, ask the Minister to do something that will enable them to go down the country and tell those, whom possibly they have misled into the belief that they would get pensions, that they are a few of the 60,000 whose claims will be reconsidered and who will have up to January, 1946, to send in their claims for reconsideration.  I know that we would not have half of these claims were it not for the fact that many Fianna Fáil Deputies prior to every election convened meetings of these unfortunate dupes and told them to put in claims.  I know that there were many manly men out fighting in 1916 who would never have thought of looking for a pension if they were not advised to do so for obvious reasons. The proof is that there were men whose claims were turned down in 1936, 1937 and 1938 who received pensions in 1944, three weeks before the last election.  If they were entitled to pensions in 1944, surely they were entitled to them in 1937.  If they were not entitled to pensions in 1937, surely they were not entitled to them in 1944.</P>
    <P>My chief objection to the introduction of this Bill is that it is to declare null and void the decision of the Supreme Court and that it will differentiate as between the claims of the many applicants since 1936.  I do not think that is fair.  The Minister, if he is doing the thing at all, should do it straightforwardly.  He should have no reservations whatsoever, if he is introducing this Bill to end, once and for all, the question of the claims of members of the I.R.A.  He should go the whole hog and finish the matter.  I have no sympathy whatsoever with the policy of keeping the door open until January, 1946.  That is why I feel I cannot support this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am not at all impressed by the arguments that have been advanced in favour of the Bill.  I am not impressed by certain statements made by the Minister for Defence to the effect that this Bill got a very bad reception by certain sections of the community.  In case the Minister may be referring to anybody on this side of the House, I want to tell him that, as <Col N="363" /> far as I am personally concerned, I have never mentioned the Bill since it was first announced by the Government Information Bureau.  I am treating the Bill merely on its merits.  I believe that the Bill will violate the Constitution&mdash;the instrument that safeguards the rights and privileges of every citizen, however humble.  Therefore, I hold that the Government is acting unconstitutionally in introducing a Bill which will deprive many citizens of this State of rights and privileges which they enjoyed under the previous Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that Deputy Coburn, in conjunction with most of his colleagues, is not acquainted with the facts either if this case or of the 1934 Act.  I want to point out to the Deputy, however, that under the 1934 Act every individual had his case examined and in a very large number of cases they were examined personally. A White Paper has been circulated to-day showing the methods by which application forms were examined and cases brought to a conclusion one way or the other.  We are not turning down any decision of the Supreme Court.  We have in fact accepted that decision to the extent of having every case in respect of which a conditional order was granted and any cases that may have come in up to the 1st February, reheard.  That, surely, is not turning down the decision of the Supreme <Col N="364" /> Court.  That, surely, is not denying the right of justice to any person who made application under this Act. Every applicant has been examined personally or has had his application form thoroughly examined and I do not see that we are doing anything that is depriving any applicant, to the total 60,000 of any right to which he was entitled.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to accept the amendment which is down in the names of Deputy Norton and Deputy Keyes and which, in fact, was seconded by Deputy Davin because, in my opinion, it is based on three false assumptions. The first assumption which is false, in my opinion, is where they assume that there is still a number of cases outstanding.  At the present moment practically every case has been dealt with by the Referee.  I mentioned in my opening statement that, with the exception, I think, of 74 cases which were referred to the Referee as a result of the Supreme Court decision, and perhaps a few cases of appeal which came in under the clause which asks for additional evidence which had not been already available, the work of the Referee has been finished.  I said it was completed, or would have been completed, at the latest, this month.</P>
      <P>The second false assumption in the amendment is the suggestion that cases were not dealt with equitably.  Again I must refer Deputies to the White Paper which has been circulated to-day and which shows the manner in which every applicant was enabled to have his case heard or examined.  There again, as I have already stated, I maintain that the machinery was over-weighted in favour of the applicant, and I do not see that there is anything that we can do, or that any committee set up by this House could do, that would produce a method which would be more equitable than the one we have had operating for quite a long period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third claim that is being made is that our method of dealing with cases was not expeditious.  I doubt that. As far as I can see, some of the complaints that have reached me are to the effect that we were too expeditious, <Col N="365" /> that we dealt with these cases so fast that we did not give them the proper consideration which they required. That, of course, is a mis-statement. The cases received ample consideration and I think that the case made for the amendment by Deputies Norton and Davin falls to the ground.</P>
    <P>In the course of the Taoiseach's address the other evening on this matter, he referred to the case of the deputy-registrar in bankruptcy in Cork.  I want to refer to it also, because I think the case is so similar to the case with which we are now dealing that it is desirable that I should cite it.  In that particular case the Circuit Court judge who was dealing with the matter had delegated certain functions to his registrar.  The registrar, in the course of time, became ill and the deputy-registrar took over these functions.  The deputy-registrar, I think, was the clerk of the court, a highly efficient officer and a man quite capable of carrying out the functions which the registrar had been carrying out and who did, in fact, carry them out effectively and efficiently.  But some enterprising lawyer discovered, as others discovered in the case under discussion&mdash;the Military Service Pensions Act&mdash;that somebody was not acting in conformity with the Act and he decided that perhaps this might be a good field for striking into.  He struck into it and was successful, as were the lawyers in this case.  He was successful because it was not strictly in conformity with the Act.  Nobody gave any consideration as to whether it was a good practical method or not.  There was a literal translation, as there was in this case, of the Act, and that was what decided it.</P>
    <P>When it was found that the position was such, the Government of that day decided that they would take steps to put the matter right and the then Minister of Justice, the late Kevin O'Higgins, introducing a Bill on that occasion, used these words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I move for leave to introduce and to have printed and circulated a Bill entitled the Deputy-Registrar in Bankruptcy (Cork) Bill, 1926.  In Cork for many years past there has <Col N="366" /> been a local Bankruptcy Court which is within the jurisdiction of the circuit judge of that area.  The Clerk of the Crown and Peace for Cork City and the East Riding of the County was registrar to the court. For some time past he has been in failing health, but, pending the reorganisation of the court staff, which is now being achieved under the Court Officers Bill, it was not convenient to relieve him of his duties and appoint a successor.  He was permitted to act through the deputy-registrar.  It was recently decided by the court that there were certain things which could lawfully be done only by the registrar himself and which could not be delegated to the deputy-registrar.  It becomes necessary, therefore, to validate certain acts performed by the deputy-registrar. We consider it is in the public interest that should be done and this Bill is brought forward to that end.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, that is what the Minister for Justice of the former Government had to say on that occasion and, if we paraphrase the words which were used then, this is what we can say in respect of the present Bill:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was recently decided by the courts that there were certain things which could be lawfully done only by the Referee himself and which could not be delegated to the members of the Advisory Committee or to the interviewing officers.  It becomes necessary, therefore, to validate certain acts performed by those members and officers.  We consider it in the public interest that this should be done and this Bill will be brought forward to this end.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is paraphrasing the statement made by the Minister for Justice of another administration and I would like to point this out, that on the occasion of the introduction of that measure in this House there were present in the House Deputy Norton, Deputy Davin and Deputy Corish.  I have looked through the records to see what protest they made on that occasion and I failed to find a solitary word of protest from any of the three Deputies.  It may be that they were, <Col N="367" /> in the words of Deputy MacEoin when he was referring to certain members of the Advisory Committee, mute of malice or, perhaps, they were stupefied by the array of front benchers.  Whatever may have been the reason, there is no record to be found in the Official Debates, on the First Stage, Second Stage, Committee Stage, Report Stage or Final Stage, of any protest good, bad or indifferent, raised on that occasion by those Deputies.  One wonders why they have become so voluble on this particular occasion.  Is it because they have a very special interest in the Old I.R.A., or is it that they see something of very special propaganda value?  Whatever it may be, I think I can say that on this occasion it will not have any more effect than their attempt to use the Transport Bill on another occasion.  If there is any effect, I believe it will be a reactionary one.  I leave it at that.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins, for some reason of which I am not aware, made a violent and vitriolic attack on me.  I am not worrying about that, knowing the Deputy's technique.  It was, however, entirely irrelevant to the measure which we are discussing and why it was brought in, I am at a loss to know. But, I certainly cannot allow some of the grossly exaggerated statements which he made to go unanswered. When he makes these grossly exaggerated statements I must reply.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister tells us that the only way that he can handle a Pensions Act inside 71 years is to give him authority to appoint a nominee who will sit in a back room and give pensions to whoever he likes, without hearing any evidence and without consulting anybody, a nominee who will deprive anybody else he likes of a pension&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Now, Deputies know that I did not make any statement of that kind.  I want to ask Deputy O'Higgins who, unfortunately, is not here, if that is the opinion he holds of the professional men of the courts?  Is that the opinion he holds of a judge of the Circuit Court, a district justice or a lawyer of <Col N="368" /> not less than ten years' standing, because these are the ranks necessary before any of these professional gentlemen can accept the post of Referee? Does he suggest that any of these individuals is prepared to sell or to prostitute his professional honour and his profession for some imaginary mess of pottage, because that is what it means?  I can only attribute the statement, made in a somewhat violent fashion&mdash;on occasions he appeared to be almost incoherent&mdash;to the fact that he was violently agitated at the moment of making it, and I leave it at that.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that even Deputy MacEoin, who is usually very reasonable in debate, lost his sense of proportion in the course of this debate, because, when he set out to deal with the verifying officers and the interviewing officers, of whom I am sure he has had a large amount of experience, he went out of his way to describe, I presume, the interviewing officers as &ldquo;young whipper-snappers.&rdquo;  I am pretty certain that the Deputy knew he was grossly exaggerating when he described them as &ldquo;young whipper-snappers.&rdquo; I have made inquiries and I find that the least service any of these interviewing officers has in the Civil Service is 25 years, and that two of these &ldquo;young whipper-snappers&rdquo; were former colleagues of Deputy MacEoin.</P>
    <P>He then went on to describe the members of the Advisory Committee as men who had become either mute of malice or stupefied &mdash; I suppose he meant &ldquo;stunned&rdquo;&mdash;by the presence of the Referee and the senior civil servants. I think it is the experience of every verifying officer who has appeared before the Advisory Committee and the Referee that the most highly competent men on that body, the men who were as competent as the highly trained civil servants, were the two representatives of the I.R.A.  I have since found out that there have been many occasions on which the I.R.A. officer differed from his I.R.A. colleague and agreed with the civil servant, and <i>vice versa</i>, so that there is no truth whatever in the statement <Col N="369" /> that these men were either stunned by the presence of these people or were mute of malice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan in the course of his speech read a document, and, I rather imagine, through inadvertence, because I doubt if he wished to do it deliberately, read out the name of a verifying officer.  It was quite a wrong thing to do.  It was an abuse of the privileges of this House, but I suggest that he may have done it inadvertently. As it was heard here, however, it was a most slanderous statement on a man who, as an Old I.R.A. man, gave excellent service.  He is a man of the highest possible character who is at the present moment held in very high respect in the Defence Forces where he is serving.  I have been given a list of the names of the people which the man named was supposed to have given to the Advisory Committee and which he was in some way or other alleged to be responsible for having passed through. I have also here a letter from the company officers in respect of the list in question which makes it very clear that the person named by Deputy Flanagan had nothing whatever to do with the list of which he is alleged to have made some wrong use.  I do not know that anything can be done in the House to rectify the wrong done to the gentleman concerned, other than perhaps the making of an apology by the Deputy, if he is manly enough to make it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton also held that this Bill gives arbitrary powers to the Referee to grant or refuse pensions, but that has been the position all along.  This Bill does not give him any greater powers in that respect than he has.  The position is indentically as it was.  The Referee has been acting in the same manner over a number of years, and it is because he has been acting in that manner that we have brought this Bill in to validate whatever actions he may have taken during the course of the various proceedings in respect of the examination of these claims.  This Bill does not add one iota of power to the power he already possesses.</P>
    <P>We heard a tremendous amount of talk during the debate about the 1924 <Col N="370" /> Act.  I think that even Deputy MacEoin went out of his way to tell us how expeditiously the Board of Assessors under the 1924 Act dealt with these cases in comparison with the people who were dealing with the 1934 Act.  I was left under the impression that the people who were dealing with the 1924 Act were a group of Titans and that the people who were dealing with the 1934 Act were a group of bunglers.  It is no harm to examine the particular statements that were made to see how, in fact, they compare with the actual position as we know it. I think I can say that the statements made in regard to the Board of Assessors under the 1924 Act and the general statements made in this House in regard to this Bill are comparable, that one is just as accurate as the other and no more.  Deputy Coogan, who was also very anxious about this matter of the 1924 Act, almost suggested that we could take up the 1924 Act people and let them deal with this Bill.  They were so expeditious, he told us, that there were 21,147 cases disposed of by the board under the 1924 Act in four years.  What he very modestly did not tell us was that 7,854 of the 21,147 cases were shovelled out by the Department itself, and had never reached even an examining officer, much less an interviewing officer. They were looked on as something unworthy of consideration and out they went.  That left 13,293 persons to be actually heard, and, I presume, they were heard.  Among the 13,293 persons, 3,890 were successful in securing awards.  That left 9,403 persons with <i>nil</i> awards.  If we add to the 9,403 <i>nil</i> awards the 7,854 departmental discards, we get a total of 17,257 <i>nil</i> awards. Yet we were told very innocently by Deputy Coogan that there was not a single complaint and that everybody was satisfied with the administration of the 1924 Act.</P>
    <P>I doubt if there were no complaints from the 17,257 persons who received no awards.  I would be amazed if that were so.  The Deputy then, unfortunately for himself, said, in trying to make a good case, that the figure of 21,147&mdash;he said this in order to show the number of cases that the Board <Col N="371" /> of Assessors had dealt with&mdash;should have added to it, the 1,066 appeals. That figure also reveals the fact that everybody must not have been satisfied because here we find, according to the Deputy himself, that there were appeals against decisions in 1,066 cases.  The Deputy then tried to make out that that meant that the Board of Assessors got through 22,213 cases in four years.  Deputies may be surprised to know that under the 1934 Act we heard 60,131 people in ten years or 6,000 cases per year.  Figures indicate that the speed in dealing with 1934 Act cases was double that shown by the Board of Assessors of which we heard so much.  In addition, we also dealt with a very large number of appeals.  Therefore, when Deputy Norton and Deputy Keyes in their amendment ask for greater expendition, I wonder do they believe that they could improve on the expedition which these figures indicate?  Out of that total of 60,131 persons, 30,245 were actually heard and examined individually. They were allowed to make their case in whatever fashion they deemed suitable.</P>
    <P>The method by which the applicants were allowed to develop their cases is shown in the White Paper which was circulated amongst Deputies to-day. First of all the applicant had his claim examined.  If it contained <i>prima facie</i> evidence that he was not a person to whom the Act was likely to apply, his case was not shovelled out as it was under the 1924 Act.  The examining officer, having examined the form carefully, inscribed his opinion on it that the applicant was not a person to whom the Act applied.  He then sent it to the Advisory Committee, two members of which examined it individually and expressed their opinions on the matter contained in the form.  If it was still a <i>nil</i> case they said so.  If there was a difference of opinion between them, the other members of the Advisory Committee were brought in, a consultation was held and a decision arrived at.  But even then the case was not ended.  When the Referee made his decision, based, I suppose, on the reports made by these officers, and he decided that this was a <Col N="372" /> man to whom the Act did not apply, he gave notice to his secretary to inform the brigade committee accordingly, and the brigade committee had 28 days in which to bring to his attention whether or not they were satisfied with his decision or whether they wanted the case to be held for further hearing.  In accordance with the brigade committee's opinion, the case was either decided there and then, or it was held for a further period.  If the brigade committee had no further interest in the case, it was not even finished then.  The Referee then issued a notification to his secretary to inform the applicant that he was a person to whom the Act did not apply.  If the applicant decided that he was going to make an appeal against that decision, he could notify the secretary to the Referee that he was dissatisfied with the decision and could make an appeal against it within 21 days.  The case was then deferred for further hearing and the applicant could produce whatever evidence he could secure which he thought likely to convince the Referee and again he had another examination.  Now, when the Labour Party, through the medium of this amendment, talk of finding a more equitable way of dealing with these cases, I must confess that I do not know what they are talking about, any more than I do when they also ask to have the cases dealt with more expeditiously.</P>
    <P>I have given, as well as it is possible to do so, the manner in which these cases have been dealt with both from the point of equity and from the point of expedition.  In the course of the debate, many Deputies who, no doubt, are deeply concerned with the complaints of applicants in their various areas, made appeals to me, to the Taoiseach and to the Government to find ways or means to bring in certain individuals who, in their opinion, were as good as other individuals who had got pensions.  In respect to the various statements made in regard to those cases, I can only say that I am just as deeply concerned about a large number of those men as any Deputy in the House.  I think it will be agreed that <Col N="373" /> Dublin was as active an area as any area in the country.  In Dublin there were men out both night and day looking for ways and means to contact the enemy.  Some may have been lucky in being able to make that contact often; others were unfortunate in that they never made that contact.  It all depended upon the areas in which they were operating.  It may have been a busy area or may have been one of the back streets through which the enemy perhaps but seldom came.  Whatever may be the reason, there are large numbers of men who were members of the Dublin Brigade who, to my own regret, were unable to prove to the Referee that they had the standard of service which would secure for them a service certificate.  I know that there is a very large number of men&mdash;the estimates given in the House ranged from 3,000 to 5,000 men&mdash;throughout the country in a very similar position and still outside the Act.</P>
    <P>I have to make this confession that, for a very long time, I have been trying to find ways and means by which individuals of that type could be brought within the Act, and I must confess that I have failed up to the present to find a method.  The Taoiseach, in an appeal to the House the other evening, asked Deputies on any side of the House to produce a solution if they could do so and said we would have it examined to see if there were any possible way in which it could be used.  I have had many suggestions from Deputies and from people outside the House, and again I must confess that, having given them careful examination, I have come to the conclusion that there is no way in which these people can be brought in unless we amend the section which deals specifically with appeals.  In my opinion, there is no way in which we can bring in a limited number of individuals and leave out a larger number of individuals.  If anyone can find any way, we shall be glad to hear of it, provided it does not ask us to rehear every case.  As far as I can see, that is what any amendment that is likely to be successful will mean; it will mean the admission of practically <Col N="374" /> every applicant who would desire to have his case reheard.</P>
    <P>We are only on the Second Stage of this Bill.  We will be taking the Committee Stage in due course, and if anyone can suggest a solution, I will be very happy to hear of it, as it will affect me just as much as Deputies throughout the country.  I know, and I am sure every Deputy knows, that there are very many excellent Old I.R.A. men outside this Act and outside of it probably because they have not reached the standard required by the Referee and the Advisory Committee.</P>
    <P>Several statements were made in respect to the threat supposed to have been made by me or by someone else as to what would occur if we did not get this Bill through&mdash;that large numbers of Old I.R.A. men would have their payments made invalid.  I do not think I said anything of that kind.  What I did say was that serious doubt existed as to the legality of all pensions under payment, because we did not know the exact cases in which the correct procedure was followed. I further said that we must either suspend payment of pensions or remove that doubt by some such Bill as this.  I do not think anyone can suggest that there was any intimidation in that.  I still believe that the position is that the Supreme Court was asked to give a verdict on a certain aspect of the 1934 Act and that what they actually did was to give a very literal interpretation of the words contained in the Act, without any regard to whether the procedure outlined was practicable or otherwise.</P>
    <P>What they apparently said to themselves was: &ldquo;We have got to examine these words &lsquo;before the Referee&rsquo; and a literal interpretation of &lsquo;before the Referee&rsquo; can only mean one thing, that is, that the case is to be heard before the Referee&rdquo;.  Now, if the men who failed to secure pensions and who did not appear before the Referee were declared to have been not heard within the meaning of the Act&mdash;in other words, that the decision of the Referee in those cases did not hold and was illegal&mdash;surely the cases of <Col N="375" /> the men who did receive pensions were just as illegal, if they appeared only before the members of the Advisory Committee and never reached the Referee?  Surely those cases where the pension was awarded arising out of the examination by the Advisory Committee, were in the same category as those of the individuals who did not receive pensions?  Surely some action was required to ensure that these pensions would not be voidable and this action which we are taking, through the medium of this Bill, is to ensure that, so far as we are concerned anyhow, these pensions will continue and that there will be no possibility whatever of their being voided.  That is one of the objects of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt with most of the questions raised.  Largely the questions raised by various Deputies appeared to me to be almost a complete repetition and I think that, in general, I have more or less answered them.  Deputy Bennett asked me to extend the date; I think the date he was referring to is the 1st February. I cannot do that.  We have fixed a date, which is several days or weeks beyond the time of the Supreme Court's decision, and I think that was fair enough.  Deputy Davin raised the question of the difference between the scales of allowances of those who received pensions under the 1924 Act and those who received pensions under the 1934 Act.  That is easily explained. Under the 1924 Act, pensions were granted on the Army ranks, not on the ranks that men had in the I.R.A.  It is a well-known fact that men who may have been private soldiers in the I.R.A. became captains later on in the Army and that men who may have been captains became commandants, majors, and so on.  That is the explanation of how the scales of allowances under the 1924 Act are, in fact, higher than those under the 1934 Act.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also asked me if, at any time, there was a doubt in my mind as to the procedure carried out.  I must confess that there was not.  The matter was being dealt with by a judge of the Circuit Court.  He was fortified <Col N="376" /> by a regulation, under the Statutory Rules and Regulations, which was made at his request by the Minister and that gave him the power to settle his own procedure.  He settled his own procedure.  Apparently he was satisfied that he was entitled to do that, and two other Circuit Court judges who followed the original judge apparently were satisfied also.  So far as I was concerned, it was never brought to my attention that the matter was causing concern.  As I have mentioned in connection with the Cork bankruptcy case, it was not until some enterprising lawyer saw a great field for his endeavours and for enriching himself that the matter was raised, and we know what the result of raising it was.</P>
    <P>I should have mentioned that Deputy Davin was one of the Deputies who certainly took a very active and continuous interest in the expenditing of the issue of service certificates.  I was looking up the records to-day and I saw that in the year 1941 he was urging me to take any possible steps I could take&mdash;it did not matter what the steps were&mdash;to expedite the ending of these military service pension claims. On that occasion he even went to the extent of saying that it did not matter whether a man got an award or whether he did not get an award; that we should bring the matter to a conclusion so that we could be all satisfied and get away from this continual harassing which was going on arising out of these pensions claims. While we expedited the hearing of the claims so far as was possible, we did that carefully and meticulously.  I am pretty certain that every case which was examined was examined with all the meticulous care necessary in cases so important as they were, and that wherever there have been cases of hardship they are due, in the main, to the fact that the men did not reach the standard required.</P>
    <P>Deputies from all sides of the House, not particularly from this side, made statements to the effect that they knew men who were getting pensions and also men who were not getting pensions and that the individuals who were not getting pensions were just as good as <Col N="377" /> the men who were getting pensions. When we talk about trying to bring these men in we must keep this in mind.  If we take a circle and take the centre as representing those of the highest grade, coming out to the edge we will find the lower grades.  We will find that close up to the edge of that circle there is a number of people in contact with people who are just outside it.  I suggest to Deputies who have been raising this matter that these are the type of people whom they have in mind when they say that men got pensions who are no better than men who did not; that the dividing line is so thin that the people inside are very little better, but that they have made that grade which the Referee required in order to bring them in and that the people who are barely outside are the people who failed to make the grade.  The solution then is to extend the circle a little.  If we extend the circle, say, an inch, there will then be pressing against the inside of the line probably a large number of people, because the radius of the circle has become larger.  There will be a number of people pressing against the outside of the circle, possibly a greater number because of the radius being enlarged.  What we have to ask ourselves is, are we to go on extending the circle until we have embraced practically everyone who made an application?  I do not think that we can.</P>
    <P>That is why I ask for a solution, if it can be found, and that is why I say that up to the present I have failed to find a solution, which I am so keen to find, outside giving a complete rehearing, and I do not know whether the House would be anxious for that, considering the expenses and so on that have already been entailed in the examining of these cases over ten years.  But, outside of the complete rehearing of these cases, I am afraid I cannot see any solution to the difficulties. Deputy Maguire, I think it was, asked me if I was in contact with the committee which was working inside our Party.  I can be in contact with a committee of any Party on any side of the House.  The committee of our Party which has been examining <Col N="378" /> this question has been in contact with me on several occasions.  They, like myself, have been endeavouring to find ways and means.  I should be glad if other Parties took the same interest, if they thought they could help.  Deputy Mulcahy made a suggestion here which, to my mind, would not be a solution.  He suggested that the matter should be handed over to the Defence Conference.  I do not think that this question has anything whatever to do with the Defence Conference or that the Defence Conference has any outstanding qualities that any group of individuals in this House does not possess.  From that point of view, I do not think that we need pursue that suggestion.</P>
    <P>As a matter of interest to the House, the two cases recently decided in the Supreme Court have cost the State, in plaintiffs' costs alone, £1,060 11s. 5d. Two other cases in the High Court have cost £240 4s. 3d.  That is £1,300 approximately.  We have not yet been billed with the costs of the other 70 cases, but it is estimated that they will cost the taxpayer between £3,000 and £4,000.  There are large numbers of other cases and there is a number of lawyers who are jumping in to see if there is anything useful to be got out of this.  We have had demands to the extent of, I think, about 400 and odd cases.  The estimated law costs of these cases, if we were to accept them and allow them to go through the courts, would be over £20,000.  Apart from whatever Deputies may think of this Bill&mdash; and they have thought a lot about it and they have thought a lot that was wrong about it&mdash;I think it is their duty to protect the taxpayers of this country against that sort of attack, because that is, in fact, what it is.  I would strongly ask the House to support this Bill, not alone from the point of view that we are anxious to see that the whole pensions question is brought to an end quickly&mdash;it would be at an end were it not for the introduction of these 74 odd cases&mdash;but also from the point of view of ensuring that this continual and perpetual discussion will cease.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="383" /> That a supplementary sum not exceeding £4,681 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1945, for the Salaries, Allowances and Expenses of Circuit Court Officers, Deputy Circuit Judges and Under Sheriffs; the Travelling Expenses of Circuit Judges; and the Expenses of Revision of Voters and Jurors Lists (No. 27 of 1926, etc.).</P>
    <P>This additional money is required under four main heads.  The first is the increase in cost-of-living bonus from the 1st January last.  It amounts to about £1,000.  The second head relates to the salaries of the staff carrying out the duties of under-sheriffs in counties where the under-sheriff has died or retired during the year 1944.  I think that applies to Dublin City and to County Wicklow.  That accounts for about £1,200.  The third head is the appointment of temporary additional Circuit Court judges to a considerably greater extent than was provided for in the original Estimate.  The additional cost is about £1,700.  The original Estimate was about £600.  The fourth head is a fall of about £1,000 in receipts for executing court orders and Land Commission warrants.  These four headings amount to about £5,000. There is a net saving of about £300, so that the deficiency to be provided for in this Estimate is £4,681.</P>

      <P>The provision in this Supplementary Estimate deals with the staff.  The position in regard to the county registrar himself has not yet been settled, and I am not able to tell the Deputy what it is.  This money is for the payment of extra staff to do the work.</P>

      <P>In connection with certain Circuit Court staffs, I would like to know from the Minister whether they have been established.  A number of them throughout the country, although they have had many years' service, are still on a kind of temporary basis.  I would like to know if anything can be done to let those people know what their position is.  I think it is very unfair that they should not be dealt with.  As regards county registrars, it would appear to be the practice now to make them general pooh-bahs, to have all kinds of extra duties shoved on to them.  Under the present system they have become sheriffs, probate officers and examiners, and, as far as I know, they receive no extra remuneration for all this work. Their positions are very responsible. I put it to the Minister that this is a matter he should consider and say whether it will be dealt with in the new Courts of Justice Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another matter on which I would like to get some information from the Minister.  I understood from him that portion of this additional Estimate is required to <Col N="385" /> meet the expenses of temporary circuit judges.  Has the Minister any idea when the policy of appointing permanent-temporary circuit judges is going to cease?  I think he will probably agree that it is not appropriate that there should be temporary judges appointed for very long periods unless there is some very pressing necessity for it.  If there is any great necessity for it, then there ought to be a very good case for appointing permanent judges.  It must be obvious that the position of temporary circuit judges is on the border-line of being unconstitutional. It is very bad from the point of view of public confidence that a man should be in the position of a judge, and at the same time be on such a tenure that his services can be dispensed with at practically a moment's notice.  This question of temporary judges is one that I shall have something to say on when the Estimate for the Minister's Department comes before the Dáil later.  At the moment, I am anxious to know from him if he has any information as to when it will be possible to bring to some finality the policy of appointing these permanent-temporary circuit judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say whether the appointment of temporary judges will, to any extent, relieve the congestion which is apparent in the Circuit Courts, particularly in Dublin? I understand that a number of men have been returned for trial, some as far back as two years ago.  I think that it is most undesirable and, indeed, contrary to the spirit of the law that a man returned for trial should be kept awaiting his trial so long.  Justice should be speeded up. Apart from that aspect of the matter, I understand that in certain cases the failure to try certain individuals is making the work of the police in Dublin more difficult.  I also understand that there is a certain amount of congestion in the Circuit Courts in the West, particularly in County Mayo.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate whether the steps he is taking now will relieve the congestion in the Circuit Courts in the West as well as in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="386" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of what Deputy Coogan has said, I would like to emphasise the fact that there is a number of people at the moment who have been awaiting trial for at least two years. I myself am engaged in a case in which a man has been awaiting trial for two years.  I suggest to the Minister that he ought to consult with the Attorney-General, and that in any case where a person has been awaiting trial for two years the appropriate thing to do would be to enter a <i>nolle prosequi.</i>  If a man has been in suspense for two years, no matter what offence he has committed, I think he has been sufficiently punished.  If the arrears in the courts are so great that a man cannot be tried within a period of 12 months, I think that a <i>nolle prosequi</i> should be entered.  If that were done, it would possibly help more to clear off the arrears in Dublin than this system of appointing temporary judges, which is all wrong and contrary to justice, or very nearly contrary to justice.  It is, as I have said, certainly on the border-line of being unconstitutional.  I think that if the Minister and the Attorney-General were to say that the best way to clear off these arrears was that any person awaiting trial on a criminal charge should be given the benefit of having a <i>nolle prosequi</i> entered in his case, it would, I think, be the best way of clearing off the arrears, and not merely that, but the best way of keeping down the commission of crime in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question raised by Deputy Costello, I agree that it is undesirable to have temporary judges. I hope that the volume of crime that has now to be dealt with will decrease. The Deputy is aware that we have not the power to appoint permanently another Circuit Court judge.  It would require a Bill to do that.  We have the maximum number of permanent Circuit Court judges allowed by law. I am sure Deputy Costello will agree that one of the reasons for the arrears is the big increase in the number of appeals to be heard.  The courts have now to deal with a far greater number of appeals than they had <Col N="387" /> hitherto.  The position is that the hearing of some of these appeals takes a very long time.  Some of them have taken as long as ten days.  It is because of the large amount of arrears that has arisen in that way, that we have had to appoint temporary judges.  If we had not made these temporary appointments, the arrears would be still greater unless we were to introduce a special Bill to make provision for the appointment of another permanent circuit judge.  I agree that it is most undesirable to have either temporary circuit judges or temporary district justices.  Before an extra permanent judge could be appointed, I would have to persuade the Minister for Finance that the appointment was necessary.  I would probably be told that these were abnormal times, and that when the war was over we would get back to normal.  In that hope, we have continued to make only temporary appointments.</P>
      <P>Regarding the position in Mayo, I have heard some complaints and am inquiring into the matter, to find out the reason for the complaints.  I can say no more on that at the moment.</P>
      <P>With regard to the officers of the Circuit Courts, there were proposals to deal with them, but the discussion has not been finished yet.  There is a question between the two Departments which has not been fixed up yet, so I cannot make any statement as to what the position is.  I think that, while the emergency is on, it will not be easy to do so, but I have the matter under consideration.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £136,310 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1945, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (45 &amp; 46 Vict., c. 74; 8 Edw. <Col N="388" /> 7, c. 48; 1 &amp; 2 Geo. 5, c. 26; the Telegraph Acts, 1863 to 1928; No. 14 of 1940 (Secs. 30 and 31); No. 14 of 1942 (Sec. 23); etc.), and of certain other Services administered by that Office.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs already approved by the Dáil for the financial year ending 31st March, 1945, amounted to £2,928,345.  Due to causes which could not have been anticipated, this provision will be insufficient and an additional sum of£136,310 will be required to cover essential expenditure up to the end of the financial year.  The actual excess over the approved Estimate amounts to £159,980, but there are offsets of £22,794, representing increased Appropriations-in-Aid, and of £876, a saving in respect of conveyance of mails by air, leaving the net excess at £136,310.</P>
    <P>Increased cost-of-living and emergency bonus under sub-heads A (2), A (3), 1 (1), N (1) and O (1), payable as from 1st January, 1945, accounts for £55,855 of the additional sum required. The causes of the other increases are broadly as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Sub-heads A (2) and A (3): £29,580. This represents the cost of additional staff to meet general expansion of business arising from emergency conditions, including revision of sub-postmasters' remuneration for increased work, etc.; unanticipated expenses of general election and distribution of ration books.</P>
    <P>Sub-heads E (1) and E (2): £9,530. The extra money is required to meet the cost of increased parcel traffic by rail, increased cost of conveyance of mails by road and the cost of special journeys to railway stations owing to the irregular running of trains.</P>
    <P>Sub-head G (2): £9,000.  The additional provision needed is due to credit from other Government Departments for goods supplied being less than anticipated in the financial year owing to difficulty in obtaining raw materials and consequent delay in placing contracts.</P>
    <P>Sub-head I (1): £9,045.  This is due to the curtailment of telephone construction work, the cost of which falls on telephone capital, in favour of <Col N="389" /> maintenance and renewal works, which are provided for under the Vote.  The restriction of construction work has been rendered necessary by the scarcity of engineering materials.</P>
    <P>Sub-head N (1): £15,950.  This is due to higher cost-of-living bonus and to an unanticipated increase in the number of retirements.</P>
    <P>Sub-heads O (1), O (4) and O (6): £14,020.  The increased provision is to meet growth of savings bank business, cost of a savings publicity campaign and unanticipated losses due to savings bank defalcations, etc.</P>
    <P>Sub-head Q (2): £17,000.  This is due to provision for payment in the United States of outstanding accounts for radio equipment supplied for the civil aviation and meteorological wireless services.</P>
    <P>As stated at the outset, the Appropriations-in-Aid are expected to be £22,794 greater than anticipated, which is attributable mainly to increased receipts from savings bank funds.  I might add that, perhaps, we might do as we did on the last occasion when a Supplementary Estimate was introduced&mdash;we might postpone anything in the nature of serious criticism of the Department until the main Estimate is introduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is asking for a rather large amount of money, the major portion of which seems to be made up of bonus increases given to the staff during the year.  A good deal of the Estimate, however, is due to under-estimation.  According to my calculations, about £55,000 of the amount asked for now is due to that. It is really incomprehensible that there should be such under-estimation in respect of the items mentioned by the Minister.  For instance, the explanation of the under-estimation of £7,000 in respect of conveyance of mails by rail, is that it was due to the irregular running of trains.  According <Col N="390" /> to my knowledge, at all events, the trains ran more regularly during this financial year than in the previous financial year and I have no recollection that the Minister brought in any Estimate at the end of the last financial year for the purpose of making good any under-estimation in respect of this particular item.</P>
      <P>Then there is an under-estimation of about £2,500 odd in respect of the conveyance of mails by road.  Presumably this expenditure was, according to the footnote, incurred mainly in Dublin, on account of the increased cost, presumably owing to the fact that the Minister had to get the mails conveyed by horse and van rather than by motor.  Under the sub-heads A (2) and A (3), especially under sub-head A (3), the additional sum required is £57,765. The Minister explained that the major portion of this is required to meet the emergency bonus, owing to the increase in sub-postmasters' salaries, increases to staff, etc.; but the Minister has not given any reason for the increase in staff.  Why was that increase necessary; are there any special reasons why the staff should be increased during this financial year, and what was the extra work that entailed that increase?</P>
      <P>Item Q (2)&mdash;Provision and installation of equipment and operating and maintenance charges, rent, etc., £17,000&mdash;seems to be due to provision for payment to the United States of outstanding accounts.  Well, if the accounts were outstanding, as I assume they were, when the Estimates were being prepared, I cannot understand why provision was not made for them in the Book of Estimates.  Judging by the phrasing of this particular sub-head, it would appear that these amounts have been outstanding for a considerable time and that no provision apparently was made for this item in any Estimate so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned somewhere that there was a saving on account of the curtailment of telephone construction work.  I do not intend to enter into a general discussion on this Supplementary Estimate, but I should like to know from the Minister if there is <Col N="391" /> any hope that the position with regard to telephone work will improve in the near future.  Is there any hope that the Minister will be able to obtain equipment which will enable him to instal telephones which are badly needed by many people, not alone in the City of Dublin, but in many parts of the country as well?  I had a letter recently from a lady who transferred her residence recently from Sligo to Dublin.  She always had a telephone when she was residing in Sligo.  On taking up residence in Dublin, she applied for a telephone, but her application was refused on the ground that it was impossible to obtain equipment, although she states in her letter to me that her next door neighbour got a telephone installed the week before.  This is a subject of somewhat general interest and I should like the Minister to make a brief statement on the position with regard to telephone installations.  Is the position likely to remain as it is until the war is over, or is there any hope of obtaining any equipment before hostilities cease?</P>
    <P>There is one item&mdash;sub-head G (1) &mdash;Uniform Clothing&mdash;which I do not quite understand.  £9,000 additional is required, owing to credits from other Government Departments being less than anticipated owing to difficulty in obtaining raw material and consequent delay in placing contracts. Owing to the vague manner in which the item is described in the sub-head, I am not clear as to the actual meaning of it.  I thought at first that the £9,000 was an Appropriation-in-Aid, but actually it is an increased item of expenditure due, apparently, to savings in the amount of clothing required by these Government Departments on account of the Minister's difficulty in obtaining material.  Perhaps the Minister will elaborate and explain the matter more clearly when replying to the points raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister asked us to keep serious criticism of his Department over until a later date.  We are anxious to facilitate the Minister in that respect and I suppose we need not raise more fundamental matters now. <Col N="392" /> But there are a couple of matters to which I should like to advert.  I notice under sub-head A (3), where an additional sum of £57,000 odd is required, that that is due to certain causes, one of which is the distribution of ration books.  I have not got the main Book of Estimates before me, but I assume that the explanation given for the increased expenditure indicates that no credit is being taken by the Department in the form of Appropriations-in-Aid for that work, nor does the Minister appear to anticipate any Appropriations-in-Aid in the catalogue of appropriations set out under sub-head T.  I should like to ascertain from the Minister, supposing the Department undertakes the delivery of ration books for the Department of Supplies, is it the position that they get an Appropriation-in-Aid from the Department of Supplies, or is the work undertaken as part of the ordinary delivery service of the Post Office?</P>
      <P>Another item to which I should like to advert is sub-head N (1).  Here I want to endeavour to enlist the Minister's sympathy for a class of persons who I do not think are covered by this.  The Minister is making provision for the payment of certain superannuation allowances and other non-effective charges.  I should like to call the attention of the Minister to the fact that he has in the Post Office service a considerable number of persons who are unestablished officers; some of them may be full-time, and some of them may be part-time officers.  There is a large number of officials described as auxiliary postmen.  Many of these rendered service of up to 40 or 50 years and, at the end of that time, after toiling for the State, these persons are finally compelled to retire on reaching the age of 70 years.  At the age of 70, they may make application for an old age pension and probably get a pension. But, if such a person has a son at home who is in regular employment and bringing in £2 or £3 a week, that person gets no grant whatever in the form of a pension or gratuity from the Post Office Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he knows of any other employer who would keep a person in employment for 50 years and, at the end of that 50 <Col N="393" /> years, send that person out without as much as a penny gratuity.  I concede that a person can get a gratuity, a miserably small one, if he can show that he is in necessitous circumstances. Up to comparatively recently, the mere receipt of national health insurance benefit or an old age pension deprived that person of even getting that small gratuity.  By dint of constant effort we succeeded in having that odious type of means test withdrawn.  But the fact remains that cases come to light every day where, after a person has served the State for 40 or 50 years, he retires and has a daughter sending money from England, for instance, or a son in the Army, or working as a turf worker or a ploughman at home, and the mere fact that that son or daughter is helping to maintain the home is used by the Post Office Department as a reason for not giving that man as much as one penny in the form of a pension or gratuity after a service of 40 or 50 years.  I put it to the Minister that he could not possibly justify treatment of that kind.  It makes very strange reading when compared with Article 45 of the Constitution in any case.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that in the last analysis he is morally responsible for the conditions of these people; he is their employer.  The Minister cannot say: &ldquo;It is somebody else's job in the Department of Finance.  I am sympathetic to those people but the Department of Finance will not soften its heart and provide any money for them.&rdquo;  I ask the Minister to get down seriously to the question of making some effort to provide these people with a pension or gratuity on retirement.  After all, very few employers would see an employee going out of their service after 50 years without as much as a halfpenny compensation.  Many firms in the city, who have not the resources of the Post Office, treat their employees much better in that respect than the Post Office treat theirs.  I put it to the Minister that he ought to remove this very serious blot on the whole Post Office administration, of casting auxiliary postmen out of the service after 40 or 50 years without as much as a penny compensation.  The cost of <Col N="394" /> meeting the claim would not be considerable, but it is the minimum measure of justice that the Post Office ought to give to men who serve it for such long periods.  I hope the Minister will find it possible to say that he intends to get down to an examination of this claim with a view to presenting proposals to the Department of Finance to end that evil system of casting people on the scrap heap after such a long period of service.  There are outstanding merits in the claim, and the Minister ought to undertake at least to examine the matter to see what can be done to meet the merits of the claim, which I think are undeniable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to bring to the Minister's attention the case of temporary postmen in rural districts. I am referring to my own district of Enniscorthy.  We have a temporary postman at the low rate of wages of 29/6 a week.  He has to pay 1/4 national health insurance and 4d. contribution to his union.  He has no uniform, although he has been three years in the service.  When he goes to the end of his beat he hands over to a man who receives £2 a week. I would appeal to the Minister to provide uniforms for these temporary postmen who are carrying on the duties of the Post Office in rural areas.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Minister that the post office in Enniscorthy is very congested owing to the fact that children's allowances are being paid through the post office officials.  A certain amount of extra work has been thrown on the officials in the post office in my town.  On Fridays old age pensions are paid and people have to wait a certain time before they are served.  The amount of work has increased very much.  I would ask the Minister to give these matters his consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the unanticipated activities of the Post Office was the payment of children's allowances, which could not have been anticipated in our Estimate.  Another unanticipated expenditure was for radio equipment, because we had not got the accounts, until quite recently, as to <Col N="395" /> how much it was going to cost.  The other matters referred to I will have to leave over until the main Estimate. The difficulty about getting in telephones is, of course, very great indeed, especially where the lines are underground. There is a tremendous shortage of underground cable, and it is almost impossible for us to meet that lack just at the moment.  We are taking very active measures to try to get more equipment in as soon as we can, and we have hopes of getting more equipment, but they are rather slight.</P>
      <P>The credit which appears against clothing is due to the shortage of raw materials.  The result is that we cannot fill the orders and we cannot claim the credits which we have already claimed as part of the ordinary business of the year, so we have to put in a counter account there showing the fact that we cannot claim that credit for the year.</P>
      <P>As to the larger question that Deputy Norton has raised, it is a very big question.  It is a question which really applies not merely to my Department but to other Departments as well. That distinction has always been there between the established and the unestablished men.  If an unestablished postman is full-time and has 15 years' service he gets a gratuity going out. There is no means test.  One would gather from what Deputy Norton said that there was, but there is not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put the thing right.  I know the position too well to say that.  The position in respect of an unestablished full-time officer is that he gets a gratuity provided he has a minimum of 15 years' service.</P>

      <P>Or, if he has not got 15 years' service, if his office is abolished. I know that only too well.  But in the case I am referring to there are 2,600 auxiliary postmen.  There are not 150 unestablished postmen in the entire Post Office service, but there are 2,600 auxiliary postmen, and these are the people to whose claims I am asking the Minister to address himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and as the Minister knows, it is in the main provided by the staff, which is a case of feeding the dog on his own tail.  Will the Minister examine the position of these full-time officers with a view, in any case, to presenting proposals to the Department of Finance in respect to the payment of a gratuity or pension to them?  No other Minister can do it in respect of auxiliary postmen. Will the Minister, who is their employer, do it for them?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £27,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending <Col N="397" /> 31st March, 1945, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain Services administered by that Office.</P>
    <P>Sub-head K (3), the first sub-head, is associated with the Bill that we discussed in the Dáil last week.  When the Estimate was being prepared for the year it was assumed that the requirements of the company for the year would be about £50,000 but the authorised limit for advances was nearly reached, and in fact only a balance of £21,800 remained.  Therefore, the main Estimate had to be prepared providing for an advance of £21,800.  The statutory limit on advances has since been raised, so it is now possible to provide for the company the balance of the amount that it requires for its work during the course of the present year.</P>
    <P>Sub-head K (4) relates to certain exploratory work which the Minerals Development Company was engaged in at Ballard in County Wicklow.  They were exploring a deposit of iron ore. The iron ore was found to be of such a grade that it is of no particular interest at the present time and, consequently, the exploratory work has ceased.  The amount now required represents the balance of the sum required to recoup the company for that work.</P>
    <P>Sub-head K (5) relates to the activities of the Geological Survey.  The normal exploratory work of the Geological Survey has been more or less suspended during the war.  The Survey is in fact engaged only in the exploration of minerals which have immediate commercial possibilities.  It is not possible, therefore, to estimate in advance the amount which the Survey will require for that work during the year, and only a token Vote of £5 was asked for in the main Estimate.</P>
    <P>During the course of the year the Survey has been actively engaged in exploring the phosphate deposits in County Clare.  That has been its main work, because it was known that the deposit there was showing signs of exhaustion and it was desirable to explore fully the possibility of securing other workable deposits.  The <Col N="398" /> amount expended by the Survey on that work on the Clare phosphates represents practically the whole of the amount of the Supplementary Estimate now required.  There was a small sum expended on work in County Wicklow and a smaller sum still upon the investigation of some coal deposits in County Limerick.</P>
    <P>The other Estimate represents a sum that will probably be required to be paid before the end of the year.  As the House is aware, certain mineral rights at Slievardagh in County Tipperary and in the phosphate area of County Clare were compulsorily acquired by the State.  It was not possible to reach agreement with the owners as to the compensation to be paid and consequently the matter went for determination to the Mining Board.  The Mining Board has not yet given its award, but its award is expected within the course of the financial year and, consequently, we are asking the Dáil to vote a sum of £5,000 which we think is ample to cover any award which the Mining Board may make to the dispossessed owners in these areas, and when the Mining Board makes the award we will, of course, have to pay the full amount of the award.</P>

      <P>My recollection is that the Minister, about this time last year, when introducing a Supplementary Estimate, mentioned that the Clare deposits would be exhausted in about 12 months' time.  He has provided a sum here to enable the members of the Geological Survey to carry out further exploratory work for the purpose of finding new deposits.  Can the Minister indicate if they have succeeded in finding such new deposits and if he finds it necessary now to revise the statement he made 12 months ago about the existing deposits in County Clare?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The position was as I stated this time 12 months.  The known deposits then appeared to be on the point of exhaustion, and consequently the Geological Survey were requested to concentrate on exploratory work in County Clare to ascertain if further deposits could be located.  Further deposits were located, and the <Col N="399" /> phosphate bearing area was shown to be larger than was originally assumed. It was because this time last year we foresaw the exhaustion of the deposits that the Geological Survey were instructed to concentrate its activities on this work during the year.  They were successful in locating new phosphate deposits.  These deposits are, however, of a kind that can be worked only by mining, but that is not the concern of the Geological Survey.</P>

    <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £11,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1945, for Pensions, <Col N="401" /> Superannuation, Compensation and Additional and other Allowances and Gratuities under sundry Statutes (4 and 5 Will. 4, c. 24; 22 Vict., c. 26; 50 and 51 Vict., c. 67; 55 and 56 Vict., c. 40; 6 Edw. 7, c. 58; 9 Edw. 7, c. 10; 4 and 5 Geo. 5, c. 86; 9 and 10 Geo. 5, c. 67 and c. 68; 10 and 11 Geo. 5, c. 36; No. 1 of 1922; No. 34 of 1923; No. 7 of 1925; No. 27 of 1926; No. 11 and No. 36 of 1929; No. 32 of 1933; No. 9 of 1934; No. 39 of 1936; No. 29 of 1938; No. 16 and No. 21 of 1939; No. 24 of 1942; etc.); ExtraStatutory Pensions, Allowances, and Gratuities awarded by the Minister for Finance; fees to Medical Referees and occasional fees to Doctors, etc.</P>
    <P>The need for the increased provision of £11,000 required in connection with this Vote is attributable to two recent Government decisions: (1) that the cost-of-living bonus payable to serving officers should be related as from the 1st January, 1945, to a figure of 110 instead of the figure of 85 hitherto obtaining; (2) that the bonus element of all pensions awarded since the stabilisation of the bonus in June, 1940, should, with effect from the 1st January, 1945, be related to the figure 110 or such lower figure (105 actually) as would in the ordinary course have applied, had there been no stabilisation.</P>
    <P>Decision No. 1 has the effect of immediately increasing requirements in respect of pensions and lump sums payable to or in respect of all officers retiring on or after the 1st January last.  Decision No. 2 increases, with effect from the same date, pensions actually in course of payment prior to that date.  This decision does not affect lump sum or gratuity payments.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that these bonus concessions will involve increased expenditure during the current financial year amounting to £3,000 in sub-head A, annual allowances, that is, pensions, and £10,000 in sub-head B, additional allowances, that is, lump sums and gratuities.  A saving of £2,000 is anticipated on other sub-heads of the Vote, leaving £11,000 as the net amount <Col N="402" /> required to meet the further demands in respect of sub-heads A and B up to the 31st March, 1945.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a further appeal to the Minister in respect of the class of persons who are being excluded from participation in this Supplementary Estimate.  I think it was in November last the Minister told us it had been decided to calculate the cost-of-living bonus on the basis of an index figure of 110 instead of 85, and he intimated that that bonus increase would be offered as from 1st January, 1945.  He intimated, too, that it was intended to increase the ceiling for the purpose of the emergency bonus from 10/- to 11/- per week.  This Supplementary Estimate flows in as a natural consequence of that decision, inasmuch as the pensions of officers who retired as from 1st January last will be now based on an index figure of 110 instead of 85.</P>
      <P>He explained to the House, towards the end of the year, the reasons which underlay the decision to calculate the bonus on the basis of 110 instead of 85. The Minister stated that the position was that the Government had stabilised civil servants' remuneration from 1st July, 1940, whereas the remuneration of workers in private employment had not been stabilised until May, 1941.  Therefore, stabilisation was effective in respect of the Civil Service for almost a year prior to the operation of stabilisation outside.  After many years of pleading, the Government finally recognised that was an inequitable position and they sought to make partial restitution by increasing the index figure from 85 to 110.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, if the Minister had not so precipitately stabilised the cost-of-living bonus in July, 1940, the staffs would have been entitled to a much higher index figure between 1940 and 1944. Between those years the staff lost. However, when making restitution, the Minister said: &ldquo;Forgive me for my past sins in respect of stabilisation.  I will make things right partially as from <Col N="403" /> 1st January in respect of those who are serving.&rdquo;  But in respect of those who retired between July, 1940, and December, 1944, who are not now in the service, the Minister is not able to make restitution to them as serving officers and so far he has declined to make restitution to them as retired officers.</P>
    <P>What the Minister is really doing as from the 1st of January is, he is saying: &ldquo;Look here, I am going to give you something I know I ought not to have deprived you of years ago.&rdquo;  So far as it goes that is all right in respect of those who are serving, but the Minister is really taking advantage of the position of those who retired between January, 1940, and December, 1944, because he is giving them nothing whatever in the form of an increased pension in respect of the money which he now admits he rather hastily deducted from them when he stabilised the bonus in 1940.</P>
    <P>I addressed a question to the Minister recently as to how many persons retired between July, 1940, and December, 1944.  The Minister had not got the information for 1940 and the figures had not been compiled in respect of 1944 up to the date of the question, but the information I got showed that, in respect of 1941, 1942 and 1943, a period of three years, less than 500 established officers had retired, indicating that the probable rate of retirement was about 160 per year.  That is not a very large number to be concerned with in a matter of this kind, and as many of these persons retired on reaching the age limit, it is a wasting liability so far as expenditure from State funds is concerned.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that he ought not at this stage to take advantage of the fact that these officers did retire. The cost of adjusting their pensions on the assumption that they had remained in the service from 1940 to 1944 would not be very considerable, and the Minister would then be giving back to persons the amount which, by the alteration of the bonus figure as from 1st January this year, he really has tacitly admitted properly belonged to them while serving.  If they had got it while <Col N="404" /> serving, their pensions would have been calculated on that higher scale of remuneration.  The cost of meeting the claim would not be very considerable, nor is the duration of the liability likely to be very considerable, because the persons concerned retired, either on the ground of being in very bad health or on reaching the age of 65 years.</P>
    <P>If the Minister would agree to concede that claim, he would adjust a matter which is a source of very considerable grievance to persons who feel that the restoration having been made and they having been affected by the earlier stabilisation, they ought not now to be deprived of having that restitution made operative in their cases.  It is a special type of case and a matter for sympathetic examination. The Minister can calculate the cost and knows it cannot be considerable, and I should be glad if he would look into the matter specially.  If he is not in a position to say that he will meet the claim now, I hope he will find it possible to examine the matter sympathetically, with a view to endeavouring to meet it.  I do not think it is beyond the resources of the State, having regard to the relatively infinitesimal expense involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add a few words on similar lines.  I think the Minister appreciates, in view of the increase which he has seen fit to grant, that those people whom Deputy Norton mentions have laboured under a very serious disability since the emergency, or since the cost of living increased so rapidly, which is almost the same thing.  I have in mind particular cases like former postmen who retired and are in receipt of pensions of something less than £1 per week.  These people are in the unfortunate position that they have too much to allow them to receive other benefit and too little to live on.  A number of them in that class possibly live on a slightly higher standard than, say, people who get home assistance or other relief from local authorities, and they find themselves in the position that they have to sell or pawn their furniture or leave the houses in which they are living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pension originally was barely <Col N="405" /> sufficient to provide the mere necessaries of life, but that pension which, before 1939, bought enough, is now entirely inadequate and these people fall between two stools. As Deputy Norton has said, it would not involve a very considerable sum, because the number of State pensioners in this category is not very large, and the duration of the pension is likely to be short.  I ask the Minister particularly to investigate the number of people in the class, and, if possible, to increase the allowances paid to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not pretend to turn a deaf ear to appeals of the kind made by the two Deputies who have spoken, or to say that I do not feel that, even in addition to the good things which have been said, there is not a good deal which could be put forward in favour of the pensioners particularly referred to, but the same arguments could be used regarding the position of all pensioners as they find themselves now, whatever kind of pension they are drawing from the State, directly or indirectly&mdash;whether in the form of old age pension, superannuation allowances, or any other.</P>
      <P>My difficulty is that I cannot select one body of pensioners, even one small body, and give them treatment which I am not prepared to ask the Government to give to other classes of pensioners. If I thought our financial situation was such that we could be a little more generous to pensioners of all types&mdash;old age, Gárda, Civil Service, national teachers, postmen to whom Deputy Cosgrave referred, and others&mdash;I certainly would ask the Government to do so, but I do not think I would be just in selecting a small body of pensioners and treating them advantageously, or disadvantageously, if we compare them with the position in which the vast bulk of those drawing pensions would be placed if I were guilty of such action.</P>

    <P>I agree, as I have said before, that when I am paying extra allowances, paying on a higher cost-of-living figure &mdash;110 instead of 85&mdash;to the serving civil servants and bringing the pensions of those who have gone out of the service <Col N="406" /> since July 1st, 1940, into line with that decision with regard to the increased cost-of-living bonus, I admit that I am doing something for the Civil Service and for the pensioners of that short period which has not been done for everybody, but I think Deputy Norton knows well, and the House understands fully, the reasons for doing that for the Civil Service particularly.</P>
    <P>Civil servants were placed in a very disadvantageous position compared with other classes of the community, and the furthest I could ask the Government, or maybe get the Government to go, was to bring civil servants into line, so far as their remuneration and the cost-of-living figure associated with it was concerned, with what was being done for people in private employment. I do not think I could face the extra cost.  I have not been without examining it.  I have examined it both with regard to the limited class Deputy Norton referred to and to others.  I can truthfully say that the figure would not be very large, but it would make an exception and, if I made that exception, there would be reason for somebody else coming along and getting the circle further expanded.  Any Deputy then would have a good argument in saying: &ldquo;You ought to go a little further,&rdquo; and I know what the end would be from the financial point of view.  I do not think I could do it.</P>

      <P>May I put this to the Minister?  I think he will appreciate that in the case of an officer who retired in September of last year&mdash;the case of a postman, for instance, who retired in September last&mdash;he will have his pension based on an index figure of 85, whereas if he had not retired until January of this year it would be based on a figure of 110.  The application of the figure of 110 is for the purpose of giving back to people something that ought not to have been taken from them, something that is now being given to them.  Why not, therefore, give it to the one who retired in September, seeing the very great disparity there would be in his pension over a mere three months? Could the Minister not meet the case of persons who retire on a small pension?</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £798 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1945, to repay to the Contingency Fund certain Miscellaneous Advances.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, this Vote is taken towards the end of the financial year to recoup to the Contingency Fund moneys issued from it since it was last replenished, other than advances for services covered by and repayable out of other Votes and/or the Central Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Contingency Fund is to defray urgent or unforeseen expenditure which is not covered by ordinary Votes and for which it may be impracticable to seek the immediate approval of the Dáil.  No final payment is charged against the Fund, and it is restored to its original figure each year either by means of the Repayments to the Contingency Fund Vote or by repayment from the Central Fund or the ordinary service Votes of advances made.  An account of the Fund showing the advances made, repayments effected and advances outstanding is published with the annual <Col N="408" /> Appropriation Accounts.  The items of expenditure&mdash;four in all&mdash;which necessitate this year's Vote are shown in Part III of the Estimate.</P>
    <P>Item (1)&mdash;Stamp Duty remitted on deeds and other instruments for Public Departments (£580 15s. 0d.).&mdash;This is a regular feature of the Vote.  The Revenue Commissioners, following long established practice, stamp deeds and other instruments for public departments without insisting on payment of duty, but as there is no power to remit the duty&mdash;which is imposed by statute&mdash;the amount has to be made good to the revenue and it is more convenient to utilise the Contingency Fund than to make separate provision in Departmental Votes.  Most of the instruments for stamping are presented by the Department of Education and the Department of Lands.</P>
    <P>Item (2)&mdash;Removal of remains of student&mdash;the holder of a scholarship awarded by the Minister for Education &mdash;who died during the college term (£25).&mdash;A student holding a FíorGhaeltacht Scholarship, awarded by the Minister for Education, at Rockwell College, Cashel, died in the Fever Hospital, Clonmel, while attending the college.  The President of Rockwell College arranged for the removal of the remains to the student's home at Dingle, County Kerry, for burial and the vouched cost was recouped to him. I understand that the family were poor and would not be able to meet that expenditure.</P>
    <P>Item (3)&mdash;Recoupment to Dundalk Urban District Council of cost of Fire Brigade services rendered in Belfast following Air Raids (£177 0s. 8d.).&mdash; The payment to this local authority represents the expenses incurred by the council in sending its fire brigade to Belfast following the air raids on that city in April and May, 1941.  In view of the special circumstances, it was decided that the expenditure should be borne by the State and, as it was not appropriate to any existing Vote, it was defrayed from the Contingency Fund.  Expenses incurred by Dublin Corporation (£355 8s. 2d.), Drogheda Corporation (£56 4s. 0d.), and Dun Laoghaire Corporation (£85 6s. 1d.) on <Col N="409" /> the same occasions were similarly met out of the Contingency Fund and the amounts were recouped to the Fund by the Votes for 1941-42 and 1942-43.</P>
    <P>Item (4)&mdash;Triplets Bounty (£15).&mdash; This, like the stamp duty remissions, is a regular feature of this Vote.  It represents five payments of £3 each.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the purpose of the amendment is to direct the Minister's attention to the rather unreasonable provision which makes a man responsible for something found not in his own land but on land even in the vicinity of his own land.  There might conceivably be a commonage, or a commons as it is called in the country, adjoining a farmer's place, and it is considered unjust and unreasonable that the owner of adjoining land should be held responsible for something found on that commonage and which according to this Bill would be found within the vicinity of his land <Col N="410" /> or premises.  The provision is too wide and conceivably an injustice might arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>This might seem a very wide provision and to some people who are not accustomed to this type of legislation it might appear that it gives powers that should not be in the hands of officers of custom and excise, but without it the scheme of the Bill would not be workable.  It is similar to powers that are in the Acts which are the foundations of the customs code.</P>
      <P>This provision is necessary to enable a customs officer to deal with the many cases in which smugglers have dumps on premises or lands near the frontier. It is not an uncommon thing for customs officials to find dumps when smuggling goes on and so it is necessary to have this power.  If they have not that power smugglers would, in many instances, be able to get away with the goods and get them across out of the dumps when customs officials might not be there in as great numbers as they normally are.</P>
      <P>We want that power so that we can get after people who smuggle or attempt to smuggle and who might be using land, perhaps not their own land, or buildings as a place to hide smuggled goods.  It might be that the person whose land was used knew nothing about what was being done on his land, or it might be that the persons who were using the land for dumping the goods were in connivance with the owners.  If we had not these provisions in the law, our hands would be tied in very many cases.  It has been proved over and over again that it is absolutely essential to us to have this power, if we are to prevent the smuggling that still goes on and that, even if this Bill is passed, will still be attempted in Border counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will appreciate, in the case of an innocent owner who has nothing to do with the smuggling that goes on across the land frontier, that such a man is being put in an impossible position, in being asked to render an account to the revenue officials in circumstances of <Col N="411" /> that kind?  He probably has no knowledge, direct or indirect, as to what is going on.</P>

He has to suffer the hardship of costs in defending the case, in which he is afterwards found to be innocent, but there is no means by which he can get costs from the State; even though he succeeds in his case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, if one looked up the history of the number of cases where any evidence could be shown to go near proving that innocent persons had been made suffer, the number would be found to be very small, if any.  I would be glad if the Deputy would let me have particulars of any cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is easy enough. Take the poteen prosecutions, which are revenue cases somewhat similar to smuggling.  An innocent person's land may be utilised by lawless persons and the owner is automatically charged with the offence and nearly always prosecuted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>That has happened nearly always where things like that are found on the premises or on lands away from where the owner resides. Though he had no knowledge of them, he was brought to court, where it was proved to the satisfaction of the justice that he had no knowledge whatever of them; but he was still put to the cost of defending and he could get no redress for the costs he incurred.  I want that to be avoided.</P>

Judging by the number of appeals we get from the Deputy to consider the cases of persons who have got into difficulties, we know that he knows a good deal about what goes on.

The revenue authorities had none of these powers to cope with it, yet they managed to stamp it out in due time. I think I would prefer to see a smuggler getting away, rather than that an innocent person should be put in an impossible position.  I quite appreciate the difficulty in coping with smugglers, whose work is largely done in the dark, but an innocent person may conceivably find himself charged with an offence, as this section is framed, if he even fails to give information which he may not have.  I would certainly agree to &ldquo;refuses&rdquo;, but &ldquo;fails&rdquo; would put him in an impossible position.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 9 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) Where proceedings for an offence under the Customs Acts are dismissed, whether on the merits or without prejudice, by the District Court, the complainant may appeal against the order of dismissal to the judge of the Circuit Court within whose circuit the courthouse in which such order was made is situate.</P>
      <P>(2) The decision of a judge of the Circuit Court on an appeal under this section shall be final and conclusive and shall not be appealable.</P>
      <P>Section 84 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, provides that an appeal shall lie in all cases, other than criminal, from any decisions of a justice of the District Court, while Section 18 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1928, provides generally that in criminal cases an appeal shall lie only by the person against whom the order of court shall have been made.  In the case of O Croinin v. Brennan (1939) I.R. 274, the High Court held, in a case taken under Section 186 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, for knowingly keeping and harbouring uncustomed goods, that the proceedings were civil in nature.  This case was concerned with an offence arising out of attempted evasion of duty, and accordingly the right of appeal from a dismiss by the District Court in cases of the kind has, so far, been regarded as secure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new position has arisen in consequence of a judgment given in the Supreme Court on 21st December last which is of importance as affecting the powers of the State in regard to appeals in the case of customs prosecutions which have been dismissed by a District Court (the State (Francis Gettins) v. Circuit Court judge&mdash;North-Western Circuit).  The case in question arose out of an alleged breach of an export prohibition imposed by Emergency Powers Order, and the <Col N="415" /> Supreme Court has in effect decided that all offences which are ultimately grounded on the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, are in their nature criminal and that, accordingly, there is no right of appeal in such cases.</P>
    <P>The position is, accordingly, that while the State possesses the right of appeal in cases arising out of evasion or attempted evasion of duty, and possibly in cases of import and export prohibitions other than those imposed as the result of emergency legislation, it has no such right in the type of case which is at present of vital interest to the community, i.e., breach of emergency prohibitions.  It is considered essential for the due enforcement of these prohibitions that such a right should be obtained, and, irrespective of whether or not the other clauses of this Bill pass into law, it is desirable to establish beyond doubt that such a right appertains to the State in all cases of prosecutions under the Customs Acts.</P>

      <P>The Supreme Court has said that, in the matter of export prohibition, which is based upon an Emergency Powers Order, the proceedings are criminal; but it is not at all clear that they have overruled the decision in O Croinin v.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The accused is in this position under the amendment, that if he succeeds in getting a dismiss even without prejudice, no hearing having taken place, the State can appeal to the Circuit Court, and before judgment is given by the Circuit Court, the State may again, on a point of law, bring him to the Supreme Court.  I think it is a rather drastic invasion of the old procedure, and that to that extent it takes away a certain amount of rights which the citizen heretofore had in matters of this kind.  You are loading the dice against him.  The State can afford to go from court to court regardless of expense, but the average citizen is not in that position.  You are not on terms of equality.</P>

      <P>I hold it is unfair. Again, it is to a certain extent retroactive in its effect.  You are getting away from the old procedure because of the decision in the Gettins case.  I think it is very unreasonable considering the powers you already have under the Bill.  You already have the power to make a suspect account for himself, the power of search, and the power to do all necessary things to make him amenable to justice.  Having all these powers, you come along and deny him what was heretofore his right, that if he got a dismiss from the lower court, that was the end of the matter.  You can now take him to the Circuit Court and to the Supreme Court, if necessary. I think you are loading the procedure against the accused.  I do not think it is unconstitutional, but I do say it is very drastic in its effect, having regard to that aspect of the matter.</P>

      <P>Because they were civil proceedings.  You are now assuming that after this Bill is passed these proceedings will be criminal proceedings. I do not know if that is the intention of the commissioners or whether or not they prefer that the proceedings should be criminal proceedings.  Having given them criminal proceedings, immediately you proceed to deprive the citizen of the right which he has in all legal proceedings, namely, if he gets a dismiss in a lower court, that is an end of the matter.</P>

      <P>I believe that the State and the individual should have equal right of appeal, but I should like the Minister to give the House his observations on sub-section (2) of the proposed new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The decision of a judge of the Circuit Court on an appeal under this section shall be final and conclusive and shall not be appealable.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, the State claim the right, if they lose their case in the District Court, to appeal to the Circuit Court.  If the State win their case in the Circuit Court, the citizen has no right to go to a higher court.  The matter finishes there.  I think there is something inconsistent in that.  If the State claim the right to appeal in one instance, they cannot very well deny to the ordinary citizen the right to appeal to a still higher court.  Under <Col N="419" /> sub-section (2) there shall be no appeal from the Circuit Court although the State claim the right to appeal from the District Court to the Circuit Court.</P>

      <P>A person charged may get a dismiss or informations may be refused.  The case is dismissed on the merits and without prejudice.  The proceedings have cost him a considerable amount of money and a considerable amount of mental worry.  The State, with all its machinery, with all its powers, is getting now, for the first time, a right to appeal against that dismiss.  Deputy Coogan has very properly put it that the cases are not equal.  The resources of the individual cannot be compared with the resources of the State.  Where the State can lightly and light-heartedly appeal, the citizen cannot.  I feel that the scales are being loaded against the citizen. There is a fundamental right in law at the moment, in criminal cases, that a person cannot be tried twice on the same facts, or cannot be put on his hazard.  That is what you are going to do in this particular case.  A court of jurisdiction has tried the case and has dismissed&mdash;and you will not get any judge to dismiss lightly.  The State then, on the same facts, proceeds to charge the person again, on appeal, and puts the person charged to the trouble, mental and financial, of defending himself against the resources of the State.  The State can lightly and readily employ senior and junior counsel and a first-class State solicitor's office to prosecute the case.  The poor unfortunate citizen will be governed, very probably, by his pocket, and there will certainly be considerable loading against him.  I would ask the Minister, before he presses the amendment, to consider very well the disadvantages as well as the advantages. I maintain that the disadvantages far outweigh the advantages.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Housing of Dublin Workers&mdash;Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that the provision of 20,000 more working-class dwellings for Dublin is a major post-war problem, and that the failure of the Government to announce its decisions with regard to some of the aspects of this question is holding back the plans of other Parties who must necessarily share in the solution of this vexed problem, and accordingly asks the Government to make an immediate pronouncement in the matter&mdash;(Deputy H.M. Dockrell).</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking on the previous occasion, I took exception to the tone and the wording of the motion.  I find that I made a small slip in mentioning the fraction one-half instead of one-quarter, and I should also say that I took the figure of 20,000 in the motion as referring to houses rather than dwellings.  I think Deputy Dockrell used the word &ldquo;houses&rdquo; very frequently.  I proceeded to say that very good progress indeed had been made by this Government in the matter of housing, and I want now to substantiate that statement.  In order to do so, I propose to quote from the report of the Inquiry into the Housing of the Working Classes in the City of Dublin, 1939-1943.  On page 234 of that report, the number of dwellings built yearly by Dublin Corporation from <Col N="423" /> 1922-23 to 1938-39 is given.  The annual total is given for every one of the 17 years.  During the first ten years, the highest number in any single year was 793 dwellings.  In the year 1938-39, under the present Government, 2,336 dwellings were completed.</P>
      <P>I have given the highest figure for the ten years of the preceding Government and the figure for the last normal year under the present Government, and I think everybody will admit that these figures disclose a very great advance indeed.  On analysing these figures, I find that the average for the first ten years of this period is 504.5, and, for the seven years during which the present Government was responsible for the housing of the people, 1,127.8.  When we consider that a building strike took place in 1937, we can discount completely one of these years, and, on that basis, the yearly average of dwellings erected is 1,266.  Another way in which to look at it is that, for the period in question, the total for ten years under the previous Government was 5,045, and, for the seven years of the present Government, 7,909.  It would be futile to deny that very great progress is indicated by these figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give the House a further piece of evidence.  There is here an analysis of the building carried out in 24 cities of this country and Great Britain in 1935-36&mdash;the last year in which it is possible to make a comparison because of the building strike here, which paralysed building for the time being, in 1937, which made the figures for 1937-38 useless for comparison purposes, and because, in 1939, we had the start of the world war.  I am, therefore, taking the last normal year on the basis of which we can make a comparison between cities here and in Britain which will give us an idea of the magnitude of the effort made in this country.  On analysing the figures on page 238 of the report, I find that of the 24 cities with a population of over 200,000, Dublin stands second.  That is a very fine record having regard to the resources of Britain, and in the light of the rateable property of Dublin compared with the other cities cited, <Col N="424" /> it is a stupendous accomplishment to have carried out such a splendid programme and to hold such a high place amongst the cities which have made an effort to house their people.</P>
    <P>On page 239, five cities, comparable in point of population with Dublin, are given, and of these Dublin stands first.  That is very definite and very conclusive proof of wonderful progress in the housing of the people of Dublin under the present Government.  But I can give a further proof.  On page 28, there is given the number of families of four or over living in tenement dwellings in the year 1901, 1911, 1926 and 1936.  In 1901, 12.8 per cent. of our people were housed under these wretched conditions.  In 1911, the percentage dropped to 12, but, by 1926, which was possibly the height of the régime of the late Government, the percentage had again shot up to 13.2. By 1936, it had dropped to 10.6.  These figures are sufficient to prove my contention that very good progress indeed was made by this Government and by the Corporation of Dublin in the housing of our people up to the outbreak of this lamentable world war.  I shall show later on that in spite of the world war, in spite of the shortages and restrictions which we have had to face in the matter of building material and supplies of all sorts, we have kept up a very good rate of progress indeed.</P>
    <P>Now, in this motion, the Government is accused of failure and of standing in the way of the plans of other Parties. With regard to plans, I think the onus of planning the building programme of Dublin or of any other centre should devolve on the local body.  I think the onus should in the first place be on the local body and I think that if that were taken from them and they were simply told what to do and if the matter were planned for them by the central Government, these local bodies would be the first to object.  The local bodies know their local needs and it is right that they should plan at least for their local needs.</P>
    <P>That does not mean that they should bear the burden of carrying out these plans.  It is the duty of the <Col N="425" /> Government to assist and to help, but I repeat, the onus should be on the local bodies.  To my mind the function of the Government should be to examine these plans and to hold an even balance between one local body and another&mdash;between the local bodies throughout the country.  They would restrict the extravagant expenditure of money but, on the other hand, the Government should help to the utmost of the capacity of the State, and having regard to the other needs of the State, in financing local bodies to enable them to carry out their duties.  These, to my mind, are the functions of the Government.</P>
    <P>One would think from listening to Deputy Dockrell that this whole question had been neglected, that he or his Party or the other Parties in the House had plans and if this wicked Government stood aside these plans would be put into execution and the people housed without delay.  I do not think it is an honest motion.  I do not think that motion is really designed in the interest of the people.  The members of the other Parties have heavy representation in the Dublin Corporation, and on other local bodies throughout the country, but we never heard of plans.  It is very strange indeed if there are plans ready and in the hands of other Parties for the housing of the people, that these plans have not been divulged.  I think we might get the benefit of the help of the other Parties if these Parties have plans and if they really think the Government is standing in the way of these plans.</P>
    <P>Now, there have been plans for the housing of the people of Dublin.  I will quote from the Report of the Housing Committee of the Dublin Corporation.  This is Report No. 10, 1944, and it says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In Report No. 6, 1938, duly adopted by the City Council, the City Manager outlined a programme of ten years' building operations, covering a total of about 20,000 dwellings.  This programme was divided into two instalments of five years each.  The schemes included in the first five years' operations are shown on page 35 of that report and <Col N="426" /> embrace some 12,000 dwellings. However, owing to the war it has only been possible, in the six years that have elapsed since the submission of Report No. 6, 1938, to build 8,257 houses out of an estimated 12,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When you consider the restrictions imposed by the present world war I think that it is highly creditable to the Corporation members and to the Corporation officials to have planned and carried through the building of 8,257 houses in the six years alluded to.  It is a great tribute to the Government who made such a thing possible by maintaining peaceful conditions at home, and friendly relations with those countries from which we obtained the necessary material to enable us to build those houses.  I quote again from the Report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Apart from the fact that the war has intervened in the speedy prosecution of the housing programme, as outlined in 1938, it has also necessitated a drastic alteration in the programme arrangement as originally intended.  As a result of a re-examination of the position by the City Engineer and the Housing Architect, a revised post-war programme is now proposed aiming at the erection of 7,500 houses over a period of five years.  If conditions regarding labour and material are favourable, it should, in the opinion of the Housing Architect, be possible to erect an average of 1,500 dwellings in each year, or a total of 7,500 dwellings in five years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I will quote one other short extract:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It will be seen that notwithstanding the abnormal conditions which have prevailed since the submission of the ten years' plan, the Corporation has succeeded in keeping ahead of the increasing demand, and from this it will be evident that if the war emergency had not arisen a very substantial advance would by now have been made in the direction of solving the most urgent housing problem.</P>
    <P>Now, you have there the clearest proof that very good progress has been <Col N="427" /> made, even in spite of the war, in the housing of our people.  I think that it was a wonderful feat to erect 8,257 houses out of the 12,000 that were planned for, when you take into consideration the state of the world as it has been during these terrible years.</P>
    <P>Was the Government idle?  As far back as March, 1939, you will find a letter from the Department of Local Government and Public Health ordering the holding of this Inquiry, which is one of the most important inquiries conducted in this country.  Not only had the corporation and all interested the opportunity of giving evidence, but, in addition, discussions took place with representatives of the Irish Banks' Standing Committee, the General Manager of the Dublin United Transport Co., the Superintendent Relieving Officer of the Dublin Board of Assistance, Dr. W.C. Dwyer, R.M.S., Dublin Union; Mr. T. Fitzpatrick, F.S.S., and Mr. Frank Gibney, architect.  You had there the Dublin Corporation, with all its experience of the housing problem and all its knowledge of Dublin conditions; you had also the opportunity given to anyone who was interested to give public evidence; and you had these various experts consulted, so that the findings of this inquiry are well worthy of consideration.  I have quoted from the report of that Inquiry figures which show that we have made tremendous strides, comparatively speaking, in the housing of our people under the present Government.  More recently, a research committee in the building trade has been set up by the Minister for Industry and Commerce; so I am afraid Deputy Dockrell has not been really conversant with the efforts made by the Corporation and by the Government in the direction of housing the people.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred rather particularly to virgin sites, and I would like to offer an opinion on that aspect of housing.  I would urge as little dislocation of family and neighbourly ties as possible, as I think our people should be housed&mdash;even if it took a little longer time to do it&mdash;as close to their original place of dwelling as possible. When a huge scheme such as the <Col N="428" /> Crumlin scheme is undertaken, terrific problems are created.  Apart altogether from the cost to the ratepayers and taxpayers, there are terrific problems presented to the clergy and to the educational authorities.</P>
    <P>The educational life of the child is disrupted; the schools in and on the fringe of the new area are in a state of chaos for possibly several years. You have overcrowding; you have the fitting in of boys, with very diverse ways of life, from very diverse localities and from very diverse schools.  My experience has been that the education of the child is retarded, as a general rule, by being transplanted to a completely new district.  The cost of erecting schools and churches in these very large schemes is immense and presents a very great problem.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, I think it would be desirable for us to conserve, as far as possible, the character of our various areas in Dublin as they are.  Those of us who know Dublin know that each area has really a character of its own. The people create family ties and neighbourly ties and these ties make life sweeter for these people.  In my own district in Terenure, during the big coal strike we had many years ago, I saw people carrying coal and fuel to each other.  When sudden calamities come upon a family, I have seen the neighbours coming along and rendering help, simply because they knew and understood each other and had these ties of neighbourliness and friendship, and very often of kinship.  I think it is a great thing to keep the people in their own areas as far as possible.</P>
    <P>You have in the old areas very fine churches and schools, and I have seen these very fine schools depleted by the exodus of big numbers of children, while the schools in the new areas are crowded out to a most extraordinary and, I might say, a most damaging degree.  It takes time to erect the necessary schools and churches in these new areas.  So that in the matter of virgin sites I am rather doubtful.  I certainly should not like to see schemes as large as the scheme we had in Crumlin or possibly in the Cabra area.  I think a number of smaller ones would be better and that best of all would be <Col N="429" /> to keep our people in their own localities.</P>
    <P>I hold that there cannot be any quick solution of the housing problem in Dublin.  If this motion gives the idea to the people that a quick solution is possible, I think it is a very wrong thing.  If you look at the report, at page 99, you will find that the principal recommendation is a long-term policy. I will not worry the House with a long quotation, but the report says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The first remedial measure which we have to suggest is the institution of a long-term building programme, and this is the basis on which would rest the success of all other measures.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no quick solution.  I do not know what the conditions may be post-war, but I fear that they will be conditions of unexampled hardship for this country.  All history tells us that major wars are followed by times of stringency and hardship, and if we are to judge the probable hardship following this war in proportion to the magnitude of the war, I think it is no exaggeration to say that we are likely to go through times of unexampled hardship.</P>
    <P>Now, important and all as housing is, there are two more pressing needs for the people&mdash;the need of food and the need of clothing.  These must take precedence even of the need for housing. Food and clothing depend upon employment.  Houses cannot be built without money.  They must be paid for out of the rates and out of the taxes, and if we search the pockets of the ratepayers and the taxpayers too frequently, we will bring industry to a standstill.  In that case, not only would it be impossible to house our people, but our people would go unnourished and naked.  So that, while we must do everything that we can within the margin of safety to house our people, we must not house them to the detriment of these two more urgent needs, the need of food and the need of clothing.</P>
    <P>I do not know what our Government may be able to do in the matter of help, but I think that, even from the <Col N="430" /> financial point of view, there is no quick solution of the housing problem. It must be done as speedily as possible. All we can do within the limit of safety must be done for the housing of the people, but that does not mean that this problem can, by this motion or any other means, be solved rapidly. The mere acquisition and clearance of sites must be a very deliberate and a very judicious procedure, if we want to give fair play to everyone, and if we want to convince our people that we are living in settled times and under an Irish Government, and if we want to give them respect for law and legal procedure.</P>
    <P>Anyone who attempts to give the idea that the housing problem can be solved out of hand by any action of this or any other Government is either dishonest or uninformed.  I repeat that if houses are built in huge numbers, they must be paid for.  When I say that, I do not mean to say that only the rich pay for them or only the middle classes pay for them.  They pay of course and pay heavily and, even at the moment, are paying comparatively heavily.  But the very poor, indeed the very poorest, contribute their share.  They pay it in the form of higher rents and through indirect taxation, so that they, any more than the rich or the middle classes, cannot escape the burden of payment for these houses.</P>
    <P>Then what is the object of this motion?  If the object of the motion were to secure co-operation and to secure a speedier housing of our people through united action on the part of all Parties in this House, I do not think it would have been framed in such a manner as it was framed.  I do not think it would have contained the undeserved and very unjust censure on that Party which forms a clear majority in this House.  I think that, if co-operation were looked for, the motion would be framed in another manner altogether.  Nobody knows better than the intelligent Deputy who already spoke on this matter that, in urging the Government to house our people, he is simply pushing an open door.  But I am afraid <Col N="431" /> from the wording of the motion that it was designed to give the Government Party the appearance of resisting a measure that was meant for the good of the people and I think I have exposed the fallacy of that.  However, I repeat that our workers must be housed as speedily as possible.  I hold that we have so far, in this area, housed them as speedily as the resources of our ratepayers and taxpayers were capable.</P>

They will be housed as speedily as the resources of the State will allow.  But they must be housed and will be housed without danger to the two more primary needs, the need of food and the need of clothing&mdash;in a word, the need of employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnSOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in perfect agreement with the first part of this motion, that the Dáil is of opinion that the provision of 20,000 more working-class dwellings for Dublin is a major post-war problem.  I think every Deputy will agree with that part of the motion.  But, with the kind of political twist that comes with the following part of the motion, I cannot agree.  I am not aware of anybody who contemplates a scheme for building dwelling-houses who is held up by any alleged inactivity on the part of the Government.  On the other hand, for some years past, I have known of several individuals and organisations who have made their plans to commence building schemes, who have cleared the land on which they propose to build houses and are carrying out the work of making roads, and so forth.  They are not waiting for any pronouncement from the Government. <Col N="432" /> They mean business.  They know the record of the Fianna Fáil Party in regard to housing.  I do not suggest for one moment that the Fine Gael Party, when in office, neglected the housing problem, but they were not quite so keen on it as the Fianna Fáil Party have been.  The Fianna Fáil Party, when they came to office, made a tremendous drive to provide houses, with the result that a considerable number of houses was built. Anyone who contemplates carrying out a building scheme knows that fact and knows that he can get any assistance that can be given by the Government when the time comes.  What is holding up building at the present time, as is obvious to everybody, is the difficulty of getting supplies of building materials.  That is the major hold-up and Deputy Dockrell is aware of that as well as everybody else.</P>
      <P>The question of the price of the house, when built, must also remain a problem.  It is safe to say that at present it costs at least twice as much to build a house as it would have cost before the present war.  How long that state of affairs will continue after the war, no one can say, or how long it will be after the war before supplies of building materials are available, no one can say.  One would want to have the powers of prophecy to deal with these problems.  Perhaps Deputy Dockrell possesses these powers.  I confess I do not.  I do not know who are the &ldquo;other parties&rdquo; that Deputy Dockrell says are being held up in their building schemes.  Does he mean his own political Party or any of the Parties in this House?  Certainly, I have not come in contact with any organisation that genuinely contemplates carrying out a building scheme that is held up by any alleged inactivity on the part of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one fact which has emerged from the development of this problem throughout the war years, and that is that, owing to the extra cost of building, heavy loan charges, and so forth, the house which the average young man getting married bought before the war&mdash;the most popular, I think, was the house that cost about £800&mdash;will be beyond the reach of the average young <Col N="433" /> man who contemplates getting married, when building supplies are again available and, as I have said, we cannot tell how long that state of affairs will continue.  It is obvious, therefore, that the only chance of providing houses for young people who are about to get married is to build them with a view to renting them, and that must be done by private enterprise.  The Government cannot possibly be expected to take upon itself that task.</P>
    <P>The question of slum clearance and the provision of houses for those who have been removed from the slums is being handled by the Dublin Corporation under the direction of the Department of Local Government, and I think it is being handled fairly well.  Despite the shortage of supplies, the Dublin Corporation has managed to build a number of houses since the outbreak of the war and there is no evidence anywhere that the Dublin Corporation has been held up through lack of knowledge of the Government's intentions.</P>
    <P>I repeat that this motion appears to me to have a political twist, to be designed to try to discredit the Government, to suggest that the Government is not doing something which it ought to be doing.  I think that is quite contrary to the facts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Connor has talked about the people who &ldquo;mean business&rdquo; in this matter.  I think he is one of those who regard business as being with a capital &ldquo;B&rdquo; in this whole matter, giving a very large percentage of return.  I do not think that is what is required with regard to the post-war housing problem and the solution of it.  Deputy Dockrell's motion is put down here in quite a frank way.  He says&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the provision of 20,000 more working-class dwellings for Dublin is a major post-war problem.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not think anyone would disagree if he doubled that figure, and made it 40,000.  I think the recent housing inquiry talked about 46,000 houses.</P>

      <P>If the Minister would devote himself to suggesting solutions to his colleague who is going to speak and let other speakers alone, he might do better.  Deputy Dockrell suggests the provision of 20,000 working-class dwellings.  I think Deputy O'Connor will not disagree that it is an under-estimate of Dublin's needs in respect of post-war housing.  Can anybody say that it is not a post-war problem of first magnitude?  Deputy Dockrell's motion goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The failure of the Government to announce its decisions with regard to some of the aspects of this question is holding back the plans of other Parties who must necessarily share in the solution of this vexed problem.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Surely Deputy O'Connor or other Deputies do not believe that all this is going to be carried out without the aid of private enterprise.  Does the phrase &ldquo;other Parties&rdquo; include those who may want to bring private enterprise into this matter or are we going to throw the whole question of future housing, say, in Dublin, and, incidentally, the rest of the country over on to local authorities or on to the Central Government, and is it a fact that nobody at this moment knows whether or not the Government has taken any decision on any aspect of the housing matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take an editorial from the <i>Irish Times</i> of December 22nd dealing with the report of the Inquiry into the Housing of the Working Class in relation to the City of Dublin, as posing <Col N="435" /> some of the matters upon which a Government decision or a Government view of what the future is likely to be might be required.  This editorial says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We must remember, of course, that the report cannot budget for the unknown conditions which will prevail after the war.  It is based on the facts and figures of 1939: those of 1949 and 1959 are as yet unpredictable. Will the costs of building have gone down, or up?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Well, we know in regard to electricity, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, as one Minister, has accepted that the post-war prices will be from 45 to 50 per cent. above 1939. Is that a view that is held only by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and only lately, and only in regard to electricity, or is it based upon a general attitude that the Government have with regard to post-war prices in relation to the year 1939?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Will the costs of building,&rdquo; the editorial says, &ldquo;have gone down, or up?  Will the conditions of the new world leave us poorer or richer?&rdquo; Have the Government anything to say to that?  Are we going to have the programme of the standstill Order continued, the Order which means that people will not get more than their 1939 wages, plus about a 10 per cent. increase, even although costs of living have gone 70 per cent. ahead of the 1939 costs that people had to meet? Deputy Butler has been very keen on the fact that food and clothing, at least, come as requirements ahead of housing.  Of course, under these circumstances, if people have to live on a 1939 wage and face 1945 costs, which are the 1939 costs increased by 70 per cent., and particularly when the food item in the calculation of the index figure has gone up by more than 70 per cent. they have less to pay for housing and for rents than they had in 1939.</P>
    <P>Government policy since the war started has been to keep wages down and to let the cost of living rise.  If they have made any attempt to keep the cost of living down, they have not been successful in that attempt, while <Col N="436" /> they have ruthlessly clamped down a standstill Order on wages.  The editorial says: &ldquo;Will the conditions of the new world leave us poorer or richer?&rdquo;  With the conditions of life that the Government will seek to impose on the community, particularly that section for whom this motion is mainly intended, will they be constrained to live in what was, relative to 1939 conditions, a much poorer situation? And again: &ldquo;Will Ireland's &lsquo;exiled&rsquo; citizens return, and if they do return, will they scatter themselves through the country at large, or will they concentrate themselves in Dublin, thereby swelling the demand for housing? The editorial goes on to say that some sort of planning with regard to the distribution of these people may help to solve some of the problems, but have the Government indicated that they have an answer to any of them? I found, in an article written with regard to house building in England, a few problems posed in this way:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Thus, in the vital matter of housing, the mind of the majority turns at once to the council or the Government, thinks in terms of a cheap rent, and that is about all there is to it.  In practice, of course, things are not so simple.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It goes on to point out that in practice there is a great deal more to it.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For instance, a saving of 5/- a week in rent may be extravagant in time and money if it means an addition of 1/- a day to travelling expenses.  A house must be considered as one factor, no doubt the big factor, but still only one in a very complicated and many-sided situation.  Road, drains, gas, water, electricity have all to be provided anew for the large-scale operations of public authorities.  Then transport, trains and omnibuses have to be diverted or adapted to meet the requirements of the new State.</P>
    <P>Next social services must be established, among them being shops, cinemas, churches and public-houses. To make life tolerable to those who are not enamoured of the panel system, a doctor must be attracted <Col N="437" /> to the neighbourhood.  Some of these accessories present difficulties that are best overcome without the assistance of a public authority, others raise questions directly due to the invasion by public authority into private affairs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Have the Government told us that they have a scheme for dealing with the swollen population in Dublin? What we do know arises out of the early inquiries of the 1939 commission, which, after about three months' activity in the public eye, hibernated until the end of 1943, when they produced this report.  In the early days, when they were taking evidence, there was one amazing item which struck the public, and it was this, that, arising out of the activities of the Dublin Corporation in this city, many people had better homes provided for them in the outskirts of the city than in the old slum quarters in the heart of old Dublin, and yet it was sworn in evidence before this Housing Commission that it was discovered over and over again that many of those tempted to the outskirts of the city by the provision of better houses had been found again inhabiting the slums.  They crept back to what was described as sub-human conditions.</P>
    <P>On inquiry, this was found to be the answer&mdash;it is not an answer which was discovered here, but was put up by people who have written of their experiences in connection with housing schemes in Birmingham, Manchester and many other large industrial centres in England where the same peculiar situation was observed.  It was that those people, who had no love for the old slum conditions, and who were tempted by better conditions to leave them, were eventually found back again in these shocking conditions for this reason, that as regards the person who was getting a small wage and was living on unemployment assistance&mdash;a fixed sum&mdash;if you shove him and his family to the outskirts of the city and he finds he still has the same income out of which to buy the same amount of food that his family required before, and that was cut down to the bare necessities, and if he has to pay more for transport or even the expense of <Col N="438" /> going into the city a couple of times a week to sign on for unemployment assistance, every 2d, 3d, 6d or 1/- taken off his wage meant so much less to be spent on food.  Of course, it was then the case with these people who went to the garden cities on the outskirts that the rents had increased to some degree over what was paid in the slums, and whatever extra amount had to be paid was taken away from the miserable sum which the family had to spend on food.</P>
    <P>Deputy Butler's placing of the situation is quite right.  Food comes first, when you get to the very primitive side of life.  Even clothes&mdash;rags, second hand clothes&mdash;come second, and the idea of a decent amenity in the way of a house comes only third.  But people whose lives could be sweetened and developed and raised beyond the sub-human conditions have to refuse them because out of the small wages, they are not able to spare even the 6d or 1/- or 2/- exacted by way of a new toll for a better house or the travelling expenses they have to meet going to the city looking for work or to get the dole.  What we want to know in connection with the housing problem is much the same as what we want to know in connection with many other matters facing this country in the post-war period.  Are we going in for the narrow policy of restriction that we have had so long, or is there any attempt to be made to get at the root evil, which is poverty, the only cure for poverty being increased production?</P>
    <P>I have referred to the most significant part of this report.  It will bear repetition.  I am speaking now of the Report of the Dublin Housing Inquiry dealing with the housing of the working classes.  I will draw attention to paragraph 133 on page 54, where there is a reference to Appendix 17, which appears at the back of the report on page 251.  The detailed circumstances are given in the appendix.  Paragraph 133 states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Appendix 17 gives a summary, prepared by the city manager, showing the sizes and incomes of 10,500 families taken at random from <Col N="439" /> the 33,411 working-class families included in the 1938/'39 survey.  An earlier summary of 4,000 families was also presented, but the percentage differences were comparatively slight, and it is sufficient to confine attention to the larger sample, which, being one-third of the whole, may confidently be taken as representing the whole&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not think there will be any quarrel if we take one-third as being a reasonably good sample to show that the results deduced would apply over the whole.  This means then that what follows may be taken as representative of the 33,411 working-class families.  We usually take an average of five to the family in this country. If we are to take that figure, it means that the 33,000 families represent 165,000 people.  Take that out of the population of this city.  The summary indicates that 20.06 per cent. of the families had incomes from 5/- to 20/-per week.  An additional 25.49 per cent. of the families had incomes from 20/- to 40/- per week.  Let us stop there.  Fully 45 per cent., a bit less than one-half of the 10,000 families, had less than £2 a week as a family income.  I want to add just the other figure to get the point over the 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>Another 9.48 per cent. had between 40/- and 50/- so that 54 per cent.&mdash; let us call it half&mdash;of these 165,000 people had, as families, a family income of not more than 50/- in the week, that is, at 1938-39 prices.  That 50/- of 1938-39 is worth somewhere between 25/- and 30/- to-day.  That means that over half the 10,000 families to-day find themselves forced to exist on something in the neighbourhood of 25/-or 30/- a week, because (a) of the standstill Order which prevents those of them who are employed getting any higher wages, with the exception of some 10 per cent. addition, and (b) the Government have been unable to control, or did not control, costs of living, with the result that these costs of living are 70 per cent. above the 1939 figure.</P>

      <P>These 10,500 families are not getting more than 50/- per week and the Government have allowed the costs of living to go 70 per cent. higher than 1939.  The result of that on the £ is that it is worth between 10/6 and 11/- in purchasing value, so that if the Government have been decent enough not to collapse the wages of the people who are getting less than £2 10s. per week, it cannot be said that they have been very efficient on the other side. They have not done much to see that the 50/- has the old purchasing power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I said before is right.  It is worth between 25/- and 30/- at the moment and I want to know if that policy is to continue post-war.  The Government are clapped on the back in English newspapers and economic journals which circulate in England, and people are told that this is one of the few countries in the world in which wages have been kept down, and that it is a great policy.  Of course, it <Col N="441" /> is a great policy from the point of view of the old reactionary type of capitalist.  I did not think we had many of these left in the world, but any that we have left in the world are concentrated here.  In any event, that is the boast and a wreath is given to the Government&mdash;they should really be honoured amongst nations, because, while they let the cost of living soar, they have kept wages low.</P>
    <P>Is that a policy only for the war?  It would seem to me to be inhuman if it were only for the war period.  If it is to be transferred into the post-war period, what will the situation be? Deputy Dockrell talks in his motion of 20,000 more working-class houses.  His case is supported by figures of what houses may cost, but any calculations made are based on 1938-39 prices.  Are housing costs to go up in the same way as the Minister for Industry and Commerce agrees that electricity costs will go up, or at least the costs of building electricity schemes, the materials which have to be brought in and materials which have to be made here will go up?  I do not know whether he added wages, but, in any event, whatever will be done in regard to electricity here, prices will be 45 to 50 per cent. higher than pre-war.</P>
    <P>Is housing to cost 45 to 50 per cent. higher than pre-war, or is it to cost that unless the Government takes steps in some way to prevent it?  If the Government are going to take steps to prevent it, what steps will they take? Suppose houses are to go up on that basis and suppose wages are kept at the same figure as at the moment, is it possible that we are going to have a bigger percentage of these 10,500 families, who will find themselves in a post-war period with their pre-war wages, asked to pay for houses erected at post-war costs?  What are the rents of the new post-war house to be and how are people to be put in a position to pay these rents?</P>
    <P>One other article I have here in connection with housing on the other side mentions three important issues to be decided in connection with any housing scheme.  The first is: can private enterprise finance the building of <Col N="442" /> houses, or, if they cannot do it entirely, is there any zone of the housing problem which they would be asked to fill on their own, and is the remnant to be filled entirely by local authority help or by central government help?  The second issue put forward in this cutting is: what is to be done about building costs?  They are far too high at the moment and this cutting adds:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They have risen out of proportion to the general rise in the cost of living.  How are they to be brought down?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The third issue is what is called long-range continuity of operations.  That deals with a problem which, because we are faced with such an immediate urgent problem, we may be inclined to put on the long finger, but it is a rather necessary matter to have inquired into.</P>
    <P>It deals rather with this, that apart altogether from the immediate demand for the erection of certain houses, not to replace anything, but really to get rid of bestial conditions in the city, it is recognised that houses are falling into disrepair, into dilapidation and almost into decay year by year, and there is an annual deficit with regard to the number of houses which are at any time to be found in any big industrial city, and particularly in Dublin. What sort of long-range continuity of operation is there to be as between Government, local authority and private industry to see that these houses are kept in repair, or that, when they fall into disrepair, they will be knocked down and replaced by others?  Have the Government any plan with regard to the areas of work which are to be given over to private enterprise, and what are to be confined to public enterprise?  Have the Government any scheme for keeping costs of building even to their present figure, or, as might be expected by people, for lowering them?</P>
    <P>The Government has been silent on all this matter, although, owing to the efforts of a member of the corporation, Mr. Milroy, in 1939, they established this inquiry in March, 1939.  While the inquiry was going on, one would have <Col N="443" /> expected that they would have been forming views on their own.  We get this report published at the end of 1943, and, since it was published, although there has been a number of newspaper articles clamouring for some revelation of Government policy in the matter, if they have any policy, so far there has not been a whimper from the Government to indicate that they have any plan at all.</P>
    <P>I suggest we should get back to the root matters, of which I say there are two.  One is very definitely touched on in the report, but it arises on another motion and I do not intend to touch to any great extent on it here, that is, the question of the rate at which the money to be invested in housing will be borrowed.  That forms the subject of a separate motion and I prefer to leave it over to be discussed by itself, but it is quite clear not merely from this report but from the multitude of reports produced in connection with cities in England, that it is one of the very important matters which have been brought under consideration.</P>
    <P>Our situation with regard to money is well known.  We have so much of it that it is a drug on the market at the moment, so much of it that it is actually adding to our difficulties.  We have any amount of it channelled into certain areas where very little return is given to those who lend that money. The pretence has been made that money, because it is what they describe as money at call, cannot be used for anything in the nature of a long-term or medium-term type of operation, and yet we know from recent discussions that some of this money supposed to be at call has been put into such an undertaking as the Shannon scheme where it cannot be described as money freely at call.  Yet there is no apparent reason why the Government should not see that these conditions are there when money is to be put into so very important a matter as housing.  That, however, forms the subject for another debate and I will say no more about it now.</P>
    <P>The main thing the Government must face up to is that the conditions under which a very big number of our <Col N="444" /> people live do not permit them to pay anything like an economic rent for the houses that are erected in these days. If they still live under the same conditions they will not find it possible to pay any addition to that rent.  Now, it is easy to say that the solution of that problem is to make those who can pay, pay out the money for these things.  But when you have a stationary national wealth, you are, when you do that, simply shifting the burdens as between sections of the community.  That particular solution cannot last for any long time.  You cannot go on piling on more and more burdens in the way of greater housing subsidies, and in the way of greater additions from the community to the rents which have to be charged for these houses without making someone step out of the queue they are in for production purposes and have them join the queue of the people who are in receipt of assistance, in receipt of help, or the dole.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce gave us here some time ago a list of the subsidies and of the reliefs, etc., which the poor are getting, but when he magnified them to double the proportions of the total amount produced in wealth or agriculture he did not say that he was afraid of that charge.  Most countries, however, have swung away from that danger point.  Most countries have realised in the past that the sections of the community not well enough off to house themselves properly must be helped, but unless those who can help are put into better means of production then in the help they are giving to the other sections they are loading down production.</P>
    <P>As far as this country is concerned the national income has not really increased in the last 20 years.  A false appearance of increase has been given by the fact that prices are now higher than they were, and if you multiply production by the prices charged across the counter you might draw a wrong conclusion of an increase in the national income.  The national income, however, has remained pretty much the same for some time.  What is happening <Col N="445" /> is this: more and more people are going off the work line in this country, more and more people are emigrating, more and more people are joining the relief line and the group of those who have to get help in different ways&mdash;those who have to get subsidies for relief, subsidies against hunger, subsidies against destitution and subsidies against disease, and you swell these more and more than you would in fact if prices were properly correlated to decreasing production.</P>
    <P>The Government attitude to the whole thing is this: we are going to see that reliefs are given.  We are not very much interested in production as long as we can keep people from destitution, and we do not care to look ten years ahead and see where all this eventually will lead to.  We are just going on with this policy, and let production take care of itself.  Of course, in that mood, we had the policy which is enshrined in the standstill Order, and we are brought back to earth by this amazing paragraph 133 of this report of 1938-39.  Samples taken over these 33,000 families during 1938-39 indicate these amazing figures I have spoken of.  Twenty per cent. of them are getting a family income of not more than £1 a week, and another 25 per cent. getting a family income of not more than £2 a week.  What the Government have got to say to that particular aspect of the problem I do not know, because I have not heard it yet.  The Government see these people getting these sums given to them, though not earning them, but if the Government's attitude is that they will look after these people, do the Government think there will be any amelioration in the condition of these people by taking this 20/- per week per family group and putting them out to Crumlin where they will have to spend a bit more than they had been accustomed to before, in travelling back to the city, or do they think there will be any amelioration in their condition where they demand from the people getting that 20/- family income a little bit more in the way of rent for houses than they are asking those people to pay now? The policy of the Government all the time in regard to this matter has been <Col N="446" /> marked by that sort of reckless tendency.  The attitude as far as the Government is concerned is to shut their eyes to the realisation of the impact of that vast increase in the cost of living&mdash;70 per cent. over 1938-39&mdash; upon the poorer people in the community; not merely upon the 20/- a week, the 40/- a week or the 50/- a week family income groups, but the people who are on low wages generally, the people with £5 a week and who find that £5 reduced to the region of £2 10s. Od. or maybe £2 15s. Od. through the way the cost of living has been allowed to soar.</P>
    <P>Yet it is expected of this community that they should finance the war out of small savings and out of small earnings.  More than 50 per cent. of the community have to live by earnings&mdash;on what they make out of their work and in the giving of services to the community, but, inhumanly&mdash;I cannot think it is entirely inefficiency&mdash;inhumanly, the cost of living has been allowed to swell to the point recorded in the official journals. Eventually it will be found, when we look backward, when we look in retrospect at the war, that the way we have got through this war is this: we have taken it out in disease, even in an increase in crime, and we have taken it out in the depletion of the small savings of the small man.</P>

      <P>Deputy Blowick has given the following notice:&mdash;To draw the Minister for Agriculture's attention to the fact that, as emerged from the reply given by the Minister for Supplies to question No. 13 on to-day's Order Paper, persons using tractors in connection with agricultural operations cannot obtain the necessary fittings to enable them to move their equipment by road without rendering themselves liable to prosecution for damage to the roads, and to ask whether he can make a statement in so far as farming operations are thereby affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>To-day, in reply to a question, the Minister for Supplies informed the House that there are no pneumatic tyres or tubes available in this country for agricultural purposes. I want to bring to the notice of the Minister for Agriculture a position that has arisen in my county&mdash;and I suppose the same applies to practically every county.  The majority of tractors in the country are fitted with steel wheels.  The wheels are fitted with either cleats or spade lugs.  If the owners of the tractors take them on the road they are liable to prosecution for damaging the roads, and rightly so.  There have been a few prosecutions lately in County Mayo.  One case is being heard to-day in Castlebar District Court.  There are others to be heard on next Wednesday.  Two tractor owners are being prosecuted for using on the road steel wheels, as fitted on leaving the factory, and causing alleged damage.  These people cannot help themselves.  Apparently the pneumatic tyres are not available. Everybody in the House, and nearly every tractor owner, fully appreciates the difficulty that the Minister for Supplies and the Minister for Agriculture have in this respect, but tractor owners find themselves in a very unenviable position, being prosecuted if they use their tractors on the road, and if they leave them idle, the Department of Supplies will cut off their fuel and oil supplies because the tractors are not being used for the purpose for which they obtained them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="449" /> This question affects four different Government Departments&mdash;the Department of Supplies, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Local Government and the Department of Justice.  The situation that I have indicated, I think, shows a deplorable lack of harmony between the different Government Departments. Up to this, tractor owners did take their tractors on the road and they were not prosecuted.  This year, when the weather improved, there were two prosecutions and the publicity that they received naturally will deter practically every tractor owner from taking his tractor on the road, with the exception of the five or six in the county who are fortunate enough to have tractors fitted with pneumatic tyres and tubes.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Supplies, in reply to my question, said that steel road bands are normally supplied with steel-wheeled tractors for use when the tractors are travelling on the roads.  That is quite true, but anybody who has used a tractor hauling either a binder or a threshing mill will know that, while they save the road and save the tractor owner from prosecution, they are a positive danger, even on the slightest hill.  There is some chance on a second-class or third-class road that is rough-gravelled, but on a smooth, tarred surface, if you use the road bands and haul a threshing mill, you will not climb the hill.  If by some miracle you do succeed in climbing the hill, there is great danger descending on the other side.  I witnessed an accident where a threshing mill shoved a tractor that was fitted with smooth road bands down the hill. Therefore, that part of the Minister's reply does not meet the situation by any means.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to get in touch either with the Department of Local Government or the Department of Justice.  I hope he will not tell me, as he did on a recent occasion, that I am asking somebody to do something illegal.  I do not want that.  It must be within the Minister's power to make an Emergency Powers Order to meet a situation such as this, particularly when it threatens to prevent all <Col N="450" /> tractors from travelling the roads with farm machinery.  That is very serious at the present moment when work has commenced.  I would suggest to the Minister that, if at all possible, he should arrange with the Department of Supplies and, through them, with some of the manufacturing firms, to have the metal road band that goes over the cleats or spade lugs, as the case may be, fitted with, say, an inch thick of rubber.  I am sure that is possible. The food supply of the nation at present, and until this emergency ends, must take precedence over practically everything else.  I am sure the rubber supplies at present available in the country are not so short that they could not provide an inch of rubber to be fitted to these road bands.  That would ease the situation.</P>
    <P>I quite appreciate the difficulty that the Minister for Supplies has in obtaining pneumatic tyres and tubes.  They were never manufactured in this country and England and the other manufacturing countries that used to supply them are using them for other purposes at the present time.  I should like the Minister for Agriculture to set about easing that situation.  The tractor owners are not so foolish as to take the tractors on the road and run the risk of prosecution.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister also to make representations to the Minister for Local Government in this matter. I have travelled a good deal in my county and I have never seen a single case of damage being done to the road by a cleated or spade lugged wheel other than the leaving of the tracks in the tar.  That is not serious enough damage to warrant a prosecution.  As I have said, there is one case to be heard in the Castlebar district to-day. There is another listed for next week. The effect of that will be felt in the county and possibly through the country.  The Minister should make representations to some Department. I will not accept as an answer that I am asking for an illegality.  I am not asking for an illegality.  I am just pointing out to the Minister, in time, a situation which, if not met, will endanger the food supply of the country for the coming year.</P>
    <Col N="451" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, my desire in this matter is to get as many tractors imported as might be necessary for the tillage required and, also, of course, for the operations of threshing and so on.  It must be obvious that these tractors will have to appear on the road from time to time, especially in the threshing season, when they must go from place to place.  That ends my function as far as tractors are concerned.  I need hardly say, however, that when letters are written complaining that people have been prevented from having their tractors on the road, my Department get in touch with the other Departments concerned. The first Department with which we discussed this matter is the Department of Local Government.  The Minister for Local Government pointed out to me that it is rather a difficult matter to maintain the roads owing to the fact that he has not got the materials that were available before the war, and that the roads are deteriorating&mdash;there is no doubt about that&mdash;and that he is very careful not to permit anything to happen that might make these roads worse still.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the maintenance of good roads is at least as important for the farming community as for any other section of the community, because the principal haulage on the roads at present is the haulage of agricultural produce, beet, grain, live stock, etc., as well as the haulage of turf.  I cannot find any fault with that reasoning and I think the Minister for Local Government is perfectly correct when he says that it is important to keep the roads in good condition.  I do not want to pose as an expert on the maintenance of roads, but I must say that Deputy Blowick is the first, to my knowledge, to claim that these tractors, with these cleats and lugs, etc., are harmless on the roads.  It is generally maintained by road engineers that these tractors would do a great deal of harm if permitted to travel on the roads without the wheels being properly covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Justice, of course, hardly comes into this matter at all. It is the function of the Minister for Justice to see that the law is carried <Col N="452" /> out.  I do not intend to interfere with the Department of Justice in that way. I am not dismissing Deputy Blowick's plea on the ground that he is asking for the permission of an illegality.  He is not, of course, because what he really is asking is that the law should be changed.  If the Minister for Local Government believes that a great deal of damage would be done to the roads and that this matter can be got over in another way, then I think the Minister is right in maintaining the law as it is and that the Minister for Justice is right in seeing that the law is carried out.</P>
    <P>The next Minister concerned is the Minister for Supplies.  He told Deputy Blowick to-day, and he has confirmed it to me since, that there are steel bands available for these tractors.  I have not heard anybody seriously contend that these steel bands cannot be used with safety on the roads.  Last autumn I saw numbers of tractors with steel bands travelling on the roads and pulling threshing mills after them, sometimes threshing mills and elevators and, so far as I know, there was no mishap.  On one occasion, when a tractor was going down a steep hill, the owner had to put a brake on the mill which he was pulling after the tractor.  These things can be improvised.  We have improvised a lot of things since the emergency started.  The owners of tractors are quite as ingenious in these matters as any other class in the community. They have got on all right with these steel bands, which are now available. I do not think that we should take too seriously the complaint that they are dangerous.  Of course, as we all know, pneumatic tyres for the tractors that are coming in now are not to be got, but the steel bands are being supplied.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it would be possible, either from the point of supply or otherwise, to have thin bands of rubber put on these steel bands, as suggested by Deputy Blowick.  I know, of course, that rubber is very scarce and that it would be difficult probably to find rubber for that purpose. Even if rubber were available, I do not know whether it would be feasible or practicable; but we can <Col N="453" /> inquire about that.  On the whole, I think that we should rather be thankful that we are able to get these steel bands; because at one time last year it was impossible to get these steel bands, but they came in subsequently. If the steel bands were unobtainable now, as well as rubber tyres, I do not know what we could have done.  We probably would have had seriously to <Col N="454" /> consider whether it would be possible to allow tractors without pneumatic tyres or steel bands to travel on the roads.  I think that tractor owners should get the steel bands and use them.</P>
