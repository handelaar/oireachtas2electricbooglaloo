      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state in respect of Mr. James Sweeney, temporary messenger, Department of Industry and Commerce, his original date of employment on State service and the reasons why it is now proposed to retire him; whether he is aware that his service has been and is entirely satisfactory; that during the emergency period he not only gave exemplary service in the L.S.F., but that in respect of meritorious police duty performed by him on the 23rd July, 1944, he was highly commended by the Commissioner and Group Staff and given a special presentation; whether he will state if his domestic circumstances have been inquired into before the proposal was made to retire him, and if in view of his service, his present capacity and his domestic circumstances, steps will be taken to continue his employment.</P>

      <P>Mr. James Sweeney was first employed as a temporary messenger in my Department on 11th January, 1924.  I am aware of all the circumstances detailed in the question.  Mr. Sweeney's employment was continued for a considerable time after the normal retirement date and the decision to retire him now was taken after full consideration of all the circumstances of the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister <Col N="1398" /> say whether he will reconsider this matter?  Does he not consider, apart altogether from the merits of this case, that this is a type of case which does require reconsideration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there are any circumstances which would justify reconsideration of the decision. Whatever circumstances would justify exceptional treatment had been already taken into account when his period of service was extended beyond the usual retiring age.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as any question of his capacity to serve is concerned, is the Minister aware that he was not only giving effective service in the duties which he was called upon to discharge in the Department but that he was serving in the L.S.F. from 12 o'clock at night until 4 o'clock in the morning and from 8 o'clock at night until 12 midnight?  If he is capable of doing work of that particular kind, and doing it in such a meritorious way as to merit particular commendation and a special presentation from his superiors, surely he is capable of doing the particular work allotted to him in the Department?  Does the Minister not consider it unfair that a person of his capacity should be obliged to retire at 68 years of age instead of being allowed to serve until 70 years of age when he would be entitled to the old age pension?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the position developing that a man who has given service in the National Army, who has given the faithful service that this man gave in a simple way in the Civil Service and who has, furthermore, given very faithful service during the emergency, is to be retired at 68 years of age without any pension of any kind instead of being allowed to serve until the age of 70, when he could draw the old age pension?  We seem to be getting into a heartless state.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his attention has been drawn to the recent increase in the price of clothing which has resulted in a lesser quantity of purchases of clothing by the more necessitous and lowly paid workers; if he will cause an inquiry to be made into the cost of materials, the cost of production, the cost of manufacture, the price from agents to retailers and from them to the wearers; and if he will order prices to be reduced if the inquiry justifies such an order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that there has been any recent increase in the price of clothing.  On the contrary, the price of clothing is at present showing a downward tendency as a result of a recent Order made by me reducing the maximum margins of profits which can be taken by traders, and as a result of reductions which have been effected in manufacturers' prices.  The prices of cloth and clothing and all factors affecting such costs are under constant review in my Department and appropriate action is taken to effect reductions in prices where such reductions are warranted. I consider these steps sufficient to maintain supervision and control over the prices charged by traders and manufacturers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he will now consider a review of the cases of traders whose licences were revoked during the emergency for minor breaches of or slight irregularities under the Emergency Price Control Orders; and whether he will consider that Christmas, 1945, would be an opportune time for a general amnesty in this respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No trader has had his licences revoked on the grounds that he was convicted in respect of minor breaches of, or slight irregularities under, the Emergency Powers Orders relating to the control of prices.  The only licences revoked were those of traders who were convicted in respect of serious contraventions of the Emergency Powers Orders relating to rationing and price control, where the circumstances were considered to be such as to indicate the unfitness of these traders to be permitted to continue to trade in rationed commodities.  It is not proposed to restore these licences.</P>

    <P>Farmers' turf, which represents about four-fifths of the whole, is valued as I have already indicated. Other turf is valued on the same basis for 1941; for subsequent years it is valued at the average wholesale price <Col N="1403" /> in the turf and non-turf areas, including the price paid by merchants for supplies drawn from Fuel Importers (Eire), Ltd.</P>

    <P>As regards the fourth part of the Deputy's question, the price of turf in Dublin was first controlled from the 27th June, 1941, at 45/- per ton.  The controlled price was raised to 64/- per ton from 1st November, 1941.  Sales by Fuel Importers (Eire), Ltd., of turf produced under special emergency schemes commenced in November, 1941, and that company's turf losses (which are recouped by subsidy) for each year since are as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state with reference to superphosphate: (a) particulars of arrangements made with Great Britain whereby manufacturers here are now manufacturing for Great Britain; (b) the total quantity proposed to be manufactured under such arrangement; (c) the advantages, financial or otherwise, of such arrangement to the agricultural industry here; (d) whether such arrangement has held up output for our own requirements and, if so, to what extent; and (e) whether, in entering into such arrangement, supplies of sulphate of ammonia were asked for as a <i>quid pro quo.</i></P>

      <P>Arrangements have been approved by me for the manufacture, from materials supplied and shipped by the British authorities, of 40,000 tons of superphosphate, of which 27,000 tons will be exported to Great Britain and Northern Ireland and 13,000 tons retained for use in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1404" /> These arrangements are of advantage to the agricultural industry in that additional supplies of superphosphate are being obtained which would not otherwise be available, and that these supplies are being obtained at a lower cost than would otherwise have been possible.  The arrangements have not in any way held up the production of superphosphate for domestic requirements.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that the arrangements in question provide for the retention in this country of one-third of the total quantity of superphosphate to be produced, no request was made for supplies of sulphate of ammonia as a <i>quid pro quo.</i>  The question of securing the release of sulphate of ammonia for this country is being pursued separately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state when the Land Commission proposes to resume its normal activities in respect of the acquisition and distribution of lands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not clear what meaning the Deputy attaches to the word &ldquo;normal&rdquo; in his question.  In fact, during the ten year period prior to 1939 the acreage of land acquired for division by the Land Commission under the Land Acts 1923-39 in a single year has varied from 21,000 acres to 112,000 and the area divided has varied from 32,000 acres to 104,000 acres.  It is plain, therefore, that the rate of land division is dependent on circumstances and that there is no such thing as a norm.  At present, shortage of materials (particularly building materials), difficulties of transport and lack of trained staff restrict the acquisition and division of <Col N="1423" /> further land, and it is not possible to state when these adverse conditions will cease to obtain nor can it be expected, as I have frequently explained, that land division can be continued in future years at anything approaching the rate to which we have been accustomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the fact&mdash;nobody ought to be more aware of it than he is&mdash;that during the past six years Land Commission activities in the matter of acquisition and distribution of land have been seriously curtailed; and that there are still, in many parts of the country, considerable areas of land which local people are anxious to have acquired and divided?  Can the Minister give any indication as to when the Land Commission will abandon the policy of going slow which they adopted in 1939 and resume the acquisition and distribution of land on a scale which will make reasonable provision for the requirements of persons who are anxious to secure portions of these holdings which, in many cases, are untenanted and could, if acquired and divided by the Land Commission, be a profitable source of living for a large number of small holders and landless men?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been rather a lack of activity by the Land Commission for the past six years in the matter of land acquisition.  It is hoped that in the almost immediate future the Land Commission, having got most of its staff back, will engage in&mdash;shall we accept Deputy Norton's word&mdash;&ldquo;normal&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, if we are to accept the policy put forward by Deputy Davin in his question of dealing with cottage tenants and landless men, may I say that landless men are not really the matter of primary concern of the Land Commission?  The Land Commission has as its major concern the question of dealing with congestion, <Col N="1424" /> and the division of land amongst cottage tenants and landless men does not tend towards the solving of the congestion problem.  When the Land Commission&mdash;as I hope in the immediate future&mdash;becomes more active in the question of land acquisition and division, it must direct its attention particularly to the question of the relief of congestion and not to matters such as Deputy Davin has raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, responsibility for the repair and maintenance of roads constructed by the Land Commission for the benefit of allottees on the division of untenanted land rests on the allottees.  In many cases such responsibility is specifically undertaken by the allottees.  The matter of the maintenance of the roads should be arranged by co-operation among the local allottees, and should not cause any hardship if minor surface damage is attended to promptly as it occurs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Though it is not the function of the <Col N="1425" /> Land Commission to undertake the repair and maintenance of roads constructed by them, in some exceptional cases they have effected necessary repairs as a matter of grace and not of obligation.  In suitable cases the Land Commission endeavour, and often with success, to get the local authority to take over and maintain such roads.</P>
    <P>It is not within my province to deal with such a large and general question as the taking over of all roads by the county councils.  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the possibilities of assistance provided by the Rural Improvements Scheme operated by the Special Employment Schemes Office.</P>

The first object is to enable the Post Office Savings Bank Fund to be invested in the stocks of a local authority and the second object is to enable a local authority to be put in funds out of the Local Loans Fund, to enable it to exercise an option to redeem a stock after the first redemption date.  As the law stands at the moment, the moneys of the Post Office Savings Bank Fund cannot be invested in the loans of a local authority, even though such loans have a trustee status.  It is proposed to do away with the limitation there, but to keep as a limitation that such funds may be invested only in the trustee funds of a local authority.  The other object is to advance moneys out of the Local Loans Fund for the purpose of enabling a local authority to redeem a loan falling in after the first redemption date.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, Section 2 (1), to delete lines 1 and 2 and insert in lieu thereof the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the word &lsquo;dwelling&rsquo; means a house let as a separate dwelling, or a part, so let, of any house, whether or not the tenant shares with any other persons any portion thereof or any accommodation, amenity or facility in connection therewith;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to ensure that, where there is common user of part of the house, such as a bath-room, lavatory accommodation or a kitchen, the tenants will not find themselves deprived of the protection which it has hitherto always been thought they enjoyed under the <Col N="1429" /> existing law.  The necessity arises out of a recent decision of the Court of Appeal in England, in the case of Neale v. del Soto, which was referred to during the Committee Stage.  I have considered this carefully and I think it better to give the court a direction, so that there will not be any doubt as to what the position of a tenant in such a case would be.</P>

The Deputy might look at the definition we have so far in the section.  It merely says: &ldquo;the word &lsquo;dwelling&rsquo; means a house let as a separate dwelling, or a part, so let, of any house;&rdquo; and I am extending that as in the terms of this amendment.  I am advised that it meets the point raised on Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have here a series of amendments in the name of Deputy McGilligan.  They are to Section 3, which is a fundamental section of the Bill.  They might have been moved lawfully and correctly on the Committee Stage, but they certainly should not be brought for the first time before the House on the Report Stage.  They are amendments Nos. 2, 4, 5 and 6.  No. 3 might be regarded as going with them, but it is an amendment that can be allowed, because its main purpose is to change a date which was changed in Committee; and whatever was changed in Committee can be changed back on Report.  Amendments Nos. 2, 4, 5 and 6 are alterations to a principle, and the issues involved are so radical that the amendments cannot be allowed at this stage.  No. 3 is, however, allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection, I might refer to another amendment by Deputy McGilligan, No. 17, in which the same question of control arises.  It proposes to delete the words in Section 27 &ldquo;controlled (1923 Act)&rdquo;.  The deletion of the word &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; runs counter to Section 3 and would widen the scope <Col N="1430" /> of the Bill.  As a matter of fact, it would apply the provisions of Part 3 of the Bill to all small premises, controlled or uncontrolled.  However, the figures and words &ldquo;1923 Act&rdquo; were inserted on the Committee Stage and if Deputy McGilligan cares to move as an amendment to amendment No. 16, &ldquo;that the figures and words &lsquo;1923 Act&rsquo; be deleted where they occur in amendment No. 16&rdquo;, he would be quite in order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Deputy McGilligan, I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 6, Section 3 (2) (b) and (c), lines 16 and 17, to delete in each place the words and figures &ldquo;7th day of May, 1941&rdquo; and substitute therefor the words and figures &ldquo;29th day of December, 1944&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister is aware that, by accepting the amendment on the Committee Stage, houses that have been controlled will now become decontrolled.  I intended to put down an amendment myself, but Deputy McGilligan has put it down instead.</P>
      <P>Not alone houses that were already controlled, but houses controlled under the Emergency Powers Order will be affected as a result of this section, which changes the date to 7th May, 1941, from the original date, 8th February, 1944.  It will operate to decontrol such houses.  Consequently, a number of people who had their rents fixed since the coming into operation of the Act will now find themselves decontrolled.  I do not know whether the Minister realised that on the Committee Stage.  Deputy Dillon had not any particular purpose in moving the amendment.  He possibly misunderstood that the 7th May, 1941, was the date fixed in the Rent Restrictions Order, 1944, as the date on which, if houses were let, the rent would be taken as the standard.  But that was not the date as from which houses built or erected, or in course of erection, or erected subsequently, would be outside the scope of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that a number of tenants who had their premises controlled will be decontrolled.  I do not know whether the Minister intends <Col N="1431" /> that, but I think it will create a certain amount of injustice.  A number of tenants have made representations to me that their houses are to be decontrolled and that the Order of 1944 will be nullified by an Act which is really intended to be a continuation of it.  I think the Minister should accept Deputy McGilligan's amendment, or re-insert the date in the Bill as it was originally introduced, the 8th February, 1944.</P>

I think there is a fair case for decontrolling houses which were built when costs were high, under the conditions that have obtained since the emergency began or, at any rate, since 7th May, 1941.  Up to that date the houses were constructed of materials the price of which had not become inflated because of war conditions, and the rents of those houses were fixed accordingly.  The landlord had in mind what the cost was and what would be a fair return for the amount of money expended in the construction of the houses.  After that materials and labour&mdash;perhaps not so much labour&mdash; began to cost more.</P>
      <P>We discussed this matter on the Committee Stage.  Deputy Dillon submitted an amendment to put the date back.  There was a good case for it and I do not think there is any very great hardship.  In my opinion there would be an injustice to the builder who was enterprising enough to build under the conditions that existed. Anyone who did that ought not to be controlled at a standard that might have been all right up to the beginning of the emergency.  I think Deputy Cosgrave will admit that.  We must be just to both sides and the person who was enterprising enough to spend money providing houses at a time like that ought not to be at a loss.  I did all this with my eyes open.  I did not know that people had benefited by the control.  Even if they have benefited, I do not think there is a case for it now and they will have to put up with the consequences.</P>

      <P>The argument now used by the Minister is the same <Col N="1432" /> argument as he and Deputy Dillon used on another occasion, having regard to the costs operating around that particular time.  While a good deal might be said on the side of the Minister, there is the aspect that the emergency brought a certain number of tenants up-to-date and they did have a certain protection which is now being withdrawn.  That is the more serious aspect.</P>

      <P>May I draw the Minister's attention to a concrete case which has had the benefit of the protection of the courts under the Order? The house was built in 1942; the valuation is in the neighbourhood of £15 and the rent is £90.  The tenant took it on a short lease which is due to be terminated within the next few months.  The tenant will then find himself in the position that if this legislation goes through he will be deprived of the benefit of the Order. He has had already a decision in his favour from the courts.  What you are doing is to deprive that tenant entirely of benefits which have accrued to him under the Order of 1944.  There is a <Col N="1433" /> good deal in the argument that the date should be as it was in the Order &mdash;8th February, 1944.  The case I have referred to is a concrete case, recently brought to my notice.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan spoke about the adverse effect that rent restrictions will have on builders. I pointed out that it already had had that effect in the between-the-wars period.  After 1919, when there was experience of control, we are aware that houses then built after, although they were not subject to control, were built more for selling than for letting.  Deputy McGilligan raised that point and mentioned that by continuing control we would be likely to restrict building.  Here are people who built houses and I think if we did what is now suggested it would be most unfair to them.  It is too bad if some people will suffer by it but, on the other hand, they have gained something up to date, may be for a couple of years or for whatever time has elapsed since the Order was made; but strictly they were not entitled to it.  Probably we made a mistake.</P>

      <Col N="1434" /> I have been informed that there is a practice&mdash;it may not be a very widespread one&mdash;that where a business premises is let on a yearly tenancy the tenant may be subject to a notice of less than six months and, in fact, it does not amount to a yearly tenancy at all.

      <P>This amendment relates to a matter mentioned by Deputy Dockrell.  I do not know that he made it quite as clear on Committee as it was made to me subsequently.  It may have been my fault, but I did not get the point at the time.  I understand that there are in the city what are called service flats in which are provided certain amenities. It was represented to me, I believe quite rightly, that in the case of these flats in which, for example, central heating is supplied, the cost of fuel became so very high that the flats were being let at a loss.  Another point is that the people who take these flats are not the type of people who require the protection of the Rent Acts.  I think there is a good case for the amendment. There are only a few cases of it in the city and I do not think that anyone would expect that people should be required to let their flats or houses at a loss, which I understand is the position.</P>

He gave us&mdash;Deputy Coogan, Deputy Cosgrave and myself &mdash;to understand in Committee that we might withdraw our amendments and that he would give us a viewpoint on Report which would be an improvement on the Bill.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to a fact of which I am sure he is aware, that there is a Bill going through the British House of Commons dealing with furnished apartments.  It is a short Bill of 12 clauses; the most important of which deals with the setting up of a tribunal to which people who have these furnished apartments may appeal to get a fair rent fixed or to get a reduction in the rent.  I should like to know if the Minister is still adamant, if he is still in the same position as that in which he was on the Committee Stage, or if he has anything to offer which would bring about an easement of this tremendously important and vexed question in relation to Dublin City.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 6, Section 3 (2), to delete paragraph (h), lines 40 to 44, and insert in lieu thereof the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(h) any dwelling or business premises let together with land other than the site of the dwelling or business premises, if the rateable valuation of the land exceeds the lesser of the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) half the rateable valuation of the site including the building or buildings thereon, or</P>
      <P>(ii) (I) in case the dwelling or business premises are situate in the County Borough of Dublin or the Borough of Dún Laoghaire, £10,</P>
      <P>(II) in any other case, £5.</P>
      <P>This deals with those cases in which land is attached to a dwelling, which were raised by Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Byrne.  I understand that, in the case of Dublin or Dún Laoghaire, a £10 valuation would mean about two and a half acres.  We made inquiries of the Valuation Office and were given to understand that about £4 an acre is the amount at which land would be rated, which would represent about two and a half acres in Dublin.  I think the figure of £10 set down in the amendment is high enough, because if you go any higher, you are getting near to an agricultural holding.  In rural areas the average is 10/- to 15/- per acre so that the limit of £5 would represent from seven to ten acres.  I think the amendment should meet Deputy Byrne and Deputy Cosgrave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this amendment.  I do not know if the Minister realises that it will decontrol <Col N="1437" /> some houses which have been controlled since the 1923 Act.  It is bad enough that houses which were controlled by the 1944 Emergency Powers Order should be decontrolled, but, under the 1923 Act, if any premises built before 2nd April, 1919, which were situated in Dublin and of which the poor law valuation did not exceed £30 and any premises situated elsewhere, the poor law valuation of which did not exceed £25, were let with land, they were controlled if the rateable valuation of the land was one-quarter the valuation of the house.  A quarter of £60 is £15 and a quarter of £40 in respect of premises outside Dublin is £10.  I understand that that worked out approximately that a house inside Dublin with a valuation of £30 was protected, even though let with land, provided that the rateable valuation of the land did not exceed £7 10s. 0d., but, outside Dublin, if the poor law valuation was £25, it amounted to £6 5s. 0d.  By this amendment, the Minister is reducing the amount in Dublin to £10, and outside Dublin, to £5, which will in both cases decontrol houses which have been controlled since 1923.</P>
      <P>Whatever case can be made in respect of houses dealt with by Emergency Powers Order for the past couple of years, there is no case for this, because serious hardship will arise, and I suggest that the Minister should accept the amendment in my name and that of Deputy M. O'Sullivan, which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 6, Section 3 (2) (h), line 43, to delete the words &ldquo;one quarter&rdquo; and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;one half&rdquo; and at the end of the paragraph, line 44, to add the following words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;provided that the Poor Law Valuation of the said land shall not exceed:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  in the case of premises situated in the County Borough of Dublin or the Borough of Dún Laoghaire, £15;</P>
      <P>(2)  in any other case, £10;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>and provided further that the tenancy comprising the dwelling or business premises with the said land <Col N="1438" /> is not a tenancy to which the Land Acts apply.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On that basis, there is no danger of the Bill covering premises to which the Land Acts apply.  It complies with the amount in the Bill of £60 in the County Borough of Dublin and Borough of Dún Laoghaire and £40 elsewhere. Certainly whatever objection there is to our amendment, there is a far more serious objection to the Minister's amendment in that it decontrols houses which have been controlled for over 20 years.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Cosgrave's point of view.  The Minister, on the last occasion, did, as a matter of fact, indicate&mdash;I think Deputy Cosgrave was supported by Deputy O'Connor on the point&mdash;that Deputy Cosgrave's amendment was reasonable.  What Deputy Cosgrave says is absolutely correct.  In the 1923 Act, the figures were £30 in Dublin and £25 outside Dublin and what the Minister is now doing, inadvertently, I am sure, is giving an advantage inside Dublin, where the old quarter basis applied, that is, £7 10s. as against £6 5s. outside Dublin.  The figure now proposed by the Minister is £10 for the city, which is an advance of £2 10s. and £5 outside the city, which will remove protection from quite a number of people, particularly in urban areas.  May I make an appeal to the Minister, on behalf of members who have taken an interest in this Bill, and who gave it a comparatively easy passage on the Committee Stage, to surrender to our point of view on this question, because we know that, as a matter of fact, hardship will follow if the Minister's figures stand.  I suggest, if he does not accept the figures mentioned by Deputy Cosgrave, that he might leave the Dublin figure at £10 and bring the figures appertaining to urban areas to £6 10s. or £7.  That would ensure protection and would cover such cases.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy McGilligan I move amendment No. 23:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 17 to add at the end of Section 30 (2), line 58, the words &ldquo;but the tenant shall continue to pay the existing rent until the final determination or confirmation by the court.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not care much for the form of the amendment as it stands and I do not know if the Minister is acquainted with such cases.  In most rent applications, where a tenant is brought up under an ejectment for not paying rent, the usual result is that the judge says he has the rent available now, and will ask &ldquo;why allow these people to get into arrears&rdquo;?  Of course there is legal advice, and the landlord may be compelled to execute necessary repairs or some other work which requires to be done.  The rent is a lever and, in many cases, it is given to a solicitor or into some safe depository like a solicitor's office, but when the case is again considered the tenant is not able to make up the arrears.  As the section stands, if a tenant makes an application to the court and a provisional rent is fixed after, say, two months, the landlord has three months' time in which to make an objection.  Let us suppose <Col N="1444" /> that after a couple of months the landlord makes an objection, the case is put into the list but, possibly, it will not come on for hearing for six months.  During that time the tenant has paid the provisional rent which was fixed by the district justice.  At the end of the period of six months, the case is heard, and the rent is readjusted to the original rent or to some other figure in excess of that fixed by the provisional order.  The tenant in that situation is faced with the payment of a sum which he cannot afford to pay.  I suggest to the Minister that this section should be amended, and that the payment of the rent under a confirmation order should date only from the making of the order.  As it stands, the section will certainly cause a lot of hardship to a tenant if, say, a period of six months can elapse before his case is heard.  There can certainly be a period of three months within which the landlord can make his objection.  I suggest that the landlord should only be entitled to his rent as from the date of the confirmation order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is not acceptable.  The difference cannot be very much since we are providing that the tenant will not have to pay a greater rent than he has already been paying.  If there does happen to be some difference between the lawful rent provisionally fixed, and the rent that is finally fixed, it certainly will not be very much.  The court can make an order as to how the difference is to be paid, if that question should arise.  On the other hand, if the amendment were accepted I think the tenant will probably lose because, as the Bill stands, he will get the benefit immediately of the rent that is fixed by the court.  I think that in most cases tenants would lose rather than gain by the acceptance of the amendment, and that the section is much more favourable to tenants as it stands.</P>

      <P>In page 20, Section 37 (1), to delete paragraph (e), lines 43 to 51, and insert in lieu thereof the following new paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(e)  in the case of a dwelling&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the dwelling is reasonably required by the landlord for occupation as a residence for himself or for any person <i>bona fide</i> residing or to reside with him, and either&mdash;</P>
      <P>(I)  in the opinion of the court greater hardship would, owing to the special circumstances of the case, be caused by refusing the order for possession than by granting it, or</P>
      <P>(II)  the court is satisfied that alternative accommodation, reasonably equivalent as regards rent and suitability in all respects, is available, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  the dwelling is reasonably required by the landlord for occupation as a residence for some person in his whole time employment of some tenant from him, and the court is satisfied that alternative accommodation, reasonably equivalent as regards rent and suitability in all respects, is available, or.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (e) of sub-section (1) of Section 37 provides that, in the case of a dwelling, the landlord may recover possession if he reasonably requires the premises for occupation as a residence for himself or for any person <i>bona-fide</i> residing or to reside with him or for some person in his whole-time employment or in the whole-time employment of some tenant from him, provided that the court considers that it would be a greater hardship to refuse the landlord possession than to allow the tenant to <Col N="1448" /> remain.  The overriding provision that the court must consider it reasonable to make an order for possession applies also.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (e) was the subject of a keen debate on Committee Stage and I undertook to reconsider the paragraph in the light of what was said on that occasion.  I am now proposing in this amendment to substitute a new paragraph (e) which, I think, represents a considerable improvement on the existing draft and is fairer to both landlords and tenants. The proposed new paragraph distinguishes between the case in which the landlord requires possession for himself or for some person <i>bona-fide</i> residing or to reside with him and the case in which he requires possession for an employee of his own or of a tenant of his.  In the former class of case it would seem reasonable to provide that the landlord should be entitled to get possession when he is able to satisfy the court that it would be a greater hardship to refuse him possession than to allow the tenant to remain on, or, alternatively, that other accommodation, reasonably equivalent as regards rent and suitability in all respects, is available for the tenant. For the landlord to be able to satisfy the court on either point should be sufficient.  On the other hand, where possession is required for an employee, the landlord should be required to show that suitable alternative accommodation is available for the tenant. The &ldquo;greater hardship&rdquo; clause should not operate in this class of case.</P>
    <P>The amendment has been drafted accordingly on these lines and, as I have stated, I think that it is a distinct improvement on the present paragraph (e).  In the case where the landlord wants the premises for an employee, he should be able to show that there was alternative accommodation for the occupying tenant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make the point &mdash;this is possibly the only chance I will have&mdash;that we are making it easy for owners of property who want possession of premises for the purpose of sale to give notice to quit to two or three tenants occupying a large house and not provide them with alternative accommodation, as is the Minister's intention.  By being able to say he wants the premises for an employee, the landlord may get judgment for possession.  There is no time limit provided; he does not have to state the length of time for which he wants the premises for the employee.  He may use that provision as a lever to get the tenants out and then may bring in a friend or relative and accommodate them for a month or two.  At the end of that time he may proceed with a plan of converting the private house into business premises and sell the premises at a handsome profit.  I suggest a time limit.  If tenants are to be put out of their flats or their houses and if that house is subsequently converted into a business premises, will the Minister provide some period of time during which the premises cannot be converted into business premises unless the tenants are given adequate compensation and provided with alternative accommodation as set out in the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Dublin one meets numbers of people who have received notices to quite because the premises are required for some private purpose of the owner and within three to six months we see the premises converted into valuable business premises.  For instance, in Tara Street at the Tara Street Fire Brigade Station, a number of houses have been allowed to get into a certain degree of decay; then the owner comes along and gives notice to quit on the grounds that the premises are not in <Col N="1451" /> good order and, in the course of a couple of months, he sells the premises at a fabulous price for conversion into business premises.  That has happened in connection with premises beside the Tara Street baths and along Sir John Rogerson's Quay.</P>
    <P>What I want to secure is that in connection with houses which are let as tenements or flats in thickly populated areas, if the owner wants to convert them into business premises he should be forced to pay adequate compensation and provide alternative accommodation.  If tenants are put out of premises which are then converted into valuable business premises such as a coalyard or a cement store&mdash; I mention these deliberately because of the cases I have in mind&mdash;the tenants should be provided with accommodation by the owner who is improving his property and we ought not to make it too easy for landlords to get possession for the purpose of sale.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that house property is worth two and a half times its value if clear possession can be obtained.  I want to secure that it will not be made too easy to put people out of their homes when they have no alternative accommodation.  I have in mind more than business concerns.  I have in mind the Irish Tourist Board, who may have to put people out of their homes and do not provide accommodation for them, although they are creating a public amenity.</P>

If the tenant assigns the premises, even with the written consent of the landlord, subsequently, if the landlord takes proceedings to get the tenant out for breach of agreement, the courts in England have held that the phrase, &ldquo;without the consent in writing of the landlord&rdquo;, does not mean anything.  They have given the landlord control of the premises.  In other words, they have evicted the tenant.  If the Minister does not see his way to accept the amendment, perhaps he would adopt the provision in the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, in which it is set out that &ldquo;such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld&rdquo;.  That would cover, this type of case.  The courts have held that the phrase in the Bill does not mean anything.  There is no advantage in having a provision as to the written consent of the landlord if that provision can be got over by the landlord.</P>

On the Committee Stage, Deputy Martin O'Sullivan proposed that the section should also include a saving for a local authority's powers under the Public Health Acts.  I have had the matter further examined and it is now thought better not to mention any specific enactments but to have the saving framed in the more general and comprehensive terms which the amendment proposes.  This will have the advantage that the saving will apply to the powers of a local authority under any Act that may be enacted hereafter.

      <P>In page 26, to insert at the end of Section 54 a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3) (a) On an application by a landlord of controlled premises, the court may by order exempt the landlord from compliance with regulations relating to rent-books made under sub-section (1) of this section.</P>
      <P>(b) An order shall not be made under this sub-section unless the court is satisfied&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  that the applicant has made satisfactory alternative arrangements for keeping records of payments of rent made by his tenants and for furnishing a proper receipt for each such payment, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  that, having regard to those arrangements and to all the circumstances of the case, it would be unreasonable to require the applicant to comply with the regulations.</P>
      <P>(c) The court may attach to an order made under this sub-section such conditions as the court thinks fit to impose, including, in particular, a condition that the applicant shall furnish each tenant of controlled premises, of which he may from time to time be landlord, with such particulars, relating to the rent payable by the tenant and the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants under this Act, as are required by the regulations to be specified in rent-books.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d) A person who fails to comply with any condition attached to an <Col N="1456" /> order made under this sub-section in relation to him shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall, on summary conviction thereof, be liable to a fine not exceeding £10.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage there was a discussion on this subject of rent-books, and, as a result, I put down this amendment.  Very often, when tenants arrive at the landlord's office to pay the rent, they forget the rent-book. The result is that the landlord will not accept the rent.  When the tenant has to go away and come back to the landlord, he may come back with the rent-book but without the rent.  This amendment provides that the landlord must give a receipt, and if the Minister is not satisfied with the receipt given, he can compel the landlord to give the tenant a rent-book.  In many cases a receipt would be more satisfactory than a rent-book, because rent-books have a habit of getting lost and tenants may not always bring them with them.  If the tenants come to pay the rent, the landlord can, under my amendment, give them a receipt and jot down in the stub of the receipt-book the amount of the rent paid, so that there can be no subsequent disagreement as to whether payment was made or not.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment.  It does not go as far as I should like it to go but it leaves to the circuit judge the decision whether or not a landlord should be exempted from the provision with regard to rent-books.  I think that the interests of tenants will be safeguarded by the Circuit Court and that an order will not be made by the circuit judge granting the exemption unless he is satisfied that the receipts the landlord is in the habit of giving to tenants will protect their interests as much as would rent-books.  Those who are dealing with property should not be forced to adopt a system of rent-books if it does not suit their method of doing business.</P>

      <P>There was some controversy about this matter on Committee Stage.  The opinion was <Col N="1457" /> expressed that the most suitable way of doing business as between landlord and tenant was by way of the rent-book.  As regards the corporation, it is true that they give receipts but I can imagine how easy it would be for a woman to lose one of a string of loose receipts.  The rent-book seems to be the firmer form in which to transact this business and, unless there is a very strong argument to the contrary, I should still favour it.  That was, I think, the consensus of opinion on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>That is my personal view, too.  However, I understand that the corporation relies on receipts. There may be cases in which the court is satisfied that suitable alternative arrangements have been made.  As Deputy O'Sullivan will see, the District Court or the Circuit Court, as the case may be, will have to be satisfied that suitable alternative arrangements have been made.  I cannot see that the amendment will do any harm and I am prepared to accept it.  Every landlord will be compelled to provide a rent-book for a tenant unless he can satisfy the court that he has made satisfactory alternative arrangements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two matters to which I want to refer.  Despite the arguments of the Minister, I want to refer, in the first place, to Section 3 (2) (b).  I have in mind a particular set of circumstances affecting six houses, the erection of which was begun in 1936.  In that year, there was a builders' strike and the work was discontinued.  Nothing was done until 1942, when work was recommenced.  The houses were completed at the end of 1942.  These houses were substantially erected or at any rate a considerable amount of work had been done on them before 1941.  The houses were completed at the end of 1942 and they were let in <Col N="1458" /> 1943.  The tenants of these houses would not only in the normal way come within the Rent Order but also within the Rent Acts.  I would suggest to the Minister he might make inquiries to ascertain if there are many such cases.  I do not know how many houses this particular builder or company erected but as far as I am aware six tenants are involved.  They are faced with considerable hardship which would have been prevented if the Minister had left the Bill as it originally stood.  I would suggest that he might reconsider the matter.</P>
      <P>The other sub-section dealing with statutory tenancies has been changed from its original wording.  Sub-section (3) of Section 39 now reads:</P>
      <P>On the death of the statutory tenant of controlled premises the following provisions shall have effect:</P>
      <P>(a)  in case the statutory tenant leaves him surviving his wife, who was residing with him at the time of his death, she shall be entitled to retain possession of the premises under the same terms and conditions as the deceased statutory tenant:</P>
      <P>(b)  in case the statutory tenant does not leave a wife so residing, such member of the statutory tenant's family so residing or, where there is more than one such member, such one of them as may be agreed upon between them or as may be selected by the court in default of agreement shall be entitled to retain possession as aforesaid;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a fairly recent case Judge Davitt decided that where a deceased tenant left a wife she became entitled to the statutory tenancy on the same conditions as the original tenant enjoyed. It has not yet been decided whether, if the wife died shortly after her husband, the children would be entitled to the statutory tenancy.  In fact that is a question of considerable doubt although it seems to me that if the parents died, one almost immediately after the other, it would be unfair to prevent the children enjoying the rights of the statutory tenancy.  In this case the Minister provides that if <Col N="1459" /> the statutory tenant dies and leaves a large number of children, such one of them as may be agreed upon, or such one of them as may be selected by the court in default of an agreement, shall be entitled to retain possession, in other words to become the statutory tenant.  I do not know whether it follows from that that if, say, the eldest son, either by agreement or by appointment by the court, became the statutory tenant and if he got married and eventually had children of his own, he could eject his brothers and sisters.  As I read the section as it stands, it follows that he will be in a position to evict his brothers and sisters.  I think the Minister should make some effort before the Bill finally passes, to introduce an amendment which will cover such cases because I am sure, instead of preventing hardship, the present provision will create hardship if, say, the eldest son of a large family&mdash;and some of them may be quite young&mdash;gets married after becoming the statutory tenant on the death of his parents and is placed in a position to evict his brothers and sisters. I would suggest that that is not the intention of the Bill and that the matter should be reconsidered.  There is the other difficulty that arises where the husband dies, leaving his wife, and she dies after a short period.  As the law stands at the moment, the children would not succeed as statutory tenants. I would suggest that in that case the children should become statutory tenants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the point of view put forward by Deputy Cosgrave. I dealt with this matter on the previous stage.  We asked the Minister then to take steps to protect the children of tenants in cases where a father whose name is in the rent-book dies, leaving a widow and children.  The widow becomes tenant but then a case might arise in which the widow might die within a very short period, leaving five or six children, the eldest of whom, perhaps, might be a girl of 18 or 20. As the law stands, that girl is not protected nor are any of her younger brothers or sisters who are left in her charge.  I understood from the Minister <Col N="1460" /> that he would take steps to give them protection.  Then there is the other point raised by Deputy Cosgrave. It has been known to happen, unfortunately, that where an elder brother became the tenant, because it was his responsibility to see that his younger brothers and sisters were properly housed, that elder brother or elder sister, as the case may be, got married and claimed full possession of the house. In the absence of any special conditions or regulations which would establish that when he was given the tenancy, it was in order that he might provide shelter for himself and his brothers and sisters, he can claim full possession.  I would ask the Minister to consider that point.  I have had experience of a case quite recently of a house let by a certain authority to a certain man.  There was a regulation in the terms of the letting that the tenant had to be qualified a certain way, and that if he were not so qualified, another person who was qualified should get the house.  The father and mother of the family died within a short time of each other, leaving behind them a family of seven, of whom the oldest was a girl of 21.  Fortunately, after five or six months' appealing to the authorities concerned, this authority, out of sympathy with the family, did arrange to provide them with a house. The girl had had five brothers and one other sister, all younger than herself, and it was just because of the sympathetic consideration given to her case by the authority concerned that they were provided with a house.  I join with other speakers in suggesting that the Minister should provide that, where children are left after the death of a father or mother, no drastic action would be taken to evict them from their homes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnSOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the remarks of Deputy Cosgrave in regard to Section 39.  I suggest to the Minister that the position which will arise on the death of a tenant has not been made any more satisfactory by the Bill than it was under the 1923 Act.  I consider that the amendment which I moved on the Committee Stage went a good deal further to alleviate the position where tenants might be dispossessed <Col N="1461" /> through a technicality.  That amendment, perhaps, may have gone a little too far in the interest of the tenant, but I suggest to the Minister that there is some middle course between what is in the Bill and what was contemplated by the amendment. This Bill is intended to last only five years.  It is really an emergency measure to cover the period while houses will remain scarce.  It is the hope and the intention that at the end of five years there will be sufficient houses for everybody, and that less necessity for restriction of rents and other controls will then exist.  Other Deputies were rather amused when I said that before.  They pointed out that the 1923 Act had been renewed every year for 20 years.  We, however, must take this Bill as we find it and it is to operate for five years only.  I suggest to the Minister that every possible effort should be made to provide that, during those five years, no owner of a premises can get possession on the death of a tenant and, owing to some technicality or defect in the Bill, put out members of a family of the tenant who may not come within the cases provided for in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Committee Stage I drew the Minister's attention to the question of the provision of costs for the tenant, in certain circumstances, in the Circuit Court.  Part III of the Bill dealt with that provision, but I pointed out that it was possible for the landlord to take the initiative under some portion of the Act outside of Part III. In that way, the beneficial clauses of the Act, so far as the tenants' costs were concerned, would be vitiated. On the Report Stage, I have not heard anything from the Minister as to whether he has considered that particular question.  It would be decidedly wrong if this Bill, while setting out to protect the tenants in certain cases, left a loophole by which the beneficial clauses could be nullified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Section 39 is perhaps one of the main clauses of the Bill that appeal to every member of the House who is interested in this matter.  It <Col N="1462" /> deals primarily with the question of family life, and nobody knows its effects better than the Minister him self.  I think it would be correct to say that this Bill has improved the position.  Hitherto, the position of the widow was obscure.  The matter is now clear with regard to the husband and wife, and succession to one child. But is it quite clear that there is any further succession?  For instance, if the father and mother die, leaving three girls, one of whom is selected to be the tenant of the house, is it quite clear that there is further succession when that girl dies?  For the sake of the preservation of family life, and for the avoidance of any domestic trouble, I think every precaution should be taken to ensure that there would be that protection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see how Deputy O'Connor can say that there is no improvement as regards the continuity of a statutory tenancy.  As the law stood before, the succession did not extend beyond the person who first succeeded, and, as Deputy O'Sullivan has pointed out, the position of the widow was not clear.  Now, it goes on to one of the children.  Deputy Cosgrave apparently wants me to consider cases where the eldest of the family, a boy or a girl, gets married, and puts the others out. Surely we cannot be asked to deal with cases of that kind.  It would be impossible to deal with family disputes.  You cannot expect the law to deal with them.  One would expect that common humanity or the fraternal feelings of the family ought to be sufficient to prevent anything of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the first point raised by Deputy Cosgrave on the Report Stage, I am satisfied that it would not be fair to control houses built after 7th May, 1941.  There may be, as he mentioned, a few cases, but they would be very rare indeed.  Even if the houses were finished in 1942, you will find that there was greater expense on the builder even in providing material to finish the houses than there would have been before.  I considered that matter very well, and it was discussed here in Committee, but I am not prepared to change that.  I think that is only fair, because it would be too discouraging <Col N="1463" /> to anyone who built houses under present conditions if we were to extend control to houses built during that period of the scarcity and dearness of supplies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to ask one question about the statutory tenancy. I think the Minister is not quite clear on the provision there.

They do not become statutory tenants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Ordinarily, this Bill, which deals with building grants payable to private persons or public utility societies, would be concerned merely to prolong the operation of certain provisions of the Principal Act, that is the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932, but this year it includes an important provision which is designed to assist the campaign now in progress to combat the scourge of tuberculosis.  I will deal later with that provision of the Bill, which is contained principally in Section 3, but I think perhaps I should first deal with what might be called the more normal provisions of a measure of this kind. In clause 2 it is proposed to extend for another two years, from 1st April last, the time for the completion of new houses in rural areas and the reconstruction of existing houses by small farmers and agricultural labourers under the system of grants established by Section 5 of the Principal Act.  Even since the outbreak of the European War in September, 1939, a comparatively high level of building activity has been maintained here.  Quite a considerable number of houses have been built by private persons and public utility societies.  As well as that, grants for the reconstruction of existing houses have been very largely availed of.  The total number of new houses built by private persons and societies of the kind to which I have referred in rural areas since the passing of the Housing Act, 1932, is about 23,200&mdash;I think, to be exact, it is 23,202 &mdash;and, of these, 5,196 have been built since 1st April, 1940, while the number reconstructed since the 1932 Act came into operation is 30,696, of which 6,341 were reconstructed since 1st April, 1940.  Of the total number of 23,202 new houses completed for private persons or public utility societies, in rural <Col N="1465" /> areas, 3,540 were for agricultural labourers and 9,791 for farmers with a valuation of £15, 2,186 houses for farmers with a valuation from £15 to £25, and 7,685 houses for other persons. As regards the 30,696 reconstructed houses, 27,963 were reconstructed by farmers with a valuation not exceeding £25, and 2,733 houses were reconstructed by agricultural labourers.</P>
      <P>These, Sir, as I have indicated, are the provisions of the Act of 1932 which it is proposed to continue as a temporary measure for another two years. At the end of that period&mdash;long before that, we hope&mdash;I shall be putting before the Dáil a more comprehensive measure to deal with the housing problem generally, not only in the rural areas but in the urban areas also; but this Bill, as you know, is not solely concerned with that particular problem.  It is merely an amending Bill, and we cannot, I think, at this stage, go into the whole question of housing. In any case, I understand that a Motion will be discussed this evening in the House with a wider ambit than this measure covers and, no doubt, there will then be an opportunity for Deputies who are interested to put their views before me, and undoubtedly, I shall listen to them with interest, and, I hope, with patience.</P>

      <P>Yes, and I am sure that I shall do that.  I come now to the novel provision in this Bill&mdash;a provision which, I think, is no less important than the provision with which I have dealt.  With regard to Section 3 of the Bill, consideration has been given to the question of improving the living conditions in the homes of persons undergoing treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis in cases where the accommodation in the home is inadequate for the proper segregation of the patient from other members of the family.  The section provides that on the certification of the appropriate medical officer of health the local authority may, and if required by the <Col N="1466" /> Minister, shall, make to the owner or occupiers of the house a grant towards the cost of the provision of an additional room in or attached to the house. A grant of the full cost may be made by the local authority, and two-thirds of the grant or £100, whichever is the less, will be recouped to the local authority by the Minister.  Where the Minister is of opinion that the provision of a hut or chalet within the curtilage of a house would serve the same purpose, Section 4 enables the provisions of Section 3 to be applied accordingly.</P>
      <P>Section 3 of this Bill may be regarded as a further step in the campaign against tuberculosis.  The Tuberculosis (Establishment of Sanatoria) Act, which, the House will recall, was enacted by the Oireachtas early this year, aimed at the provision of additional sanatorium accommodation for patients who need it, and I am happy to inform the House that very satisfactory progress is being made with the planning of these new institutions, but these institutions will provide only for those cases which require institutional treatment.  Further provision is required to deal with the cases of persons who, although suffering from the disease, do not require active treatment in sanatoria.  It is very difficult to say how many persons in this country are suffering from tuberculosis. It is known that 22,879 persons received treatment under the various local authority schemes in 1944.  No doubt, there are many others who are being treated by private practitioners, and also there is a large number of people who, unfortunately, unknown to themselves, are suffering from the disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tuberculosis is an infectious disease, and therefore the first measure to be taken to combat it is to limit the spread of infection.  It is hoped, at an early date, to put into operation an organisation which will enable us to deal with those persons who are anxious to undergo examination and satisfy themselves as to whether they are suffering from the disease or not. In the case of an infectious disease, isolation of the known open infectious case is a matter of prime importance. Infection is spread by careless coughing <Col N="1467" /> and spitting by persons who are known as sputum-positive cases; that is, persons who exhale the tuberculosis germ in large quantities.  The incidence of tuberculosis infection and disease is, therefore, higher amongst persons who come into daily or perhaps hourly contact with infective patients in their own homes.  It follows, therefore, that the incidence of the disease is higher amongst contacts under conditions of overcrowding both in the home and at work, because of the increased exposure to the sputum of persons suffering from the disease.  We have to recognise that fact, if the disease is to be prevented from increasing.  I am sure that there is probably no Deputy in the House who has not known or heard of a family, three or four, or perhaps more, of the members of which have died from tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>It is this high mortality in certain families which has given rise to the delusion that tuberculosis is &ldquo;in the family&rdquo;, as the saying is.  Now, it can be definitely stated that tuberculosis is not hereditary and is not, therefore, &ldquo;in the family&rdquo;.  The reason why three, four, or more members of the family have died from tuberculosis is that, in their own homes, they have been constantly exposed to infection and &ldquo;cross-infection&rdquo; from one another. Section 3 of this Bill aims at reducing as far as possible this exposure to infection.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary that every person who has contracted tuberculosis should be treated in an institution.  In fact, there is a very large number of persons suffering from tuberculosis who do not actually require active sanatorium treatment.  What they need is good food, rest, and fresh air.  But, if we are to counteract their influence as a source of infection, it is essential that the conditions of the homes in which they live shall be such as will permit of segregated accommodation. If this accommodation can be provided, domiciliary treatment, that is, visits at frequent intervals to the patient's home by the tuberculosis medical officer, will meet the case and the <Col N="1468" /> person concerned will make satisfactory progress without entering a sanatorium.</P>
    <P>During the last year over 8,000 persons suffering from tuberculosis received institutional treatment.  It is highly probable that a considerable number of those persons did not, in fact, require such treatment.  But, because their home conditions did not permit of segregated accommodation being provided for them, it was deemed prudent to have them admitted to sanatoria in order to protect the other members of their families.  If treatment can be provided, say, for 1,000 such persons, as we anticipate under this Bill it will be provided, it must follow that the pressure on the bed accommodation in existing tuberculosis institutions will be relieved to that extent.  Consequently, by the operation of Section 3 of this measure, which, I am sure, will become an Act, the existing shortage of bed accommodation will be relieved, which is naturally a very important consideration, and, as well as that, we shall have an additional safeguard against the spread of the disease and the infection of new persons by reason of the additional accommodation which we provide in the patients' homes.</P>
    <P>When addressing the House on the occasion of the Second Reading of the measure to which I referred earlier, the Tuberculosis (Establishment of Sanatoria) Act, 1945, the Parliamentary Secretary (Dr. Ward) intimated that housing conditions had been advanced as being partly responsible for the rise in the death-rate from tuberculosis. He then informed the House that we had instituted an inquiry, which superintendent and county medical officers of health had already carried out, to determine the extent of overcrowding amongst those persons who were known to suffer from the disease. At the time when the Parliamentary Secretary was putting the Sanatoria Act through the House an analysis of the results obtained as a result of the inquiry was being carried out and the Parliamentary Secretary then intimated that we should have to consider every possible means by which segregation could be provided within the <Col N="1469" /> home for those persons who have undergone institutional treatment and have returned to their homes and are being looked after by the local tuberculosis officers.  The survey and the analysis have now been completed, and as a result we have come to the conclusion that about 1,000 cases would secure the benefit of this new provision.  That will mean that in 1,000 cases we are attacking this source of infection.  That will mean that not only will there be 1,000 individuals for whose cure better provision will be made, but there will be a considerable number of other individuals, as yet uninfected by these, who will be protected against the spread of the disease.</P>
    <P>The Government accordingly proposes in this Bill to permit, in fact almost require, local authorities to make grants for the provision of an extra room, as I have said, in the case of a house where the conditions admit of extension of the living accommodation and where the county medical officer of health or the superintendent medical officer of health, as the case may be, certifies that a member of the household is suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis and is undergoing treatment and that the existing accommodation is inadequate for the proper segregation of that person from other members of that family.  I think it would be no harm in this connection to emphasise that those persons who may seek or may desire to avail themselves of the benefit of this section must be persons who are actually undergoing treatment and, of course, they must be persons who cannot provide this proper accommodation for themselves.</P>
    <P>Towards the cost of the operation of this section the Government propose to give a very generous contribution, a more generous contribution, in fact, than was given in respect of any other housing activity.  The maximum amount provided under the Act of 1932 to assist local authorities to carry out slum clearance schemes was, I think, 60 per cent.  In the case of this measure, the Government will contribute towards the cost of providing this separate accommodation two-thirds <Col N="1470" /> of the total cost or £100, whichever is the less.  That contribution will, of course, relate not only to the provision of the extra room attached to the dwelling-house, but will also apply in cases in which it is thought better that a but or chalet detached from the dwelling-house should be provided within the curtilage or garden of the original hereditament.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that the valuation of the building consisting of or including the house shall not, on any valuation or revision of the valuation coming into force within seven years after the additional accommodation has been provided, be increased on account of any increase in the value of the hereditament or tenement by reason of the addition of the extra room or chalet.</P>
    <P>These are the main purposes of the Bill.  I am sure I do not have to say anything more to recommend them to the House.  We regard Section 3 as providing a very important instrument in the campaign which we are waging against tuberculosis.  The Government hopes, at a very early date, to circulate a White Paper giving a much more comprehensive review of the measures which we are taking to deal with that scourge than I am able to do within the narrow ambit of this measure. That will indicate that the Government's plans in relation to this particular problem are very well advanced. When the White Paper itself is in the hands of Deputies, they may take the opportunity, perhaps in the debate on the Public Health Bill which is now before the Dáil&mdash;or on another more suitable occasion, if the time which the House can devote to the Second Reading of that measure should be inadequate for the purpose&mdash;to debate the whole question at length.  I have only to add that, if it would be acceptable to the House, I should like to get all stages of this measure to-day or, at the latest, to-morrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 should not be part of a Housing Bill at all.  This Bill is designed to extend the provisions of the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act of 1932.  Under the 1932 Act, the grants were paid out of State funds, but this particular Bill goes further than any of the previous Acts, in so. far as it brings in the local authorities as well as the State.  The local authorities will be obliged to make grants as well for the purpose of providing the additional accommodation necessary for people suffering from tuberculosis.  I submit that sections of this kind should more properly be introduced or incorporated in a Public Health Act, that they are not related to housing legislation, or at least to housing legislation as we understood it in the past.  Why bring in the local authorities?  If grants are to be made in a Housing Bill for the purpose of providing additional accommodation for unfortunate people suffering from tuberculosis, I submit that those grants should be paid by the State and not by the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has told the House and the country on innumerable occasions that local authorities are responsible, and solely responsible, for the finance of the local bodies, but in this Bill, in the Public Health Bill and in the Harbour Bill&mdash;to mention only three recent measures&mdash;all that authority of the local bodies has been taken away from them.  The Minister has taken power to spend money on this, that and the other, without ever consulting the local authorities.  That tendency has been going on in all the legislation passed in this Dáil in the last three or four years.  In the end, it will happen, in a very short time, that local authorities will have absolutely no control at all over their finances.  I submit that there is no justification for bringing local authorities into a measure of this kind.  The grant for ordinary housing operations are paid by the State out of State funds and a Housing Bill designed to continue the operation of the Housing Act of 1932 should not <Col N="1472" /> have incorporated in it these Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6, which really belong to some other type of legislation, such as the Public Health Bill.</P>
    <P>It is true that portion of a grant&mdash; two-thirds&mdash;will be refunded by the Minister, but even so, I submit that the responsibility for providing the whole of the grant rests on the Minister and the central authority and not on the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I agree that it is necessary, in very many cases, to make provision from some source for building additional accommodation for the unfortunate people suffering from tuberculosis and I agree with the Minister that it is the duty of the State, with the co-operation of the local authorities, to do every thing possible to stamp out the disease and see that the people suffering from it get the best possible treatment and the best possible opportunities of recovering from the effects of the disease.  I suggest, however, that the methods of dealing with tuberculosis should be devised in a Public Health Bill and not in a housing measure of this description.  I think it is most unfair and I wish to protest very strongly against the novel procedure which the Minister has introduced into this housing measure, by making local authorities responsible for part of the grants for the provision of accommodation for tuberculosis patients.  It is a bad precedent, though it is only in accordance with the procedure adopted not only by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health but by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and other Ministers.  They have taken authority, in all legislation passed by this Dáil during this year and the previous two years, for the purpose of directing local authorities to contribute to this, that and the other, with the result, as I said, that soon local authorities will have no control whatever over local finances.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on the progress he has made with the housing problem, but he is not to be congratulated on the manner in which the schemes submitted by local authorities are dealt with in his Department. Schemes submitted by urban authorities <Col N="1473" /> have been held up for months and months, for apparently no sound administrative reason.  In the interval between the submission of a scheme and its actual return to the local authority concerned, costs have gone up enormously, with the inevitable consequence, of course, that the prices have had to be revised on numerous occasions.</P>
    <P>Before the Minister proceeds to deal with housing again on a big scale, he should first of all set about the reorganisation of his Department and see that, when schemes are submitted for his approval, they are dealt with within a reasonable space of time.  The local authorities and the unfortunate ratepayers as a whole should not be obliged, because of the Minister's negligence and the delay in his Department, to bear extra costs, as they have had to do on numerous occasions during recent years.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a real housing policy, that policy should be administered on sound, efficient and economic lines.  I suggest that the manner in which housing schemes and these proposals of local authorities are dealt with at present is a disgrace to any Department of Government.  It is time some steps were taken to reorganise the Housing Branch of the Department, in order to see that there is expedition in dealing with these schemes.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has considered the possibility of increasing the valuation limits for reconstruction grants.  A case was made, when this Bill was up for renewal last year, that the limit of £25 was unfair in many ways, since valuations differed in so many parts of the country, due to a variety of causes known to the local authority but probably not to Government Departments.  For instance, it is well known that valuations along the western seaboard are exceedingly high as compared with other parts of the country.  A man living inland with a valuation of £24 will get a grant, whereas another man along the seaboard with a £25 valuation and half the acreage of land, will be refused.  I was wondering if it would be at all possible for the Minister to devise <Col N="1474" /> some ways and means, in consultation with the Land Commission, to deal with rather unusual cases of that kind. There is a grievance amongst many people regarding the valuation limits. They feel it operates unfairly in some cases, especially along the western seaboard.  The exceedingly high valuation there is due to the fact that flax was grown extensively along parts of the seaboard in years gone by, and scutch mills operated in those districts for a period.  Because of that, apparently, when the valuation was being made, the land was assessed more heavily than land where such developments did not exist.  I suggest that, in fairness to the people of the country, and especially in order to see that the valuation standard operates fairly on all classes of the people, the Minister should look into this question and ascertain from his officials if it is possible to meet that difficulty in any way.</P>

      <P>I rise merely to express my disappointment that the opportunity was not availed of in this Bill to set at rest the anxieties and doubts of local authorities regarding grants for their housing programmes. It is some considerable time since the Minister indicated that he was prepared to revise the subsidies in the light of existing costs, but so far there has been no positive indication given to the local authorities in that connection.  A number of Deputies expected that this Bill would contain some indication of the general policy regarding housing subsidies, but apparently the Bill is merely confined to certain extensions.</P>

I suggest his statement on this terrible scourge would be far more convincing and far more impressive if it contained some element of consistency that would suggest that there was sincerity in the approach to this problem by the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  While the legislation to which the Minister referred was going through the House, Deputies on all sides applauded the efforts the Government were prepared to make so far as people suffering from tuberculosis were concerned.  One defect in that legislation was pointed out by Deputies of all Parties, and that was, that no progress could be made while provision was left out for the dependents of patients undergoing treatment in sanatoria.

      <P>I am not going any wider than what the Minister voluntarily entered upon in his opening statement.  I am well aware of the provision to which he refers in the Public Health Bill, but I suggest it does not meet the point I am making, which is that in the Sanatorium Bill we were given to understand that provision would be made for a scale of allowances for dependents of patients undergoing treatment.  In some Parliamentary Questions recently I wanted the Parliamentary Secretary to indicate how far he was prepared to go with his scale of allowances and his answer was that patients such as I have referred to were capable of being treated by public assistance authorities.</P>
      <P>This evening the Minister referred to the matter again and he said we were making a most generous contribution to sufferers from tuberculosis.  He mentioned that there is a higher provision than ever has been made for subsidies on houses.  It is not higher; it is precisely the same&mdash;66?&mdash;as in the case of slum clearances.  He is entitled to claim that he is making a generous provision towards an extra room for tubercular patients, but his Department has turned down a claim for equally generous treatment for dependents of patients in sanatoria.  That is a glaring inconsistency so far as the treatment of tuberculosis is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as a first instalment in the important matter of housing.  It proposes to do something for the persons who are badly in need of accommodation.  I shall try to confine myself to that aspect and to-morrow we can debate the other points that were raised. While the Minister is going a certain distance in this Bill, I suggest that <Col N="1477" /> there are certain improvements that could be made.  For instance, in one section it is set out that the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; recoup to a local authority an amount not exceeding £100.  I suggest the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; should be &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. You are proposing to compel a public body, which is quite ready to act on the recommendation of the county medical officer of health, to make a grant equal to £100 for extra accommodation in a rural area.</P>
      <P>Those of us who have had experience on public boards and who are living in rural areas know that at the present time there is great hardship among numbers of people, small farmers and others with little means, in trying to get extra accommodation for members of their families who may be suffering from tuberculosis and who may be awaiting admission into a sanatorium. It would seem that after we provide that accommodation the Minister is taking precautions to have the owner of the house protected by not having the valuation increased.  I should like him to go further and provide that, after a grant is given to the owner of a house for £100, he will not look for an increased rent as a result of the increased accommodation given and the grant from public funds.  If protection is given in respect of the valuation, I claim there should be also some protection for the tenant.  We should see that the landlord or owner will not reap any benefit by means of increasing the rent, even though the amount is rather small.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that this may give accommodation to something like 1,000 people.  I was calculating that it would not give more than 40 extra rooms in each of the Twenty-Six Counties.  My experience in regard to the treatment of cases, domiciliary and otherwise, is that in the infant stages, when you are unable to get even sanatorium treatment, or when the county medical officer of health may consider it necessary to get accommodation for one member of a family you require a much larger amount.  It is an admission that the large number of houses which public bodies are building are not suitable for the present position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1478" /> I hope that in the new housing scheme which is being considered there will be greater accommodation for large families in working-class areas, that the houses will not be confined to those with three or four rooms, but that there will be larger grants available for public bodies to provide larger houses.  Personally, as one who has had experience, I welcome the Bill as a measure designed to do something, pending the starting of a bigger housing scheme, and I hope it will go through as quickly as possible, so that public bodies will be enabled to make grants on the recommendation of the county medical officer and to make accommodation available for people who require treatment.  I believe that we shall be doing a good day's work if we do something to alleviate in some way the sufferings of these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be inconsistent if I did not reiterate the demand I have frequently made in connection with similar Housing Bills for the raising of the limit of valuation for housing reconstruction grants.  The grants to small landowners for the improvement of their homes have been very widely utilised and have proved a very valuable asset.  Not only have they resulted to a great extent in an improvement of living conditions in rural Ireland but in an improvement in the appearance of large areas of the country.  I cannot, however, see any reason why the limit of £25 valuation should still be adhered to.  For the first few years of the operation of the scheme, there may have been good reason for limiting it to holders under £25 valuation, but, having proved the worth of the scheme and in view of the extent to which it has been availed of there is good ground for raising the limit by at least £10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be contended that people over £25 valuation are in a position to obtain such financial asistance as will enable them to reconstruct their houses, or, alternatively, that they are in receipt of such an income from their holdings as would enable them to make the desired improvements; but anybody who knows anything about rural Ireland knows that, on a <Col N="1479" /> very large percentage of our farms under £50 and £60 valuation, the dwelling-houses are buildings which were constructed 200, and, in many cases, 300 years ago.  They may have been reconstructed from time to time, but the old original buildings are still there&mdash;old that ched farmhouses which are now falling into decay.  The landowner of the type I have mentioned, the man up to £35 valuation, has not the financial resources to enable him to reconstruct his home, because it must be remembered that the work of reconstruction is very substantial.  A reconstruction grant of £40 would go only a very short distance in the reconstruction of the usual type of farmhouse; but, at the same time, it would be very useful, and I think the time has come when, having regard to the success of the scheme up to the present, it should be extended to valuations of £45.</P>
    <P>I was under the impression that the grievance in this respect existed mainly in my own constituency, but I had occasion recently to visit a neighbouring constituency and to investigate conditions there.  I find that, even in Wexford, which is supposed to be a very prosperous agricultural constituency, a very large number of farmers of valuations of £25 have very poor living accommodation and have not got the financial resources to improve them. The help which has been given to small farmers should now be extended to those with valuations over £25, at least up to £35 or £40.  I think that would cover most of the needs of farmers whose housing accommodation is very bad.  The Minister may say that if we raise the valuation limit to £35, why not raise it to £45, £50 and £60?  That would not be a reasonable approach because it is on the type of holdings I have mentioned&mdash;those somewhat over £25 valuation&mdash;that you find a large percentage of the older type of house which urgently requires reconstruction. It is a pity the Minister did not introduce a provision to raise the valuation limit.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision of additional accommodation for people suffering from tuberculosis, I think it is a <Col N="1480" /> desirable provision, but I am anxious to know if it will apply to tenants of labourers' cottages in rural areas, that is to say, will the local authority be required to provide additional accommodation in these houses?  It is a rather extraordinary thing that we very often find very large families in households in which there is a tendency to this disease, and the labourer's cottage, while adequate for the ordinary working family, is not sufficiently large to provide for the segregation required in the treatment of tuberculosis.  The provision of an extra room is good, always provided that there is adequate education or instruction of those concerned, so that they may avail fully of the opportunity for segregation.  Without that instruction, it would be of very little use.  I have in mind the case of a very large family affected with this disease&mdash;three or four members of the family have already died. As they were smallholders under £25 valuation, they availed of the £40 grant to build an additional room, but, notwithstanding that, I know from personal knowledge that there has been no attempt at any kind of segregation and that the position is still almost as bad as it was.  So far as the remaining members of the family are concerned, in spite of everything done up to the present, in spite of the arrangements of the county medical officer and in spite of the fact that they have this additional accommodation, there is still nothing facing this family but slow extermination.</P>
    <P>This provision is welcome, but it must be accompanied by a very elaborate system of instruction, so that those concerned will be able to avail of the additional accommodation advantageously.  As I understood from the Minister's statement, a local authority is empowered to provide a grant equal to the full cost of the additional accommodation.  If I did not misinterpret the statement, a local authority would be recouped to the extent of two-thirds, or, £100, whichever is the least.  Of course that means a small additional burden to local rates, but that may be offset, if the scheme is properly availed of, by a <Col N="1481" /> saving in the cost of institutional treatment.  Wherever it is humanly possible to ensure that persons suffering from tuberculosis could be adequately treated in their own homes, that is, in certain respects, better than institutional treatment, and for that reason I welcome the provision dealing with housing.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill.  Deputies who have contributed to the debate so far carried on a discussion on the housing question generally rather than on the objects of this measure.  I welcome the Bill, because I know from experience the necessity for it.  Every Deputy who knows provincial towns has had the same experience.  Many people would like to see the provisions of the Bill extended to rural districts, because, unfortunately, a great many people who are affected by tuberculosis are not in a position to make the necessary alterations in home conditions in order to grapple with the complaint.  I have to express disagreement with Deputy Roddy and, to some extent, with Deputy M. O'Sullivan for their criticisms, and for finding fault with the Minister for placing an additional burden on local bodies.  We have heard that cry in this House continually, but we have not yet heard one Deputy of any Party on the Opposition Benches make any reference to the extraordinarily increased values which the housing policy of the Government as a whole has created for local authorities.  I often wonder if these Deputies think what the position will be 35 years hence, or it they ask themselves: &ldquo;What will be the position of local bodies when valuations have increased by hundreds of thousands of pounds as a result of the Government's housing policy&rdquo;?  As the representative of a local authority&mdash;a county council&mdash;I make no apology to people who find fault with the Government in a matter of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall that Deputy Roddy complained some years ago that we were advancing too fast with the housing policy.  It had a disastrous effect for the Deputy in the following June.  I advise Deputies to give this measure <Col N="1482" /> their wholehearted support.  It is one that is overdue.  It is only those in constant touch with unfortunate families affected by tuberculosis who know what a benefit the Bill will be when it is put into operation.  I ask the House to accept the Bill and to see that the best possible use is made of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anybody is objecting to provision being made to enable families suffering from tuberculosis to extend their housing accommodation with certain public assistance, although I would rather agree that the State might take that burden on itself.  My principal reaction to the Minister's statement is that anyone affected by tuberculosis must be wishing that words could do something for them, because both here and elsewhere the whole question of tuberculosis is smothered with words.  In this Housing (Amendment) Bill, after dealing with a continuance of certain powers in the 1932 Act, we get practically nothing at all about housing; information that would be of the utmost importance.  We got a statement from the Minister which was completely obscured by a long dissertation on tuberculosis.  Could we have a few words about housing?  The 1932 Housing Act provided for the making of grants, to provide assistance for private persons and public utility societies building houses in urban and rural areas.  That Act provided that the State would bear certain of the charges for houses built by local authorities in urban and rural districts. The Minister was rather anxious that discussion of this measure should relate only to the grants made to private persons building houses in rural districts.  It would be interesting if he concentrated on that.  The way to do so was to give some real information that would enlighten the House as to what house building by private persons is going on at present in rural districts, because if a study of what was going on were made, it would give the information we are looking for.  We might know something then about the present trend of house building and housing costs, as well as of the people who are anxious to build houses in rural districts, but who do not know <Col N="1483" /> how to face up to the difficulties concerning materials and costs.  They might also be able to learn something through the Minister, from information gathered by the Department, about the initiative of people building houses, if they can manage to do so.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us that under the 1932 Act something like 33,000 houses were built by private persons in rural areas, and that of these 5,000 were built since the 1st April, 1940.  I suggest to him that what we are really concerned to know is what is happening at the present time, and what happened during, say, the past two years. Can he tell us what the trends indicate with regard to the possibility of speeding up the building of houses in the years immediately in front of us?  The Minister's statement that 33,000 houses were built by private persons in rural areas under the 1932 Act, and that of these 5,000 were built since the 1st April, 1940, conveys nothing to us, because, of the 5,000 houses that were completed since the 1st April, 1940, some of them were a hang-over in the sense that the building of them had begun before the war, or at any rate in the early years of the war.  The fact that this measure is being introduced now suggests to me that there has been practically no building by private persons in rural areas during the last year or two, and that it has now tapered out to no building at all. It would help if the Minister would tell us how many houses were completed during the last 12 months, and how many were completed in the 12 months before that, and, further, if he could give us some idea of what the costs were to the people who were building houses during that particular time as well as the kind of houses that were being built.  The Minister could also help by giving some information about the 1932 Act under which grants were given to private persons to build houses in urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a substantial number of houses are now being built in rural areas, will the Minister say why something is not being done to encourage private persons to begin the building of houses in urban areas?  He must know that, in quite a number of urban areas, he <Col N="1484" /> has been pressing the local authorities to build houses.  Have we reached this position, that Government policy is that all houses built in future must be built by the local authorities?  If so, I want to ask the Minister why he is not reopening the policy of giving grants to private persons to build houses in urban districts.  The 1932 Act provided for the payment of certain loan charges in respect of houses built by local authorities in urban and rural districts.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Minister has been pressing the local authorities in urban districts to build houses.  Recently, he was pressing the Thurles Urban Council to build 62 houses.  The urban council considered that 72 houses should be built, and looked for a tender for the building of that number. Twelve of the houses are going to have a bathroom, and the all-in cost of each of the twelve houses is going to be £940.  The rent under present conditions is going to be 24/6.  As regards the remaining 60 houses, 30 of them are going to cost £731 each, and the other 30 £700 each, the respective rents being 19/1 and 17/1.  Again, I ask who are these houses being built for.</P>

      <P>I am asking one simple question with regard to private persons: why is the Minister not reintroducing the grant for private persons building in urban areas?  The original Act provided for such persons, and I am evidencing the fact that the Minister is pressing local authorities to build houses in urban districts.  My second question is this: is it the <Col N="1485" /> Government's policy to see that only local authorities will build houses in urban districts, and, if that is so, what class of persons are they building for? I ask that because, under the scheme that is being pressed by the Minister on the Thurles Urban Council and accepted by it, the rents are going to be 24/6, 19/1, and 17/1.  If we consider the attitude of the Department of Local Government in relation to the standard of wages paid to certain workers under the local authorities, I do not see how on earth any of these people are going to be able to pay such rents out of their wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have suggested to the Minister that there is a sufficient number of questions to be asked and answered, and that he will understand how irritating it is to us that a Bill like this should be introduced with nothing said about housing and so much said about tuberculosis.  I think that the question asked by other Deputies might be answered by the Minister: if the house with a bathroom in Thurles is going to cost £940, is the Minister going to subsidise the loan charges in respect of that house only up to a level of £350 or £400, or what is the level going to be, because we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that the cost of housing has substantially increased and that there is not any sign apparent that it is going to fall? In the case of Great Britain various items were recently taken under which the cost of houses was examined.  The various classes of materials used were taken, the extent of which the cost of them had increased and the extent to which the cost of the total house had increased.  It was found that a house costing £550 pre-war would now cost in or about £1,200.  When a comparison was made as between costs in 1938 and the present time it was found that the cost of materials had increased by something like 78 per cent. or 79 per cent.  I would like to feel that there was some recognition of that on the part of the Government here.  We feel that urban districts cannot have their housing problems properly considered by the local authorities.  They are being left in the dark as regards the Government's intentions in the matter <Col N="1486" /> of housing and its appreciation of the housing position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide additional assistance in the national campaign against tuberculosis.  I would be inclined to welcome it, but there are two features of the Bill which lead me to suspect that, though on the surface it appears to be such, in practice it is going to be the reverse.  Sub-section (3) says that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;where a county medical officer of health or medical superintendent officer of health certifies that a member of the household of a house situated in the area for which such officer acts is suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis for which he is undergoing treatment and that the existing accommodation of the house is inadequate for his proper segregation from the other members of the household,...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>he may do certain things.  I want to raise two points at once: one is whether this House is of opinion that the method of choice for treating pulmonary tuberculosis is treating it in the patient's household and, two, whether medical officers of health are to be restrained from authorising the erection of this additional room unless the tubercular condition from which the patient is suffering is pulmonary. To deal with pulmonary tuberculosis first, I understand that there are two classes into which that disease falls, one a very small class in which the probability of infection is remote; the other, the far largest class, in which the probability of infection is very great, and where segregation is eminently desirable.  In this latter class the proper place for a patient who would ordinarily seek the benefits of this Bill is in a properly equipped sanatorium where he can be relieved of all domestic worry, where he can receive the kind of nursing without which recovery from tuberculosis is very improbable, where he can have available to him, should the necessity arise, the surgical assistance that such a patient may from time to time stand in need of and, above all, where he can rest tranquil in the certain knowledge <Col N="1487" /> that the family dependent upon him has the wherewithal to live.</P>
    <P>If we are contemplating in this Bill the persons who are suffering from infectious tuberculosis, let us first consider parents of families.  Is it seriously suggested that it is a desirable thing to plant them down permanently in the midst of family anxieties that must surround an invalid parent and have them night and day worrying in their sick beds about whether the wife and children can keep going so long as they continue to lie there.  Surely the method of choice is to get such a person into a comfortable sanatorium and provide his family with a sum approximately equal to the average wages that man was earning before his illness smote him.  Is there any Deputy who seriously believes that if the father of a family is taken away from his wife and children and put either into this room or into a sanatorium and told that while he is there in that bed, getting extra nourishment, getting care and medical attention, his wife and children are to go hungry and ragged, if need be, there is any prospect whatever of the patient recovering?</P>
    <P>There is no use saying to me that such a one is entitled to draw national health insurance benefit, that such a one is entitled to avail of the social services.  Take a man earning £5 to £7 a week, who has been accustomed to send his boys to the Christian Brothers' school and his girls to a decent convent school, who has been accustomed to seeing his wife turned out neat and respectable when she went out on a social occasion or about her shopping, and give him a couple of pounds a week, he himself being an invalid and therefore an additional charge upon the family purse, and tell me, do you imagine that such a person will have the peace of mind which is conducive to the recovery of health, either in this room or in a sanatorium?</P>

What I am afraid of is this: that we are going to be told, when accommodation has been provided for perhaps one-half of the tubercular cases in this country, that the remainder must have recourse to the provisions of this Bill, that it is not practicable to provide sanatorium accommodation for all the people in the country suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis and that we need not get unduly worried about that inadequacy of sanatorium accommodation because <Col N="1489" /> those who cannot have accommodation in a sanatorium can fall back on the provisions of this Bill.  My submission, Sir, is that, if any such attitude is adopted by the Government, they are sentencing a large number of the population to death and they are definitely wasting every penny of the money they are going to spend on their larger sanatorium scheme in the country.</P>

Can he not conceive a situation arising in which a local authority would say: &ldquo;There are two ways of meeting the tuberculosis situation in our area of jurisdiction; we can either opt for sending the patients to the State sanatoria, with whatever charge that would bring on us, if that service is available, or we could opt to provide the accommodation designed under the Housing Act, 1945.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is a county medical officer of health in this country a person in whose absolute discretion the Minister would unreservedly trust in respect of somebody near and dear to him, if smitten with tuberculosis?  In the rarefied atmosphere of the Custom House and of this Chamber, we are sometimes inclined to think that, whereas, if one of our family were struck down, we would search Dublin for the best practitioner available, it is good enough to leave the wife of a labourer, or the labourer himself, in rural Ireland to the tender mercies of whomsoever happens to be for the time being medical officer of health for that county.  I do not want to do that.  I want to have open to the humblest individual in the State the same amenities&mdash;I mean that literally&mdash;that would be available to the Minister or to myself if one of our families were smitten with tuberculosis.  Does that sound unreasonable?  I do not think that it does.  I name no names but, were that disease to come on me or mine, I should go to a certain doctor in Dublin and try to get myself, or mine, into a certain sanatorium.  We ought to make available to the humblest creature down the country precisely the same resources which would be available to the Minister or myself.  When we were discussing this question of tuberculosis here recently, I think that that view was pretty generally held on all sides.  Does the Minister seriously say to me that, if pulmonary tuberculosis were to manifest itself in one of our families and we were put to election between treatment of the patient in our own homes or sending the patient to a sanatorium where we knew he would be well looked after night and day and have at hand facilities for the treatment of any development which might arise, we should do as is suggested here?  Suppose somebody said: &ldquo;There are two courses open; you may send the patient to a sanatorium or keep him at home&rdquo;, would we send for the county medical officer of health for his opinion?  In the case of certain counties, I would not.  I should take good care to have somebody else's opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county medical officers of health <Col N="1492" /> were not primarily chosen as tuberculosis officers in every case.  In a good many cases, they have been made to do that work.  It is no disrespect to them to say that their treatment of tuberculosis in many cases is not one on which I should care to depend.  I seriously apprehend that you may have the procedure envisaged in this Bill substituted, in some areas, for the plan which I understood to be accepted&mdash; the offer of sanatorium accommodation to every individual suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis who is prepared to avail of it.  If the Minister says to me that, whatever the inclinations of individual patients may be, side by side with this measure he adheres to his firm resolution to provide adequate sanatorium accommodation for every foreseeable case of tuberculosis, then I believe he acquits himself very largely of the dangers to which this Bill may give rise.  But I beg of the House seriously to dwell on this matter, because there is a very real danger.  I have known these types of chalets to be availed of and I have known the patients to die.  Of course, we all know that, in the best sanatorium in the world, patients will occasionally die.  It is extremely difficult in this House to discuss a measure of this kind, because we are confronted by the Minister, who is supported by his medical advisers and purports to speak with their advice, whereas we, laymen, on the various sides of the House, are endeavouring to deal with a highly technical problem without the benefit of advice of that kind.  I know enough of the problem to assert without fear of contradiction that, if we depart from our resolution to make provision in properly equipped sanatoria for every case of pulmonary tuberculosis that occurs in this country within the next 10 years, we shall sabotage the whole plan for combating that disease in the State.  Therefore, if this Bill is in any sense contemplated as a substitute for the full provision of sanatorium accommodation, it is a bad Bill.  If it is in addition to full sanatorium treatment for every case, it is a Bill on which I should like to have expert medical opinion before determining whether it should be supported or not.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1493" /> That brings me to the second point which I want to make.  Why does the Minister insert the word &ldquo;pulmonary&rdquo;?  It seems to me that, if this Bill were used in the right way, in the event of its becoming an Act, it should be much more used for non-pulmonary than for pulmonary tuberculosis.  As the Minister is aware, there is in this country virtually no provision in institutions for the treatment of bone tuberculosis.  If a boy of 17 or 20 years of age gets Pott's disease of the spine, there is no hospital, so far as I am aware, which is prepared to keep him until he is completely cured, which may be for a period of two years.  He will be brought to a surgical hospital and there, after a suitable waiting period, will be put into a surgical frame on which he may have to lie for upwards of 12 months while the healing process of the spine proceeds.  In many cases, the patient is returned to his people. The tuberculosis nurse, the tuberculosis medical officer and the local dispensary medical officer may call and advise on his treatment from time to time but, ordinarily, the nursing of that patient devolves upon his family. Those of us who are familiar with country houses are aware of the common practice of those houses&mdash;that one bedroom is devoted to the girls, another to the boys and the third to the father and mother.  Everybody must realise that the maintenance of a young person on a surgical frame for a protracted period in a bedroom used by two or three other members of the family becomes an acute inconvenience to the members of that family.  Why should we not permit a household, in cases where the local medical officer of health determines that any tubercular condition requires a greater measure of segregation than the house in question can afford, to avail of the provisions of this Bill and build an added room?  What is to be lost by taking out the word &ldquo;pulmonary&rdquo; in this case?  Will not every Deputy in the House familiar with rural conditions confirm what I say&mdash;that a person who has a protracted illness before him which requires his being confined to bed should, in fact, have a room to himself and not be thrust in with one or two <Col N="1494" /> other members of the family?  If the Bill is to go through I urge on the Minister to consider an amendment along those lines.  Before the Bill goes through, I want from the Minister a categorical assurance that there will be no diminution of the Government's resolve to provide sanatorium treatment in adequately equipped sanatoria for every case of pulmonary tuberculosis that manifests itself in this country for the next 10 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this Bill can be a big factor in the fight against tuberculosis.  We are all aware of cases where, owing to not being able to get proper treatment in the initial stages, the affected person has developed tuberculosis to an incurable degree and some other members of the family have become affected to a lesser extent.  There are many people who, if they could provide for the isolation of patients in their own homes, would be prepared to do so and at least keep the disease from getting so far advanced that it becomes incurable.  I think that this Bill, therefore, will be of great assistance in a number of cases.  Unfortunately sanatorium treatment cannot be provided for all those who desire to avail of it. In spite of all that can be done, it is not adequate to meet the requirements of people who may have to remain on the waiting list for years to come. Naturally this Bill can only deal with cases of patients who are in the earlier stages of the disease.  Consequently, to my mind, time is an essential factor if the Bill is to become fully effective.  Accordingly, I should like the Minister to take steps to see that when a case is discovered, there is no delay in certification and no delay in passing and sanctioning plans for these buildings.  Steps should also be taken to provide that priority will be given in the allocation of materials necessary for such buildings.  I think that some system of precedence for such cases is necessary.  Further, I think that the clause in the Bill which prohibits an increase in the valuation for seven years is a wise one, as the possibility of being made liable for extra rates might act as a deterrent to some <Col N="1495" /> people in taking the steps necessary to provide the additional room.  I heartily approve of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnSOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The first part of the Bill deals with the ordinary subject of housing.  This is not the Bill under which the big housing drive, which we anticipate, will be operated but the Minister has informed us that another Bill will be introduced to deal with that question.  That is all we can say on that aspect of the matter at the moment.  Section 3 provides that in certain cases assistance will be given to people suffering from tuberculosis towards the cost of adding a room to their houses.  It is further provided that a local authority will not be able to obtain any extra rates in respect of that building and that the Department of Finance will not be able to obtain any income-tax in respect of that room for a period of seven years. So far everything seems splendid and I am sure every Deputy will approve of the provisions of the Bill.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should consider the position in regard to the landlord of the premises.  Perhaps the Minister has already done so but, in case he has not, I suggest that this is a matter that will require the most careful consideration.</P>
      <P>As some Deputies are aware, in many cases the tenant of a house is precluded by the terms of the lease from putting up any additional building and very often there is a clause imposing a penal rent in the event of such a building being erected.  I think the Minister should take power to deal with that situation, either by making such provision inoperative in regard to a room built under this section or leaving it to the Minister to decide whether the landlord should have that authority or not.  There is another difficulty in regard to obtaining the consent of the local authority, particularly of the town planning authority.  Town planning authorities are most hostile to the addition of rooms to existing buildings. That aspect gives rise to considerable difficulty for people who want to erect an additional room.</P>

      <P>The introduction of this Bill will at least prove to the House that the Minister is awake to the seriousness of the situation.  The proposal to grant £100 towards the erection of an additional room so as to separate the healthy members of the family from the tubercular patient is a step in the right direction, but what I have more particularly in mind is the immediate treatment of existing cases. I have in mind five or six hundred persons who are on the waiting list for immediate attention in sanatoria and who have little or no chance of getting into any sanatorium at an early date. Under this proposal to provide £100 for the erection of additional rooms in patients' homes, it will probably take a year or two before the room is ready for the patient.  Again, the Minister, by giving them an empty room, is not providing them with tuberculosis treatment in their homes.  There is nothing in the Bill about nurses to visit the homes of T.B. patients.</P>

      <P>Almost before I stood up I could see that the Minister was getting ready to interrupt.  I sat down to allow him to interrupt at the very beginning, because those are his tactics at all times when I stand up to speak on any measure.  If he is trying to prevent me from making my case he is on the wrong track.  Even if he sneers at me&mdash;his Parliamentary Secretary is sneering with him now&mdash; when I speak on this serious problem, it does not affect me in the least.  I still say that there are hundreds of tuberculosis patients in this city waiting for beds and that this £100 per room could be better spent by giving it to hospitals which are anxious to improve their position, and letting them separate their tuberculosis patients from the medical and surgical cases that are in the one ward. That is the case I want to make.  I do not condemn the Bill.  The Minister was trying to misrepresent me when he said that.  I welcome this Bill.  I think it is a step in the right direction. I said I was glad that the Minister was awake to his responsibilities, and that the introduction of this Bill showed us that he was.  What I want to get at is that this £100 per room means that he is going to condemn a patient to stay in that room without nursing facilities, without medical attention, and without the food that is necessary in a sanatorium for the treatment of tuberculosis.</P>

The Minister is merely shoving his responsibilities <Col N="1500" /> on to other shoulders by introducing this Bill as if it were a complete remedy for tuberculosis.  I know the case of a tuberculosis patient who, only yesterday, was put out of a sanatorium because they could not do anything for him.  In cases like that the patients come home to die.  In another case, only yesterday, a girl patient wanted to get into a sanatorium, and it fell to my lot to tell the family that she could not be admitted, and would not be able to avail of the benefit of treatment there.  I want temporary accommodation to be found in some big buildings, on which the Minister could spend this £100,000 for the immediate benefit of the tuberculosis patients of to-day, and not the tuberculosis patients of five years from now.  He is making arrangements&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;to provide for the patients of four or five years from now and on that matter he is to be congratulated, but what I am anxious about are the unfortunate 2,000 or 3,000 people in this city to-day who are not being properly looked after, and for whom no accommodation is being found.  In common with other men in public life, I have met mothers who have said: &ldquo;For God's sake, will you give my daughter a chance by getting her into a sanatorium?&rdquo;  I have tried and failed.  I have done everything possible with the medical authorities to try to get beds for those patients. Only yesterday, as I have already said, a girl was refused admission to a sanatorium, and she had to go into a medical and surgical hospital.  They are putting her out this week, although she has nowhere to go.  In another case a man went into a sanatorium a month ago, and at the end of the month his unfortunate wife and family were told: &ldquo;Take him home; we can do nothing for him.&rdquo;  All I am asking is: for God's sake let them die in peace, and do not drive them out as they are being driven out of the hospitals and institutions to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At times I feel sorry for having to <Col N="1501" /> raise my voice in the House on account of the way the Minister tries to irritate me.  He is the only Minister who tries to do that when one endeavours to draw his attention to what is going on in the City of Dublin to-day.  There are a thousand people waiting for sanatorium treatment, and this Bill is going to put them into empty rooms, without nurses, without doctors, and without the dietary scale that is provided for tuberculosis patients.  I say there are a thousands of that kind in Dublin to-day, and I do appeal to the Minister to put this £100,000 or another £100,000 into some kind of temporary building, take a couple of hundred patients in, and pay a staff, and pay them heavily, to give those unfortunate people a chance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with much of what Deputy Dillon has said in this matter so far as the provision of extra rooms or chalets for tuberculosis patients is concerned.  I think it should definitely be the policy of the Minister and this House that sanatorium treatment should be offered to all tuberculosis patients.  We cannot hope to make a proper attack on the scourage of tuberculosis if we do not do that.  I feel that this provision might be very dangerous if sanatorium treatment is not offered.  It might serve a very useful purpose if a patient coming back after a course of treatment in a sanatorium is put into a room or chalet of this sort, but surely in the case of a patient even in the initial stages of tuberculosis it is essential to isolate that patient in the interests of the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Putting the patient in a room or a chalet outside will not ensure isolation.  As a matter of fact, I think that one definite advantage that a patient gets from being in a sanatorium is that he learns to understand himself; that he must take certain precautions and keep certain rules of life, and I fear that these precautions will not be taken if the patient is not sent to a sanatorium, in the first place, where he can get the advice of the best experts that we have.  We know that if a special room is not provided in a house for a member of the family who may be suffering <Col N="1502" /> from this disease, other members of that family&mdash;perhaps, young children, will be in and out of that room, and the utensils used by the patient will be used by the children and other members of the family; and the one thing that is essential, if we wish to save the rest of the family from the disease and to stop the spread of the disease through the whole family, is segregation.</P>
    <P>In that connection, if we are to take the Minister at his word, I presume that if you are going to treat certain patients and provide sufficient institutional accommodation for them in the home, there will be sufficient finances provided for the maintenance of the family.  However, I do not want to go into that, because I am sure that the necessary finances to maintain the family while the parent is in the institution will be provided, and I take it that the House is agreed that that should be so.  It seems to me that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister has already informed the House that that aspect of the problem is being considered, but I think that the Minister, when he is replying, should give an assurance to the House that it is the intention, when sufficient sanatoria are provided, that every individual in this country suffering from tuberculosis will be given the opportunity of proper sanatorium treatment and advice, that some provision will be made for the proper amounts of segregation from the other members of the family when the patient returns home, and that it will be made sure that the patient understands how he has to live and what rules he has to keep for, possibly, a year or two after he returns home.</P>
    <P>So far as the other part of the Bill &mdash;the part that provides for a grant&mdash; is concerned I want to say that I am very sorry that the Minister has not seen fit to alter the former provisions, in view of the circumstances in which we live and the increased cost of the building or reconstruction of houses.  I have always felt that the limitation of £25 valuation was far too low, and that a man living on a holding of slightly over that valuation, and who has a family, has a very hard struggle to exists.  Very often, in the case of <Col N="1503" /> such a man, when it is necessary to provide some increase in the allowance for his family, he finds himself unable to do so, and surely we ought to make some provision for such cases.  In the case of rural dwellers, at the present time, who are living in a house which requires reconstruction, we should take into consideration the increased cost that would be involved if such a person were to tackle a problem of that sort.  At the present moment, as the result of the emergency, the cost involved would be enormous, and, for that reason, I think the Minister should consider increasing the amount of those grants.</P>
    <P>The Minister might also consider the fact that in certain parts of the country the valuations of certain small holdings have been increased because the county councils have put a certain amount of turbary in these areas, and that has increased the cost, and I suppose that that might prevent such people from benefiting from any of the things that will occur in connection with this Bill.  That would be a very grave hardship on the people concerned, but, apart from that, I think that the provisions, generally, for assistance to individuals in connection with this Bill fall into the low categories so far as the valuation of agricultural holdings in this country is concerned, and that the amount of assistance provided is not sufficient. Accordingly, I think that the Minister should seriously consider raising the level of assistance and also increasing the valuation of holdings to which the grant would apply.  As regards the provision of a room or chalet, for which provision is made under Section 3 (1) (g), for the recoupment to the local authority of an amount not exceeding £100 or two-thirds of the grant, whichever is the less, it seems to me that that means throwing back on the local authority a very substantial burden by way of the raising of that money.  I feel, accordingly, that that will throw a great burden on the agricultural community because, after all, it is the agricultural community that subscribes a very substantial portion of the local rates, and I do not <Col N="1504" /> think it is fair to single out one portion of the community to bear the cost of this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It happens to be a very personal problem to those who are living in contact with the disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a State contribution and, therefore, the cost should fail on the taxpayers as a whole, but it would appear that, under this Bill, it is going to fall on one section of the community, and I do not think it is fair to single out one section of the community to bear the cost.  That has happened, not alone in connection with this particular Bill, but in connection with other measures also, and I do not see why one section of the community should be singled out to bear the cost. Again, I would point out to the Minister that since 1932 there has been a very large increase in costs of various materials, and that there will be new difficulties to be faced in the post-war period: that conditions which at that period were fairly good, are not now sufficient to meet costs in present circumstances.  I would ask the Minister to consider that point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I expected that every Deputy would have welcomed this Bill, and have had nothing but praise for it. I was really surprised to find that most of the Opposition Deputies, evidently unwilling to give the praise it merits, went outside the scope and intention of the Bill altogether.  When Deputy Dillon started to speak, I thought he was going to confine himself to the Bill, but he was not more than a few minutes going when he ran true to form and tried to represent this very excellent measure as a measure actually designed to retard the fight against tuberculosis.  He spoke as if this Bill meant the abolition altogether of senatorium treatment.  There is nothing in the Bill which would lead anyone to make that assertion.  I think it can only have been made with the usual intention of the particular Deputy to discredit anything that emanates from the Government.  Deputy Byrne very adroitly saved himself by saying that he welcomed the Bill, that it was a step in the right direction.  But immediately <Col N="1505" /> he went on to make capital and propaganda out of things completely unconcerned and unconnected with the Bill.  I think it is a most enlightened measure, and that when it is availed of by the local authorities and by the poor victims of this disease, it will be recognised as probably the biggest step that has been made in this fight against tuberculosis.</P>
      <P>It is a fact that you can have verified by tuberculosis specialists anywhere that hundreds of thousands of people have recovered from this disease in their own homes.  In the course of the previous campaign against tuberculosis, I remember its being stated that the majority of ordinary people have at some time in their lives been affected by tuberculosis.  There you have it clearly shown that people recover from it in their own homes.  There is a certain amount of comfort in the mere surroundings that a person has in his own home.  If things are even normally right, even in poor families I think that the comfort and companionship of his own people tend very much towards the recovery of the patient.</P>
      <P>I am absolutely in favour of sanatorium treatment and, if there was anything in this Bill to cut out sanatorium treatment, I would not vote for it, but I do not see anything in this Bill that would bring about that result.  Like Deputy Byrne and other members of the Dublin Corporation, I have seen people come home from sanatoria after having benefited by their treatment and have then seen them fall back again through overcrowding in their homes.  I think the provision of an extra room will do much to prevent that.  According to my reading of the measure this additional room will be of advantage to anyone undergoing treatment.  I presume that if a person is undergoing treatment in a sanatorium this room can be built and that he can come back into the better surroundings with a chance of observing the rules and regulations he has been taught in the sanatorium and that a complete recovery will be likely to accrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The valuation provisions are very generous and very necessary.  I think <Col N="1506" /> the Minister should be congratulated on every point in that particular section dealing with the tuberculosis problem.  The provision of a chalet is sometimes necessary because you may have a big enough house without any overcrowding but, on account, of the bad aspect, if the house is facing north or north-east, it would not be possible to add on to the house.  A distinct chalet or hut might be a better idea in that case.  Then, sometimes, you have a house facing due south but with higher buildings in front of it, so that if you built behind the house the windows would be facing north.  Therefore, you have to get a bit away from the house and I am very glad that the grant can be given towards the erection of a chalet or a hut.</P>
    <P>The provision that the borrowing powers of the local authorities are not to be restricted by reason of the fact that they may take advantage of this measure is an admirable one.  There is one possible abuse, however, that may arise when this comes into operation. From my experience as a councillor I know it is a possibility, and every other councillor I think will agree that it is a possibility that, when this extra room is put up, other beds than the bed for the T.B. patient will be put into that room.  Indeed, our corporation experience leads us to fear that there might be even a worse abuse because some people, if they get an additional room, will take in boarders or lodgers.  I hope that local authorities will keep a very strict watch to see that this additional room is maintained for the benefit and the cure of the tuberculosis patient and that it will not be otherwise used until the patient is completely cured.  I welcome the measure and I think the Minister should receive nothing but congratulations from all sides of the House.</P>

      <P>To continue about the provision with regard to tuberculosis which is in this Bill, I am trying to think of the machinery by which a room will be provided for a person who is suffering from tuberculosis.  I take it that it must be physically possible to put an addition to the house or cottage.  That would seem to rule out of consideration almost all the houses in Dublin and, I would imagine, a very large proportion of those in County Dublin.  Of course when you get down to the country it is another matter.  The Minister mentioned the possible provision of a chalet near the house.  Now, a chalet is usually made of timber, and I would hazard a guess that the amount of timber used in a one-roomed chalet would be equal probably to the timber which would be required for a workingman's dwelling of the present day.  Does the Minister envisage, any time in the next three or four years, having timber to spare?</P>

      <P>The Minister seems to be optimistic that these chalets can be put up of material other than timber. I make him a present of that idea: if they can, that is all right.  To continue on the idea of a person who is suffering from tuberculosis and who is going to get the advantage or the disadvantages&mdash;I hope it will not be the disadvantages&mdash;of this Bill, I am making this case this evening for the Minister's consideration.  The medical officer comes along and certifies that a patient who is receiving treatment ought to have this room provided. Now, I take it that the local authority would send along the surveyor and a plan or something like that would be prepared, together with an estimate of the cost, and that would be sent up to the Department.  Does the Minister imagine that that could be provided inside 12 months?  I suggest that 12 months is the very minimum, and quite conceivably the period would be longer.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister suggest that accommodation such as is mentioned in this Bill can be provided inside 12 months?  I would very much like that he should make an estimate for us as to the time it will take for this to be brought about.  The Minister has the advantage of the medical adviser next to him as to what stages might be gone through in a rapid consumption case in 12 months. The really fair way of dealing with this would be for the medical officer to be able to order that person into a sanatorium, to be brought back when the accommodation was provided. Otherwise, it will leave a whole lot of people believing that they are about to get an addition to a house for their treatment which, indeed, and in fact, will never be provided.  To my mind, that would be the acid test of the sincerity of this measure.  In other words, this Bill in certain instances conceivably can provide an advantageous way of treating the disease, possibly in its early stages; but I suggest that full sanatorium benefit should be provided until that accommodation is available, and that that <Col N="1510" /> should be at the discretion of the medical officer in charge of the case.</P>
      <P>Now, I will sit down and be very interested to hear the Minister's calculation as to what time he thinks would elapse between a medical officer saying that a patient should be provided with this accommodation and the patient going into the room that has been provided for him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>On last Wednesday, when Deputy Byrne's motion was under discussion, I advocated that there should be a Department of Housing established.  The reason I <Col N="1513" /> advocated that was that we have at the present time a Minister for Local Government and Public Health and that Minister has two Parlimentary Secretaries.  I think it would be very wise, in view of the need for houses and the importance of the housing question, if one of those Parliamentary Secretaries would devote his whole time to housing.</P>
      <P>Last week, when I was speaking on this subject, I was dealing with the types of houses that have been built. Deputy Burke of County Dublin sang the praises of the Government for the marvellous houses that have been erected since 1932.  We must admit that a very forward step was taken so far as housing is concerned.  There were a good many houses built and a lot of the slums were demolished. While we are aware of all that, we are also aware that in large towns and in the cities, as Deputy Byrne pointed out, slums still exist.  In the interests of public health additional houses are necessary.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne pointed to the numerous requests he has had from residents in Dublin City, newly-married people who are unable to find accommodation here.  I know from experience, and I am sure every country Deputy has had the same experience, that the housing shortage is so serious that it is a hindrance to young people who are anxious to get married.  We know the consequences that follow from that. Deputy Mulcahy pointed out in the House certain important things.  If I took his statement correctly, he said there is a housing scheme being formulated for Thurles and the rents of the houses there will be 24/6, 19/1, and 17/1.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely no Minister for Public Health or for Housing could expect an ordinary working man, an agricultural labourer, to pay 24/6 per <Col N="1514" /> week for a house?  Would not that mean the best part of his week's wages gone?  Let us take the tuberculosis patient we hear so much talk about.  The Roscommon County Council unanimously agreed, with the full consent of the county manager, that in all cases where there are tuberculosis holders of labourers' cottages the council would be prepared to let them have those houses free.  The Leix County Council adopted a similar resolution and we also had the full sympathy of the county manager.  The matter was placed before the Department of Local Government and, while the Minister, in the House, extends his deepest sympathy to those who have tuberculosis, he refused to sanction the proposals from the Roscommon and Leix County Councils.  In cases where the tenant&mdash;either the father or the mother&mdash;was suffering from tuberculosis, the council agreed to give such tenants a free cottage, but the Minister refuses to sanction that.  I think that that is most unfair.  We cannot blame the county councils and we cannot say that in these cases they were lacking in their duty to those suffering from tuberculosis.  The Minister, in refusing their suggestions, was not acting in accordance with Christian principles and he was not acting as if he was sympathetic towards tuberculosis patients.</P>
      <P>When I was speaking on this subject of housing before, I was dealing with the types of houses that are being built in my constituency.  I cannot speak for any places outside my constituency. The schemes in my area are giving anything but satisfaction.  Most of the housing schemes in my constituency have been, I am sorry to say, failures. Deputies residing in the Leix-Offaly constituency received letters this morning from the Clara Cottage Tenants' Improvement Association.  I am very pleased to have an opportunity of placing before the Minister the position of housing in the town of Clara, where a new scheme was tried out recently.  The letter to each Deputy for Leix-Offaly says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;At a meeting of the above, held on Sunday, representing 144 families on the new housing scheme at Clara, <Col N="1515" /> County Offaly, I was instructed to write to the five T.D.s for Leix-Offaly and respectfully request them to visit Clara on Sunday, 16th December, at 2 p.m., to meet a deputation of the tenants, and to be fully informed and to see for themselves a housing scheme that was started and never completed, and that ranks as one of the worst schemes and most congested schemes in the country.  This scheme cost thousands of pounds, and the houses are only 18 months occupied, and we are told by the county manager that it will take £13,000 more to carry out the improvements we have suggested.  We have been in direct contact with the county manager, county engineers, and the council officials, and we have held protest meetings, and the local clergy have expressed their views, as well as the management of the jute mills in Clara, and still no progress has been made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then follows the portion I want to impress on the Minister:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is no fencing of the cottage plots; no out-offices of any kind have been erected; no public lighting of the scheme.  The roads through the scheme are in a deplorable state of repair.  There are no fireplaces in two of the rooms, and it is impossible for anyone to sleep in these rooms during the winter time.  The walls have been completely cracked; the chimneys are smoking; and the ranges&mdash;not grates&mdash;are giving entire dissatisfaction to the tenants concerned.  We ask you and the other public representatives to come to Clara and to be fully informed of the position that exists in the so-called up-to-date and modern housing scheme of the present Government. Scarcely a week passes but one of those houses becomes vacant, as people would take a house anywhere &mdash;even in the county home&mdash;in order to get out of them.  This shows clearly that something is wrong with our present-day modern houses.  It has often been said that the T.D.s only visit Clara during election times. You are therefore earnestly requested <Col N="1516" /> to oblige us by your presence on this very important matter on Sunday, 16th.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those are the types of letters which are coming from constituents in connection with present-day housing schemes.</P>
    <P>I pointed out here last Wednesday night that it is a deplorable state of affairs that, in 1945, we have a Local Government Department and engineers who call themselves capable and competent to carry out a housing scheme for working-class people and who provide not gateways or entrances except the front door, through which the working man can gain access to his house.  I pointed out that these agricultural labourers and working-class people are obliged, under penalty of having their cottages compulsorily acquired from them by the county manager, to sow, their allotments. Every cottier who has an allotment on a housing scheme in my constituency must take the manure for his allotment in the front door, through the kitchen and out the backdoor to the garden. Surely such a state of affairs should not exist in an up-to-date and modern housing scheme.  In the town of Edenderry, this position exists.  There is a scheme of houses there with no rear entrances whatever.  The tenants protested and made a request to the county manager for Offaly at the time for the erection of gateways or entrances so that they could get in with carts or creels of turf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with Edenderry which I did deal with before.  The Minister was asked to intervene and he refused, with the result that notices to quit were served on the tenants.  The Cole case came off and the justice decided against the council.  There would have been no need for the huge expense incurred if the Minister had intervened at the request of the county manager and if gates had been erected.  Now we have reached the stage when the courts have decided against the county council, with the result that not alone in Edenderry but in every place in <Col N="1517" /> which these housing schemes have been operated the tenants will be knocking down walls and they will have the law and the courts behind them in doing so.</P>
      <P>The principal point and the last point which I want to raise is in connection with old age pensioners.  We all know that it is impossible for an old age pensioner in receipt of 10/- per week to pay anything like 4/6 or 5/- a week for one of these houses and some special arrangement should be made for old age pensioners in that connection.  Some scheme should be introduced whereby an old age pensioner will get one of these houses for half the rent which the ordinary citizen pays and some special consideration will also have to be given to the case of widows and home assistance recipients, because very little has been done for that class of people so far as housing is concerned.  It was all very fine to erect these houses and to put these people into them, but, when they got in, they found themselves unable to pay the rent, with the result that we had nothing but evictions and scenes which were not very pleasant.</P>
      <P>I fully agree that something should be done with regard to this matter of housing and I suggest furthermore that there should be some central fund for the purpose of financing housing. In certain counties, it is impossible for large schemes of houses to be carried out in areas in which they are needed, simply because the councils do not want to undertake the task on account of the increase in the rates.  There should be a central housing fund and houses should be built from State funds and not levied on the rates.  It is most essential, in the interest of public health, that some steps be taken to relieve the present housing shortage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>In rising to support this motion, I should like to say that nobody on this side, and, I think, nobody in any part of the House, would suggest that the Government are not most anxious to solve the housing problem.  I do not think there is anybody in the House who would speak against it.  How is it that we have not solved this problem long ago, because <Col N="1518" /> there has been a housing shortage which has grown more and more acute in recent years?  We have unfortunately had a six years' lull, because, in spite of some of the speakers' references to satisfactory progress being made in view of the times, nobody would suggest that housing has been going full blast for the last six years. Unfortunately, housing is a very complicated problem.  One imagines that it will never be solved until it is put into various compartments, each one being attacked with methods somewhat different from those used in other sections.  We have the problem of uneconomic dwellings which has resulted in the corporation and, in the last resort the Government and some philanthropic associations, being practically the only bodies now providing houses for the working classes.  The question of building houses as an investment and letting them at a profit is at an end.  I am afraid it is very doubtful if we will see it in any very modified form in the years to come. I should like to reproach the Government for, in a matter so important and so complicated, not having had more frequent debates.  I think debates on the housing question are somewhat like the meetings of the three witches in <i>Macbeth,</i> and are accompanied by almost the same sounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am speaking about Dublin City and County, although I am aware that there are housing problems in other parts of Ireland.  But I suggest they are less acute elsewhere, and that if a solution can be found in the capital city, it can be applied to the rest of the country.  Up to a short time ago, certainly until the outbreak of war, a very important question was that of sites.  I think the Minister told us that they had about 6,000 sites ready.  I suggest that that statement must be taken with a certain amount of reservation.  We have the amenities and facilities in Dublin, main roads, sewers, gas, water and electric light, but we have not got the sites.  Outside Dublin, sites are available but there are no amenities.  These are questions that the Government will have to take up very seriously.  Another thing which has complicated the housing problem, <Col N="1519" /> and for which the Government are certainly not to blame, concerns the question of building in the centre of the city.  I remember one industrialist saying to me, apropos of a discussion as to whether houses were to be put up in the centre of the city or on the outskirts, that industry should leave the city and leave the ground for houses.  Of course, that was only a joke, but it serves to illustrate the fact, that there is a great temptation to say that we have to house the workers in the centre of the city, close to their employment, quite forgetting that there is probably a scramble going on in the centre of the city at the present time between industry and housing.</P>
    <P>I doubt if sufficient attention has been given as to how the problem grew up.  Going back a thousand years or more, the Danes might be blamed. Later the blame might be put down to the fact that this was a walled city, and after that a military city or that wars were going on.  That brings us down to the present day.  No effort was really made up to the present to ascertain how the working classes were to be housed.  I suggest that it was only in the last century that anybody began to think of building houses for the working classes as such, either as a philanthropic duty or as a profitable investment.  What happened was that houses in this city underwent progressive alteration, something like what happens to a suit of clothes that an individual buys, which does duty for one section of the community for a time and then is passed on until it is absolutely unusable.  Houses are like that.  Houses which were put up, perhaps a couple of hundred years ago, by very wealthy people, or possibly as warehouses, have passed through a precarious existence, during which they have degenerated, first into apartment houses, then into lodging houses, and finally into tenements.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt about this, that the supply of better-class houses has begun to give out in this city.  That has complicated the present situation. We have now reached a position when there are numbers of dangerous and insanitary buildings in this city, but <Col N="1520" /> the local authorities cannot enforce the by-laws because the housing shortage has become so dreadfully acute.  One hears stories&mdash;I do not know whether they are true or not&mdash;of tenement houses, where rooms are quartered out and let at 5/- a corner to single people. That only serves to illustrate the tremendous shortage of houses at the present time.</P>
    <P>I have already said that building has ceased to be an investment.  It has become a social service.  I imagine that we are still arguing about principles that ought to have been settled generations ago.  I was very much struck by some of the remarks made by previous speakers. Remember, we are dealing with a time when almost any house that can be provided is useful as a solution towards the problem, and when any savings that local authorities can make on their housing estates is all to the good.  Deputy Flanagan is not in the House at the moment, but I want to refer to an incident that he dealt with.  He was referring to a man who, I take it, is probably an agricultural labourer.  This man was either being put into a new house or was in possession of it.  He offered the local authority £1 a week, I think, if they would allow him to put in a window in the house and make a sort of huxter's shop of part of his dwelling.  I suggest to the Minister that questions of that kind are worthy of some consideration. I suppose the Minister will answer me by saying, possibly very properly, that the local authorities are building working-class dwellings, and, therefore, could not allow a shop to be maintained in that area.  What would be the attitude of a private landlord if such a suggestion were made to him? Would he not jump at it and say: &ldquo;Here is a house that is about to be taken out of the category of being a loss to the rest of the community, and I am most anxious that there should be as small a loss as possible on our housing estate; therefore, I will allow this man to start a shop because, by doing so we will make a profit on it.&rdquo; I want to be perfectly fair to the Minister and say that there may be some reason why that could not be <Col N="1521" /> done in the case of a local authority house.  If it is merely a question of the law relating to housing, I would like to remind the Minister of a certain king engaged in battle who is reported to have said: &ldquo;Curse the laws that deprive me of such soldiers.&rdquo;  In this case the Minister ought to say: &ldquo;Curse the laws that prevent me from carrying out that transaction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was also struck by some of the instances that Deputy Byrne gave in the course of his speech.  I am not going to deal with them in detail. What some of his complaints amounted to was this: that people were being put out of corporation dwellings because they had taken in as residents some relatives, people who, I suppose, were outside the degree of affinity permitted by the corporation by-laws. I may be asked where does that get us?  It is relevant in the sense that there is a very acute housing problem which is admitted by everybody.  The corporation, and a number of societies which have taken up the burden, are trying to provide as many houses as possible, and to make their pound go as far as it can.  The question is: why does it not go far enough?  Because they have got all the skimmed milk. The corporation are letting houses, for the most part, at uneconomic rents, while on the other side you have people, with dangerous, insanitary dwellings getting the highest possible rents, who probably would say: &ldquo;Well, if you pull down these houses you will have to provide the tenants with alternative accommodation; we cannot do anything; we will just continue to draw our rents.&rdquo;  There is a great shortage of houses, and some tenants are being charged rents that they should not be charged at all.</P>
    <P>What is the solution for that, or is there any solution?  I am afraid there is no cut-and-dried solution: that you cannot just wave a wand and say that the housing problem will disappear over-night if the corporation will do this, that or the other.  I suggest to the Minister that there is one avenue through which, possibly, some progress could be made.  It is not ideal by any means, but, curiously enough, it is along the lines from which the Department has mainly kept <Col N="1522" /> away.  It is a curious fact, borne out, I believe, by medical authorities, that you can put human beings together to a most extraordinary extent so long as they are warm and fairly well fed.  Of course, if you huddle a lot of human beings together in insanitary conditions, with disease prevailing, they will die like flies.  As I have said, there is a most serious shortage of houses, and I do not think the building trade is going to solve the problem in the next few years.  Even granted that everything goes smoothly, it will take a number of years to make any very appreciable progress towards a solution of the problem.  I suggest to the Minister that his Department might absolutely reverse its policy as regards sub-letting of corporation dwellings: that it should allow sub-letting at an increased rent for a limited period to approved tenants.  I do not suggest that is the ideal way or, if the problem were not as bad as it is, that it should be undertaken at all.</P>
    <P>But what you would have is a selection of the people who really ought to be housed and the people whom we are anxious to house.  The corporation would incur a smaller loss on their dwellings, unsound and insanitary houses could be pulled down, and there would be an indication as to the probable trend of the density of population, when it took a free movement, that is, when people were in a position to move as they wished.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should seriously consider that position.  It is the only way I can see that offers any immediate prospect of even a trifling betterment of the present acute difficulty.  It would bring the time nearer when houses that are not fit for human habitation could be removed and, possibly, sound ones put in their place.  I do not know what the Minister thinks of that suggestion.  I do not know what the members of the corporation who are present here this evening would think of it.  There is no doubt about it that a number of the people to whom I have referred are very anxious to take in relatives and, possibly, friends, which they are not allowed to do at present under the <Col N="1523" /> corporation by-laws.  There would be a system of selection.  The landlord would be living in the house and, presumably, would not take into that house anybody with whom he could not live in friendliness and who was not similar in outlook and standard of living.  I make that suggestion to the Minister for what it is worth and when he is replying I hope he will indicate whether or not he thinks there is anything in the idea.  It is put forward in all sincerity as being, possibly, the only way in which you can make any assault on the problem at the present moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wholeheartedly support this motion which seeks to deal with a very difficult problem.  In so far as it suggests the appointment of another Minister, however, I am not too enthusiastic about it.  I think we have nearly Minister enough and that what we really want is not so much an increase in the quantity of Ministers as an improvement in quality.  I certainly would very much object to having the Minister for Local Government duplicated.  This motion goes further than to suggest the appointment of another Minister.  It suggests that more houses, and cheaper houses, be provided.  That is the kernel of the motion.  That is the kernel of the problem that we are trying to face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the first considerations that arise in connection with the cost of houses to the tenants or to the State is the financing of any housing scheme that we propose.  I am of the opinion, as I have expressed in the past, that the State should not borrow money for the purpose of building houses.  With financial reform, it is possible to provide whatever capital is required for house building, without imposing upon the taxpayer, the ratepayer and the tenant a burden of interest charge. Until we decide to face the problem in that way and recognise the fact that a house built for a family in this country is as valuable an asset and as good security for the issue of currency as gold, we will not be dealing with the problem in the best possible way. What capital is required for the building <Col N="1524" /> of houses to solve this problem can be provided by the State issuing the currency on the security of the housing scheme initiated.  In that way a large portion of the rent charges upon the incoming tenant and a large portion of the cost to the taxpayer can be eliminated.</P>
    <P>There are other problems and other difficulties which add to the cost of building.  There is the problem created by the fact that such a large section of our population&mdash;one-seventh&mdash;are crowded into an area roughly surrounding Nelson's Pillar.  In the crowding of such a large section of our population into that small area, it is inevitable that problems of engineering and increased cost should arise.  I think that matter was referred to by Deputy Dockrell and by others.  It may be suggested that the problem can be relieved by inducing or even compelling, industry to move out from the centre of the City of Dublin.  At any rate, a beginning should be made to encourage new industries that are in course of establishment to build outside the city area and thereby not only guard against adding to the congestion in the city area, but ensure that future housing schemes will grow up in the areas of the newly-established industries.</P>
    <P>In this, what is known as the atomic age, it is undesirable to have such a large percentage of the population of the State crowded into a comparatively small area in the City of Dublin.  It is a deplorable thing, on travelling through the country, to see in every remote country district, the ruins of farmhouses and of agricultural workers' cottages which were in existence 50, 60 or 70 years ago, but which have been abandoned.  There are areas in country parishes where there was a substantial population but which are now denuded while the city continues to grow by leaps and bounds.  I think it would be necessary eventually to move out into the country not only many of the industries which are crowded into the city but also the entire administrative services.  I do not see why the Civil Service should be crowded into the city, adding to the congestion which exists.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1525" /> This motion seeks to meet the problem of the ordinary, poorer workers&mdash; the people of small income who cannot afford to pay more than 4/- or 5/- a week for their housing accommodation. We shall never deal effectively with the problem until we reduce, firstly, the cost of financing housing, and, secondly, the cost of building materials of every kind.  There must be a drastic reduction of all costs.  We must try to standardise and to bring down costs to the minimum by adopting the most efficient and up-to-date methods of building.  Reference has been made to several problems arising out of the shortage of houses.  Deputy Dockrell referred to the problem of the sub-letting of houses by tenants.  I am strongly of opinion that no tenant with a family should be encouraged or allowed to sublet a house provided for him by the State.  The houses provided by the State are mainly working-class houses, designed for the accommodation of a family.  It would be completely wrong to permit sub-letting of portion of those houses and thus create overcrowding of the family.  There are, and always will be, in housing schemes by local authorities a number of houses occupied by widowers, single persons and aged couples, the members of whose family have gone to live elsewhere.  Those people would have some accommodation to spare and it might be of advantage to themselves to sublet portion of their houses.  I think that they should not be debarred from doing so.  In addition to that, provision should, I think, be made in future housing schemes for single persons, widowers and old couples.  They should be provided for, as well as married couples with families.  At present, no provision is, I think, made in any of our housing schemes for old couples or single persons who have no houses of their own.  It should be possible to build a smaller type of house suited to such persons and to build it in such a way that it would be suited to the needs of such people.  In that way, a certain saving could be effected.  These houses would be cheaper to erect and, if erected, single persons and old couples would not be crowding the houses ordinarily required for families.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1526" /> Another matter which should give concern in connection with this housing problem is the persistent demolition of large houses in the country areas.  How those houses could be used to relieve the housing shortage may not be apparent at the moment, but, recently, the Minister for Home Affairs or the Minister for Housing in Great Britain referred to the desirability of providing flats in country areas for the housing of working-class families. Eventually, it may be possible to utilise those big houses in country districts in some scheme of housing or in some other way.  It is sheer vandalism to demolish them merely because there is a temporary shortage of building materials.  In most cases, the material obtained in this way is unsuitable for the provision of houses for working people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the difficulties of public bodies is to erect houses for which tenants can pay an economic rent.  I am connected with Irish trade unions which are prepared to lend a very considerable sum of money to public bodies at a cheaper rate of interest than those bodies are now paying for the purpose of building houses for the working classes.  Under the Trustee Act, trade unions are not allowed to invest money in the loans of public bodies, because they are not regarded as a trustee security.  These Irish trade unions have a large sum of money at their disposal and they are prepared to lend that money at a lower rate of interest than that at which the banks are lending money to <Col N="1527" /> the local authorities.  Therefore I appeal to the Minister to have the loans of local authorities scheduled as trustee securities so as to enable the trade unions to advance money to them.  I have been asked by one trade union to mention the matter to the Minister with a view to seeing if anything can be done.  The money would be lent to the local authorities on condition that the local authorities would pass on the advantage derived from the lower rate of interest to the tenants.  The tenants would then be paying an economic rent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw attention to the wording of this motion by Deputy Byrne who, we all know, has great experience in this connection and is very interested in the working-class people of Dublin.  I should like to remind the House that this is not a Dublin problem, nor is it an all-Ireland problem; it is a world problem and a problem which has been intensified as a result of the past six years of devastation.  Deputy Byrne has worded his motion as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Eireann is of opinion that a Minister for Housing should be immediately appointed to take urgent action to increase the supply of houses, especially in urban areas, and to finance, in conjunction with local authorities, schemes whereby rents may be fixed at figures which necessitous tenants can afford to pay.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Byrne knows the law as well as I do.  I, as the representative of a local authority which has had some responsibility for housing schemes, know very well that there is nothing to prevent any local body from going ahead with any scheme for which they get a tender.  That is an incontrovertible fact and why any Deputy should seek to whip a willing horse is beyond my comprehension.  I have yet to hear any Deputy make the charge that the Department of Local Government has deliberately delayed or prevented any housing scheme submitted to it.  I, as a representative of one local body, and my colleague, Deputy Coburn, as the representative of a sister town in the <Col N="1528" /> same constituency, are well aware that any schemes submitted by us to the Department of Local Government have been accepted and sanctioned within a reasonable time.  Where the &ldquo;grouse&rdquo; comes in in connection with this motion passes my comprehension.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat amazed last Wednesday evening to hear a very prominent Front Bench Fine Gael Deputy charge the Local Government Department&mdash;I cannot infer that it was the Dublin Corporation he charged&mdash;with bias in the distribution of houses.  That was a very astonishing statement.  I know the law; other Deputies who are representatives of local bodies know the law also, and the conditions governing applications for houses under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts are very specifically laid down.  It is very plainly laid down that the largest family living in the worst circumstances is to get priority, apart from cases where tuberculosis has been certified. I have heard no Deputy make the statement since the debate commenced that that rule has not been lived up to, except Deputy Costello.  It is all the more surprising to me, seeing that he is one of the leading legal luminaries of this country, that he has made that charge against the Local Government Department.  I cannot understand it.  It is certainly not paying any compliment to the Dublin City Manager if such has been allowed to happen.  In the absence of any proof, I believe that such has not happened. Deputy Costello has made that charge, and I think, in justice to the people in the Local Government Department, he should be called upon to prove it.  I have had some 12 or 14 years' experience of negotiations with the Local Government Department, and I want here and now to pay my tribute to the higher officials at the Local Government Department.  On every occasion that we prepared plans and specifications, selected sites and submitted them to that Department, we always got sanction in a reasonable time.  I am not, as I said, in agreement with the motion for these reasons.  If the Local Government Department were convicted of delay, there would be something to be said for it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell seems to be of <Col N="1529" /> opinion that public bodies who erect houses, financed out of public moneys, should give permission to tenants to start in business in opposition to people who establish their own businesses out of their own capital.  I do not think that would be right, even if these tenants were to pay economic rents.  It is public money that has provided the expenditure.  At least as far as our town is concerned, in all our housing schemes we leave available a particular site in a favourable situation and we offer anybody who comes along a lease to enable him to erect his own business premises on that site.  I do not think there could be any better system in the City of Dublin and I think it is splendidly administered by the Local Government Department.</P>
    <P>Again I want to draw the attention of the Dáil to the question of the provision of houses.  A good deal has been said here this evening about having social services&mdash;sewerage, water, gas, electric light, roads, etc.&mdash; extended to areas where there were no building sites.  That is the responsibility of the local authorities' officials and not the responsibility of the Local Government Department.  Deputies who speak in this way are putting the boot on the wrong foot.  If they are spending public money on extending social services where they have not got building sites, it should not be tolerated by the local authorities.  At least that is the attitude we take in regard to these matters.  Taken on the whole, if we look over the past 22 years of native government, from 1922 to 1932, during the administration of the Fine Gael Government, 29,000 houses were built.  The Fianna Fáil Government from 1932 to 1939 or 1940 built 130,000 houses.  There you have 100,000 more houses provided in a very much shorter space of time by the Fianna Fáil Government and, mind you, provided at a time when it was very difficult to provide them.  From 1932 back to 1922, houses could be provided in this country for at least one-third of the cost which they entailed from 1932 onwards.  I should like Deputy Byrne, when he is replying, as I presume he will, to tell us why the Fine Gael Government of which he was a member&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think, after the very cogent speech to which we have listened from Deputy Walsh, that it is necessary for me to say very much.  What I intend to do is to remind the House of the terms of the motion.  The motion asks that, for reasons stated therein, the Dáil should declare that a Minister for Housing should be immediately appointed.  In the whole course of his speech, the mover of the motion, Deputy Byrne, never once addressed himself to the kernel of his motion. He talked in and out and round about it and made many statements, some of which have been controverted by Deputy Walsh and all of which could be proven conclusively to be without foundation.  Never once did he advance a single argument to justify his demand that a Ministry of Housing should be established.  The Deputy is one of those who on occasion complain of the high cost of living, the high level of taxation, of the increasing size&mdash;I suppose if it were Deputy Mulcahy or Deputy Dillon was speaking he would use the term &ldquo;bureaucracy&rdquo;&mdash;of the increasing size of bureaucracy in this country.  Yet here is the Deputy, a member I think of the Dublin Corporation, which has very full powers, as Deputy Walsh has shown, in relation to housing, coming in here and asking us to adopt a motion which would <Col N="1531" /> increase the size of the Government, because you cannot have a Ministry for Housing without having a Minister for Housing; which would considerably increase the number of civil servants; which would undoubtedly add its quota to an increase in taxation, and thereby tend to increase the cost of living and make it harder for the poor, for whom the Deputy on occasions professes so much sympathy, to live, and he has not said one word to justify that demand of his.  It is typical of the thoughtless insincerity with which the Deputy puts forward propositions in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy, however, was not only insincere in this motion but he was wise in his speech.  He was wise in evading the issue which he had posed to the House, wise in avoiding any reference to the question of the establishment of a Ministry of Housing, wise in failing to adduce any arguments in support of his motion, because it could have been shown conclusively that, so far from assisting in providing houses for the people, the consequence of the establishment of an independent Ministry would probably be to slow up the rate of progress.  In this country practically every local authority can do everything for itself that a Minister for Housing could do. It can determine how many houses are required.  It can, within limits, determine the type of house that is going to be built.  It can make its own arrangements to acquire sites, armed with special powers in that regard by the Government.  It can plan those houses, lay out the sites for those houses, provide sanitary services for those houses, and in doing all this it is going to be generously supported by the Government.  It is going to be generously supported by the Government, I have said, but it would be more correct to say that it has been and will be generously supported by this Government, because, as Deputy Walsh has taken occasion to remind the House, before the Fianna Fáil Government came in, before this Administration came into being, before this Fianna Fáil Party, of which Deputy Byrne has been such a consistent <Col N="1532" /> and unscrupulous opponent, came into power, during the whole period when the Deputy who has put down this motion, and who has wept crocodile tears here to-night in this Chamber ostensibly on behalf of the poor, was the city boss here, during the time when he was running his own Party in the Dublin Corporation, during the period which reached its culmination in the election of 1934 when he asked the ratepayers of this city to return men on the sole ground that they were friends of Deputy Alfred Byrne, during the whole of that period from 1922 to 1933, and until we were able to shake his dead hand off the services in this city, only about 5,000 houses were built.  In the period after we got rid of his dead hand, from 1934 to the present year, during those 12 years of which six covered the period of the Emergency, almost 14,000 houses were built here in the City of Dublin. That is the Deputy who can come in here and pretend that we have been in any way negligent or slow or unhelpful in trying to solve the housing problem for the citizens of Dublin.  I leave him to the House with the contempt he deserves.</P>

      <P>I will not delay the House five minutes with my reply. Every member who spoke, including the Minister, has made my case.  If ever a motion was justified by the speech of a Minister, the motion that I put down which led to the discussion on the failure to provide houses for the people of the country has been justified by the Minister who has just sat down&mdash;justified by his venom.  The venom that he uses on election platforms he brought into this House.  I am quite happy that my motion, because of the indignation it aroused in him, has had the desired effect; that from this moment onward there will be a speeding up of housing; that the newly-weds, who have been tramping from morning to night looking for rooms in this city, and in Rathmines, the Minister's own constituency, and the people in the basement dwellings which are flooded by burst sewers, the people in the old houses which have long outlived their usefulness, will have some provision made for them.  I am <Col N="1533" /> satisfied that all that will go.  I am satisfied that the Minister will have to live up to his speech to-night, and will have to see to it that all that will go, and that those newly-weds and those people who are tramping from morning to night, with their children in their arms, looking for rooms, and being asked for £1 a week for basement dwellings in the City of Dublin, and those families of six or eight living in one room, on poor law relief, getting no extras for the high rents demanded from them, and who are running from place to place, will be housed soon, as well as the soldiers who are being evicted from the married quarters in the barracks and being sent to the Dublin workhouse.  We often heard of Lord Clanricarde's battering rams, but what has the Minister's Government done with the married quarters, with the men whose time has expired, and who have no place to go, and who are coming to Deputy Dockrell and Deputy Martin O'Sullivan and Deputy Butler asking them &ldquo;for God's sake get us a room somewhere; they are going to throw us out to-morrow?&rdquo; These are the people I am pleading for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister was roused to make the speech he did make, and to talk to me about insincerity and what I did in the Dublin Corporation.  I was nine years Lord Mayor.  When I started first, the output of houses was very low, but in my ninth year I had brought the building of houses in this little city of ours to 2,700 in 1939.  Unfortunately, when I resigned and my successor came in, the war broke out, and crash went our whole building programme.  We were aiming at 3,000 houses a year.  That was what we were borrowing our money for, and to-day the Government is giving only the same grant for the building of cottages as they gave when they were only £400 a cottage. To-day they are £750 a cottage and the grants from the so-called benevolent Government are the same as they were at that period.  That is the reason why I put down this motion. That is the reason why I feel a very happy man in this House to-night, because I have been able to rouse the Minister to make his venomous attack <Col N="1534" /> about my insincerity on this motion. Call it what you like, you will never stop me.  You can insult and abuse me, but, if you think you are going to stop me from doing the work I came in here to do, I want to tell you that you are just playing into my hands, because the more venom you throw at me the better for me.</P>

      <P>Strange to say, he is the only Minister in this House who tries that stuff on me but, as I said before, he only plays into my hands. Eight Deputies in this House are members of the Dublin Corporation, and morning, noon and night people are at our doors pleading with us to try to get them a house.  I did not put down this motion from motives of hostility to the Minister, but merely to try to get things done.  In my opening remarks, I praised the Minister and I praised the City Manager and the officials of the Dublin Corporation.  There is no better man for the job than our present City Manager&mdash;nobody could be better&mdash;but I actually saw a woman coming to the Housing Department of the Dublin Corporation with a bag of rates in her hand, and she said that these rats had run over her children. I mentioned that before, and now I mention the place known as Glorney's Buildings, also Willett's Place, and the Gloucester Diamond, but just because I try to transfer to the Minister's mind the thoughts of these people&mdash;and I do it in the humblest way that I can&mdash;the Minister talks about my insincerity, but backed up by only a few of his colleagues.  His colleagues have been tolerant with me, as they were in the early days of 1916.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned the case of Corporal Ward who, in 1913, recruited a number of the people on the opposite bench for the I.R.A.: who served through the War of Independence and afterwards joined the National Army in 1922, and yet was put out of his house and had no place to go except the union.  That is the type of person I am speaking of. Then there is the case of people who come out of the Army.  Their pensions are not fixed until they leave the married <Col N="1535" /> quarters, and their rent for the married quarters was increased to 14/- a week.  When such a man gets his gratuity&mdash;whatever it may be&mdash;the 14/- a week will be deducted from it, and that means that at the end of three, four or six months he will be calling on Deputy Butler, Deputy Dockrell, Deputy Martin O'Sullivan, Alderman Doyle or myself, asking us to get him a room, and in the meantime his pension is withheld, or it is not fixed at any rate, and he has no place to go.  We all know that anyone who does apply for a room will have to pay at least £1 a week for a room in the City of Dublin.  Yet, the Minister charges me with insincerity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I do not want to go into that.  My only purpose in putting down this motion was to ask the Minister to provide sites.  As Councillor James Larkin pointed out to the chairman of our housing committee a few days ago&mdash;and he is a man who has done great work for the city&mdash;in a few years the ratepayers of Dublin will be faced with something like £1,000,000 for this.  How long is the burden to be borne by us?  I say that housing is not a local problem, but a national problem.  What is the cause of Dublin being in the state in which it is to-day?  The &ldquo;blitz&rdquo; in London did not do to that city the damage that age has done to our old buildings and tenements in the City of Dublin. Yet we still have the tramp going on from the land to the City of Dublin. These people who come to Dublin because they cannot get a decent living on the land come here in the hope that they will get work here and decent accommodation.  During the war the outlet was the British Passport Office in Merrion Square, and that was the goal they faced.  That does not exist now, and these people are remaining in Dublin.  The Government should not allow one area to be torn down until another is provided.  I put down this motion, helped by Deputy Anthony, for just that one purpose.  I do not care whether a Minister <Col N="1536" /> for Housing is appointed or not, but I do hope that one of the Minister's.  Parliamentary Secretaries as, I think, Deputy Flanagan or some other Deputy suggested, or some of the existing staff in the Minister's Department, should be placed in an office and given sole charge of housing, and should be in a position to give directions to the county managers all over the country, as well as to our own city manager, in this matter of housing. That is why I put down the motion.  I do ask the House to believe me that I did it sincerely and with the best intentions.  As I have said, in my opening remarks I praised the Minister, but I did say that I could produce about a thousand letters received by the housing department of the Dublin Corporation from people who were living in rotten tenements and were looking for decent accommodation, the replies to which were in the general terms that owing to the number of people who were living in these rotten tenements, and the necessity for tearing them down and providing alternative accommodation, the applications of these people could not be entertained for some time.</P>
