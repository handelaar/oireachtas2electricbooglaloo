      <P>If the Deputy is referring to tyres and tubes for motor cars used by those engaged in the services mentioned I would refer him to replies I gave in the Dáil on 23rd February, 1944, and 21st March, 1945, to previous questions regarding tyre supplies.</P>
      <P>The Irish Dunlop Company have available from time to time limited supplies of inner tubes for light motor vehicles and are authorised to supply these for vehicles engaged on essential services where it is established that the existing tubes cannot be repaired.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has in mind cycle tyres and tubes I would refer him to my replies of 31st January and 3rd May, 1945, and on earlier dates, to previous questions regarding the distribution of these articles.  As indicated in those replies, it would be quite impracticable to differentiate between the many and varied classes of persons requiring bicycles for essential purposes or to give preference in the distribution of tyres and tubes to any particular class.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing last night with the allegations made by Deputy Dillon regarding the work in infants' schools.  I should like to say that, in so far as the charge that they lose time and that progress is retarded if they are taught through Irish is concerned, experience does not confirm that there is very much substance in that contention. There is very little formal teaching in infants' classes.  Infants learn through their own activities and through the materials with which every infants' school is equipped.  In fact, the basic principle of the work in infants' schools may be described as providing occupations suitable to the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Referring to nursery training recently, an English writer said that it is planned to secure an acquaintance with the behaviour and properties of objects and to develop, through play and conversation, the ability to talk intelligently about what can be done with them and is an essential preliminary to all subsequent mental <Col N="454" /> development.  In short, knowledge gained through description has no sure foundation unless it is based upon knowledge gained by first-hand acquaintance with the world of objects and events.  Even for those who are taught through English, the major portion of the teaching is concerned with language training and, apart from language, very little else is done save a little training in numbers.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted now by educational experts that there should be no formal teaching of arithmetic or reading before the mental age of six and a half years.  The modern practice is to base the work in the infants' department on the experiences and activities of the children and to equip the infants' schools and classes with materials designed to develop and enrich those experiences and activities to the greatest extent possible.  The picture of a class of infants was drawn by Deputy Dillon, in whom, one may observe, the traditional eloquence of Irish Parliamentary life has not died out and is occasionally reinforced by a rather powerful, if not excessive, flight of imagination.  According to the Deputy, it is quite usual to have a class of infants sitting passively in the benches while the teacher lectures to them in a language they do not know. He lectures to them in a semi-university fashion, I presume.  This, of course, is purely a caricature of what might happen under a competent teacher or in any properly conducted infant class.</P>
    <P>In actual fact, the pupils in the infant classes are employed continually. How are they employed continually? They play and, as I have emphasised to the Dáil on a previous occasion, creative play is one of the chief instruments for language training. In addition, they draw in chalk; they model things in a variety of materials; they sing songs and rhymes and listen to and try to reproduce little anecdotes.  All these activities are based on, and intimately connected with, the pictures, charts, objects and materials which are there before their eyes in the schoolroom.</P>
    <P>In the matter of language it must be remembered that the teacher knows both Irish and English.  It is entirely <Col N="455" /> wrong, and a misrepresentation of the position, to suggest that an embargo is placed on the speaking of English from the very moment the pupil enters the infant class.  In the very early stages the work must be to a large extent bilingual, with a gradual increase in the extent to which Irish is used until, after a certain time, all the work can be done through the medium of Irish.  No praise is too great for the skilful, sympathetic and judicious manner in which the vast majority of the teachers handle this gradual transition from English to Irish and, instead of the use of Irish resulting in unhappiness and retardation, it is an incontrovertible fact that the infant classes taught through Irish are amongst the happiest and most successful in the country.</P>
    <P>I wish Deputies who find fault with the teaching of the infant classes would visit some of these classes.  I think they would find, in the same way as those pupils who have completed their entire secondary course through the medium of Irish have proven that, so far as a knowledge of English is concerned, far from being behind their companions who have done the work through English, they are at least equal to them, that there is no loss whatever so far as the knowledge of English gained by the children who have passed through all-Irish infant classes is concerned, and that the intellect of the child has probably been improved by reason of the fact that he is given special tuition of this kind at a very early age.</P>
    <P>As regards the school-leaving age, I have explained to the House that, pending the receipt of the report from the commission which is inquiring into youth unemployment, it is unlikely that the Government will make a decision upon the question of raising the school-leaving age.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, later on.  The <Col N="456" /> policy of my Department is to extend the facilities for the provision of continuation education until such facilities will be available to all children between 14 and 16 years.  We have been working on a programme in order to extend these facilities in the borough and urban areas and we have, as the House knows, introduced compulsory part-time continuation education in some of the borough areas.  I have discussed the matter with the Dublin City Vocational Education Committee and their difficulty, whether we regard the immediate object of providing part-time continuation education, at least, for pupils between these ages or whole-time compulsory education eventually, is that they are unable to provide accommodation at present for the pupils who are willing to attend the courses run by them voluntarily.  There is not nearly sufficient accommodation.  The population of this city has grown greatly in recent years and the school accommodation has not grown with it.  There is, of course, a building programme there but, like school buildings programmes generally, it must wait until materials are available and then will have to take its place in the order of priorities which the Government may find necessary to establish.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the attendance at vocational education schools.  I think that the attendance is quite good.  In fact, as I have said, there is not sufficient room to accommodate all comers in Dublin and I dare say the same is true of some of the other large centres.  In the rural areas, however, there has been a certain falling off, due to emergency conditions.  The only cure is that the attendance, whether it be of a part-time or a whole-time character, be made compulsory.  That is a point which I shall deal with later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer now to the statement made more than once during the debate, that more than 80 per cent. of our young people cease to attend school and finish their education at the age of 14.  The statement is inaccurate and misleading as, in fact, nearly half the young persons between 14 and 16 years of age are in attendance at <Col N="457" /> school.  Possibly the inaccuracy is due to making the comparison of the number of children in attendance at national schools with the numbers in attendance at secondary and technical schools.  Such a comparison gives a misleading result, since the national school course extends over eight or nine years, whereas the secondary school course extends over four or five years and the technical school course over two or three years.  In the circumstances, even if all our young people continued their education at secondary or technical schools, the total number attending those schools would be less than half the number in attendance at national schools.</P>
    <P>In order to get a correct idea of the proportion of school pupils who continue their education after the age of 14, the simplest and most convenient plan is to compare the total number of young persons between certain age limits with the numbers between the same age limits who are in attendance at school.  In view of the suggestion that the age for attendance at school should be raised to 16, it may be of interest to indicate what proportion of our young people between 14 and 16 is already in attendance at school at the present time.  According to a calculation based on the 1936 census returns, the number of young persons between these age limits may be taken as 108,000.  The total number of pupils between the same age limits in attendance at school is 50,629.</P>
    <P>A calculation, therefore, shows that 46.9 per cent. of all young persons between 14 and 16 are at present receiving education at school.  Of course, I do not claim, nor do I wish it to be deduced from those figures, that the 46.9 per cent. attend up to the age of 16 or for the whole time.  All we know is that, at a particular date, that proportion of the children was in attendance at the schools.  It is an average, and it is very probable that the proportion who attend up to the age of 15 is greater and the proportion between 15 and 16 is less.  As I am on that point, may I say that, of the remaining 57,000 for whom suitable courses have yet to be provided or who should be in attendance at such <Col N="458" /> courses, it is estimated that there may be as many as 33,000 in employment of one kind or another and that the remaining 25,000 may be described, perhaps, as &ldquo;not being gainfully occupied&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Very many Deputies have addressed themselves to the question of teachers' salaries and I think I should correct some possible misconceptions that may arise from the case that has been stated.  It is not correct to say that there were salary cuts between 1923 and 1934.  What happened was that certain fees and gratuities were abolished, but at no time did the whole body of teachers share in those fees and the salary scales as such were not touched in any way between those years.  It has also been stated that the 1934 reduction amounted to 9 per cent. This leaves out of consideration the 4 per cent. for pensions purposes, which was always a charge on the teacher; so that the 1934 cut was really one of 5 per cent. and the net reduction on the 1920 scale was 15 per cent., not 20 per cent. as stated.  If Deputy Butler's figure of 14 per cent. is the figure of 15 per cent. which I have given, there is not so much difference between us, but whether it be 14 or 15 per cent. that is not the end of the story, as the 5 per cent. cut of 1934 was restored in 1938.  Moreover, when the latest addition to the emergency bonus, the 1/- a week, is slightingly referred to, it must be remembered that this 1/- is in addition to a previous 10/ &mdash;or 8/ for women&mdash;and put in that way it does not sound quite so insignificant.</P>
    <P>I have met the teachers on this question and the Taoiseach has met them.  The situation has been fully explained to them and I believe that the Government attitude is well understood. It ought to be understood also in this House.  With the object of preventing or retarding a wholesale inflation in prices, the Government made a standstill Order in May, 1941, applicable to employees generally and prohibiting any increase in the scales of salary or wages.  To grant an increase in basic pay in present circumstances to the national teachers, or to any other class would, in the Government's view, <Col N="459" /> be tantamount to abandoning the policy implemented by the standstill Order.  It must be quite clear that an increase in basic pay given to one class of employees would certainly create demands for similar concessions for other classes.  It will be conceded, I think, that an increase in one case or to one class would certainly create the impression that the standstill policy had been abandoned by the Government and would have serious reactions which the Government wishes to avoid.</P>
    <P>There has been reference to discrimination against the teachers. There has been no discrimination and I think that charge would not be made by those who understand what has happened in the case of other public servants, with whom this demand has been associated and who have been dragged into the issue.  The position of national teachers is quite different from that of civil servants and other classes of public servants in the matter of remuneration.  The national teachers' salary scale is a fixed one and is not variable according to the cost of living.  On the other hand, civil servants and other specified classes of public servants&mdash;for example, teachers employed under vocational education committees &mdash; serve under conditions of employment which provide that their remuneration is based partly on a fixed salary scale and partly on a variable cost-of-living bonus.  In accordance with the action taken in July, 1940, regarding the stabilisation of bonus these classes of public servants ceased to receive any increase in the rate of cost-of-living bonuses as from that date, with the result that when the standstill Order of general application came into operation in May, 1941, civil servants and others similarly treated had already been deprived for the intervening period of the increased cost-of-living bonus to which they would otherwise have been entitled.  The recent adjustment in their case of cost-of-living bonus merely purports, therefore, to place them in the same position as general outside employees in May, 1941.  That is to say that, as from that date onwards, they can receive no further increase in rate of <Col N="460" /> remuneration other than the special emergency bonuses which might be sanctioned for all classes of employees, both those in the public service and those in private employment.  Furthermore, the award was not retrospective and takes effect only as from the 1st January of the present year.</P>
    <P>The increases in cost-of-living bonus to civil servants, vocational teachers and so on, are not, accordingly, violations of the Government policy that salaries and wages, as such, should not be raised.  The Gárdaí come into the same category because, under a commitment made to them by the last Government in 1924, certain adjustments in their pay had to be made following changes in the cost-of-living figure and, accordingly, the Government had no option but to give to the Gárdaí the adjustments appropriate to that commitment and in line with those which were given to the civil servants and other classes to which I have just referred.  In the circumstances, therefore, it will be understood why the Government have had to take the view that the standstill Order precludes their granting an increase in teachers' scales of remuneration at the present time.  This is not to say that when the Government decides that the emergency conditions have passed it may not be possible to reconsider the question of teachers' remuneration and, if conditions appear to warrant it, to recast their scales of salaries.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of the payment of substitutes by teachers absent from school owing to illness, this matter has been under active consideration and I am not without hope that a measure of relief will be granted to teachers in respect of this matter in the near future.  With regard to the question of sick leave, in the past year a concession has been introduced in the sick leave regulations, which allows payment of salary to be made, on certain conditions, and provided that a substitute is employed, up to a maximum of 18 months instead of 12 months as heretofore.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy has quoted from the annual report for 1941 regarding certain difficulties said to be in Irish and English in the higher classes in the <Col N="461" /> primary schools.  This year he quoted the same extract and expressed surprise that no reference was made in the 1942-43 report to remedying these defects.  I do not think there is any justification for the conclusion the Deputy has drawn, apparently, that because there has been no such reference nothing has been done to remedy them.  If that is his conclusion, he is mistaken.  Those defects and any others that are found by the inspectors are being dealt with by them as part of the ordinary routine of their work. The report from which he quoted was compiled from reports sent in by inspectors from all over the country. It is the duty of the inspectors to do their utmost to have such defects remedied as promptly as possible after they become aware of them, and the fact that there is no reference in the 1942-43 report to this matter means that steps have been taken for remedying the defects and that there is no further need, for the time being at any rate, to bring the matter to the notice of the Department.</P>

      <P>As regards the question of school buildings, to which reference has been made by a great many Deputies, we have to congratulate ourselves that all through the emergency a certain amount of building work has been going on.  Last year, for example, the Minister for Finance sanctioned £220,000 in respect of grants towards the cost of the erection and improvement of national school buildings.  In addition, supplemental grants were made in connection with the completion of schools in slum clearance areas in Dublin, and a total of £17,000 was spent on this work.  This must be added to the £220,000.  The total expenditure represented work in the erection of 35 new schools, large schemes for the enlargement and improvement of five schools, and the <Col N="462" /> execution of works of improvement needed to 213 existing school buildings, inclusive of 59 cases in which schools required to be put in a serviceable condition pending their replacement by new buildings.  Supplemental grants were also allowed in 222 cases, based in each instance on a recommendation made by the Commissioners of Public Works.  The House knows that a scale of priority is being laid down in connection with building.  We have submitted our programme&mdash;a long-term programme for a period of years&mdash;and wherever managers are energetic and anxious to get on with the work, all I can say is that I shall do everything possible to facilitate and assist them in having their building projects brought to fruition.  I am aware of the case to which the Dublin Deputies referred, where a school is being carried on in the crypt of an old church.  A scheme for a new school in this area is engaging the active attention of my Department.  I am hopeful that we shall be able to overcome the difficulties and proceed with the erection of a new school at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of sanitation, to which Deputy O'Higgins referred, is bound up with the problem of the construction and reconstruction of school buildings.  In the meantime, everything possible is being done with the means at our disposal to deal with the more serious and urgent cases which arise.  As regards the question of hygiene in the schools, I hope that it may be found possible to give short talks and instruction in matters affecting hygiene and the health and physical welfare of school children.  If we secure the co-operation of the teachers, and I am sure that that will be forthcoming, it would serve a very great need, and I am rather glad that attention has been called to the matter. I think the time is opportune and that it would be a very necessary and, indeed, essential step.  At the same time, the teachers have a great deal of other work to carry on.  They have to satisfy the inspectors of their competence and efficiency in the ordinary school subjects, and one does not care to ask them to take on additional work, even of the special importance <Col N="463" /> of hygiene.  However, it ought to be possible to do a certain amount by way of weekly chats or short lessons, and I think that it is, as I have mentioned, very necessary.</P>
    <P>As regards the heating of schools, I am sure that most city and urban dwellers will have realised that it was difficult to arrange for adequate heating during the winter months.  This was particularly the case in respect of buildings with central heating installations, the furnaces of which were designed for a special type of fuel that was not available during the emergency. By arrangement, however, with the Minister for Supplies, managers of national schools in Dublin and elsewhere were granted permits during the summer months to lay in a stock of the fuel that was available, so that there would be a reasonable supply of such fuel as was available for the purpose of heating during the winter months.  I should like to add that I shall have a circular sent to managers to call their attention again to the necessity for providing reserves of fuel for the coming winter since, as present indications go, there is no proof whatever&mdash;in fact, it is unlikely &mdash;that there will be any improvement or any increase in coal supplies.  Might I say also that managers, during the exceptionally cold spell last January, were authorised to use their own discretion in the matter of closing the schools?</P>
    <P>Reference was made by Deputy Mulcahy to the question of large classes. I dealt pretty fully with this question in the previous year and my remarks will be found in volume 87, column 725, of the Official Reports.  I outlined there the present staffing arrangements in these schools and the difficulties of coping with the situation at present.  The problem of unduly large classes has been examined further in the light of present conditions.  It has been found that in some cases the condition exists throughout the year but that in others it is seasonal, in the spring and early summer.  Although there has been a considerable improvement during the last few years, a complete solution cannot be found until the necessary school accommodation <Col N="464" /> is provided.  That is the substance of the problem and there can be no proper solution until extra classrooms are available.  We are trying to see if the problem can be mitigated and if there are not constructional difficulties, if the buildings lend themselves to it, we have tried to provide extra teachers and to reorganise the classes.</P>

      <P>I do not think we got sufficiently stable ones to enable us to use them for schools.  The school children might not be quite satisfied with the accommodation which is provided for the Army.  I do not know whether the Deputy would care to see his children provided for in this way, but I certainly think that his is the kind of statement which does not lead one to believe that he is very responsible in some of his statements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the Deputy particulars, but possibly he does not wish to pay any attention to them, of the amount of building done. He knows, or ought to know, that in the case of some of the large convent or other schools where this problem is serious, in the Marlborough Street parish and adjoining areas, there is the problem of providing accommodation for the children until the new schools are provided and there is the problem of providing sites for the new schools. Quite possibly the situation will only be dealt with by a system of decanting by which the constructional work and the school work will go on at the same time in the same premises.  About half the schools throughout the country in which this problem exists are capitation convents and monasteries and in no two schools do we find the same problem.  The difficulties vary according to the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ua Donnchadha raised a question regarding men as sole teachers in mixed schools and it might be no harm to mention that normally <Col N="465" /> a man teacher is not recognised as a principal in a school if the average does not exceed 35, but there are a number of cases where, although the average was more than 35 when the man was appointed, the position now, due to falling averages, is that the attendance is below that figure.  If it does not fall below 30, a junior assistant mistress can be continued on the full junior assistant mistress salary and she may be continued under Rule 109 (2) even when the average falls below 30 at a reduced salary of £85 plus 5 per cent. per annum, if she was appointed to the school before January, 1921.  If she were appointed after that date, she must be guaranteed £93 plus 5 per cent. per annum by the manager, of which the Department will pay a fixed sum of £65 per annum plus 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>An outgoing woman teacher in a mixed school under a master may be replaced under Rule 109 (3) by a junior assistant mistress and paid at the rate of £85 plus 5 per cent. per annum, if the principal was appointed before January, 1921.  The case in which a man teacher is the sole teacher arises therefore where either the manager refuses to give the guarantee required by the rule or the average is so small that two teachers would not be justified. In some of these cases local arrangements are made for instruction in needlework, etc., for girls.  The Department usually tries, where a man is the only teacher, to arrange with the manager for his transfer to another school, but there is no rule to this effect, and in any event it is not always feasible.  I think these are the main points which were raised in connection with primary education.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne and other Deputies mentioned the question of school books.  The fact that the provision this year is reduced does not mean that it would not have been increased if it were found necessary to increase it.  It means that there is no change in the conditions upon which the grant is paid, and the explanation, therefore, of the reduction is that the amount required is estimated to be less than was previously needed.</P>
    <P>Speaking of the large school question <Col N="466" /> mentioned by Deputy Butler, may I say that in these large schools at Crumlin we have subdivisions within the same large building.  They have been designed so that separate schools can be carried on.  In Crumlin girls, I find there are seven schools and in Crumlin boys, four schools.  Each school of these separate schools has its own principal teacher and staff and it is often the case that a teacher goes ahead and continues in the same class from the infants class during the whole school period.  Of course, these large schools are a direct result of the situation to which the Deputy referred&mdash; that we had huge building schemes in Crumlin and the only possible way to deal with the situation was to provide accommodation in the quickest possible time.  It was not provided as rapidly as it should have been, but eventually it was provided.</P>
    <P>I am in entire agreement with the Deputy as to the necessity for giving preference to small schools, but until better arrangements are made&mdash;and I hope arrangements will be better in the future&mdash;to build the schools at the same time as the houses, and to have smaller schools than those we have built in the Crumlin and Drimnagh areas, for example, we shall only have to put up with the situation.  The Department of Education is in touch with the Housing Department of the corporation about its future plans, and I hope that, with the collaboration of the ecclesiastical authorities, in any future schemes better arrangements will be made.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to continuation education in rural areas and made certain criticisms of the vocational education system.  It should be remembered that this branch is under the immediate control and administration of local committees. These committees are not appointed by me or my Department, but by the responsible authorities, that is to say the county or the urban councils. The members of these committees include farmers, businessmen, teachers, tradesmen and so on.  They should be regarded as representing the views of the local community and of knowing the wishes of the parents of the young <Col N="467" /> people for whom they provide education. If a committee carries out the statutory duties imposed upon it, the policy of my Department is to interfere as little as possible in its actions, and I am glad to be in a position to say that, in general, vocational education committees discharge their duties in a satisfactory manner. There are 38 of these committees.  The system has been in operation for almost 15 years, and I think it is a matter for congratulation that, during that time, no serious difficulty has arisen between the Department of Education and any vocational education committee.  This, I think, as I have said, is due to the fact that the committees on the whole take their responsibilities seriously, and try to give the people the best possible services for the money which they expend.  Of course, Deputy Corry is not correct when he states that most of the cost of technical and vocational education comes from the ratepayers. It is true that the local rates bear a substantial portion of the cost, but that portion is about two-fifths of the total.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the question of the training of apprentices and the provision of better facilities for technical education.  It has been stated, and there is a good deal of truth in the observation, that this is not an industrial community.  We have certain industries concentrated, generally, in the larger centres of population.  We have also the position that only a small number of bodies engaged in industry have made definite arrangements with vocational education authorities regarding apprenticeship training.  These include the Electricity Supply Board, the Great Southern Railways, the Dublin printing trade, and Guinness's, but outside these there are really no groups sufficiently representative and sufficiently interested in the training of their apprentices to take such joint action.  I might say that the Irish motor traders have recently brought in a scheme by which portion of the apprenticeship period of apprentices to that trade throughout the whole country will be spent in the local <Col N="468" /> vocational schools, but we have not nearly enough of this type of co-operation with industries outside.  Industrial and commercial concerns do not specify their educational requirements. They do not go to the vocational education committee, or to the headmasters, and tell them what exactly they need, so that only a small proportion of the training given under the committees' schemes is formally associated with apprenticeship regulation. The Department is endeavouring to meet the difficulties of the situation and has issued its views in memorandum V.40 in which Deputies will find detailed instructions as to the methods which might be devised to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>I may say that, in all cases where educational requirements have been specified and guarantees of employment given, corresponding courses have been organised by vocational education committees.  In all industrial centres the available school accommodation is heavily taxed by the attendances at both the pre-employment and post-employment courses. We have given particulars in the Department's annual reports from 1934 to 1938 of the training which is given in local technical schools to assist in the establishment of new industries and the maintenance of existing ones.  This assistance includes the training of apprentices for such industries as boot-making in a number of schools, pottery, the woollen industry in various schools, tanneries, and so on. In some instances, where it was necessary to send workers out of the country for training such as in the case of aluminium works at Nenagh, this was done.  Deputy Corry mentioned in particular the training of apprentices for the sugar factories.  A well organised scheme for the training of apprentices for this industry was introduced in 1934 and has been in operation since.  The Deputy, or anybody else interested, will find the particulars in pages 60-62 of the Department's report for the year 1933-34. As regard the Cobh Steel Mills, and other Cork industries, I have no doubt that it should be possible for those in charge of these industries to make arrangements with the local vocational <Col N="469" /> education committees for the training of apprentices.  It is part of the duty of these committees to do this, and as the two committees concerned, both the borough committee and the county committee, are efficient bodies, there should be no serious difficulty about making the necessary arrangements.</P>
    <P>I mentioned in my opening statement that during the session 1943-44 765 students from the schools of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee were placed in employment in trades, dressmaking, factory work, catering and commercial occupations. The Cork City Technical Institute is also a very efficient body, and I find that a certain amount of employment has also been provided for its students. The most recent report of the committee that I have got states that it has always been part of their policy to try to provide employment for the pupils attending the schools.  That has been the general policy with headmasters and chief executive officers. The Cork report for the academic year ending on the 31st August, 1944, dealing with student employment says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;During the year it is satisfactory to record that employment was obtained for 74 students of the school of commerce and domestic science in addition to those who secured posts by competetive examination.  Students of the technical institute, to the number of 112, obtained posts during the same period.  Of that number, the industrial courses provided an avenue of employment for 49 girls.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>says the chief executive officer&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that particular care is taken by the principals to ensure that the posts offered to our students are suitable to their attainments, and that the work is not of a blind alley or non-progressive nature.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All that the principals can do is to assist the parents of the young people to secure suitable employment for them.  They cannot, in the nature of things, guarantee such employment.  I do not know why parents, whose children attend vocational schools, should expect to be guaranteed employment for them any more than <Col N="470" /> the parents of students attending other educational institutions should expect it.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that there has been a demand, as far as I can understand the trend of some Deputies' remarks, particularly the remarks made by farmers' representatives, that there should be an extension of continuation education in the rural areas.  Deputy Everett also spoke on this question.  I should like to remind Deputies again that the matter of making the best use of the teaching power at their disposal is entirely one for the local committees.  I think that the committees should be guided by the experienced and trained opinion of their chief executive officers.  At all events, it is only natural that there should be demands to have facilities spread out as much as possible in the particular areas and I am sure the executive officers try to do this.  The fact is that the attendance at a great many of the vocational schools in the towns includes a large proportion of country pupils.  That has to be taken into consideration. Deputy Cogan seemed to suggest that those who follow courses and, apparently, derive some benefit from them, leave the areas in which they attended the schools and get employment elsewhere.  He seemed to find fault with this practice and also because those who would benefit, perhaps, more from the courses do not attend them.  There is only one solution for that position.  I do not know whether or not Deputies from rural areas fully realise the implications of that solution.  It would seem to me that the solution is that these courses should be made compulsory.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that I interpreted Deputy Murphy rightly, but I gathered that he felt that parents were dissatisfied with the courses and, in particular, with the commercial course. There has been a good deal of criticism regarding the commercial course. The fact is, as we are occasionally reminded, that parents have their rights and if parents obstinately refuse to send their children to particular courses, or even to send them to the schools at all, as has happened. <Col N="471" /> what is to be done?  If parents refuse to send their children to courses of which rural science is a part and prefer to have commercial courses; if they say to the headmaster, as they often do: &ldquo;If you are not willing to provide a commercial course for my child, whom I intend to send into clerical employment, I shall have to send him, or her, to a private commercial school or to a school in some neighbouring town where they will get those facilities&rdquo;, what is to be the reply?  The matter is not quite simple and the best way to look at it is from the point of view of what we would be likely to do ourselves if the children were our own. Only a certain proportion of the children can ultimately find a living on the land.  We are all anxious that as many as possible should find a living on the land but we know that, in the ordinary household in the country, a strenuous effort is being made to prepare the children for employment which may not be obtainable locally. Employment may be only obtainable elsewhere and it is entirely for the local educational committees to distribute their courses and the teachers at their disposal so as to secure the best results.  I do not see how the economic factor or the wishes of parents can be entirely ignored.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick referred to the cost of the vocational schools while Deputy Giles spoke of &ldquo;huge buildings&rdquo; in County Meath.  I have not seen any of those buildings in County Meath.  I think that they exist only in the Deputy's imagination.  Deputy Blowick is Leader of a Party and one would expect him, as one would expect Deputy Cogan, to make some investigation into this question before referring to it.  Most Deputies, I think, understand the position and there has not been much reference to it.  But there has been a certain amount of propaganda about the &ldquo;expensive and elaborate buildings&rdquo; which have been put up.  I should like to ask Deputies to cast their minds back to the situation which existed before 1930. Where were technical classes, generally, being carried on then?  Were they not being carried on in inadequate rooms and in very unsuitable <Col N="472" /> places?  After the passing of the Act, we set out to provide suitable accommodation&mdash;and not alone to provide the buildings but to equip them in such a manner that the education which is now being demanded, and which will be demanded, I venture to say, to a greater extent in the future in the urban areas, if not in all the rural areas, could be provided.  Those buildings were not elaborate.  They were simple and straightforward in design.  It may have been that they were attractive from the outside.  So far as cost was concerned, I can assure the House that they were not uneconomic. If their appearance would lead to the conclusion that we had been extravagant, that would be a wrong conclusion.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, these schools were built at comparatively low cost, the reason being that the plans were carefully scrutinised in the Department and that everything possible was done to cut out what was not absolutely necessary.  The lay-out was made as simple as possible and the design as ingenious as the joint powers of the architects, the chief executive officers and the Department's inspectors could make it.  Taken as a whole, I think I can claim that the buildings have been economic.  These classrooms had to be prepared for cookery, metalwork and woodwork, or all three, and they had to be specially equipped.  The number of each class is much smaller than in a national school.  Therefore, from the point of view of classroom equipment and accommodation, one cannot compare cost in the vocational school with that in the neighbouring national school, which may house the same number of pupils.  When we take those factors into consideration, we must admit that the buildings were not as expensive as they were represented to be.  My belief is that those committees which went ahead and built before the war will have reason to congratulate themselves.</P>
    <P>Those committees&mdash;if there are any such&mdash;which had not made provision for continuation education in their areas, so as to give the maximum facilities within the limits of their <Col N="473" /> resources, will find that they will have a heavy burden to bear in the future. I find that, in County Kilkenny, a school with a capacity of 50 was built at a cost of £1,854, or £37 per head. Other schools run to £50, £60 and even £70 per head, so that the limits in the small number of cases which I have quoted would be from £37 to £75.  In some parts of the country building costs, of course, are much greater than in others or perhaps the committees and the executive officers have been more efficient.  However, even the cost of the most costly school in the list, I think, will be a great deal short of the sum needed to provide a similar school in the post-war years. If we were to compare these schools with modern technical school buildings abroad, we would have to admit that they were of modest dimensions and of very temperate design.  It may be that Deputies have been influenced by the fact that there is such a terrible contrast between these buildings, and the old buildings such as workhouses, in which students were formerly accommodated.  The complaints are possibly due to this feeling of contrast and not to any careful appreciation of the circumstances and the necessity of providing ample, full and suitable accommodation in every way for technical and vocational school students.</P>
    <P>I do not know that there are any other points which call for comment. As I said, if I were to go into the question of the school-leaving age and other matters, and deal with all the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i> it would take a very considerable time.  As regards the question of school books, I may say, since I have not had an opportunity of explaining the position as regards primary school books to some of the Deputies who have come into the House since the last election, that there is a list of suitable books in the Department of Education and books which are considered by the inspectors to be suitable may be added to the list. We have been trying to reduce the list because in the case of Irish there were books there since the early days which might not now be considered as suitable as others which are available. There has naturally been a great improvement in that respect.  It is the <Col N="474" /> case where you have small classes that two classes may be taught at the same time by the teachers.  That is the reason why inspectors feel strongly that books must be changed.  If the third and fourth, and fifth and sixth classes are taught together&mdash;the third and fourth as one class, and the fifth and sixth as another&mdash;the inspectors do not think it right, and I agree with them, that a child who has been using a book this year, should use the same book next year.  It should be possible for the teachers to make arrangements to buy the books back again from children.  If it should happen that the book cannot be used by another child in the family, we have seen an arrangement in operation in very many schools by which the books are collected, particularly in an emergency period like this, and sold out again to other children.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy referred to industrial schools.  I have only to say that for very many years past, not alone managers of industrial schools but some of the social welfare organisations, the Catholic social organisations in particular, have been looking after boys and girls who leave industrial schools and go into employment.  The trouble has been that it is difficult sometimes to maintain contact with boys who frequently change their place of residence and will not take the trouble to acquaint the headmaster of the school as to where they are going next.  Of course it is often the case&mdash; and I think it is a very admirable feature of the work of the schools and reflects great credit on the managers &mdash;that as well as giving the children annual holidays in the way I have explained in my opening statement, the school is available generally to a boy or girl if he or she becomes unemployed and has no place to go to. These ex-pupils can generally go back to the school until such time as things improve for them.  If Deputies would send me particulars of any individual cases which may be of quite an exceptional character we could look into the matter which would be better than having a somewhat fruitless discussion on the question in this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy O Cléirigh referred to the <Col N="475" /> question of inspectors.  The inspectors are all practical men who have been teachers themselves.  The vast majority of the primary school inspectors have been national school teachers and it would be an extraordinary thing if they were not fully aware of the difficulties of the teachers and did not make allowances for them. Apart from the fact that it is quite clearly laid down in the official instructions that allowance must be made for special difficulties which the teacher has to contend with, it would be surprising if it could be said that inspectors were discourteous or unfeeling in their treatment of teachers or in their dealings with them.  There is no reason why, as I have said before in this House, teachers should have a complex about inspectors as some of them have.  It is a very serious matter, no doubt, for a teacher, a serious ordeal, when the inspector makes a general inspection upon his work, but I think that the teacher ought to realise that the inspectors are there as friends and advisers more than as inspectors in the narrow sense of the word.  They are not there to find fault.  They are there to assist in every way possible and I think the great majority of the teachers realise that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Halliden referred to the fact that no opening in the Civil Service seems to be available to primary school pupils.  Well, of course, we have a system of secondary school scholarships in every part of the country and generally the more talented pupils will be sent forward for these examinations.  Actually, however, the standard laid down for the writing assistants examination is the national school standard, but what happens is that pupils who have passed through the secondary schools, who have had a good secondary education and are within the age limits, compete for these posts and the ordinary national school pupil, no matter how well prepared or talented, can scarcely compete with a secondary school pupil who has done a good course.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes referred to appointments that, I take it, occurred in <Col N="476" /> County Carlow.  I asked him to send me particulars of the cases and he has promised to do so.  Lest I might not receive these particulars and lest the circumstances connected with the appointment made in October last by the County Carlow Vocational Education Committee, may be the particular matter that the Deputy has in mind, I should like to say that, while the qualifications normally required for a teacher of rural science are a university degree in agricultural science together with a certificate of suitability as teacher, some years ago when rural science was being introduced as a subject in vocational schools, the supply of university graduates in agriculture was insufficient to meet the demand for teachers and it was necessary to organise a special course of training for the purpose. This course was organised in consultation with the staff of the agricultural faculty in University College, Dublin.  It lasted for two years, the second year's course being completed at the Albert College, Glasnevin.  The course was confined to young men who already possessed some knowledge of agriculture.  The man who was appointed to the post in County Carlow had spent a year at Ballyhaise Agricultural College, and another year at the Albert Agricultural College, before his admission to the course of training. After the completion of his training he had seven years' satisfactory experience as a teacher of rural science in a rural vocational school in County Kilkenny.  I may say that I do not know the man personally.  I am speaking purely as Minister in the matter. A majority of County Carlow Vocational Committee considered him to be the most suitable applicant to fill the vacancy on the staff for a rural science teacher in October last, and I do not feel that there is any reason why I should question the soundness of their decision.</P>
    <P>The only reason I mention the matter now is lest it might be taken that some slight was intended&mdash;which I am sure was not the case&mdash;to the teacher, or that it might be suggested he had not the qualifications.  He had the qualifications which were available at the time.  The committee had the facts <Col N="477" /> before them when they made the appointment and, in the circumstances, I did not feel that there was any reason why I should interfere.  Deputy Hughes may be or may not be a member of the committee.  I know that Deputy Everett is a member of the committee.  I think it would be well if matters of a purely local character could be dealt with locally.  We all hope that committees come to the right decision and appoint the best person, but so long as they appoint persons who are properly qualified, I do not think I should demand that I should come in and interfere in the way of telling them whom exactly they should appoint.  It is my duty to see whether a candidate is qualified or not, and it is then up to the committee to appoint the one whom they consider to be the best.</P>

      <P>With reference to the report for 1941-42, and the extraordinary position regarding the speaking of Irish in the higher classes to which the Minister referred, he indicated that as it is not referred to in the report for 1942-43 we have to take it that the question has been completely dealt with.  I ask the Minister to realise that there is an interest in this matter in the House, and that we are disturbed by some things we see in departmental reports.  I ask the Minister to give us credit for that interest and to realise that it is absurd to say, when asking for information concerning the serious situation disclosed: &ldquo;If you do not see any remark about it in subsequent reports, then that is all there is to it, and that is all the information I can give about it.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Has the Minister investigated details of what was referred to in the report for 1941-42? The last time information was asked for the Minister said he had not read the report.  He has, to some extent, corrected that view, but has he read the details upon which the report was <Col N="478" /> based?  Has he asked for any explanation of what has been done? Could he tell us what exactly has been done, and what is the result of the action taken or would he suggest that we ought now to consider the matter closed?  I suggest to the Minister that if it was considered necessary in the 1941-42 report to report on the speaking of Irish in the higher classes, it is most desirable, as there was a poor report then, that there would be a report from the Department on that aspect of the language in the higher classes until it was quite clear that there was a good report.  I ask the Minister to say what he has done since then.</P>

      <P>As I explained to the Deputy the matter has been dealt with in the ordinary routine way.  The report in question was really a composite statement made up from reports of inspectors throughout the country and obviously in any one year the inspectors may or may not refer to a particular question.  If they refer to the teaching of arithmetic, or to the teaching of Irish in a particular year I take it that that is a certain estimate of the work of the schools at the time. I do not share the Deputy's conclusions&mdash;I do not know how anybody could&mdash;that that means finishing a question, and that nothing further has been done.  All I can say is that the matter is being examined.  It has been examined.  With other matters affecting the efficient work of the schools, the inspectors pay attention to them.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy's conclusion&mdash;if that is his conclusion&mdash;is meant to refer to the position generally.  There is difficulty about the annual report of the Department, either in confining ourselves to platitudes, or to what some persons may consider to be platitudes, in the form of a general assessment of the work and the efficiency of the work in different subjects.  If the report of <Col N="479" /> each inspector was published it might be better, but obviously in that case, if an inspector sees that a particular subject has not been satisfactorily taught, an entirely wrong conclusion might be drawn.  We know how phrases have been for years distorted to try to make out that something was intended that was not suggested at the time.  The inspectors report on the work as they find it, and I take it that they give objective reports, but the difficulty that we have is this, either to have a composite report, which it is rather difficult to phrase, on the basis of the reports received or to publish each inspector's report.  We have first of all a conference from time to time between divisional inspectors, of whom <Col N="480" /> there are eight, and district inspectors, within their areas.  These divisional inspectors meet the chief inspector and the deputy chief inspector to discuss matters.  Once a year there is also a formal conference between representatives of the national teachers and the representatives of the inspectors. If it is found that there is some particular matter of such importance that it should be raised, it is put on the agenda for one of the conferences and discussed, and in that way special attention is given to it.  If it is not a specially grave matter it will, even though it may not come up at the conference, be dealt with in the ordinary routine way by the inspectors.</P>

      <P>I move that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration. I put down the motion because I wanted to give the Minister an opportunity to deal in a satisfactory way with some of the matters that were discussed on the original Vote. The Minister has failed in every way to do so, and there are a few points, therefore, that I should like to raise on the Vote for Primary Education. The Minister gave us some figures to show that the situation was not so bad, and that there was quite a large number of children between 14 years of age and 16 years of age who were getting a certain amount of education some place.  He indicated that something like 50 per cent. of them were doing it.  There may be something in the Minister's figures, although in these figures he is taking credit for children who attend, say, a vocational school for one or two days a week, but the Minister's own report for the year 1942-43 makes a very positive statement which we must accept at its face value.  It is on page 18 of the report, and is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Caithfear cuimhneamh, ámh, gur beag de scoláirí na mbun-scol a gheibheann caoi ar dhul thar an mbun-scoil le'n a gcuid scolaidheachta. Bíonn ar a bhfurmhór mór mar sin aghaidh a thabhairt ar an saoghal agus tabhairt fé shlighebheathadh de shaghas éigin a bhaint amach dóibh féin nuair a bhíonn ceithre bliadhna déag d'aois slánuighthe aca.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is, most of them have to go and earn their living when they are 14 years of age, and that gives some indication of the position in regard to primary education in this country. Now, there are two things to which the Minister failed very much to give any kind of a satisfactory answer.  One is the position with regard to teachers and their salaries.  The last report of the Department of Education, on the primary education side, gives no general information about what progress has been made in any section of the primary schools system.  The whole of it is devoted to an idealisation of what the teacher ought to be in his person, in his relation to the child, and in the kind of teacher-child relationship that we ought to try to bring about.  The Minister, however, tells us that so far as the teachers are concerned, in relation to their salaries, nothing is going to be done in any branch of our educational system expect on the same basis as in the case of any other class in the community, and that only when the emergency permits.  I want to ask the Minister if he would answer this question.  Is he not going to regard the teacher in a different light in the future, in view of the work that has to be done by the teacher in the future, than that in which the teacher was regarded in the past?  Is the teacher to be left in the position, from the point of view of <Col N="483" /> society, from the point of view of the realisation of what his function is, that we have had in the past?  Are we going to realise that the human material we have in this country is the greatest and the richest of our raw materials, the material that has the greatest potentiality?</P>
    <P>We see that in Great Britain, now, after all the various experiences and vicissitudes that they have had, and facing the difficulties of commercial and economic life in a new and very difficult world, they are declaring that education is going to be the foundation of their well-being and of their future. If that is so in the case of a people with their experience, their organisation and their capacity to lay their hands on raw material, how much more does it apply to us who have not their economic development, their commercial development, or their manufacturing development: who have limited raw materials and limited resources in the country, and who must realise that it is only by improving in every possible way the education of our people and their capacity to face things that we are going to improve the economic situation in this country at all and, I might even say, the spiritual situation in this country, because if there is anything retarding the spiritual advancement or the idealisation of life in the country, it is the unfortunate economic conditions in which we are drifting and have been drifting for the last ten years, even since the great depression in 1929 and 1930.  The British are setting out to train 10,000 teachers a year, and they have got something between 120,000 and 140,000 teachers, so that they will not have to go outside the normal course in the training of the children in that country.</P>
    <P>In going into the great improvements in salary scales that have been put into operation in Great Britain I shall take two figures.  Take, for instance, before the war a four-year trained graduate teacher in an elementary school.  The scale ran from £204 by £12 to £366.  That scale is being changed to run from £345 by £15 to £585.  Thus the salary at the end of four years will be higher by £141 and <Col N="484" /> the salary at the maximum scale will be higher by £219.</P>
    <P>The cost of living has risen much less during the emergency in Great Britain than it has here.  Here the teachers are told that they must stay exactly where they are at present and that no new concept of them or of their functions or of the salaries they ought to be entitled to will be entertained by the Government.  I want the Minister to say positively whether that is so or not.  If that is so, then I think the country and this Parliament ought to know it very definitely.  If there is a changed concept on the part of the Government with regard to the teachers and their functions, we ought to know that, too.  We ought to know whether the Minister has considered in any way the facts put before him in the debate on the previous Estimate as to the salaries and outgoings of certain teachers for the maintenance of their families, and whether he proposes to make any different approach to the settling of what the scale of a primary teacher should be, I am taking the primary teacher at this particular stage because of the importance of the primary teacher not only in respect to the children who get only primary school-going, but in respect of the primary education system as the basis upon which we must build.</P>
    <P>The next point the Minister has been very unsatisfactory about is the position with regard to spoken Irish in the higher classes.  If we are serious in restoring a capacity to speak Irish, knowing the difficulties that are there, we cannot afford to take things for granted.  The Minister gibingly says that I should get some new points.  The point I am raising here is 12 months old.  It is the point as to which the Minister's annual report for 1941-42, dealing with the position of Irish in the higher classes, states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Is minic a leigtear i ndearmad ins na h-Árd-Ranga cuid mhaith de'n eolas a bhíonn ag na daltaí ag teacht ó na bun-ranga i n-ionad a ngreim ar an eolas san do láidriughadh, agus é do chur i ndoimhne agus i leithne.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Very often a good part of what is learned in the lower classes is forgotten <Col N="485" /> in the higher classes.  The Minister tells me that I ought to drop that point.  When he was challenged with that report in a serious and inquiring way last year, he may have slipped into the position of saying that he had not read it.  But he ought not to slip into the position of thinking that this House has no interest in the matter referred to there and is not entitled to get more detailed information than the Minister has given us.  I think the Minister's suggestion that I should drop this point and get a new point is the greatest condemnation of the position that we could have had from the Minister.  We know that there are difficulties, but it is because these difficulties are not discussed and faced here and because we do not get the explanations that we ask for in a constructive and reasonable way, that that report rings so true.</P>
    <P>There are some of us who are concerned with the position of the Irish language in the country and in the schools and our great difficulty is that the handling of the situation very often by the Minister both here and on the platform, and in some of the schools by some of his inspectors, is such that it is driving a large section of people into a lack of sympathy with the language.  The result is that in one of the Minister's Estimates before us to-day-Estimate No. 49: Science and Art&mdash;we are asked to vote £5,000 for Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaedhilge. We are being asked to finance out of State funds work that was done with pleasure in a voluntary way by many organisations throughout the country in the past; that is, that by the stubborn and almost ignorant way in which the Minister treats discussion of the question of the language in the schools in this House and elsewhere he is creating a situation that State funds have to be used to try to encourage an interest in the language by other means.  We want to know why that report was written and to what extent it stands true to-day.  It is a very reasonable request to make.  I would ask the Minister, if he does not reply to that, will he at least tell us why he thinks we ask these questions and press these questions.</P>
    <P>Anybody looking at the language <Col N="486" /> position in the higher classes and in relation to the higher classes must be concerned with what they see.  While that situation is developing, I for one am concerned with the people in Dublin who want some sound primary education through Irish for their children. There is no school in Dublin where it can be got to-day.  When a small body of persons brought up their children to speak Irish and wanted to secure that primary schools would be available in the city where they could send their children, the idea was that where there were families bringing up children with pre-school Irish they ought to be able to send them to schools where the work carried on through the medium of Irish would be well done, because you had there the home and the school working together. At the time when there was a demand for that, Scoil Mhuire and Scoil Colmcille were set up, but they were not reserved for children coming from homes where Irish was the language of the home.  It was not in the Minister's time, but the Departmental policy at that time was to get uniformity and to have no difference between the schools in the city; that any child in the city was entitled to enter any school it wanted to enter. The result was that children without Irish were allowed into Scoil Mhuire and Scoil Colmcille.  Then a preparatory school was set up to act as a kind of sieve through which children would have to pass before they could pass into Scoil Mhuire and Scoil Colmcille.</P>
    <P>Very good work was done in Scoil Mhuire and there was a time when Irish was completely the disciplinary language of the school.  But in Scoil Mhuire to-day that position has broken down and, as I say, there is not a school in the city where people who have Irish in the homes can send their children to be educated completely through the medium of Irish.  Scoil Colmcille hardly exists.  I think there are three teachers in it, if one has not gone to England within the last week or two, attracted by the higher salaries there.  So that even where the best work has been done for the language in the past deterioration has set in and the discipline in respect of the <Col N="487" /> language has broken down.  There may be difficulties in connection with it, but that is all the more reason why special care should be taken and why everything should be done to help to maintain the standard that was achieved to some extent in the past, even if that standard was not as high as some of us expected it to be brought to.</P>
    <P>This kind of aiming at a dead level of uniformity of approach to problems in schools that differ very much seems to be leading nowhere, and I suggest the Minister should be frank with us as to what progress is being made in different classes and different schools, what the difficulties are and what the failures are, so that we may know what has to be done.  Let us not be living in a fool's paradise, where we are simply planning and squabbling with one another about things, the facts of which are denied to us.  I resent being told that we should drop the old points and get to new points.  Nearly every old point that I had with regard to the educational system here has had to be dropped, getting up against the stonewall, ignorant approach that the Dáil has been accustomed to from the Minister. I consider that the money we are spending on primary education will be completely wasted in the future unless there is a new approach with regard to the status of the teacher and a new approach in estimating the work that is being done for Irish in the schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the importance of primary education, I think it is time that the Minister made a big effort to bring to an end the widespread discontent that prevails in the teaching profession.  The characters of our young people depend almost entirely upon the example and the training given to them by the teachers in the primary schools.  If the teachers are engaged over a long period, some three, four or five years, in a struggle with reference to their conditions of employment and salaries, if their attitude towards the State is to be one of grave discontent, and if they are to live under a sense of grievance, a sense of injustice, such a <Col N="488" /> situation must have a demoralising effect on the young.  Steps should be taken to investigate the causes of discontent among the teachers and whatever machinery can be set up in order to ensure that the case put up by the teachers will be impartially examined and adjudicated upon, that machinery should be set up at once.  No useful purpose can be served by prolonging a position of discontent, uneasiness and dissatisfaction among the members of the teaching profession.</P>
      <P>It was stated in the Dáil last week that we have a surplus of brains in this country.  I think the Deputy who used that remark was anxious to indicate that we had an exportable surplus.  I do not think we have an exportable surplus.  All the brains of our young people are urgently required to deal with domestic problems.  We require the best brains of our young people to tackle our agricultural and industrial development.  I hold that the first step towards securing that the best brains of our young people will be directed in the proper channel is to inculcate into their minds a sense of good citizenship.  That sense of good citizenship cannot be inculcated into the minds of the young in our primary schools unless the widespread discontent, uneasiness and dissatisfaction that exist among the teachers are removed. Various members of the Irish hierarchy, individually and collectively, have appealed to the Government to take this matter vigorously in hand.  I would like to add my voice to that appeal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite understand, but Deputy Mulcahy referred briefly to this matter and it is not my intention unduly to prolong the discussion.  I think the Minister has not satisfied the House that he realises the gravity of the position with regard to primary education, and the necessity, in view of the changed world conditions and the serious situation that faces our people, to make some effort to meet the reasonable demands of the teachers.  The Minister does not seem to realise the danger of allowing the present situation to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I really have very little to add to what I have already said.  It has always been the practice here that there should be one general discussion on the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Education and I have no wish to trespass on that practice.  I have explained that the policy of the Government is to control basic salary and wage scales, and the remuneration of employees generally.  That policy was decided upon in the early stages of the emergency and it was considered necessary in the national interest.  We all know that during the last war, and during this war to a certain extent, there was inflation and prices increased.  It is well known also that when wages or salaries are raised to compensate for increased prices you have what is called the inflationary spiral, and the responsibility is on the Government to prevent that spiral from reaching serious dimensions. Everyone who has studied the question knows that if it were uncontrolled and allowed to grow in extent, it is the poorer people and those on lower wage levels who would suffer most.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also known, if I may say so in passing, that if remuneration generally is increased, it is extremely difficult. if it should be necessary to make adjustments later on, to reduce it.  I am sure that fact has not escaped the speakers for Clann na Talmhan during election campaigns, and perhaps on <Col N="490" /> other occasions.  I am sure it is a point that the representatives of the Irish farming community bear in mind. What is particularly relevant at the moment is the consideration that it was after the last war that that inflationary trend became most serious. We all know that, even if we had not this problem of increased circulation of currency, there will be such a demand for goods from all the former belligerent countries, for the reconstruction of their cities and industries, that prices are bound to go up and, perhaps, for all we know, go up to even a greater extent than after the last war.</P>
    <P>Therefore, as the Taoiseach reminded the House in reply to a question yesterday, the Government has to consider this matter very carefully.  We have not come to a decision that the emergency is over.  The emergency conditions still obtain in regard to a number of matters, and until the Government decides that the emergency conditions no longer necessitate the maintenance of the standstill Order, the policy in operation now will continue.  Once the Government decides, however, that the emergency conditions no longer obtain and that that particular restriction can be relaxed, we are faced with an entirely new situation.  In the same way as during the emergency we have had to be subject to the controls imposed by the Government, the conclusion of the emergency will leave the matter entirely open and the whole question can be reviewed and reexamined, if it is found necessary to do so.  I hope that the whole question of the remuneration and salary scale of our teachers will then be re-examined.</P>

      <P>Are we to understand, then, that the reference to the teacher and his function in the last Report of the Department on Primary Education does not herald a new outlook on the teacher and his function by the Government, that his position is going to be as it was previously? Would the Minister say, in view of what he says in regard to inflation, by the time Great Britain has increased its teachers by 100,000, as well as increasing their salaries, that it looks <Col N="491" /> as if Great Britain is going to blow up and that that is why the A.R.P. services are to be maintained as a permanent part of our services here?</P>

I do not think we need look to any outside country in order to form our own standards in the matter of education or social affairs generally. We ought to have our own standards and our Constitution provides a sufficient basis and gives us aims <Col N="492" /> and ideals to attain the proper standards. I think we must have regard to our own circumstances and conditions in deciding on our aims and in setting out to achieve our standards. I do not see, therefore, that what is going on elsewhere must necessarily relate to us.</P>

      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do so for the purpose of asking the Minister if he will give us some information as to what the position is with regard to the recruiting of secondary school teachers, and their future.  Let us, compare the salary position of secondary teachers here with the salary position in England at the moment.  The starting salary of the secondary school teachers here is about £150; the present starting salary in Great Britain is £350; so that on that basis alone I have heard it said that it will be impossible to get lay secondary school teachers here in the future&mdash;in the immediate future, anyway.  But as well as the uninviting position from the point of view of salary there are other difficulties that the secondary school teacher here has to face.  Under the Ministerial regulations, there is quite a number of teachers who are actually employed but who are not getting crédit towards increment for the years they are working at the present time.  I should like to ask the Minister how many secondary teachers there are at the present <Col N="494" /> time, men and woman, who are not getting credit towards increment for their present years?  As well as that, I understand there is a large number of secondary teachers who are not getting the basic salary, because of the way in which the quota system is applied by the Minister, and that only a certain number of secondary teachers in a school get the basic salary.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister whether anything has been done permanently and fixedly for the purpose of deciding what the qualifications of a secondary teacher are, whether they are fixed in any way and to what extent he is allowing new entrants to the profession who have not defined qualifications to receive basic salary.  In regard to not getting basic salary and not getting their years of work allowed for increments and the standard of their salaries, secondary teachers are labouring under very great disabilities to-day and the class will not be recruited in the years that lie in front of us unless some change takes place.  I should like the Minister to say what the position is and what his proposals are.</P>

      <P>I take it that the questions which Deputy Mulcahy has put to me are all related to the future of secondary teachers as a profession.  I have not got by me particulars regarding the number of secondary teachers who are not receiving increments.  If it is considered necessary that I should give these particulars, I can either send them to the Deputy or make other arrangements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I could not say at the moment.  I did not anticipate that I would be asked this question and I do not think the Deputy could expect me to be able to answer <i>ad hoc</i>, on a responsible occasion of this kind, every question he pops up to ask without notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of secondary teachers has been under consideration for some time past.  The same conditions govern their remuneration as formerly. <Col N="495" /> There has been no change, so far as I know.  There has undoubtedly been this fact that certain cuts in the grants to secondary schools have been, either wholly or partially, given back to them, but as regards the salaries and increments of secondary teachers there has been no change. They have been granted the emergency bonus of 11/- for men, 9/- for women, applicable to other classes of teachers and other employees.  As to qualifications, there is, as the Deputy knows, a registration council, and in order to become a registered secondary teacher a teacher has to comply with the regulations of the council.  There is also, of course, a fixed quota of teachers who must be employed on the basis of the number of pupils in a school. According to the 1942-43 report, page 25, the number of teachers employed in secondary schools in the school year 1942-43 was 3,357.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some figures for 1943-44 which perhaps I may read.  In that year, 3,386 secondary teachers were employed, 1,609 men and 1,777 women, of whom 1,420, or 42 per cent., were not registered&mdash;625 men and 795 women&mdash;and 1,966 registered&mdash;984 men and 982 women.  Of the registered teachers, 864 were lay teachers, or 44 per cent., of whom 843 were definitively registered teachers.  The number of teachers newly registered in the year ended 31st July, 1944, was 133.  The total number of teachers whose names appear at present on the register is about 2,400, and approximately 82 per cent. of this number were teaching in secondary schools recognised by this Department in 1943-44.  The number of teachers eligible for increments was 1,792&mdash;942 men and 850 women&mdash;of whom 831 were lay teachers; 1,724 teachers were in receipt of incremental salary &mdash; 929 men and 795 women &mdash; of whom 805 were lay teachers.  Of these 1,724 teachers, 782 got special increments for honours degrees or equivalent and 473 got special increments for teaching through the medium of Irish. Of the 831 lay teachers who qualified for increments, 750 had the basic <Col N="496" /> salary or more and 81 had less than the basic salary.</P>
      <P>In the time at my disposal that is all the information I can give the Deputy, except to say that the general question of the scales of salary of secondary teachers will fall for consideration when the Government declares that the emergency conditions no longer pertain to the question of remuneration.  The matter of their qualifications is being examined.  We have been in communication with the schools and the inspectors are following a certain policy of trying to bring about gradually an improvement in the standard of the new entrants. These are examined specially and are under probation for a certain period. I have no further announcement to make at present about new qualifications for teachers.</P>

      <P>The Deputy must remember that a great many of our schools are under the management and control of religious orders.  Let us take them as an illustration.  We compel <Col N="497" /> such a school or any other school to maintain a certain number of registered teachers, but, outside that, if they choose to keep teachers who have qualifications in particular subjects, part-time or whole-time teachers, it is a matter in which we do not interfere, as the regulations stand at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister take into consideration the fairly small number of 81 teachers who have not got the basic salary, and about the same number of teachers who are not getting any recognition towards increment by their present years of service? In view of the number of teachers there are, and of the small number who are in that position, as well as the block which that position creates in the case of new entrants to the profession of secondary teachers, will the Minister review the regulations, and see if these anomalies cannot be eliminated, so that arrangements may be made to ensure that any teacher who is registered, and who has been teaching for a year, will get recognition towards his increment, and that any teacher who is teaching and has been accepted by the Minister as such will get the basic salary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the quota of registered teachers laid down in our regulations, which is based on the number of pupils, I think it provides fair teaching power and teaching personnel and that it compares favourably with the numbers provided elsewhere. That does not say that it may be exactly the same, but the matter can be looked into and improvements made, if possible.  I do not want the Deputy or anyone else to assume that I have any feeling that we are not providing, under our existing regulations, a sufficient quota of teachers.  Outside the registered teachers, there is the problem of teachers who are doing or have done their diplomas and are awaiting registration.  They are in a special category.  I think the Deputy will see that unless it is clear that fulltime employment is available for them and that the number of pupils which we would consider necessary is also available, his suggestion practically amounts to this, that he wishes us to <Col N="498" /> provide additional teachers in addition to the quota we have already.  We feel that the quota is, generally speaking, sufficient.  As regards the teachers outside the quota of registered teachers, they are in a different category altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration. On that, there are two points which I want to put to the Minister.  He has received a protest from certain areas in the country where there are Irish colleges against a scheme that he has apparently adopted for this year by which all persons going for the ceard teastas will be required, instead of going to <Col N="499" /> Ring, Ballingeary, Carrowroe or any of the other colleges in the Gaeltacht districts, to go to Galway City to some kind of a special course that is being organised there.  I want to ask the Minister whether he has changed his mind with regard to that.  With a view to improving themselves in their knowledge of the Irish language, teachers have established the practice of going to particular districts year after year. One of the great advantages they derive from doing that is the contact they make with the old people and with those living in Irish-speaking homes.  It means that as well as getting the course provided in the college, they are living completely in the atmosphere of the language during the period they spend attending the college.  The proposal the Minister is now making seems to me to be an extraordinary one.  All these people are to be brought to Galway City. They are not to be allowed to pursue their course in the Irish-speaking districts. Those who have been in the habit of going to Ring, Ballingeary, Carrowroe or to Rann na Feirste will have to go to Galway City.  I should like to echo the complaint of various classes of teachers who have raised their voices about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of the ceard teastas that I would like to ask the Minister about, and that is whether he is paying any special attention to the number of persons who are being failed in the ceard teastas examination, persons who are either native speakers or who, during the greater part of their school careers, have been attending Irish-speaking schools. There are, as I understand it, a number of persons who have been educated through the medium of Irish, on the one hand, and a number of native Irish speakers on the other, who have been doing their professional course, and who, when they sat for the ceard teastas examination&mdash;some of them more than once&mdash;have failed in it and failed in a way which they did not understand themselves. Neither did the people associated with them in their classes or their teachers understand why they had failed.  There must be something erratic in the conduct <Col N="500" /> of the examination of the ceard teastas.  I would ask the Minister whether he has had his attention called to that.  If so, will he look into it and see what the situation is?  The fact is that people are being failed for the ceard teastas and there is no obvious reason why they should be failed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not heard any complaints, and I am told that no complaint has been heard in the office. It is quite possible that there have been fluctuations from year to year. If the position is that we have had no complaint, then it is very difficult for me to answer the Deputy's query.  I can only say, with regard to this question in general, that in awarding these qualifications and in holding these examinations, an effort is being made to bring the contents of the courses and of the examinations into closer concord with the needs of the schools. Naturally, the standards that were prevalent 25 or 30 years ago may not hold to-day.  I explained to the House, I think, that we were trying to get ahead with teaching through Irish in the vocational schools.  I indicated that up to the present we had not the progress to show there that we had in the case of the primary and the secondary schools.  We have the difficulty that we have teachers in the vocational schools who, although well qualified in other respects, are not perhaps sufficiently experienced in Irish to undertake instruction through the medium of that language.  There may be some change.  I shall look into the matter and see if there has been or if there have been any fluctuations. If I find that there have been any complaints, or changes in the rules, I shall communicate with the Deputy.  As regards the holding of the course in Galway, a course for teachers has already been held in Galway City and it was found very satisfactory.  A large number of teachers attend some of those courses and the question of providing suitable accommodation for them arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I confess that there is something in the point that, when a teacher is attending a course, there is no reason, <Col N="501" /> unless it is considered absolutely necessary, why he should be taken completely away from the ordinary amenities and amusements he is accustomed to during the holiday period.  Amongst the teachers themselves I think that there has been a feeling that they would like to be given a course in or near the larger centres. In Galway the courses have been held in University College, which means something.  Good accommodation is available in the City of Galway, and it is not very far from the Gaeltacht, if not actually in the Gaeltacht itself. One has only to go two or three miles from Galway to be in an Irish-speaking district and to hear Irish freely spoken as the native language.  I think that there are points in favour of Galway, though I can quite see that there are other considerations.  If it were to appear that we were giving all our courses to one particular centre, catering for a particular dialect, other areas and other dialects might have a grievance.  But the persons attending those courses &mdash; teachers &mdash; are experienced persons and I think that the dialect difficulty gives them no great trouble.  Moreover, at their level of attainment it is not really a question of giving them a further knowledge of Irish; it is a question of teaching methods and of specialised instruction. It might be that, in a course at Galway, it would be possible to get teachers of music or some other subject whom they might like to have but who might not be available in some of the Irish-speaking districts in the more remote areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that it was ever intended they should be compelled.  Students attend in the hope of getting the ceard teastas.  If they are candidates for a position under a vocational education committee, they must have this qualification and it is to their advantage to go through the course.  But it is not essential.  Without casting any slur on the very high qualifications which some students &mdash; graduates in certain cases&mdash;who are going up for the ceard <Col N="502" /> teastas may have, I think that, as a preparation for the kind of work they will have to do in the vocational schools, this course is valuable.</P>

      <P>I should have to ask notice of that question.  I do not think that it arises now.  If it is a question of passing the examination at the end of the course, I may say that I know students myself who had to attend the course more than once and try for the examination more than once.  If the period of years during which they have to get this qualification lapses, then the question of their continued recognition may arise.  With regard to attendance at a particular course in a particular year, I cannot see why any disabilities should be imposed on teachers who do not choose to attend. We encourage them to go and I should not like to be placed in a position in which it could be suggested that we were not interested in having teachers go there.  But I do not think that we compel them.</P>

      <P>The Minister should take into account cases where it is perfectly clear that the person, in addition to possessing the ordinary technical qualifications, is a native Irish speaker or has received his education in an Irish-speaking school.  In these cases, it is perfectly clear that he has a linguistic foundation of Irish though he may not have the ceard teastas.  Will the Minister consider whether a provisional certificate could not be given in such cases?  There is a lack of standardisation.  Doctors, rate-collectors and nurses have been appointed to Irish-speaking districts on condition that they qualify in three <Col N="503" /> years under the Gaeltacht Order.  But they have gone on for ten years without qualifying.  They are firmly fixed in their positions and they are getting credit for their years of service for the purpose of pension.  On the other hand, persons with a good linguistic knowledge of Irish and with the technical qualifications in the subjects they propose to teach are being refused appointments, in districts where their Irish would not be used at all, unless they pass an intricate examination in an examination atmosphere.  The Minister will see that there is an injustice there.  He ought to give a provisional certificate in certain of these cases, with the requirement that the persons concerned continue to study for the ceard teastas and secure it within two or three years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that you can only judge whether persons are likely to be good teachers or not when they commence to teach.  It is my duty to see that as few persons as possible who are not likely to become good teachers are allowed into the permanent service.  It is better to keep them out than to allow them in and later have to terminate their employment.  That point has to be kept in mind.  That is why I said that we must have regard to the capacity of the person as a teacher.  The ceard teastas is not a linguistic matter; it is a question of qualification for teaching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

      <P>The teacher is judged on the language on the one hand and on his teaching on the other <Col N="504" /> hand.  Is it indicated to a person who fails the ceard teastas examination that he failed in the language or failed in the technique of teaching, because it seems to me that there are cases of persons who have had a good foundation as native speakers, and a good foundation going through the schools, who have failed on the language test and not on the teaching test.  It seems a hardship to leave teachers who have spent a number of years working up their technical courses in the position, when they face the ceard teastas examination, that they do not know whether they failed because they have not enough Irish on the one hand or sufficient teaching technique on the other.  It seems rather strange that a person's capacity cannot be ascertained in some way or another in the three years' course which he spends in acquiring technical knowledge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that when the House is presented with an Estimate in which we are dealing with publications in Irish, the production of plays in Irish, the Irish Folklore Commission, scholarships to Gaeltacht students, the preparation of a revised edition of <i>Handbuch Des Alt Irischen</i> and a grant-in aid of the National Film Institute, that one would naturally expect that the Minister might have something to say about some of them.  I move the motion standing in my name:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That sub-head B (6) be reduced by the sum of £10.</P>
      <P>While the motion deals only with one particular item, there are a number of matters about which I should like to say a word.  The Minister told us in introducing the Estimate for his own office that it was proposed to set up a group of workers to examine into and report on the history of the famine. He indicated that Professor Dudley Edwards and Mr. W.S. Moody would be responsible for various sections.  I was moved by the general effect made on me by the Minister's statement on the position of education in the country to suggest that these gentlemen might be asked to hold themselves in readiness for a different kind of inquiry&mdash;to inquire into the position of things in the Department of Education.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did, and I do not want to reopen the matter but I think I am entitled to ask for some description of the qualifications and capacity of the workers for whom provision is being made here, so that we could seriously consider whether they could not be used for more urgent work than the Minister intends to put them to.  I want to repeat once more that there are likely to be social and <Col N="506" /> economic consequences arising out of our neglect of education at the present time and that the sooner we get somebody to look into that the better.  I should like some information in regard to these workers with a view to seeing whether we could not put them to more useful work than writing up the famine.  I have no objection to historical research if it is properly and systematically faced and not for political purposes of one kind or another. I think we require a good deal more of it but I do not think we should deflect qualified workers from work that would be of more immediate advantage to-day and I think there is plenty of that work to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In respect to a number of grants provided for here&mdash;those for instance to the Irish Committee of Historical Science, Cómhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaedhilge, and the National Film Institute of Ireland&mdash;and for some of which large sums are provided, I should like to ask whether the Minister could not provide in some form or another for an annual report which would be presented to the Oireachtas and would be available in the Library. There are matters embraced in the activities of these organisations that are no doubt of interest and worthy of some expenditure but we should have some systematic means of obtaining an account of what is being done for that money.  For the Cómhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaedhilge we are granting £5,000 in respect of work which was formerly voluntarily done by branches of the Gaelic League.  In addition a substantial amount of money has been spent on Timthirí Gaedhilge in the vocational schools. A lot of that work is work which is making up for defects in either the educational system or the political system here.  I think it desirable, when we are starting to spend such large sums on this work, that we should get a report of some kind.  I take it these bodies do make a report to the Minister.  If they do not, I think they should make a report to the Minister as to the extent of the success of their work.  I want to ask the Minister whether he has had any report from any of these bodies in respect of moneys advanced to them <Col N="507" /> for the last year or whether he proposes to get them to make a report on the work of the current year and whether he proposes to present that report to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be an advantage in having in our annual reports a section dealing with this matter providing an account of the activities of these bodies.  I do not think we have asked Cómhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaedhilge for a report on their work but I shall communicate with them. It is not exactly the work that was done by voluntary workers in the Gaelic League or by Irish organisers under vocational education committees. Obviously the standard of the work nowadays is very much higher than it was in the old Gaelic League.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy is referring to.  If he cannot see any difference between the work done by Cómhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaedhilge, which is trying to bring the language into our national life, in business as well as socially, and the work done by the Gaelic League classes in former times, I am afraid I cannot see his point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the work under the vocational education schemes, while we are trying to give them a certain amount of latitude, we know that the resources of committees are limited, that the number of teachers they can employ must be in proportion to their resources, and that only a certain proportion of their budgets can be made available for Irish.  They will want to know if organisers are really part of the educational work or part of Irish organising work.  I think they can assist in the work of organising Irish outside, but I realise that committees may have other views.  As I said on the main discussion we leave these matters to committees, depending on their goodwill. <Col N="508" /> However, I will go into the matter.  I think the Folklore Committee issues a report.  I do not know if copies are in the Library but I can see that one will be placed there.</P>
      <P>As regards the other subject to which the Deputy referred, I doubt if it is in order to discuss the history of the famine, because no financial provision was made for it.  I mentioned it because preliminary work would have to be undertaken, and it was as well to refer to it here.  The Irish Committee of Historical Sciences was formed by the leading Irish historians in 1937 as a national body to represent Ireland at the International Historical Congress which, prior to the recent war, met every second year.  The last meeting at which Ireland was represented was held at Zürich in 1938. The members of the committee received no payment for their work, but a small Government grant, £100, has been provided annually to defray necessary incidental expenses, printing, etc.  The Irish committee is representative of the whole country; it includes three representatives of the Ulster Society for Historical Studies. This committee has undertaken to prepare a history of the Great Famine. The members of the committee have been mentioned.  It is proposed that the cost of printing the work will be defrayed by a Government grant.  I do not think I need go into the financial points this year, except to indicate that the work is being undertaken by this body.  It is work of first-rate historical importance which ought to add greatly to Irish scholarship and general knowledge of a very important period for our people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to give continuing effect to the Financial Resolutions passed by the Dáil on the 4th instant following the Budget.  As Deputies are aware, these Resolutions have statutory effect under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act. 1927, for a limited period only.  The matters provided for in the Bill have all been before the House already in the form of Financial Resolutions or have been referred to in my Budget statement. In the circumstances, it is, I think, scarcely necessary for me to deal with them now in detail.  I propose, therefore, <Col N="511" /> with your permission, to refer briefly to the various sections of the Bill as introduced.</P>
    <P>Part I &mdash; Income-tax.&mdash;Section 1 (which corresponds to Financial Resolution No. 1 passed on Budget day) is the customary &ldquo;charging&rdquo; section. It provides for the imposition of income-tax, sur-tax and excess sur-tax for the year 1945-46 at the same rates as those in force for the preceding year.  It also makes provision for the continuance in force of the existing enactments relating to those taxes.</P>
    <P>Section 2 secures broadly, following a point raised by way of amendment to last year's Finance Bill, that losses in transactions, where a profit, if it had arisen, would have been assessable under Case VI of Schedule D, may be deducted in computing for tax purposes any profits from such transactions. The relief, which is made retrospective to the year 1944-45, will apply not merely to the transactions of professional bodies in connection with the registration of members, to which reference was made last year, but to all transactions coming under Case VI.</P>
    <P>Section 3, which was foreshadowed in the Budget speech, secures with retrospective effect that exemption from income-tax and sur-tax shall be granted in respect of deferred pay which is credited to the pay account of a member of the Defence Forces.  A similar exemption is extended to gratuities granted in respect of service with the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Part II&mdash;Customs and Excise.&mdash; Section 4 reduces the rates of excise duty on matches.  The reduction amounts to 2/1 on each gross of boxes containing more than 20 but not more than 50 matches.  This is the type of box in general use and it is sold by retail at 1½d.  The reduction is to compensate manufacturers for the increase in cost of raw materials and overhead expenses and to ensure that the public may continue to be able to purchase matches at the price now current.</P>
    <P>When the excise duty on matches was increased from 3s. 8d. to 8s. 4d. in 1941, manufacturers were given to understand by the Department of <Col N="512" /> Supplies that the duty would be adjusted if necessary so as to recoup them for increased cost of materials and increased overheads arising from war conditions.  In November last, strong representations were made for such review.  The position has been thoroughly examined and as any increase in the price of matches would be most undesirable at the present time, the only alternative, that is, a reduction in the rate of duty, is warranted on the understanding that the position will be again examined on the return of more normal conditions.</P>
    <P>The loss of excise revenue in the current year will amount to £53,000 and in a full year to £58,000.</P>
    <P>Corresponding reductions have been made in the rates of customs duties but as imports are very small at the present time the effect of the change on customs revenue will be negligible.</P>
    <P>Part III&mdash;Death Duties.  Section 5, which is complementary to Section 3, provides for the exemption from estate duty and legacy duty of the payments for service with the Defence Forces which are covered by that section.</P>
    <P>Part IV&mdash;Corporation Profits Tax. Section 6 secures that a public utility company which carries on a tramway undertaking shall not, by reason of that fact alone, be deprived of the temporary exemption from corporation profits tax and excess corporation profits tax afforded to public utility companies.  The effect of the section will be that the new transport company, Córas Iompair Éireann, will be exempt from corporation profits tax and excess corporation profits tax in respect of the whole of its profits for a period of two years.</P>
    <P>Part V&mdash;Miscellaneous and General. Section 7 is the customary care and management provision and Section 8 is the usual section relating to the Short Title, construction and commencement of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some items in connection with this Bill to which I should like to refer.  There is one which might have been more properly dealt with on the Budget Resolution, that is, the general disappointment <Col N="513" /> that there was no reduction in income-tax, but, in the circumstances, I suppose, we could not expect it.  The relief under Case VI Schedule D is welcome, as is the provision under Section 3, which exempts from income-tax and surtax certain payments made to members of the Defence Forces. Both of these provisions are welcome and desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the Finance Act of last year, Section 13 of which deals with deductions in remuneration of directors in relation to excess corporation profits tax.  It has been pointed out to me that this section is operating unfairly in the case of smaller companies.  Under Section 13 (c) of the Finance Act, where the paid-up capital is less than £15,000, the Revenue Commissioners must deduct 3 per cent. of the paid-up capital.  I will give the Minister an example.  A company has been formed as a limited liability company which was formerly run by a trader and his sons as a family business.  The father and the sons have become directors.  Pre-war, and during the earlier years of the emergency, the sons were in receipt of a salary or director's fee of £400 per annum each.  In 1942 the business was formed as a company and, for family reasons, and in order to give the sons a financial interest, the provisions relating to companies were adopted as the family thought it would be more satisfactory and more successful.  The capital of the company is £6,000.  The maximum total remuneration allowed to the directors for the purpose of calculating excess corporation profits tax is 3 per cent. of £6,000, that is, £180 a year.  I submit to the Minister that in this case the Revenue Commissioners should be in a position to allow at least £1,200, which was the remuneration that the three sons had before the war.  The Revenue Commissioners are empowered to do that in respect of companies where the paid-up capital is £15,000 or over.  In this case the company is liable to excess corporation profits tax and, after charging full remuneration to the directors, the position is as follows: The amount allowed by Section 13 (c) &mdash;3 per cent. of £6,000, is £180; the <Col N="514" /> excess corporation profits tax, at 50 per cent., is £510, less tax at 7/6 in the £&mdash;£191.  The actual loss to the company in tax is £319.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will realise that in small companies like that where a family are working the business practically entirely by themselves or, at any rate, where they are the board of the company, the provisions of this section operate very harshly.  I have received particulars of this case, but I have complaints in respect of other cases, and, in fact, no later than to-day, I was discussing the matter with an accountant who deals with a number of these small companies and yesterday I had a complaint from a solicitor who has had considerable experience of them.  I should be glad if the Minister would look into the section and see if he can alter it.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to the exemption from income-tax applicable to a married man, and to the difference between the allowance granted to a married man and the allowance granted to him when a child is born. As the Minister is aware, the tax is leviable under the Finance Act of 1920, which was extended and modified by various amending Acts.  Here, the situation is that if a man gets married at any time during the financial year he is allowed the full rebate of £220. For instance, if he got married on 4th April, which is the last day before the end of the financial year, he would get the full allowance.  If his wife died on the following 7th April, that is the second day of the next financial year, he would still be allowed the full allowance for that year.  If a child is born on 6th April, no allowance is made until the beginning of the following year.  In England, recent legislation has allowed £50 in respect of a child born at any time during the year.  Here, of course, the allowance is £60 for a child, reduced for every additional child under 16 years of age. I presume that the argument which the Minister or the Revenue Commissioners will put up is that it will be made up at the other end, when the child becomes 16 years.  It has been put up to me that an individual is likely to be in a better financial <Col N="515" /> position when his children are grown up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard frequent complaints in regard to the allowance for adult dependents.  The allowance, I think, is £60 a year for children and £25 for adult dependents.  To my mind that £25 seems to be an entirely inadequate allowance.  Reference has been made to the cost of the upkeep of children, particularly young children. I definitely think that the upkeep of a baby in the first or second year would be very considerably less than the upkeep of an invalid or an aged person.  Of course it may be argued that in the case of children the cost of education has to be taken into account, but there are compensations there, because those who are charged with the upbringing and education of children can look forward to some return in the future, whereas the person who is charged with supporting an invalid, whether it be a parent or any other relative, cannot look forward to any similar compensation.  It is a permanent burden.  For that reason, I think the Minister should consider increasing the allowance, and bringing it up to something like the same level as the allowance in respect of children.  I am not an income-tax payer myself, but I have sympathy with anybody who has to pay that taxation because I know it is always a rather unpleasant duty.  I can imagine that in some cases the burden of maintaining <Col N="516" /> relatives might be very severe.  There might be two parents to be maintained, or perhaps a brother or a sister who is an invalid.  I think a good case could be made for some increase in the allowance.</P>

      <P>There is not very much excitement about the Finance Bill this year because, as some Deputies described it during the discussion on the Budget, it is more or less a standstill Order.  There are some changes, but they are modest changes which do not affect the major position of taxation to any considerable degree.  On the question raised by Deputy Cosgrave in regard to small companies, cases have been made to me personally by deputations from Chambers of Commerce and so on about the position of certain small companies.  I have said more than once to some of those deputations that I do not want to be in a position properly to be charged with being unjust or unfair to any type of company, small or large.  To those deputations, particularly to certain accountants amongst them who stated that from their professional knowledge and from their colleagues' professional knowledge there were cases where they thought there was injustice, I have said: &ldquo;Give me the details.  Give me the facts.  If you convince me that injustice is being done by the present scale of taxation, I will try to remedy it.&rdquo;  I have not yet got a convincing case, although that statement was made to those deputations some months ago.  I was told a fortnight or so before the day of the Budget that cases would be presented.  One member of the deputation said that he had, of his own knowledge, four or five such cases.  Some of those cases have since been presented to the Revenue Commissioners, and they are under examination, but I have not yet had conveyed to me, from the official sources at any rate, any intimation that any convincing case has been made.  If such a case is made, I can assure the Deputy that it will have sympathetic examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister for Finance, I would not stand over what I would regard as <Col N="517" /> unfair or unjust discrimination against any type of company.  In regard to the particular case mentioned by Deputy Cosgrave, I should like to get the facts.  If he gives me the facts and figures, I will certainly have them examined, and carefully and sympathetically examined.  I should like to mention that before any excess corporation profits tax is taken out of that company they have a standard of £2,500 on which no excess profits corporation tax is paid.  They have that standard, and that would give a big return on capital without paying any excess corporation profits tax.  However, if the Deputy lets me have the figures, I will examine the case carefully.</P>
    <P>With regard to the allowance for children, as I said to the Deputy during the course of his speech, that case has been frequently made in this House.  I heard it made several times when the gentlemen opposite were the Government.  It has been made almost every year that I have been in the Dáil, but, I think, if one takes the long view, it will be seen that it is as broad as it is long.  If the person does not get the advantage in the first year, the year during which the child was born, he gets the advantage in the year after the child reaches 16.  Some people hold that it would be a greater advantage to get the allowance during the first year, but I have heard people with families, some of them with large families, recently say that when the family is at the more costly stage the £60 allowance is more useful to them.  It has been the custom here, at any rate, so long as this Dáil has been in existence, to pay on the present basis.  The matter has often been considered by the Revenue Commissioners and their advice is not to alter it.</P>
    <P>As an individual, I have considerable sympathy with those who ask that the allowance for dependents should be increased.  I should like to increase it.  I read an article in a paper recently.&mdash;I think it was the <i>Sunday Independent</i>&mdash;on this very subject, a well-written, well-argued article.  I asked the Revenue Commissioners for figures as to what it would cost to <Col N="518" /> double the allowance.  It would cost £80,000 and in these times I would not afford it.  I should like to do it, but £80,000 in present conditions would be more than I can afford.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £2,108,125 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1946, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (45 and 46 Vict., c. 74; 8 Edw. 7, c. 48; 1 and 2 Geo. 5, c. 26; the Telegraph Acts, 1863 to 1928; No. 14 of 1940 (secs. 30 and 31); No. 14 of 1942 (sec. 23); etc.), and of certain other Services administered by that Office.</P>
      <P>The estimated Post Office expenditure for the financial year 1945-46 amounts to £3,225,125, representing a gross increase of £223,364 on the provision for 1944-45, of which approximately £174,080 is due to increased cost of living and emergency bonus. There are offsetting decreases of £62,894, leaving the net increase in expenditure £160,470.</P>
      <P>The principal features of the Estimate are as follows:&mdash;Sub-heads A (1) to A (4)&mdash;Salaries, etc.  The gross increase is £203,526, due in the main to increased bonus, which accounts for £151,815; to normal incremental increases; to additional staff provision necessitated by general growth in various classes of work, including additional remuneration to sub-post masters for increased business; provision for officers resuming from Army service, and increased cost of labour in Post Office factory, etc.  There are offsetting decreases amounting to £23,316, the result of savings on retirements and lesser number of weekly pay days at certain offices&mdash;leaving the net increase under the sub-heads £180,210.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-head E (2)&mdash;Conveyance of <Col N="520" /> Mails by Road.  There is an increase of £2,570, due to increases in subsidies to mail car contractors to meet advances in maintenance, etc., costs. Sub-head E (5)&mdash;Conveyance of Mails by Air.  There is a reduction of £13,869 under this sub-head, due to provision having had to be made last year for arrears of payment in respect of Commonwealth air services.</P>
    <P>Sub-head G (1)&mdash;Non-Engineering Stores.  There is an increase of £4,585, due chiefly to increased cost of mail bags; to the purchase of charcoal for gas producer plants and to higher cycle costs.  Sub-head G (2)&mdash;Uniform Clothing.  The decrease is £9,000. Provision above normal had to be made under this sub-head last year due to an anticipated reduction in credits from other Departments. This was due to difficulty in obtaining raw materials and consequent delay in placing contracts.  Sub-head G (3)&mdash; Manufacture of Stamps, etc.  The increase of £1,630 is due to provision of additional watermarked paper for children's allowances orders and to increased price of paper.</P>
    <P>Sub-head I (1)&mdash;Engineering Salaries, etc.  This shows a decrease of £7,075. The gross decrease is £25,890, due mainly to increased relief from telephone capital, against which there are offsetting increases on account of cost-of-living and emergency bonus&mdash;£16,315 &mdash;staff increments, etc.  Sub-head M&mdash; Telephone Capital Repayments.  Here the increase is £5,873.  The repayments are in respect of annuities created under the Telephone Capital Acts, which authorised the Minister for Finance to borrow moneys for the development of the telephone service. The provision to be made each year is notified by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Sub-head N (1) &mdash; Superannuation Allowances, etc.  The increase here of £12,765 represents an increase in the total payments to pensioners, due to additional retirements; also increased provision for marriage and death gratuties, bonus, etc.  Sub-head O (1) &mdash;Savings Bank Salaries, etc.  The increase of £2,675 under this sub-head is due mainly to increased cost-of-living and emergency bonus.  Sub-head O (4)&mdash;Stationery, Advertising, etc.  The decrease of £7,570 is due to <Col N="521" /> special provision in 1944-45 for advertising of savings bank facilities not being repeated this year.  Sub-head O (6)&mdash;Losses by Default, Accident, etc.  There is a decrease of £2,050. The saving bank losses were higher in the previous year, necessitating increased provision in that year.</P>
    <P>Sub-head Q (1)&mdash;Salaries, Wages, etc., Civil Aviation and Meteorological Wireless Services.  There is an increase of £3,250, representing mainly the cost of increased technical staff and of labour for new works.  Sub-head Q (2) &mdash;Civil Aviation Equipment, etc.  The decrease is £17,190.  A special provision of £17,000 was made in 1944-45 for the payment of outstanding accounts in respect of radio equipment supplied.  Sub-head T &mdash; Appropriations-in-Aid. This shows a reduction of £7,081, due mainly to decreased receipts from savings bank funds and from other administrations in respect of agency services performed for them, e.g., payment of money orders and postal orders.</P>
    <P>The financial position of the three main services&mdash;postal, telegraph and telephone&mdash;on a commercial basis at the end of 1943-44 (the latest year for which complete figures are available) was as follows: Postal services&mdash; surplus £114,621; telephone service&mdash; surplus £247,703; telegraph service&mdash; deficiency £73,685; showing a net surplus of £288,639 on the three services. This surplus is estimated to have dropped to approximately £89,000 at the end of the financial year just completed (1944-45).  Although the revenue of each service increased substantially last year increase was more than counter-balanced by increased administrative and operating costs&mdash;mainly cost-of-living bonus.</P>
    <P>The past year was one of considerable difficulty for the Department in connection with the maintenance of the internal mail services, by reason of the drastic restrictions in railway transport which became operative in April, 1944, as a consequence of the emergency coal situation and which involved an almost complete reorganisation of the mail arrangements.  Passenger services generally, except on certain local lines, were reduced from <Col N="522" /> six days a week or two, and, on the days on which the passenger trains did not run, the Department was dependent for the conveyance of mails upon much less expeditious transport &mdash;goods trains, lorries and buses&mdash; running at times only moderately suitable for Post Office purposes.  Certain branch lines were closed, and, generally, the transmission of correspondence was closed down, especially in areas in which travelling post offices had to be withdrawn.  There was, however, no serious dislocation of service, and I am glad to acknowledge that the railway company did everything in its power to meet Post Office requirements in the very difficult circumstances. The position improved somewhat in July, 1944, when passenger train services were increased to four days a week and additional bus services provided.  The Department has kept the closest possible watch on the situation, and has availed of every opportunity that presented itself to improve the mail arrangements.  So long, however, as the present restricted transport facilities continue, the existing postal services are the best that can be afforded in areas served by Córas Iompair Éireann.  As far as the employment of postal staff is concerned, the mail service restrictions have, fortunately, had little adverse effect.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to report an improvement in the postal services in North-West Donegal.  Since 25th November last the night mails for the Letterkenny area have been conveyed by special service from Strabane to Letterkenny, and under the new arrangements it has been possible to have the mails ready for despatch from Letterkenny Post Office at 6 a.m.  As a result of the new arrangements, deliveries along the entire Burtonport line have been accelerated and the scheduled time of arrival at Burtonport is now 9.5 a.m. as compared with 12.35 p.m. previously.  There has also been substantial improvement in the postal services in the Rathmullen, Milford, Downings and Rossnakill areas.</P>
    <P>Postal traffic during the year, apart from the Christmas period, showed little variation as compared with the <Col N="523" /> previous year, the upward trend in parcel traffic continuing.  The traffic during the Christmas period was extremely heavy, but the satisfactory response to appeals for early posting, combined with the restoration of normal train services during the fortnight before Christmas, enabled the Department to effect delivery of all Christmas mails before Christmas Day.</P>
    <P>As regards cross-Channel mail services, for a period of four months last year the sailings of the Dun Laoghaire-Holyhead Packet were restricted to three days a week in each direction owing to circumstances outside the control of this Administration.  By the use of the cargo boats from and to the North Wall it was, however, possible to maintain the cross-Channel mail services without serious impairment.  The normal emergency services were restored in July last.</P>
    <P>Postal communication with foreign countries generally has undergone little change during the past 12 months.  Hostilities in Western Europe last summer caused interruption of the services to France and other European countries, with the exception of Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Russia. Limited services are, however, again in operation with the Vatican City, with Southern Italy (including Sardinia and Sicily) and with France and Belgium.  The service to Switzerland which was suspended for a time has been restored.  The transmission of foreign correspondence generally is, of course, subject to serious delay.</P>
    <P>The various air mail services continue to be used extensively.  In addition to approximately 300,000 air-graphs, over 38,000 ordinary air letters were despatched by Commonwealth Air Services last year.  Air mail services to the Continent of Europe which had been suspended for some months have now been partially restored.  It is hoped to introduce a 6d.  Commonwealth air letter service in the near future.  Foreign parcel post traffic, which showed a material decline in 1943-44, is again growing. Over 281,000 parcels were received and 4,800 despatched last year, as compared <Col N="524" /> with 111,100 received and 2,600 despatched in the previous year. Events are happening so rapidly that we may anticipate a marked improvement in external services in the near future.</P>
    <P>There is little new to be said about the telegraphs.  While the service continues to benefit from emergency traffic, especially telegraph money orders, expenditure has grown considerably by reason of increased operating costs.  It is estimated that at present the loss on the service is approximately £113,000, as compared with £73,600 at the end of March, 1944. There is nothing the Department can do to improve the position.</P>
    <P>The growth of the telephone service continues.  Notwithstanding the suspension of the cross-Channel service for five months, there were 686,000 more trunk calls in 1944 than in the previous year; while the increase in local calls was 2,000,000.  As an indication of the extraordinary development of the service since pre-war days, I may mention that in 1938 trunk and local calls numbered respectively 3,297,000 and 30,000,000; the figures for 1944 were 6,630,000 and 43,000,000 respectively&mdash;representing percentage increases of 101 and 43.  With these remarkable figures in mind and taking into account that line construction and other stores are unobtainable, it is not surprising that the standard of service, particularly of the trunk service, is at times adversely affected, especially at peak traffic hours.  Everything possible is done to keep delay to a minimum, but as the capacity of circuits is limited, delay at times cannot be avoided.  Even so, apart from peak hours, a very substantial proportion of trunk calls is dealt with &ldquo;on demand&rdquo;, that is, while the caller remains at the telephone.</P>
    <P>Lest the Department may be again charged, as it has been previously charged, with a want of foresight in relation to the provision of reserve stocks of telephones and telephone plant, let me repeat what I said on the matter a year ago when presenting the Estimate for the last financial year.  I pointed out that, as far back as 1938, when the European situation showed <Col N="525" /> signs of disturbance, reserve stocks to the value of £100,000 had been purchased. At the outbreak of the emergency we had actually a reserve of three years' supply&mdash;quite a reasonable provision at the time.  But the emergency brought its immediate telephone problems and the huge network of communications that had to be arranged for the Defence services, on a scale that could not possibly have been anticipated by the Post Office, ate rapidly into the reserve.  Supplementary stocks, up to the limits obtainable, were subsequently secured, but they had to be drawn upon to meet the requirements of the abnormal traffic which developed from emergency conditions.</P>
    <P>In connection with the replenishment of stocks it has, of course, to be borne in mind that the materials employed for engineering purposes have in the main to be imported and that, as they are materials of a type in large demand by the belligerent countries, it has been impossible to procure them for our purposes in anything like adequate quantities. We have managed to keep going during the past few years only by resort to very special expedients, as, for example, by getting the utmost possible life out of spare and recovered materials, expending on reconditioning money in excess of what would be justified if normal sources of supply were still available.  I regret that I see no prospect of any material improvement in the supply position at an early date.  In the extremely difficult circumstances, however, I think that the service afforded has, on the whole, been as satisfactory as could reasonably be expected.</P>
    <P>The total number of subscribers' circuits at the end of 1944 was 32,773, an increase of 1,357 during the year. There was an increase of 1,135 in the number of subscribers connected to the automatic exchanges.  The position as regards new subscribers is that, owing to shortage of instruments, of underground cable and of wire for overhead circuits, it has recently been necessary to impose further restrictions on the provision of service.  A list of priorities has been drawn up, preference being given to essential and emergency <Col N="526" /> services, hospitals, doctors, etc., and this must be rigidly adhered to until the supply position improves. Meantime, however, Deputies may rest assured that every effort will continue to be made to afford service where there are special circumstances.</P>
    <P>At the end of January last, a severe gale, followed by snow and frost, caused considerable damage to the telephone and telegraph plant throughout most of the country, more especially in the south-east, where the damage in the Wexford, Waterford and Kilkenny areas was very extensive. A large number of trunk circuits was put out of service and large numbers of subscribers were cut off.  All possible steps were taken to repair the damage as rapidly as possible and normal working was generally restored by the end of the month.</P>
    <P>A 3-channel carrier system was opened between Dublin and Clonmel during the year and steps are well advanced for bringing a Dublin-Tralee 3-channel system and an additional Dublin-Limerick 3-channel system into operation in the near future.  We have also a promise of delivery during the coming year of a new type of carrier system which will give 10 speaking circuits on the one pair of physical lines. With this new equipment, if delivery is not unduly delayed, a material increase in the long distance circuits throughout the country should take place in the near future.  In addition to the circuits to be provided by means of carriers we have, for the coming year, an extensive programme of new overhead circuits.  The extent to which the programme can be carried out in practice will, however, depend upon the supply position.</P>
    <P>Traffic on the automatic exchanges in Dublin has been very heavy during the past year and continues to grow. In consequence of the impossibility of obtaining additional automatic equipment, the exchanges are working under conditions of considerable difficulty. Schemes for large-scale relief have been prepared and will be put into operation as soon as plant is forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I may mention an interesting development in regard to the limitation <Col N="527" /> of calls from call offices in the Dublin area.  All automatic coin box installations, including all the street kiosks, have been fitted with equipment which limits the time of local calls to five minutes after the number dialled has replied.  A warning of the termination of the call is given by &ldquo;pips&rdquo;.  It is estimated that the number of calls thus restricted is something between 800 and 900 per day, which means that the call offices generally are at the disposal of a much larger number of the public than was formerly the case. The expedient remedies a nuisance which was a source of much public dissatisfaction and one to which attention has frequently been directed during Estimate debates.  It is a source of satisfaction to record that the complicated equipment required was designed by our own engineering staff.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that, at the present time, the profit on the telephone service is about £247,500, the same as at the end of the year 1943-44.  Increased revenue last year of £30,000 was counterbalanced by correspondingly increased expenditure.</P>
    <P>In concluding my remarks in regard to telephones, I may say that I anticipate large-scale development of the service in post-war years.  The installation of a telephone call office at every post office now without service is intended as part of a five-year plan, and it is also hoped to increase our existing plant sufficiently to cater for double, or even treble, the existing number of subscribers.  Preliminary investigations and plans are well advanced.</P>
    <P>The value of contracts placed by the Stores Branch last year was £1,431,211, an increase of £53,572 on the figures for the previous year.  The value of contracts placed for articles manufactured or assembled within the State was £1,128,235.  Difficulty is still being experienced in obtaining tenders for imported stores, or stores manufactured from imported materials, although there have been some signs of improvement in this respect of late, especially in regard to tenders from Great Britain.  We have, I may say, left nothing undone, both on our own part and in conjuction with the Department <Col N="528" /> of Supplies, to procure stocks.</P>
    <P>The Post Office factory, which was destroyed by fire in November, 1942, has been re-established, and all the shops are at present working.  The equipment is satisfactory and the employment given at the moment compares favourably with that prior to the fire.  The extent to which this position can be maintained will, of course, depend upon the situation in regard to raw materials and spare parts, which is at present particularly difficult.</P>
    <P>With regard to Post Office buildings, final plans for a post office and telephone exchange at St. Andrew Street. Dublin, have been approved but, owing to scarcity of materials, building work cannot yet be undertaken.  It will, it is expected, be possible to give the matter early priority after the emergency. It is hoped, too, that construction work on the new district office at Whitehall, Drumcondra, will commence very shortly.  In regard to Post Office accommodation generally, I may say that a comprehensive survey is at present being made with a view to effecting improvements as soon as building materials are again available.  Serious difficulties for the Department in the matter of accommodation have arisen from the large volume of additional work falling on post offices by reason of the various new social services instituted during the emergency, particularly the children's allowances scheme.</P>
    <P>The development of Post Office Savings Bank business proceeds apace. Five years ago annual deposits numbered about 679,000 and amounted to slightly under £3,000,000.  In 1944 the number of deposits was in excess of 1,000,000 and the total amount was £8,500,000.  Withdrawals, on the other hand, only rose from £2,100,000 to £3,400,000 in the same period.  The average amount deposited per transaction five years ago was £4 6s.; it is almost double that amount to-day. One person in every six of the population of the country now has an account, indicating the widespread appeal of the Savings Bank.</P>
    <P>In addition to the ordinary deposits <Col N="529" /> a sum of £949,500 was deposited last year by way of investment of moneys received by the Minister for Finance for the credit of trustee savings banks under Section 31 of the Finance Act of 1940 and £31,200 was withdrawn by these banks.  Interest credited to the banks during the year amounted to £74,000.  The total, inclusive of interest, invested since 21st November, 1940, amounted to £3,143,500.  The total amount invested by the public in Savings Certificates during 1944 was £1,511,000, an increase of £336,000 on the figures for the previous year.  Withdrawals (principal and interest) amounted to £619,000, leaving a net saving for the year of £892,000.</P>
    <P>I have to refer in conclusion to the serious railway accident which occurred on the 20th December last as a result of the night mail train from Dublin having crashed into a stationary cattle train at Straboe, near Portarlington, and which resulted in the death of one of the officers employed in the travelling post office and in serious injury to two others.  The regrettable circumstances are well known and it is not necessary for me to refer to them in any detail, but I am glad to say that accidents of such tragic character are rare, both in railway and Post Office history, in this country.  In expressing my very deep sympathy with the relatives of the deceased officer and with the officers who were injured&mdash;all excellent officials&mdash;I wish to pay tribute to the remaining members of the sorting carriage staff whose zeal and devotion to duty on the distressing occasion, under conditions of considerable hardship, were in accordance with the best Post Office traditions.  To all concerned, including civilians on the wrecked train and officials from post offices in the vicinity, I return grateful thanks for the valuable assistance so promptly and willingly rendered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was sorry, Sir, that I was not able to hear the whole of the Minister's speech, but there are a few points I should like to raise.  One is in connection with the time of deliveries in suburban areas.  Most people who live in the suburbs and work in Dublin City have to leave their houses, at the very latest, at somewhere <Col N="530" /> around 9 o'clock, and the vast majority of them have to leave a great deal earlier.  I am thinking particularly of an area around Sandycove where the post does not arrive until after the people have left their houses.  That is a very great inconvenience to citizens in that area.  I am not raising this in any confentious spirit.  I know that it is not the fault of the postal people in the area.  The actual roundsmen do their work very efficiently and are very hardworking men.  Possibly it may be due to some effort to save money, and so on, but the length of the postman's round has been so extended that at the end of his round he is very little use to the residents on whom he calls.</P>
      <P>Another matter which I have long wanted to raise with the Minister is in connection with the telephone directory. There is a lot of information under the preface and under &ldquo;How to Use the Telephone&rdquo;, but I do not think it is set out to the best advantage. There is a section, &ldquo;If You Have a Dial Telephone&rdquo;, which tells one how to lift the receiver, listen, and so on.  That is all very necessary, but most people who use the dial telephone pick up the method pretty quickly.  What they forget, or perhaps do not know, is, when they want to make a trunk call, what precisely they should do&mdash;whether they should dial 0, 39 or 31.  I think there is also 30. Although it is in the telephone book, it is not very easy to find it.  You will not find under &ldquo;Trunk Calls&rdquo; whether you should dial 0, 30 or 39, or if it is there it is rather effectively hidden.</P>
      <P>Most people when about to make a trunk call look up the trunk call charges.  They read what they are to do and look at how much it will cost them, but they do not find how they are to get on to the proper person in the exchange, and I suggest that, under trunk call charges, there should be shown clearly how to contact the proper person.  Granted it is all in the book&mdash;I am not making that point&mdash; but if I have to make a trunk call, I find that I have to hunt feverishly through the book to find out exactly what to do.  I may be a great deal more stupid than the average person, but I certainly find that difficulty and I know that other people find it too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="531" /> In connection with the telephone service, we all know that at present we are experiencing a shortage of materials, but, speaking for myself and for other people with whom I have discussed it, I should like to say that telephone subscribers find the men who come to correct faults extremely courteous and efficient.  The Minister is to be congratulated on the manner in which he manages that rather difficult side of his Department in these days.  I should like the Minister to look into the matter of setting out more clearly how to get on to the correct person in the telephone exchange when making a trunk call and also the matter of the time at which the morning mails are delivered in the Glenageary and Sandycove areas.  The vast majority of the people in those areas do not receive their morning mail until they return home in the evening, which is a great inconvenience.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the good results he has achieved in the past year, and has achieved generally for a number of years.  The Post Office service is an extremely good service, and I have no complaints to make, except complaints which arise out of the shortage of materials.  Even with the shortage of materials, the telephone service has increased enormously. Due to the partial mechanisation of tillage operations, the telephone has become a great facility and a great help to farmers who very often urgently need parts for machinery. There have been difficulties and delays in getting in touch with firms in Dublin and the larger towns, but these, I understand, are also due to the emergency and the lack of materials.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister indicated that the telephone service is one which will develop.  I believe it will and that it will become a great facility in the rural areas which have been completely cut off.  I advocate that as soon as possible he should put up the necessary lines and obviate the delays which farmers often experience in trying to get calls to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="532" /> In general, I have nothing to say about the officials.  They have all been extremely courteous and have done their best and any matters to which one might take exception generally arise from restricted space.  The onus thrown on post offices, and especially rural post offices, has been made much heavier.  They are more or less like the Civic Guards.  The Government during the emergency gave a lot of matters to them to administer, the result being that in many of the rural post offices space is not adequate.  There is another difficulty, of which the Minister is aware.  I have the impression that many of these sub-postmasters are scarcely treated fairly.  As far back as 1924, a special payment system was applied to them, but there was a promise&mdash;I think, a definite promise&mdash;that in a short time it would be reconsidered and their conditions improved. That has not been done.  The war broke out, the cost of living went up and these people, very often with extremely low remuneration and with their duties multiplied, have had to engage assitants.  Holidays with pay came along and the assistants had to get these holidays, but these sub-postmasters got no increase, except whatever unit system existed for paying them in respect of the telephone and other services.  The fact of the matter is that these people are extremely badly paid and their hours are excessive.  I know post offices in the country in which the staff have to commence work at 6 o'clock in the morning and with a break after 7 o'clock, have again to be on duty at 11 o'clock to receive mails.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister himself is aware of a good deal of that.  I believe there is some grievance there, and that a more equitable system than the one that exists at present should operate in the future.  I would like to hear from the Minister what his opinion is on that.  It is quite true that before the war many of those people with sub-post offices were carrying on little businesses, but, like the old age pensions, their businesses were considered to be very important and so their salaries were reduced accordingly. We all know that since the war started these little businesses have practically <Col N="533" /> disappeared.  Supplies could not be obtained, with the result that those people were left high and dry.  Consequently, for the last four or five years, and, possibly, the same situation will obtain in the future, whatever little side lines they had could not be counted upon to bring in some return to them.  That is an added reason, I think, why their position should be considered.  Apart from that, I have nothing to say about the Post Office or its staff but what is complimentary. I, and I think the members of the public generally, have always found them most anxious to give a reasonably good service.  Where that did not occur it was due entirely to the fact that their space was extremely limited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in the course of his statement, made reference to the extraordinary growth in post office telephone traffic.  In saying that he was, of course, only recording what is a well-known fact.  Notwithstanding the emergency and the shortage of materials, telephone traffic has continued to increase, and all the indications are that it is likely to expand still more rapidly in the post-war period, as soon as materials are made available to provide the services for which there is an extensive public demand.  I think, however, the Minister ought to realise that the Post Office is not keeping pace, from the point of view of building accommodation, with the rapid development there has been in the growth of telephone traffic.  It is true, of course, that a new exchange has been opened at Exchequer Street, but I think the Minister will realise&mdash;he certainly would realise it if he had to work there&mdash; that the accommodation is utterly insufficient for the traffic that is being carried there.  The result is that in warm weather particularly, notwithstanding the efforts to get air-cooled conditions in the building, the place is most uncomfortable to work in.  In my opinion, it is overcrowded, and is very unpleasant for those who are employed there continuously.  Not only is it overcrowded from the staff point of view, but the pressure of work there, particularly on certain positions, is so great as to impose a very severe strain on the staff which is engaged <Col N="534" /> on a type of work that is fatiguing, arduous, onerous and nerve-racking. I would suggest to the Minister that the Post Office Department ought to employ its talents in an effort to try to provide relief for the overcrowded position in the Exchequer Street Exchange.  The conditions there, as I have said, impose on the staff very distinct hardships, some of which are of a character which, I think, would yield to treatment.  I realise, of course, that it probably will not be possible to get a satisfactory telephone service in Dublin until such time as the St. Andrew Street Exchange is open.</P>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say that the final plans for the erection of a new exchange in St. Andrew Street have been prepared, and that the work will be carried out as soon as materials are available.  If we are going to have a continued expansion of telephone traffic, it is absolutely essential to have a new exchange in St. Andrew Street made available.  Otherwise, the staff are going to be harassed by having to deal with the present volume of telephone traffic, and the public are going to get a very unsatisfactory telephone service.  The Minister has told us that these plans have been approved, and to some extent we can appreciate the difficulties of procuring equipment in present circumstances for the fitting up of an exchange of that character. I wonder if the Minister could tell us if the Department has a promise from those from whom the telephone materials have been ordered that these materials will be made available, and, if so, when.  Further, can the Minister, at this stage, give us any idea as to when the St. Andrew Street exchange will be made available for the accommodation of telephone staff, and for the diversion to it of the telegraph traffic which is at present being dealt with under very onerous conditions in the Exchequer Street exchange?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noticed that the Minister ran away from the ghost of the Pearse Street office this evening.  It is no wonder that he should.  The Minister told us with a great demonstration that the Post Office is making progress, and <Col N="535" /> that it is going to open a new district office in Whitehall.  That announcement will not shake the world.  Probably it will provide some facilities in the Phibsborough area.  It is all very well for the Minister to tell the House that the Post Office Department is going to open a new district office in Whitehall, but he could not tell the House what the Post Office intends to do in the way of providing a central sorting and delivery office for the capital city of the country.</P>
    <P>The present building in Pearse Street&mdash;a disused distillery&mdash;is still a ramshackle building.  It has been serving as a central sorting and delivery office for more than 20 years.  A very considerable amount of money has been spent patching up that ramshackle building in order that it might continue to serve the function of a central sorting and delivery office. While, as I say, a considerable amount of money has been spent on the building, it is still a ramshackle distillery, and is still an unsuitable central sorting and delivery office.  Instead of telling us that the Department had some plans for dealing with a situation of that kind, a situation which surely ought to be troubling the Minister's conscience, he proceeded to skittle away from the Pearse Street Office to tell us that the Department was opening a new district office in Whitehall.  The Minister on one occasion had a predecessor known as Deputy Boland, who, in his salad days, told us that the Post Office had plans for the rebuilding of the Pearse Street office, that these plans had reached such an advanced stage that the now cautious Minister for Justice felt he could assure the House that the new building would be erected in 1941.  This is 1945, and the Pearse Street building is to-day almost the same as it was 15 years ago.  Not a new brick has been laid since then. In fact, the building has been deteriorating in the meantime.</P>
    <P>The present Minister has been delightfully silent as to what the Post Office propose to do in the way of erecting a new central sorting and delivery office.  I would like to ask him, because he cannot ride away from <Col N="536" /> his responsibility in this matter, if any decision has been reached with regard to the disused distillery that has been masquerading as a central sorting and delivery office in Pearse Street?  Has the Post Office secured the site on which they propose to build a new office?  Have any plans been prepared for the erection of a new office?  Have these plans been approved by the Board of Works, and has Finance sanction been secured for the erection of a new building?  Has the Post Office got the consent of the Department of Industry and Commerce and Department of Supplies to proceed with this work under a post-war priority plan, and, if all these formalities have been completed, will the Minister now say when work on the erection of the new building is likely to be provided?  These are matters of very considerable importance to the staff to whom the Minister paid a tribute a short time ago. Many of them are much more interested to know what the Minister proposes to do in Pearse Street than in what he proposes to do elsewhere.  I should be glad if the Minister would give us some definite evidence that the Post Office is alive to the necessity of providing suitable offices in Pearse Street, that it realises its responsibility in the matter and that the present Minister will try to put a face on the now rather reckless promise which was made by his predecessor, Deputy Boland, when he said that the new office would be erected in 1941.</P>

      <P>I should like to know what the policy of the Post Office is in respect of the erection of telephone kiosks in small towns.  In a number of those small towns, the post office service is not available after 8, 9, or 10 o'clock.  Again, in many of those small towns, there are no kiosks.  In some of these small towns and large villages, there are no Gárda barracks, with the result that, if a person requires to <Col N="537" /> make an urgent telephone call, he must go to a private house and ask leave to use the 'phone.  It is not right, when we have a national telephone service, that that service should not be available in cases of urgency. Take the case of Leixlip, eight miles from the city.  There are no Gárda barracks there and there is no telephone kiosk there.  I think that the post office service there closes about 8 o'clock.  If you want an urgent telephone call after 8 o'clock, you must go to one of the few subscribers in the town and ask permission to use his telephone.  I realise that there may be difficulty, in present circumstances, in getting the type of coin-box which is used in telephone kiosks.  That may explain why such kiosks are not generally available in small towns and large villages, but I should like to ascertain from the Minister the policy of the Post Office so far as the extension of the kiosk service is concerned. Would the Post Office be prepared, in cases such as I have mentioned, to meet the public demand by installing kiosks in view of the exceptional circumstances? I have no doubt that there are many similar cases.</P>
      <P>There is another matter to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention in the hope of inducing him to move with much more alacrity than he has moved during the past few years.  A few years ago, the urban area of Howth was absorbed, for administrative purposes, into the City of Dublin and became as much a part of the city as Rathgar, Fairview, Whitehall or Phibsboro'.  As a matter of fact, the citizens of Howth elect members to Dublin Corporation.  When Howth existed as a separate urban area, the staff at the Howth office were paid on the basis of an office located in a small urban area.  Howth was brought into the City of Dublin for municipal purposes a few years ago and is now subject to Dublin rates and Dublin administration.  Because of that, the staff ought to be paid on the same basis as the staff employed within the jurisdiction of the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A case was made to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that Howth, <Col N="538" /> which was a thriving urban area and had characteristics resembling the suburban characteristics of Rathmines, Ballsbridge and Rathfarnham, should be recognised as part of the City of Dublin and that the staff should be paid on the same basis as the staff in other offices in Dublin.  It was pointed out to the Minister that the moment Howth was incorporated in the Dublin area, the Department of Local Government, which used to pay widows and orphans non-contributory pensions on the scale appropriate to Howth when it was an independent urban area&mdash; that is to say, on the Class III scale&mdash; issued instructions that, in future, widows' and orphans' non-contributory pensions should be paid on the same scale as in the City of Dublin.  In other words, the Department of Local Government recognised that the whole character of Howth had been changed when the district was brought within the jurisdiction of the City of Dublin. Consequently, persons in receipt of widows' and orphans' non-contributory pensions in that area had their pensions stepped up from Class III to Class I.  The Department of Industry and Commerce, which administers unemployment assistance, makes these payments on the basis of a certain scale for Dublin and the county boroughs, on another scale for areas with a population of 7,000, and on a third scale for areas with a population less than 7,000.  That Department also recongnised that the characteristics of Howth had undergone a change and stepped up the scale of unemployment benefit from Class III to Class I.  Dublin Corporation, when Howth was amalgamated with the City of Dublin, imposed an urban rate in the Howth area and, in respect of new lettings of cottages handed over to them, charged as if Howth were, in fact, portion of the City of Dublin. We heard the Minister for Local Government saying in this House that the Corporation had rightly levied rates on the Howth area in the same way as rates were levied on other portions of the city.  Notwithstanding that all this evidence has been submitted to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, notwithstanding that it has been shown that other Government Departments <Col N="539" /> have been recognising the change in the characteristics of Howth because of its incorporation in the city, notwithstanding that he has been urged for almost two years to recognise what other Government Departments have already recognised, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has maintained for some time a stony silence.</P>
    <P>The Minister must recognise that the merits of the claim for raising the scale of wages in Howth area, and in any other areas which may be brought within the ambit of Dublin Corporation, are unchallengeable.  So far, the Minister has not indicated what he intends to do in the matter.  I put it to him that he cannot abstain any longer, in equity, from recognition of the claim that the staff at Howth should be paid at the same rate as the staff at Rathgar, Phibsboro', James' Street and other portions of the city.  I hope the Minister will tell us that he will put an end to that long-continued injustice and pay the proper rates of wages to those employed in the Howth area.</P>
    <P>Another matter which has been the subject of representations to the Minister for close on two years is the question of recognising the claims of temporary officers to some pay when they are, unfortunately, stricken with illness and unable to attend for duty. The House may be interested to know that there are full-time temporary officers with a service of up to 15 and 17 years.  Yet, notwithstanding the fact that they may have served 15 or 17 years, if they are out stick for a single day, the Post Office does not pay one farthing for that day, in spite of the long service they have given. Representations have been made to the Minister in respect of these employees. It has been pointed out that in other Government Departments a certain scale of sick pay is allowed for a period in the case of person who have a certain minimum service.  The Minister has been urged to apply to the temporary staff in the Post Office the same conditions as are operative in respect of other Government Departments.  I think the Minister now recognises the merits of the case which has been submitted and there <Col N="540" /> are some indications that the Department is prepared to concede the claim but so far there has been no crystallisation of the extent to which the Department has agreed to meet the precise claim which was submitted.  I should like, therefore, if the Minister could on this occasion indicate what exactly the Post Office intend to do in the matter and what is the precise nature of the sick pay regulations which in future will apply to temporary officers of all grades.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that the Post Office last year yielded the staggering surplus of £147,000.  Approximately £250,000 of a surplus was yielded on the telephone service.  One could in normal circumstances afford to take pride in an achievement of that kind if one felt satisfied that those who toiled in a Department of that kind were well paid but, of course, that is not the position.  While the Minister tells the House of the fact that the Post Office telephone service is yielding a surplus of approximately £250,000 per annum, the Minister must know that he is responsible for the employment in the telephone service of people under the most appallingly bad conditions.  There is quite a considerable number of persons who are known as temporary night telephonists. There is another class known as part-time temporary night telephonists. These part-time night telephonists are employed for a period of three hours at night, from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m.  They are paid notoriously low wages, so low, in fact, that the Post Office cannot keep them in employment because, when those folk are recruited from the employment exchange and when they learn the wages, and experience the conditions under which they have to work, the boys take themselves away and say: &ldquo;I would not work under those conditions.  I would not work for those rates of pay.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In answer to a question here, the Minister recently told me that 14 of these part-time telephonists who had been trained, after being trained decided they would leave because they were not prepared to continue to work for such rates of pay.  I put it to the Minister that it is a most unsatisfactory condition of affairs to have the <Col N="541" /> chief telephone exchange of the country staffed on the basis of employing persons from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. at wretchedly low rates of wages whilst employed for that period.  The Minister, surely, should be able to organise his telephone staff on the basis of providing full-time employment for these people.  It seems to me nothing short of an outrage that the Minister should be talking of a surplus of £247,000 on the telephone service while persons are being employed in that service for as short a period as 18 hours a week.  Many of these workers have no other employment whatever.  To employ people for 18 hours a week with the pittance which they get for this work, a pittance which is not even sufficient to induce them to remain any length of time at the work, whilst talking about a surplus of approximately £250,000 seems to me rather strange and ironic.</P>
    <P>At one time, of course, the Post Office used to tell us that the whole postal system would collapse unless the service was saturated with part-time labour.  By dint of constant effort over a long period of years, it was demonstrated that part-time labour in Dublin could be abolished.  As a result of constant pressure by the staff organisation, approximately 150 part-time duties were abolished, and now there is no part-time employment on the postal side in the City of Dublin.  If at one time you went to the Post Office and said that part-time duty should be abolished, the authorities would hold up their hands in holy horror and say the thing simply could not be done. But it was done, and the Post Office has continued to make a greater profit every day since, while the service has not been impaired in the sightest.</P>
    <P>If it was possible to do that in respect of 150 duties on the postal side, by the conversion of these duties to full-time duties, surely it should be possible to apply a similar remedy in respect of part-time duties in the telephone section, and abolish the present system by providing full-time employment in the telephone exchange.  As a matter of fact, those who know the inside story are aware that conditions in the telephone exchange are very far from satisfactory.  Many of these <Col N="542" /> people who are employed to work from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. are beseeched to come in at 7 o'clock because the place is in a jam and in a panic.  Again, when they are about to leave at 11 o'clock, they are beseeched to remain on until 12 o'clock.  Not only that; they are entitled to one rest night in the week, but they are asked to come in on that rest night, and told that the office cannot be properly staffed unless they come in.</P>
    <P>Did anybody ever hear of worse huckstering with a national telephone service than that?  People who are supposed to be employed from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. are asked to come in at 7 o'clock to get the service out of a jam, and again when the lads are leaving at about 11 o'clock, they are asked to stop on until midnight.  They are even asked to sacrifice their rest night in order to keep things going.  The Post Office is sufficiently insolent to ask for an explanation as to why they will not come in on a rest night.  One would think that these employees were getting a retaining fee of £1,000 a year instead of being paid the miserable sum which the Post Office gives them for 18 hours a week.  I put it to the Minister that this is a disgraceful method of administering a national telephone service, huckstering with staff hours in this way, paying low rates of wages, and keeping the service perpetually in a panic, with the question eternally cropping up: &ldquo;What will to-night be like if so-and-so does not come in at 7 o'clock, or if he is not prepared to remain on until 12 o'clock to-night?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is not a very big problem, but it is a vicious problem so far as those who are its victims are concerned.  It is a problem easily capable of solution. With a surplus of £247,000 on the telephone service, the Minister ought to recognise that the evil of part-time employment in the telephone service should be brought to an end and that the persons concerned should be paid a decent wage on a full-time basis, the part-time duty being extended so as to create full-time duties in the interest of those who are employed on those duties and in the interest of providing a better and more efficient service for the community.</P>
    <P>In March last I raised on a Supplementary <Col N="543" /> Estimate in this House the question of providing pensions for auxiliary postmen and the Minister then sought refuge in a statement that this was a problem that affected other Departments and could only be considered in conjuction with other Departments. I say to the Minister this does not affect other Departments in the same way as it affects the Post Office Department.  There are approximately 2,600 auxiliary postmen in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. A large number of these officers give service up to 40 years.  Some of them give service even in excess of 40 years. When they go out at the end of 30, 40, or 50 years, as the case may be, they may get a grant from a fund known as the Minister's Special Fund. If they happen to have a son or daughter working and living with them they get no grant whatever.  If they happen in these days to have a son or daughter in England sending home money then, the Post Office says, notwithstanding a man's 40 or 50 years' service: &ldquo;You will get nothing in respect of that service because John Bull is paying your son or daughter and your son or daughter is sending money back to you&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I think Pharaoh was tender-hearted, compared to those who could adopte that stony-hearted attitude towards those who had served them for 40 or 50 years.  If the Minister was an employer, and if a man who had served him for 40 or 50 years was leaving, I wonder would he just shake hands with him and say: &ldquo;Now, Pat, thank you very much.  You have a daughter at home and a son earning in England and I cannot see my way to give you anything.&rdquo; That would be all against the laws of justice and an infraction of the Constitution.  I am sure that the Minister would not do anything like that.  But that is what the Post Office Department is doing to people who were employed in it for 40 or 50 years. In many cases they are given no gratuity, and no recognition for the long service given to the community, and to the State as distinct from the community.  It is true that some in very needy circumstances may get <Col N="544" /> grants from the Minister's Special Fund.  The grants are trival, when you think of the services rendered by auxiliary postmen, particularly those working in exposed coastal areas for periods of 40 or 50 years.  Many of these men work from 30 to 33 hours weekly.  If we take 33 hours as an example, and the normal attendance for a full-time established postman as 44 hours, many of those who work for 33 hours are doing what is three-fourths of a full week's work.  Although they serve for three-fourths of a week they get no recognition whatever for that service.  If they were established officers, working 44 hours weekly, they would have to get recognition under the superannuation code, but not being established full-time officers they get nothing as a matter of right, and as a return for their services, even though they worked three-fourths of a week for 40 or 50 years.  I put it to the Minister that he cannot possibly justify that kind of almost inhuman treatment of a large section of people who serve the community in such circumstances as to draw praise from the Minister and from Deputies.  The common answer of the Minister is that there are people in other Departments similarly affected.  The hard core is in the Post Office Department.  The real grievance exists in there because people employed there have rates of wages less than those operative in other Departments.  In this case the Minister has a moral responsibility of which he cannot divest himself merely by saying that there are other people like them employed elsewhere.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion I raised this question I endeavoured to enlist the Minister's sympathy.  The Minister was then oozing sympathy.  I put it to him now that whatever sympathy he may or may not have, he has a moral responsibility, and that in conscience, as the ultimate employer, he is bound to take some steps as a member of the Government to try to remedy the situation. The Minister has all the powers of an individual Minister to raise this matter.  He has as much power as any Minister to initiate correspondence with the Minister for Finance calling attention to the existence of this problem.  I put it to the Minister now, <Col N="545" /> knowing that he has a moral responsibility, that he should initiate proposals to remedy it.  If the Minister, during his period of office, has not displayed any sympathy towards claims presented to him on a number of occasions, now that the war situation cannot be used as an excuse for postponing consideration of them, I hope he will be able to announce in the House this evening that he is impressed with the claims of these people for a pension on retirement, and that he will undertake to have it sympathetically examined so as to remedy what has been too long a scandal to the whole administration of the Post Office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that there has been an enormous increase in the telephone service.  That is to be expected, because that service will eventually supersede the telegraph and, to some extent, the letter services.  We were promised an improvement in the trunk service when new equipment was provided.  There was a substantial improvement for a while, but I think it has lapsed again, because my experience has been that there was unreasonable delay in trunk calls.  Possibly the Minister will look into that matter.  I want to ascertain what steps are being taken to provide a really efficient telephone service for the agricultural community in rural Ireland.  Are any plans being developed to provide such a service at a reasonable charge?  There has been a good deal of talk about agricultural development here, and about competition with other countries.  In respect to this service other countries have advantages that our people have not. The telephone service throughout rural Ireland would make for expedition in agricultural affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can appreciate what a tremendous advantage it would be to people living in remote districts if they could ring up neighbours when they required the use of a machine or wished to have a conversation.  I hope the Minister will be able to tell the House that the question of extension is under consideration. I do not know whether the Electricity Supply Board poles that will be used for rural electrification <Col N="546" /> could carry telephone wires.  The whole problem is a very big one and is well worth going into to see if such a service could be provided at a reasonable charge.  So far as telegraphs is concerned, it is a dying service and, as it is continuing to shrink, the Minister should consider the question of the charges for telegraph delivery in rural areas.  This matter is raised every year.  The charges are excessive and, at certain times, they constitute a hardship.  In the case of a death in a poor family, if a number of telegrams expressing sympathy arrive, to charges for delivery constitute a hardship.  This service is a State service; it is not conducted by a private institution; and the people living in remote districts are entitled to equal consideration with the people living in more densely populated districts. That applies also to the two-day delivery postal service.  The delivery generally in rural areas is slow. I do not wish to stress that point because I appreciate the difficulties, such as lack of transport.  It is often difficult for business people to post early in small towns.  Their customers may not place their orders in time for early posting.  The matter is not a simple one.  I merely want to say that I hope the Minister will continue to give every possible attention to that particular problem, and that he will secure more expeditious delivery.  There is a fairly substantial increase in the Estimate for road services&mdash;£2,500.  Whether that is due to a further deterioration of the rail services or to an effort to improve existing services, I do not know.  I would hardly expect that the position has further deteriorated in the last 12 months.  I hope the Minister will be able to tell us that something definite is being done in planning for what is going to be the premier service in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the dissatisfaction that exists in the Dun Laoghaire area in connection with labour employed in the Dun Laoghaire section. Last January established men received an increase of 10/- a week, cost-of-living bonus, while some other men got only 1/- a week increase.  These <Col N="547" /> men feel they have a great grievance. The Minister must be aware that there is dissatisfaction in that particular branch.  While he has not given the increase to these men, he has reduced the Estimate this year by £7,000.</P>
      <P>In the rural areas the linesmen have a very large area to cover, very often in inclement weather.  I recommend that these men be supplied either with a small car or a motor cycle.  They may have to cover 15 to 20 miles, and it is difficult to do that with a push-bicycle. The Minister, I think, would find that the provision of a car or motor cycle would be economic because if he examines the records I think he will see that it is costing the State much more in sick pay than it would cost to provide proper facilities for the work.</P>
      <P>I do not want to repeat what has been said in other years about the small wages paid to the auxiliary postmen. That has been raised year after year and, no matter what appeal is made, there seems to be no change in the Government's outlook in that respect.  I think it is in the Minister's power to reconsider the wages being paid in the Dun Laoghaire area. If it is in his power, I would appeal to him to take courage in his hands and to fight the Department of Finance in that matter and not to have every Minister subject to the Department of Finance.  The Minister is in charge of the Department and he should realise that it is in his interests that there should be satisfaction and contentment, in the whole service.  If he wants to secure satisfaction and contentment, he can do so by obtaining justice for these men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some items to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention.  In the first place, can he indicate to the House any hope of a reduction in the rentals on telephones? I know the Minister would like to see telephones multiplied possibly by ten or 12, but I am aware of the fact that materials are scarce and, when available, are rather expensive.  I can appreciate the difficulties which attend the whole question, but, now that the war is over and that materials may become plentiful and perhaps cheaper, I was wondering if the Minister would consider the question of reducing those rentals, and reducing the charges of the telephone service generally.  At the moment they are prohibitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just one other matter to which I want to refer.  The staff of the Cork Post Office&mdash;a more courteous lot of officials it would be difficult to find; that is my experience and the common experience of every user of the Post Office service from day to day <Col N="549" />&mdash;are at times considerably overworked. There are rush hours, the periods when pensions are being paid out and so on, when the officials are run off their feet.  Some arrangement should be made whereby the ordinary citizen who just wants to buy a half dozen 2½d. stamps can be catered for. They have not quite got into the queuing-up system at those counters, and sometimes considerable delay is caused to business people and other users of that very central Post Office. Of course, there are delays in the smaller offices, too, but they are infinitesimal compared with those in the General Post Office in Cork City. There are occasions during the week when the staff is quite sufficient, but they are definitely overworked during the periods I have mentioned, and I would ask the Minister to see if something could be done to ease that position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like briefly to add my voice to the plea made here this evening in regard to one class of employee in this Department, the auxiliary postmen.  In recent times particularly, attention has been called to a number of cases which could only be described as a disgrace even to any private employer.  I brought to the notice of the Department recently the case of a man with 46 years' service, who had never been away from his employment through illness or anything else.  He has given 46 years' faithful service, but now, owing to rheumatism contracted through wettings in the course of his employment, he will be unable to carry on his duties much longer.  As has been pointed out by previous speakers, if that man had given 46 years' service to the meanest private employer he would get some material recognition in his old age.  I want to ask the Minister to see that this matter will be considered.  Everybody in the rural areas knows how faithful those auxiliary postmen are in carrying out their duties.  In many cases they have to walk through boreens over which nobody but themselves and the dwellers in the house at the other end ever travel.  In view of their whole conditions of service, I think the least <Col N="550" /> they might get at the end of 46 years is some material recognition which would keep them out of the county home.</P>
      <P>I should also like briefly to refer to the position in recent times in the General Post Office in Kilkenny City. The Minister knows that many complaints have been made, both in this House and outside it, in regard to this matter.  Due to the expansion of social services, the payment of children's allowances and so on, the premises in the City of Kilkenny known as the General Post Office would not do credit to a town with one-third of Kilkenny City's population. I sincerely hope that the Minister will get the experts of his Department to examine that premises to see in what way the structure could be rearranged in order to give greater space and facility to the public.  I believe that the premises could be very much improved if the matter were looked into by the competent people in the Minister's Department.</P>
      <P>Another matter which I mentioned to the former Secretary to the Minister's Department some short time ago was the manner in which the mail car work is carried out in the City of Kilkenny.  Up to the petrol shortage, we had petrol-driven vans, but for some years past an open dray has been used, and many people have complained to me that postal parcels are saturated with rain when they receive them.  If that kind of car is to be used, there ought to be proper protection for the parcels.  Another subject of complaint is that this type of vehicle is unsuitable for the proper transit of such things as egg boxes and so on.  At this stage, it might be possible for the Minister to restore the motor vans.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I sincerely hope that this will be the last year that members of this House will have to appeal to the Minister for some Christian consideration for auxiliary postmen on retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have mentioned here on previous Estimate debates a matter very similar to that raised by Deputy Anthony to-night, except that my complaint relates to the City of Dublin <Col N="551" /> while his relates to the City of Cork. Anyone who has experience of providing staff for retail trade knows the difficulty of maintaining a staff adequate to deal with the rush hours. If one keeps on duty all the time a staff sufficient to deal with the rush hours, one has a redundant staff for probably three-fourths of the day. Nevertheless, the Post Office is a public service, and I can assure the Minister, speaking as a businessman, that if I ignominiously failed to provide a staff adequate to deal with the business transacted in my shop on a market day in Ballaghaderreen I would very quickly lose my custom on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. I have got to maintain such a staff as will obviate the necessity of my customers queuing-up on the market day, which is Friday, for the very excellent reason that my customers would not queue up; they would go and deal in another shop.</P>
      <P>If you have a Government monopoly, which is a public service, it is true that that kind of pressure cannot be brought upon it, because there is nowhere else you can buy stamps, but that puts a peculiar obligation upon a Government Department to see that they will, from a sense of duty, provide the same standard of service that they would provide were competition the spur, and the Minister has grave grounds for apology if he is obliged to come before this House and say: &ldquo;During rush hours in the General Post Office I know that my employees are overworked, and I know that, overworked though they are, the public is not getting satisfactory service.&rdquo;  If this is to be the permanent attitude of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, it means, first, that they are bad employers, and secondly, that they are incompetent business people, and that is an indictment to which they should not leave themselves open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know all the stock answers the Minister is going to make&mdash;that if he has enough staff there all the time to deal with the few rush hours, he will have a redundant staff in the meantime. Let him go down to any country shopkeeper in Ireland, and he will tell <Col N="552" /> him how to deal with that problem. Let him go to Clery's to Todd's, to Arnott's, to Switzer's, or to Brown Thomas's, and ask them what they do on sale days.</P>
    <P>He will find that they have a reserve of assistants on their permanent staff which they can switch to the counter to serve the public coming in or else they go out and hire a temporary staff. Let the Minister make up his mind that, if the counter staff in the Post Office cannot be maintained at a sufficiently high level to provide for the rush hours, a system of subsidiary pay will be provided for officers working in other parts of the building to compensate them for coming down and assisting the counter staff to meet the rush hour demand.  That is only one of many possible solutions.  Ministers are continually saying that there is no use in finding fault if you do not propose a remedy.  There is a remedy.  There are about 600 employees in the post office building.  Let the Minister bring down the clerks, the typists and the runners from upstairs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Or the Minister himself &mdash;to wait on the public.  I was at a picture showing the late President Wilson, Lord have mercy on his soul, during the last war when he was at a railway station serving out refreshments to the soldiers going to the war. If the President of the United States can put an apron round his middle to wait on soldiers going to the war, the Minister or his subordinates might roll up their sleeves to wait on the public, if the necessity for it exists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a dignified costume that any man might be proud to wear.  Seriously, if there are employees of the Department in the building they ought not be above coming down and waiting on those who employ them, namely, the public.  If there are people working in the building, they ought not to be above coming down and lending a hand to their fellow-workers, if the burden of work becomes unduly heavy at any particular part of the day. <Col N="553" /> Now I want to refer to an incident relating to the Kerry Gaeltacht.  I am not going to be more particular in locating the incident than to refer to the Kerry Gaeltacht.  I say that the Department has a very special responsibility to ensure that every servant of theirs in the Gaeltacht is able to transact his business, be it humble or exalted, through the medium of the people's vernacular, just as people have that obligation in regard to their employees in Dublin, or in Cork, or in Monaghan.  The vernacular of the people in the Kerry Gaeltacht is Irish. Therefore, I say that every employee in the Post Office working in the Kerry Gaeltacht should be able to transact all his business through the medium of Irish.</P>
      <P>I know of a case where there was a temporary postman working in the Kerry Gaeltacht filling the place of a permanent postman until such time as a permanent appointment was made. As some Deputies will understand, these temporary appointments often last for years, and this man was running the post in this particular area for a long time.  He spoke Irish before he ever learned English.  Irish was his vernacular; English was to him a foreign tongue.  Like many another man in the country, he was handier with the spade than with the pen; but he was able to transact the business of the post in Irish, to read the addresses and to deliver the letters correctly, and no fault was ever found with his execution of his duty.  In due course the Post Office proceeded to fill the permanent post and, amongst other candidates who presented themselves, was the temporary postman.  There were also some learned men who had drawn their learning from the volumes of O'Growney, and after the academic test imposed on the candidates, one of the learned men got the post and the temporary postman found himself out of a job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My information is that the gentleman who got the job is not able to talk to the people in Irish.  His vernacular is English, and if anyone asks him what time it is or engages him in any casual conversation he is not able to reply.  If they ask him to run on a <Col N="554" /> message for them, he is not able to execute their commands unless their commands are addressed to him in the English language.</P>
    <P>Now I suppose that any system of a rigid kind may slip up occasionally.  I do not want to dragoon the Department or suggest that they are inimical to the Irish language; I know they are not.  But they will want to be very careful to ensure that an employee chosen for work in the Gaeltacht is furnished with something more than an academic knowledge of the language; their primary solicitude should be to see that he has Gaeilge as an gcliabhán.  That, I know, can only be satisfactorily ascertained by an oral test and interview.  I appreciate that the Post Office may feel that giving primary importance to an oral interview might create a situation in which a less equipped person would get the job in preference to somebody who is better equipped but who was, in some way or another, not as fluent at an interview as the successful candidate. Such precautions as are feasible should be taken to allay any apprehension on that score, but the prime purpose to be kept in mind is that a sub-postmaster or a postmaster or any other employee of the Department in the Gaeltacht should be able to transact his business through the people's vernacular, just as similar employees in the Galltacht should be equipped to use the vernacular of the people living there.</P>
    <P>I suspect the Minister knows the case to which I am referring but, if any ambiguity remains in his mind, I shall be pleased to furnish him in private with the specific instance, thus avoiding the undesirable practice of referring to an individual in the House.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies have spoken about temporary postmen.  There is not the slightest doubt that the position of temporary postmen in this country is very anachronistic.  I should like some Deputies who are pressing on the Minister all the things that I would like to press on him to tell me how we are to get out of the difficulty of establishing the temporary postmen.  I think I am right in saying that if a postman is <Col N="555" /> put on the establishment the Department is entitled to move him anywhere within the postal service.  Is not that so?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, a great many temporary postmen in this country do not want to take employment which makes them liable to be transferred 15, 20 or 40 miles from their homes.  On the other hand, it does not seem to be a very practical proposition to appoint a civil servant on the basis that he is entitled to tell his employers where he is prepared to work in the service.  If he becomes a full-time servant of the State, presumably he ought to work where the State wants him to work Deputy Norton is familiar with the problem from the point of view of the temporary postmen; we all are, because the temporary postman is the neighbour and the familiar friend of most of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had exactly the same dilemma put to me with regard to a district court clerk.  A number of these are not established civil servants and are anxious to be established.  The Minister for Justice is quite prepared to establish them if they will accept the conditions of establishment.  Their reply is: &ldquo;We do not want to be shifted to the other end of the country, because we have a number of other little jobs which, taken together with the district court clerk's salary, make a decent income.  If we move to another part of the country we will lose all our ancillary jobs and find it hard to live on the district court clerk's salary alone.&rdquo;  Therefore, I find myself in a dilemma.  Am I to say to the Minister for Justice: &ldquo;You must establish this man and give him a guarantee that he is to go on working in this area whether you want him to or not&rdquo;?  I think it is true of most temporary postmen that they do not live on their wages.  They have other little employments of one kind or another in a particular district, and it would not suit them to be transferred to the other end of the country.  Is it practical then to establish a man as a permanent full-time <Col N="556" /> civil servant and at the same time guarantee that, unless he is willing to be transferred, he will not be transferred? I may be wrong, but it does not seem practicable to me.  If anyone can suggest a remedy for that, I would be very glad to hear of it.</P>
    <P>However, I do not think that that places any block in the way of the matter raised by Deputy Pattison.  All the local authorities have temporary and established servants.  The established servants are entitled to pensions on a scale; the unestablished servants are entitled to a gratuity when they retire.  I do not think the Minister will challenge what I understood Deputy Pattison asked for, and that was that if an unestablished postman has served 20 or 30 years, at the end of his time he should get a gratuity, if not a pension, of a reasonable sum.  I believe that is a proposal which most members of the House will feel is equitable, and about which I do not see any real practical difficulty arising. I commend the proposal that some recognition of these men's service should be given to them, particularly where they have been in the service of he Post Office as temporary workers or a protracted period.</P>
    <P>Talking of that draws me to the sub-post offices.  The theory with regard to sub-post offices is that if some old lady in the country gets a sub-post office, she ought to keep a shop, and between the two she would have a airly good living, but none of them would be expected to live on the income from the sub-post office.  I think that is a rotten system.  There is a emptation to everybody employing labour in this country to try to get somebody who is living at home, or to try to get an old broken-down penioner and pay to that person less than just wage and keep the difference in ne's pocket.  It is a thoroughly rotten principle.  If you employ a person to do a particular job, you ought to pay that person; if you are not prepared to say such persons, then do not employ them at all.</P>
    <P>If the people of Ballaghaderreen or Castleblayney or Glaslough want a sub-post office, then they ought to pay a postmistress or a postmaster to do the <Col N="557" /> work in that office, but they have no right as a community to go to some poor woman or hard-pressed man and say: &ldquo;Because we know you are prepared to take less than a living wage owing to your special circumstances, we will give you less than a living wage to do the particular job we want done&rdquo;.  That is very undesirable and ought to be put an end to.  If it is to be put an end to, the right way to do it is to review the whole system of operating post offices at the present time, because the existing system is putting a premium, from the Department's point of view, on multiplying the number of sub-post offices.</P>
    <P>I have one case in mind&mdash;and again, I shall give the Minister the name in confidence if he asks me&mdash;of what is called a sub-post office, where one post-mistress has died of a stroke and the other post-mistress there will not die of a stroke because she is determined she will not so far exert herself as to incur a stroke.  But she will give everybody else in the town a stroke, and the reason is that her remuneration is not sufficient to permit of her hiring the help she requires to operate the post office and, being a very sensible woman, she has no intention of killing herself on the job.  The public have to take such service as the efforts she is prepared to expend will provide, and if they want any further service, they can go whistle for it so far as she is concerned because, sensibly enough, she says: &ldquo;One pair of hands cannot do the work of four; I am paid so much and out of that I have to pay an assistant and what is left would not feed a sparrow and only I am very abstemious I might be dead to-to-morrow&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A woman in that position ought to be an established servant, running the post office in the ordinary way and let the public, if they are unable to get the service that they are entitled to expect, demand of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs the provision of additional employees and, if they can satisfy the Minister that the business is of sufficient volume to justify the employment of additional hands, he would have to send additional workers. But the neighbours in that town cannot go to that post-mistress, knowing the <Col N="558" /> income she is getting from the Department, and ask her to hire extra help because we know that if she did the extra help would be &ldquo;sweated&rdquo; and she could not afford to pay an adequate wage; even if she paid them an inadequate wage, she would have little left for herself.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say: &ldquo;Are we then to close down the small post offices in outlying areas where it would be manifestly ridiculous to maintain a permanent employee?&rdquo; I do not think that that obligation devolves upon the Minister at all.  I think he will find that the bulk of the business transacted in these cross-road shops would be the sale of stamps and possibly postal orders and instead of appointing a post-master or a post-mistress for these areas I would farm out the right to sell stamps; I would appoint agents for the sale of stamps and, if the people want other post office facilities, let them travel to the neighbouring post office or, if they want a post office in a district which it would be manifestly uneconomic to maintain, let them by way of memorial to the Minister ask him to levy in their area the sum necessary to maintain the post office and provide it for them.  I think in the vast majority of cases no such memorial would reach the Minister. If he provides facilities for the purchase of stamps and postal orders in these peculiarly remote areas, the people would be quite content to travel three or four miles to the nearest suboffice if they want any more elaborate conveniences from the Department.</P>
    <P>I want to give the devil his due in regard to telephones in one sense, and then to give him his due in another sense on the same topic.  A great deal of difficulty has been experienced by a number of people in getting telephones during the emergency.  I have made representations to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in a very large number of cases where people have put forward special circumstances which would justify the installation of a telephone.  The vast majority of those applications have been turned down, but I am constrained to say, although it may not please some of my constituents for whom I failed to get telephones, that I cannot deny that in <Col N="559" /> every case where I felt the want was real and urgent the Post Office went to the most extreme lengths possible to get the equipment necessary to install the telephone and did, in fact, provide one.</P>
    <P>In the vast majority of cases the want was acute, no doubt, but compared with the demands of more urgent services I was constrained to admit that the Post Office people were right in saying: &ldquo;These other applicants will have to wait until the supply position becomes better.  Bad as their wants may be more urgent wants remain unfilled.&rdquo;  Therefore, I must acknowledge with appreciation the exertions that the telephone division of the Department has made, with a very limited quantity of equipment at its disposal, to meet every reasonably urgent requirement in regard to telephones.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I find the greatest fault in the Department is the deplorable trunk service.  There is not the slightest doubt that, admitting all the difficulties with which they have to contend, resulting from the inadequate supply, there is something radically wrong with the personnel or the equipment dealing with trunk calls.  Sometimes trunk calls can be had with reasonable expedition, but very frequently the delays are utterly unreasonable. From time to time, I have written to the Department, and I do not deny for a moment that, every time I addressed the Department, the specific complaint I made was exhaustively examined.  In each case, I got a reply setting out the reason for the delay and, where necessary, saying that disciplinary steps had been taken to prevent a recurrence of the cause of the delay.  On other occasions, it was said that the volume of traffic was such that the equipment could not carry it and the delay was unavoidable.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that efficient steps are being taken to do all that might be done in order to get the trunk calls through as quickly as they should be got through, with the equipment that is available.  Whether it is that the assistants are not sufficiently highly <Col N="560" /> trained or whether it is that the equipment, such as it is, is not kept in adequate repair, I am not in a position to say; but a delay of 30 or 40 minutes on a call from Ballaghaderreen to Dublin is not looked upon as fantastic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We must all admit the Minister's difficulties.  I am going a little bit further.  I am alleging that, with the supplies the Minister has, the trunk service is not getting that degree of supervision requisite to extract from it the best it is capable of yielding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If I saw the inside of the exchange in Dublin, I may say that that is true; but the Deputy had not the experience which was so eloquently described on one occasion by &ldquo;Quidnune&rdquo; in the <i>Irish Times</i>, of a trunk call from Tuam to Dublin, in the course of which the caller heard two railway porters discussing whether &ldquo;that ould wagon had passed down the line or not&rdquo; and, having successfully disposed of them, he heard a man asking &ldquo;whether the greyhound had had pups yet&rdquo; and, after that person, it seems that there was someone who wanted to know &ldquo;if that was Mrs. Slattery&rdquo;&mdash; and then he threw his hat at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That was interference on the line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see that it is reasonable that that kind of interference should take place, if the trunk line between two points in this country <Col N="561" /> were efficiently and effectively staffed. We must remember that the strength of any line is its weakest link.  You may have highly efficient staffs at both ends, but put an utterly untrained person at any two stages on the line and you may cause complete chaos in a system which, if left to the two ends, would work efficiently.  I think it ought to be practicable to resolve a problem of that kind.</P>
      <P>I know a case in the city last week&mdash; and here again the Minister can have the name privately, if he wishes to have it&mdash;where a telephone began to ring at, I think, 2 o'clock in the morning. It rang continuously until 3.30, when an irate householder hurried downstairs and took off the receiver in despair.  An employee of the telephone service called at the house within an hour of being summoned the following morning.  He carried out the most elaborate repairs and stepped on his bicycle, but he had not turned the corner when the telephone began to ring again, in a sibilant whisper.  It rang all day until about 6 o'clock. Again, the Post Office was approached through another telephone and, promptly, an engineer was on the scene.  This time he gutted the whole installation and left, with profound apologies for the trouble.  The hiss of his bicycle tyre had not ceased when the telephone began to ring again.</P>
      <P>Further representations were made and again&mdash;that is the disarming quality of the Post Office, that they never fail in courtesy or in consideration and, apparently, they never lose their temper&mdash;the men arrived, this time armed with a completely new instrument. They rooted out the whole installation and put in this new instrument. Night had not faded into dawn before the new instrument began to tinkle again.  At ten o'clock this morning, there was a man out again, rooting most energetically, and the last report I had from the front, speaking on the telephone a quarter of an hour ago, was that everything was functioning normally, but the whole family were standing around agog, waiting to see if the instrument would begin whistling again.  There seems to be some very big miscarriage of exertion in a case of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What worries me is that I hate to seem to complain about men such as those who tried to carry out these repairs.  In every case their attendance was prompt, in every case their zeal was admirable, in every case they were manifestly anxious to get the job done and to be obliging in every possible way.  It then seems a poor thanks-offering for their admirable demeanour, to be making a complaint out of their failure to achieve their purpose.  I think there is some kind of inefficiency, as in the case of the intermediate stations on the trunk line.  It is not goodwill that is lacking, but the ability to give effect to the excellent intentions of what, in my experience, has proved to be a very well-intentioned Department.</P>
      <P>The last point I would refer to is one which was made the subject of comment in more than one Report of the Committee of Public Accounts, that is, the disappearance of mail bags.  I am not going to deal at length with that, as those who are interested can find it adequately reviewed in the evidence and report of the committee.  However, I would ask the Minister, when dealing with the Vote in his reply, to tell us if the position in regard to mail bags is improving.</P>
      <P>At one time, the losses were quite sensational, as the bags disappeared in thousands.  I believe that a new system of accounting and checking was introduced subsequently, as a result of the comments made by the Committee of Public Accounts.  The House should watch this matter with some vigilance, and the Minister may be in a position to reassure the House that articles as valuable as these and as difficult to replace are not disappearing on the scale they used to disappear.</P>
