      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state what is the position of Irish nationals in the Channel Islands; if he is aware that Irish nurses at King Edward's Sanatorium, Guernsey Island, have been recently removed to Germany and that grave anxiety exists among their parents and relatives at home; and, if so, if he will state if any representations have been or will be made to the responsible authorities for their protection.</P>

      <P>Since June, 1944, the Channel Islands have been completely isolated, and none of the Irish Legations on the Continent has been able to communicate with them.  While this state of affairs continues, it is, of course, impossible to know what is the actual position of our citizens on the islands.</P>
      <P>Previous to this, that is, since the occupation of the Channel Islands in 1940, my Department and the Irish Legations on the Continent took steps which enabled Irish people on the islands to correspond with their relatives in this country by transmitting messages on their behalf to and from the islands.  The Department also endeavoured to secure the repatriation of Irish citizens who desired to return home.  With few exceptions, however, these efforts proved fruitless owing to the very great delays in correspondence and in obtaining the necessary visas and transport for the journey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1414" /> I have no information to suggest that Irish nurses or any other Irish citizens have been removed from any of the Channel Islands to Germany.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if, in view of the penalty inflicted on Mr. Kevin Cleary, Main <Col N="1415" /> Street, Monasterevan, by the revocation of his cycle tyre licence and the fact that it was the sole means of livelihood for himself and his family, he will now consider restoring his licence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Cleary was convicted on nine separate charges of having sold bicycle tyres at prices grossly in excess of the controlled price, and he was also convicted on a number of charges of failure to record sales of tyres and of having made false entries in his records of tyre sales.  I have already indicated in a statement to Dáil Éireann on the 9th July, 1943, that it is necessary for me to ensure that no section of the people will be left dependent for their supplies of essential goods on a trader who has shown himself to be incapable of being trusted to sell these goods at a fair price or to distribute them equitably. It is evident from the offences committed by Mr. Cleary that he is not a fit person to be entrusted with the distribution under emergency conditions of essential goods which are in short supply, and it is not, therefore, my intention to restore his cycle tyre retailer's licence.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware that country millers who are compelled to use wood as fuel for kiln-drying grain for the production of flour are unable to secure that degree of dryness essential for effective grinding and that the resulting flour is very inferior and tends towards wastage; and, if so, if he will consider releasing supplies of anthracite to the millers for this purpose.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that country millers who use fuel other than coal for kiln drying wheat for the production of flour are unable to secure that degree of dryness essential for the production of satisfactory flour.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the existence of any feeding stuff of the description given by the Deputy.  In fact, under the Emergency Powers (Animal Feeding Stuffs) Order, 1944 (S.R. &amp; O., No. 196 of 1944) made by the Minister for Agriculture it is illegal for any person to manufacture or sell any feeding stuff of which sugar-beet pulp is an ingredient.  If, however, the Deputy will furnish fuller details to my Department, including the name of the manufacturer of the feeding stuff he has in mind and the districts in which it is being sold, I will have the matter further examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware of the increasing hardships suffered by doctors, clergymen, hackney owners and light van owners because of the shortage of tyres; and, if so, if he will now make available an adequate supply of tyres, say, two for each vehicle allowed on the road at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the shortage of tyres for light motor vehicles has necessarily resulted in hardships for doctors, clergymen, hackney owners and light van owners, but as I stated on the 23rd February, 1944, in reply to a previous question on this subject, the rubber supply position has necessitated the suspension of the manufacture of tyres for all light motor vehicles and, consequently, new tyres for such vehicles can no longer be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not, therefore, in a position to make tyres available for light motor vehicles as suggested by the Deputy, and I can only suggest that owners of such vehicles should avail themselves of the service operated by the Irish <Col N="1418" /> Dunlop Company Limited, whereby that company will supply remoulded tyres where they are required for immediate use on vehicles engaged on essential services, provided the owners of such vehicles are in a position to forward to the company sound casings suitable for remoulding.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is misinformed as to the position when he asks me to ensure that necessitous people purchasing turf on vouchers will get their supplies during the year at 1/- per cwt.  Under the scheme in Dublin, 11 per cent. of the recipients of fuel are getting supplies from the fuel depots during the winter months entirely free, and 55 per cent. are getting fuel during the same period at 6d. per cwt.  During the winter, those paying 1/- per cwt. constitute only 14 per cent. of the recipients, while persons on low income admitted to the scheme on payment of 2/- per cwt. constitute <Col N="1422" /> 20 per cent. of the recipients. The scheme, which has been in force for the past two years, has been of great benefit to the several classes who participated, and I see no reason to alter the several rates of contribution. The scheme was started originally as a winter scheme and its continuance in the summer months was mainly for the purpose of ensuring that turf supplies would continue to be available for necessitous families, who might otherwise find it difficult to secure constant supplies.</P>

      <P>As has already been indicated by the Taoiseach, it is the Government's intention to retain the Local Defence Force as a component of the National Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that purpose, and having regard to the fact that the present force is raised under the Emergency Powers Act, it will be necessary to bring it within the provisions of the Defence Forces Acts.  It is the Government's intention that the present character <Col N="1424" /> of the Local Defence Force will remain as that of an unpaid force based on local and voluntary training. The existing wide age limits and conditions of enlistment will, however, have to be changed.  Reduction of age limits may lead to the separation from the force of many of the older men who have given loyal and unstinted service during recent years, and it is not inappropriate that I should avail of this opportunity to thank them again for the example of unselfish patriotism they have set and the help they have given in raising and maintaining this great Defence Force and to ask them to continue in service until the end of this emergency. I am confident that they will appreciate that in the post-emergency period it will be necessary to ask them to make way for the younger men who will have to fit themselves to carry the responsibilities borne by their elders in the past.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The wording of the Deputy's question is somewhat confusing, as he uses the word &ldquo;dividing&rdquo;<Col N="1427" /> where presumably he means &ldquo;reselling&rdquo;. I take it that he desires to know how many estates (and the number of holdings and the area therein) are still awaiting resale to the tenants. The number of such estates is not readily available, as in order to obtain it investigation would have to be made into what estates have been partly resold, and there is a number of small residues of estates difficult to dispose of.  As regards holdings awaiting resale, there are on Congested Districts Board estates approximately 15,000 holdings comprising a total area of about 400,000 acres; and on estates of tenanted land purchased by the Land Commission under the Land Acts 1923-39 there are approximately 74,000 holdings, comprising an area of about 2,000,000 acres.  The resale of these holdings has been greatly hindered by the emergency conditions of the past five years, but with the return of the Land Commission staff lent to other Departments, the work of resale will be taken up with vigour.</P>
      <P>The information requested in the second part of the question is not readily available, as it would involve considerable research to follow up the history of each holding vacated by migrants from the congested districts, and I am not prepared to divert staff from their normal duties for this purpose. I am fully aware of the desirebility of expediting the rearrangement of holdings on congested estates, but this is work of exceptional difficulty and will necessarily take time.  Not the least of the difficulties is the reluctance of tenants of rundale holdings to agree to the proposals for rearrangement put forward by the Land Commission.  A number of well-devised schemes have been thereby held up.</P>

      <P>I think it is treating the House almost with impudence to ask Deputies, considering the Bills put before us and the way in which they have been presented, to take a sudden decision to get through the work in a very limited time.  The Government were offered, from various parts of the House, an arrangement to set up a special committee to deal with the Mental Treatment Bill.  The Government decided that they would deal with the matter in the ordinary time of the House.  Of course, that is a matter for the Government, but it is absurd that heavy and substantial legislation should be brought in at this time in such a way as to absorb the few hours that would normally be devoted to Private Members' Business.</P>

If the proposal had been acceptable to the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash; I understand it was acceptable to members of the Government&mdash;we could <Col N="1431" /> have disposed of the Mental Treatment Bill last week while the House at the same time was discussing the Vote on Account.  Because the Government would not accept that proposal, a proposal which was designed to facilitate the Government and the House, we are now in the position that the Mental Treatment Bill is thrown at us and we are told: &ldquo;Pass this, lads, before we rise for Easter.&rdquo;  This is a Bill containing 272 sections, and 310 amendments have been tabled, the bulk of them being Ministerial amendments.

      <P>Before we enter the Committee Stage of this Bill I would like to know what is the difficulty in having the Bill referred to a special committee for the purpose of considering it with that closeness which it needs to get?  Apparently, the Parliamentary Secretary wants his Bill by Friday.  He knows he is not going to get it by Friday.  He knows that the various amendments are calculated to occupy the time of the House to a very considerable extent. What difficulty is there in referring the Bill to a special committee?</P>

      <P>Why does the Parliamentary Secretary adopt that kind of churlish attitude on the matter?  The Tánaiste told us, before we entered on the Committee Stage of the Bill, that we could go a certain distance that evening, and then consider the question of referring it to a special committee.  Now we are threatened that the Bill must be passed by Friday, and that Private Members' time must be taken in order to ensure the passage of the Committee Stage of the Bill.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary think it is fair to bludgeon the House into the position in which it has got to pass this Bill in order to preserve its rights to have a free Private Members' discussion, because that really is what he is doing?</P>

      <P>Originally, when this matter was raised we from this side offered to support the setting up of a special committee to deal with this Bill.  It appeared to us a reasonable thing to do, particularly in view of the fact that we have so many Private Members' motions on the Order Paper. If these motions are not discussed before Easter it is more than likely there will be no chance of disposing of them until we reach the summer.  A number of them deal with very important matters&mdash;some with matters that cannot be discussed on the Estimates. We have an example of that in the motion which proposes the setting up of a council of education in accordance with the recommendation made by the Commission on Vocational Organisation.  That is a matter that would require legislation.  It cannot be dealt with on the Estimate for the Department of the Minister for Education because, if raised then, we would be told that it was a matter requiring legislation.  Obviously, from the point of view of public policy, that <Col N="1435" /> is a motion that ought to be got out of the way before the Estimates are reached.</P>

The Tánaiste, on the last occasion, gave us an assurance that the matter could be considered when we had got through with this particular Bill during the time that was then available to us.  The Tánaiste is not here this evening, and, therefore, we cannot call him to witness the accuracy of the quotations that we are making from his speech. We have to deal with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government, and he, apparently, is mute of malice this evening.  He will not tell us why the Bill cannot be referred to a special committee.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach knows that no later than to-day I again urged that this Bill should be referred to a special committee.  He knows that every week since the Bill was first circulated we have been urging the same course.  This, obviously, is the type of Bill which should go to a special committee.  The proposition is not new to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government, and yet we have not been able to get from him any explanation as to why, even now, the Bill could not be referred to a special <Col N="1437" /> committee.  Our only desire in this matter is to expedite business and to preserve the rights of Private Members in the House.</P>

      <P>On the last occasion when the Bill was in Committee I was speaking to this series of amendments which will be determined by the decision on amendment No. 73.  On that amendment, therefore, we are debating the whole principle of the superannuation scheme which it is now proposed to substitute for that in the 1909 Act in so far as existing serving officers will opt to come in under the present Bill when it becomes an Act.  Pressure has already been exercised to try to get the Parliamentary Secretary to appreciate the point of view, not only of those who are speaking from these benches, but of the men and women who are directly concerned <Col N="1438" /> by any provisions we may embody in the Bill.  The Parliamentary Secretary stated on the last occasion that he was reinforced in his attitude in regard to the provisions of the Bill concerning the officers and servants of mental hospitals by the support of the Labour organisations of which these officers and servants are members. While the Parliamentary Secretary did have interviews with representative deputations, I think he is trying to convey to the House a good deal more than was said by the deputations or is in the minds of the members of these Labour organisations.  The very fact that many of the amendments to the sections dealing with superannuation, particularly the provisions for the calculation of the lump sum and annual allowance, have been submitted in the names of Deputies who are connected with these Labour organisations indicates that there is not that degree of satisfaction.  In so far as the officers and servants of mental hospitals are concerned, I have already pointed out, and I think it is the correct position, that they do appreciate the general approach of the Government towards superannuation, inasmuch as they propose to provide for a lump sum on retirement.  That is a principle which is good in itself and which is acceptable to and appreciated by these men and women, but there is a great difference between appreciation of a principle and giving effect to that principle in actual figures.  It is in regard to the actual basis of calculation that dissatisfaction is expressed by the men and women who will be affected by these provisions and it is in respect of the basis of calculation that most of the amendments have been submitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I can follow the Parliamentary Secretary's attitude in this matter, he has not attempted, so far at any rate, to give an adequate explanation as to why, if we desire to introduce a good and beneficent principle into the scheme of superannuation for these employees, we should do so in such a way as to penalise them, as we undoubtedly do.  In the course of the Second Reading debate, <Col N="1439" /> the Parliamentary Secretary stressed the fact that he and others who were concerned with this problem were of the opinion that it was a good thing to provide a lump sum for men and women going out on pension, when there would be a break in their normal life, because the change in many ways would impose, not a burden, but certain obligations upon them, in the meeting of which a lump sum would be very helpful.</P>
    <P>Everybody appreciated the point of view expressed by the Parliamentary Secretary on that occasion, but let us take one of the arguments that he has put forward to justify the present basis of calculation.  When I referred to this matter of the lump sum, the Parliamentary Secretary said they could go and buy a farm.  If the lump sum is provided to meet certain difficulties which arise in the case of these men and women when they leave active service and retire on superannuation, how is it, at the same time, to be available for investment either in a farm or business or in some form of security?  Either they will use the lump sum, or portion of it, or they will retain it as savings.  They cannot use it for the two purposes. Let us consider it as a means of investment, in one of the cases that has been worked out, the case of a man retiring after 25 years' service.  He receives a lump sum of £189.  Take a round figure of £200.  The amount of interest he would receive on that under the most favourable conditions would be £10 per annum.  The actual difference between the annual allowance that he would receive under the present provisions of the Bill, £70, and the sum he would receive if he remained under the 1909 Act, £92, is £22 per annum.  The interest on the investment of his lump sum would cover only half of that, so that, instead of the lump sum being liquidated in a period of nine years, it simply means that it would carry on for 18 years.  At the same time, in order to secure that he will not lose the benefit of the lump sum over a short period of years, he has to deprive himself of the whole value of <Col N="1440" /> the lump sum, according to the point of view of the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary considered a change in the superannuation code, I do not think he had in mind the provision of a lump sum for investment or for the purpose of helping in the establishing of a small business or buying a farm.  I think he was quite satisfied to regard it from another point of view: that these men and women had been engaged in a particular service, that many of them were accommodated on the estate of the particular institution, that they were provided with uniform and other emoluments and that at a certain date that particular form of life would cease as far as they were concerned and they would then have to go outside the institution to obtain housing accommodation and, to a certain extent, possibly, provide themselves with extra civilian clothes and that generally the lump sum was intended to cover the period of the change from one condition of life to another and the commitments that they would have to meet. I think that was the point of view he had in mind.  At least, that is what occurred to me when I was listening to him on the Second Reading, when he laid particular stress on this principle. I think that is a good attitude, which everybody, including the men and women who may obtain the advantages of it, appreciate, and I think that to revert from that attitude and to regard the lump sum as being merely provision of a form of savings for investment or to assist in establishing a business is a retrograde step which the Parliamentary Secretary should try to avoid.</P>
    <P>I impressed upon him the other day that if we did accept the point of view that he expressed in the course of the debate&mdash;not only was he dealing with a superannuation scheme under this Bill, but he also had proposals almost complete for a general levelling up of salaries and conditions in certain of the mental hospitals which would impose an additional burden of some £80,000 on the rates&mdash;that, if he is going to do these particular things, which will effect an improvement in <Col N="1441" /> the superannuation code, at least we could agree upon one thing, that if we are not going to give these officers and servants improved conditions as against the 1909 Act, at least let us see is it not possible to give them the same conditions in so far as actual money is concerned.  I am aware that, in relation to the series of amendments we are now discussing, the acceptance of these amendments and the embodying of them in the Bill would in actual fact mean that an attendant who went out on superannuation under the Bill, as amended by these various amendments, would receive an increased financial return as against what he is entitled to under the 1909 Act.  I can see, therefore, that there is a certain difficulty facing the Parliamentary Secretary from the point of view of accepting these amendments. But surely it would be possible to preserve the principle of the lump sum as set down in the Bill and to find some percentage which would be the ceiling in regard to the annual allowance which would provide the men and women in the service with what they would receive in the aggregate under the 1909 Act and nothing more.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the percentage would be exactly, but in a later amendment I have put down the figure of 60 per cent. instead of the present ceiling imposed under Section 75.  Possibly it may be less.  But, at least, if we meet them on a basis of equity so far as these men and women are concerned, there possibly could be some agreement.  I would strongly press that point of view on the Parliamentary Secretary, because, in discussing these amendments, we are, as I said, discussing the whole basis of this particular part of the Act deal ing with superannuation and what we are saying now will cover our position in regard to a whole series of amendments on questions that arise later on in this part of the Bill.  If we could get some indication from the Parliamentary Secretary, even though he is not prepared to accept these particular amendments where they change the actual percentages for the purpose of <Col N="1442" /> calculating superannuation, that he was prepared to consider so adjusting the ceiling provided in Section 75 as to allow the officers and servants to receive in total over a certain period of years the same sum of money by way of allowance and lump sum that they would receive over the same period of years by way of annual allowance alone under the 1909 Act, it would help.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is fair to suggest as an interpretation that could be put upon it that, if we level up the salaries and other conditions of service in certain mental hospitals to the standard which we all think should be provided and should have been provided many years ago, portion of the cost of that must be contributed out of superannuation sums to which men and women are entitled and that, if they do not wish to make that contribution, because of the provision now made, their only alternative is to remain under the 1909 Act and therefore lose the benefit of this very important change that the Parliamentary Secretary has introduced in the Bill by the provision of a lump sum. I would strongly urge the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider this matter in the light of equity towards these men and women, not with the idea of giving something more than they are entitled to at present, but rather giving them what they would now receive under the 1909 Act, in accordance with the new principle of the lump sum introduced in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made that in certain cases the whole benefit of the lump sum would be liquidated over a certain period of years.  I asked the Parliamentary Secretary on the last day two questions (1) to indicate the average age at which those employees retired on superannuation; and (2) what was the average period during which they drew their superannuation or pension.  He answered the first question, but did not answer the second one, and the second one, of course, is the most important.  If we take the case I have been referring to of a man with 25 years' service under the existing Act, his pension would <Col N="1443" /> amount to £92 per year.  Under the Bill as it now stands, he would receive a lump sum of £189 and an annual allowance of £70.  The result would be that in nine years the value of the lump sum would be liquidated in so far as that covered the difference between the sum to which he would be entitled under the 1909 Act and what the Bill provides.  Over a series of cases, so far as I can see, the period during which the lump sum would be liquidated by covering the deficit varies from six years up to 14 years at the outside.  I am sure that if we got official figures we would find that the average number of years during which these persons drew the annual allowance after retirement was something around ten to 12 years.  That means, therefore, that in a number of cases where the lump sum will be liquidated in six, eight or nine years on the average, those individuals would continue to lose.  As we know, the average is not an indication of the actual conditions, but it is quite possible that many individuals will have the benefit of the lump sum liquidated in a period of from six to ten years and will continue living on the annual allowance for possibly another 12, 15 or 20 years.  For each year they live they will be losing sums running from possibly £15 to £25 per year merely because, in applying the good principle in the Bill, we have been shortsighted enough not to try to arrive at a basis of calculation which would provide equitably for these men and women not only as between them as employees and the committees of the local authorities, but also as between them and any future entrants under the scheme and as between them and the State in so far as they were covered by the 1909 Act.</P>
    <P>I do not think that any of us on these benches want to try to use this particular part of the Bill to gain something to which these people are not entitled under the 1909 Act.  But we object very strongly to having this principle introduced in such a way as to deprive men and women of considerable sums of money and, if they are not prepared to accept the conditions, <Col N="1444" /> merely to leave them with the alternative of remaining under the old Act which we feel, and the Parliamentary Secretary has expressed the same view so far as the provisions of the Bill are concerned, requires very drastic improvement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P. Burke (County Dublin) Mr. P. Burke (County Dublin)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke (County Dublin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Larkin has gone into this matter at great length.  The Bill really makes it a personal matter, because it may suit one employee to take the lump sum and it may not suit another employee to take the lump sum.  I should like to give a few figures, taking a man's basic salary as £120 a year. A man retiring under the 1909 Act with ten years' service will get £24 a year pension; under this Bill, he will get £15 pension and a lump sum of £40. That lump sum would be liquidated in five years.</P>
      <P>Now, take the man who becomes ill and who has no other choice but to come out on pension.  The provisions of the Bill would not be very considerate in his case.  If that man, by any chance, lived on and took up some other employment, the Parliamentary Secretary would be wise if he could leave open a choice for the man concerned.  Then we have the man retiring after 34 years' service.  His basic salary is only £20 and his pension under the 1909 Act is £80.  Under this Bill, the pension would be £60 with a lump sum of £80. It would mean that an ordinary healthy man retiring at 55 years of age would have his lump sum liquidated when he would be 64 years of age.</P>
      <P>There is a feeling in the two institutions I am in touch with that they would like the Parliamentary Secretary to consider leaving this as optional.  It is purely and simply a personal matter and what will suit one man going out may not suit another. I would recommend the Parliamentary Secretary to give the matter his favourable consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>There has not been anything contributed to the discussion to-day that we have not had in one form or another when this matter was before the House the last time we were in Committee.  The position is <Col N="1445" /> very simple.  Staffs of mental hospitals can have the superannuation terms of the 1909 Act without any difficulty whatever, but they cannot have those terms combined with the terms proposed in the Bill.  As I said before, I have discussed this matter with representatives of the staffs and the impression was very definitely conveyed to me that the superannuation provisions of this Bill were much more acceptable to the staffs than the terms of the 1909 Act.  If I had thought for one moment that the terms embodied in this Bill were not as acceptable, I certainly would not have drafted superannuation proposals as outlined here.</P>
      <P>The 1909 Act provides that a mental hospital attendant, male or female, can retire on full pension of two-thirds salary and the estimated value for pension purposes of their emoluments, after a certain period of service. It is now suggested that, in addition to that two-thirds, we should provide a lump sum.  They cannot have it both ways.  I am quite willing to give them the two-thirds provided under the 1909 Act, but I cannot at the same time provide the lump sum.  This scheme will give a maximum pension of half the salary and the estimated value of the emoluments, plus a lump sum amounting to one and a half year's salary, and emoluments.  If the House can assure me that it would be more satisfactory to abandon that lump sum idea altogether and that, instead of the half, we give the two-thirds, I am quite willing to consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many other provisions in the superannuation code set out in this Bill of very far-reaching consequence that are not set out in any of the previous superannuation codes applying to this class of service or to any other class of service.  The superannuation provisions in the Bill before the House are the most generous provisions that have been made for any servant of the State or any servant of a local authority.  Of course, I can understand that, no matter how generous the provision is, it may be necessary as a popular gesture for certain Deputies to plead for something more.  I have no objection to that and do not wish to criticise that attitude <Col N="1446" /> at all.  Perhaps that is inevitable, but I want to tell the House that I have been as generous in these superannuation terms as it is possible to be and, except for very minor amendments, I cannot go any further.</P>
    <P>It would be well that the House should realise that the superannuation provisions proposed here are considerably better and provide substantially greater cover of one kind or another than is given even in the case of prison officers.  I am sure Deputies are aware of that.  If it were necessary to do so, I could compare section by section of the 1909 Act and the terms of the Bill before the House, or I could compare the terms of the Prison Officers' Superannuation Code with the terms in this Bill.  However, I take it that those Deputies who are interested in this matter have acquainted themselves with the provisions in those other codes and that they do realise that a more generous superannuation code has never been submitted to this House on behalf of any section of servants of the State or of local authorities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin did give a halting appreciation of that, but I think it might be more generously accepted by the House as a whole.  Deputy Larkin talks about penalising the staffs.  We are not penalising anybody.  Existing staffs are given a choice under the Bill as to whether they will remain under the 1909 Act or accept the superannuation terms embodied in the Bill.  There is no penalisation there. Surely I am not to be asked to offer alternative codes of superannuation and leave a man to decide as to which code he will accept, when he is due to retire?  I do not think that is a reasonable proposition and it is not one I am prepared to entertain.  I do not think that, under any insurance. code, it would be left to the time of retirement from active duty for a man to determine whether he would take a lump sum and a smaller pension or a larger pension without the lump sum.  If one could estimate with accuracy how long one was going to live it would be easy enough to decide which code would suit the better, but one has to take a chance <Col N="1447" /> on that.  If they live to be 100, which is unlikely, taking it all round, they would lose under this Bill, but if they die at any reasonable time&mdash;and we are told, and it is true, that they lead a very strenuous life and are not likely to live to an old age&mdash;the earlier they die the more they will benefit.</P>

      <P>He pointed out that the mental hospital employee would benefit by dying earlier, but it is reasonable to argue that the longer the person lives, the weaker that person gets and the less able he is to look after himself.  Therefore, it is reasonable to suppose that that person should be in receipt of the necessary pension in order to help him through his weaker years.  But the reverse is the situation and, as the person grows older, the less pension he receives.  It could be argued that, if a person retires at 55, he or she would be capable of supplementing the allowance in some way but, as he or she gets on in years, and reaches 76 or turns 80, then he or she will not be able to supplement the allowance by any form of work.  Therefore, it is desirable that instead of reducing this allowance it should be increased but, obviously, the Parliamentary Secretary did not see that.</P>

      <P>This particular section is probably the basic section of this part of the Bill.  The efforts that have been made by Deputies on various sides of the House to have certain of the objectionable principles that they see embodied in the section removed have been treated, as far as I can see, in a somewhat facetious manner by the Parliamentary Secretary. Certainly, the arguments he has put forward to support the point of view expressed in the Bill bear very little relation to the arguments that have been advanced in favour of an alteration of the basis of calculation of superannuation.  When we said that persons going out on pension would, after a period of years, lose financially under the provisions of this Bill as against the provisions of the 1909 Act, we were somewhat lightly told that that is correct if they live to be 100 years of age.  I do not know what exactly is the percentage of centenarians in the country at the moment.  I am sure not many of the mental hospital attendants will come within that category but, on actual figures, taking the retiring age as being 55, it means that many of these persons would commence to lose financially even at 61 years of age.  Many of them live to be over 70 and even 78 and 80 years of age.  So that we would have the position that recipients of allowances under this Bill would continue to lose financially for a period of anything up to 20 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are embodying in this Bill what the Parliamentary Secretary and I agree is a good principle, the principle of a lump sum, why cannot we have a basis of calculation which will give them the same amount that they would get under the 1909 Act in this different form, instead of penalising them?  We are not asking for anything more.  It is only a question of fixing a ceiling.  One of the amendments sought to do that by fixing the old ceiling of the 1909 Act.  It is quite clear that, if it were calculated on that basis, they would gain, even on the basis of the annual allowance, without taking the lump sum into the calculation at all.  I can understand the Parliamentary Secretary's reluctance to grant on the one hand a lump sum and, at the same time, to grant the same annual allowance or possibly even an increased annual allowance under the present Bill as against the 1909 Act, but surely we could calculate the average period of years during which these persons would enjoy their superannuation allowance and give them such lump sum as would take a reasonable period to liquidate, not the short period that it would take at present under the Bill, a period as short as six years.  The longest period I have seen has been 14 years.  Even in the case of a person with very long service and enjoying a fairly high rate of salary, the benefits of the lump sum are liquidated in a comparatively short time&mdash;nine or ten years.  That viewpoint has been pressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section is a basic section for many of the following sections dealing with various alternative conditions under which payments can be made by the committee in the case of sickness or injury arising out of discharge of duty.  So that whatever we decide on this particular section will probably be the guiding or determining principle. Even at this moment, I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to see if it is not possible to meet the point of view we have put forward and to give, not an improvement, not any financial increase, but merely the same average financial return as <Col N="1454" /> would be obtained under the 1909 Act in so far as annual allowance is concerned, to calculate it on the average period of years during which these persons would receive superannuation allowance and to calculate it on the basis of a lump sum and annual allowance instead of annual allowance only.  If the Parliamentary Secretary were to do that, he would find that the benefits of the Bill would be appreciated.</P>
    <P>When I say that many of the men and women who have been discussing the provisions of the Bill have suggested that they should be allowed to exercise an option, not within six months of the passing of the Bill, but even immediately prior to their retiring on superannuation, as to whether they would go out under the 1909 Act or under this Bill, the Parliamentary Secretary will realise that there is some perturbation in their minds in regard to the provisions in the present Bill.  I have personally heard many of them express the view that if the Bill goes through in its present form, without some amendment of this particular section, they would prefer to remain under the 1909 Act.  Of course, the Parliamentary Secretary's answer to that is that they can remain under the 1909 Act and that they are not suffering any disability, but I would urge him to try to follow up the viewpoint that he expressed to the House when he introduced the Bill, namely, that in this Bill we were approaching the whole problem of the treatment of mental disease in a new and more enlightened manner, both from the medical side and also, he submitted, from the point of view of our attitude towards the men and women who gave valuable service in caring for these sick people.  One of the points that he claimed credit for was the provision of a lump sum.  It is only right and proper that if we do accept that as an advance on the previous conception of superannuation, at least, it should be made possible for all existing servants to enjoy that new and enlightened principle without financial loss to themselves.  It is not a fair or equitable proposition to say that, if you do <Col N="1455" /> not like this new provision, you can remain under the old Act. When we are improving on the principle of the Act, we should be prepared to do that so long as it does not result in any increased financial commitment on the part of the local authorities and does not cause any financial penalisation of the recipients.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2) (a) (i), line 17, to delete the words &ldquo;one-eightieth&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;two-eightieths&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is moved for two reasons.  It deals with the case of officers or servants who resign or otherwise cease to hold office or employment on account of having sustained or contracted any physical or mental injury or illness in the course of their duties and who have less than 20 years' service.  In the case of an officer who goes out at the normal retiring age set down in the Bill of 55 and who has 20 years' service, he would be entitled to have his annual allowance calculated, in so far as his 21st and his subsequent years of service are concerned, at two-eightieths. It is submitted that, in the case of an officer or servant who goes out with less than 20 years' service and who possibly may have as <Col N="1456" /> little as 11 years' service, that some increased rate should be granted to him over and above the one-eightieth: and as there is but a slight dividing line between, say, 19 years and 21 years, and as this results in the difference between one-eightieth and two-eightieths of salary for the purpose of calculating superannuation, this distinction should be wiped out and he should be afforded the same basis of calculation in respect of his salary as is provided in the case of other officers for their 21st and subsequent years.</P>
    <P>There is the other point of view, too, that should be considered, that here we are dealing with short-service men going out through illness or injury.  In certain cases they may have a comparatively short service.  They are to be provided with an annual allowance and a lump sum.  So far as the lump sum is concerned, if their service is comparatively short, the lump sum will be comparatively small and not of great value to them.  As we are dealing with the case of officers and servants who may be suffering from the effects of injury or illness over a certain period, it is submitted that the annual allowance should be of such nature as would afford them some reasonable support and recognition of their service during the period while they are trying to establish themselves in civilian life.  In that case, I submit that the main emphasis should be placed on the annual allowance rather than the lump sum and, for this purpose, that the figure in the amendment of two-eightieths should be accepted in place of the one-eightieth provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. We are all aware that a large number of attendants in mental hospitals are subject to illness and accidents which may not occur in an ordinary business outside.  As Deputy Larkin pointed out, these people may have a very short service and may be suffering from grave injury for which, if they were in outside employment, they would receive full compensation from their employer under the Workmen's Compensation Act; whereas, under <Col N="1457" /> the Bill, if they have only a short service, they receive only a very small amount.  I, therefore, think that a case can be made for exceptional treatment for employees with short service who may meet with an accident or contract some discase in the course of their employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot recommend the acceptance of this amendment to the House, but I think that the principle which the Deputies who have spoken have in mind is fairly dealt with in Section 71.  Section 71 sets out that, where an officer or servant of a mental hospital authority is injured, otherwise than through his own misconduct, while discharging his duties, he shall be entitled to certain superannuation provisions.  But the important principle is incorporated in Section 71 that a mental hospital authority can, with the consent of the Minister, add years to the years of service, subject, of course, to the maximum limitations set out in the Bill.  Section 71 applies to any officer or servant and deals with injury.  A similar provision is made in regard to registered officers who contract illness in the service and have to retire on grounds of illness.  Provision is made for the addition of years to their service.  Not only that, but a most radical and far-reaching departure will have been made in that regard when the amendment that stands in my name has been accepted by the House, as I have no doubt it will be, to the effect that illness of an incapacitating nature contracted in the service will qualify an attendant in future for superannuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies who have been in touch with the staffs of mental institutions have been aware that the new principle which I have just referred to will have very far-reaching consequences. Many cases have come to light in the past where attendants and nurses have contracted illness of an incapacitating nature, but they were not deemed to be entitled to superannuation, because it was held that the illness could not be deemed to be attributable to the nature of the service.  We are now getting right away from all that in the provisions <Col N="1458" /> of the Bill and we are providing that illness, from whatever cause, contracted in the service, will entitle a person on retirement to superannuation. As I have said, the mental hospital authorities, with the consent of the Minister, can add years up to the limit set out in the Bill.  That very far-reaching provision should meet the reasonable requirements of the House and, in the light of that, I do not think Deputy Larkin will seriously press his amendment but, if he does, I must resist it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 89:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2) to delete paragraph (a), lines 55-58, and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) an allowance during life, the annual amount of which shall consist of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  twenty-five eightieths of his yearly salary or wages, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  where he has been in the service of a mental hospital authority for 25 or more completed years two-eightieths of his yearly salary or wages in respect of each <Col N="1459" /> of the 25th and the subsequent (if any) of such completed years, and&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of this amendment is to try to reduce the distinction that has been indicated in the Bill as regards the calculation of the superannuation in respect of registered officers and non-registered officers.  In Section 64, in the case of registered officers, we provide that the allowance should be calculated on the basis of one-quarter of his yearly salary, plus, where the service exceeded 20 years, an addition of two-eightieths to his yearly salary for each year over the 20th.</P>
    <P>In the case of a non-registered officer we provide for an allowance, based on one-eighth of his yearly salary in respect of each year of completed service and in the same manner, in respect of the lump sum, we provide a lump sum in the case of a registered officer, based on twenty-thirtieths of his yearly salary, plus two-thirtieths for each year additional to the 20th.  In the case of a non-registered officer we have the single basis of calculation, based on one-thirtieth of yearly salary, in order to arrive at the lump sum to which he is entitled.</P>
    <P>We recognise that, in the approach to the question of superannuation for a person engaged in the service, there has been a distinction between registered and non-registered officers and established and non-established officers. The distinction is based on whether, in the normal course of their duties, they are engaged in the care of patients or not.  That distinction is in many ways most difficult to apply.  It might be quite easy in the case of certain clerical officers whose duties are confined to the office, where only members of the staff or of the public may have access and where patients do not intrude.  However, very many of the non-established and non-registered officers who carry on the daily work of the institution are not normally required as part of their official duties to have the care and safety of patients placed upon them, but in actual fact during many hours of the <Col N="1460" /> day they are in constant touch with the patients.  Many of them have to take on the responsibility of guiding patients in a particular work or exercising certain supervision over them. For all practical purposes, the manner in which their duties have to be performed at certain times does not differ in any way from that of the established officer.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether, in an earlier amendment which the Parliamentary Secretary moved, he had this particular difficulty in mind.  If I recollect correctly his statements to the House the last day, I think he does recognise that there is a difficulty in this respect.  In so far as we are merely following the old precedent of dividing these two sections of employees on the old basis and applying that to the basis of calculation for their superannuation, we are not accepting a viewpoint that is already more common than it used to be.  I submit that, in so far as these officers are engaged in many ways on similar duties to those of established officers, a more equitable basis for calculating their superannuation should be provided in the Bill than is set out in Section 66.</P>

      <P>With reference to the non-registered officers, I hold that very many of them, during the time they are on duty, are almost as much in touch with the patients as any other class of servant.  I hold that any man or woman in the employment of an institution, while inside its walls, no matter in what capacity, is definitely associated with the patients of the institution and so has some responsibility towards them at some time or other, whether it be as chief clerk or storekeeper or in any other capacity.  They may have patients working with them in some occupational or clerical work to occupy their minds, or in other capacities too numerous to mention.  I respectfully suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should consider having all employees in an institution on a par.  It would at least do a good deal to put a stop to the differentiation which some of them object to so much.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept the principle <Col N="1461" /> embodied in this amendment, nor do I think it is necessary that I should do so in order to meet the case made by Deputy Larkin.  Deputy Burke goes a little further and wants all employees of mental hospitals, whether engaged in clerical work or in the care and charge of patients, to be on an equal footing so far as superannuation is concerned.  I cannot concede the principle that a clerical officer or any officer engaged in the service of a mental hospital authority, whose duties do not entail the care or charge of patients, has a case for special treatment that could not equally be made for a clerical officer occupying a similar post under another local authority.</P>
      <P>The type of case that Deputy Larkin has referred to particularly is in a somewhat different category.  We had some discussion about that on the last day we were in Committee.  In so far as the members of the staff, whose normal duties entail the care and charge of patients, are concerned, we have not any difficulty.  They will be registered automatically.  The officers and servants in the employment of the mental hospital authority who, on occasion, have the care and charge of patients, will have to be afforded special consideration. We cannot here define the degree to which it would be necessary to devote their attention to the care and charge of patients in order to qualify.  Each case must be determined on its merits.  Generally speaking, if the classes of persons under discussion are engaged, as has been suggested, in occupational therapy, and in charge of patients while so engaged, they would, in the ordinary course of things, be admitted to the register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides machinery under which an appeal can be made to the Minister if the local authority declines to admit such people to the register. I think that is the most effective machinery that we can set up.  There would be a full inquiry in any case of doubt, or where an employee of a mental hospital authority feels aggrieved as a result of his failure to become registered.  The administrative view has, so far as I am aware, and I have a pretty long experience of it, <Col N="1462" /> always been rather generous.  The employee has been given the benefit of any reasonable doubt and that policy will continue to operate; but beyond that I cannot go.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that the section, in its present form, is unsatisfactory.  The view I take is that an officer or servant who has had anything up to five years' service and who dies, has contracted certain rights and these rights should be regarded in the nature of a debt which has to be discharged and the discharging of that debt should take <Col N="1463" /> place automatically to the relatives or the dependents.  This is all the more important because the section continually refers to the mental hospital authority, and in the mind of the ordinary person that is presumed to be the committee of management.  In effect, so far as wages and conditions of service are concerned, that is not the case because, primarily, wages and conditions of service are matters for the county or city managers, as the case may be.  An important matter of this kind should not remain in a permissive form.  The final obligation is centred in the persons of the city or the county manager.  Certain rights have been secured and the Bill should ensure that they are carried out.</P>

      <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary favourably to consider this amendment and make the position more definite than it is.  As a matter of fact, a number of employees have taken severe exception to the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  They would prefer the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; inserted there.  It does not seem right that you should be at the discretion of anybody; you are just getting what you are entitled to&mdash;your rights.</P>

      <P>I should like to know whether the mental hospital authority will have the right to exercise the same discretion in a case of this kind as they have in other cases.  For example, in the case of increasing the number of years' service for pension purposes, will the mental hospital authority have discretion to recommend to the Minister that an award or a grant shall be raised because of special circumstances connected with the death of the servant of the hospital authority?  If that discretion is exercisable, I suggest to Deputy O'Sullivan that it would be better to allow the wording of the section to remain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in Section 68, but you can make an allowance under Section 73 without regard to this section.  The powers of Section 73 are not governed by this. On the amendment, I should like to point out that its principle is not in any way objectionable. In fact, as Deputies are aware, some lawyers hold very often that &ldquo;may&rdquo; means &ldquo;shall&rdquo; or &ldquo;shall&rdquo; means &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  It is a difficulty of administration that is anticipated here.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...may, in their discretion, pay to the legal personal representative of such officer or servant...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the ordinary course of things, that discretion would be exercised in favour of the dependent or legal personal representative, but there are circumstances in which it might not be possible to exercise it.  There might be no legal personal representative who, in the opinion of the mental hospital authority, was entitled to any such payment. There might be nobody except, perhaps, the solicitor acting on behalf of the next-of-kin.  The legal personal representative might be a ne'er-do-well or, perhaps, an inebriate.  These are the considerations which operated in my mind when the section was being drafted.  The intention is that in ordinary circumstances the normal procedure would be to make the payment to the personal representative, but it is felt safer to allow discretion lest some set of circumstances should arise which, if there was not that discretion, <Col N="1465" /> might give rise to an embarrassing position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the Parliamentary Secretary's difficulty with regard to this section, but I do not think he has altogether cleared up the position.  What occurs to me first is: what is the purpose of the section in granting such lump sum to the legal personal representative?  Is it intended to be in the nature of what would be given in other cases by way of annual allowance to the dependent of a man or woman who died, or is it intended to be a means of meeting burial expenses and liquidating any personal debts and so on left behind, because the nature of the purpose to be met largely determines the way in which we should approach the matter?</P>
      <P>It is quite clear that if we make it mandatory and say that such a sum shall be paid to the legal personal representative, we might find that the legal personal representative was someone who never knew the deceased person, who had no particular connection with him and who would not undertake any responsibility of a financial character in relation to debts. That, to a certain extent, gives rise to a difficulty if the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is inserted.  But if, on the other hand, the Parliamentary Secretary tells us, as the lawyers often tell us, that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; implies &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, is it not far better for us to try to get a correct drafting which will avoid these loopholes for lawyers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not put that forward as a firm view.  I merely mentioned that lawyers sometimes hold that view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the purpose of the section is quite clear.  I take it that what we are dealing with is the case of a man or woman who dies and who would qualify in the normal way under the section and who leaves a widow or dependent child, or possibly a brother, sister, mother or father who in some way is dependent on him or her.  Also I think we also have in mind the case of a man or woman who dies, leaving small personal debts to be met&mdash;the ordinary <Col N="1466" /> things which we in the trade union movement have to deal with every day. We protect ourselves by laying it down that in the payment of mortality benefit the main responsibility on the union is to see that benefit is utilised as it is intended to be utilised, for the proper interment of the deceased, and we actually claim the right to apply the money to that purpose as against paying it out to some legal personal representative who may even allow the deceased to be buried by the public assistance authorities.  If we could be clear as to the intention of the Parliamentary Secretary in relation to this section, it might possibly be easier for us to agree with him on the phraseology, but, as it stands, the word &ldquo;may,&rdquo; with its implication of a possible refusal, creates in our minds the feeling that we are leaving a loophole which should be closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might also point out the different procedure in relation to this and the other sections to which there are amendments.  In Section 68 we are dealing with an officer or servant who has five years' service or longer and who dies in the service of a mental hospital authority.  We say that he may be provided with a lump sum or a year's salary.  Section 69 deals with the case of officers or servants who have to relinquish their positions because of injury sustained in the discharge of their duties.  In the first case, we leave it entirely to the discretion of the mental hospital authority to make a grant, while, in the other case, under Sections 69 and 71, they may exercise this discretion only with the consent of the Minister. In regard to both these latter sections, we are dealing with a different type of case altogether&mdash;the case of an officer who sustains an injury or contracts illness.  In the case in which there is probably 100 times more reason for making some grant, by way of lump sum or allowance, to an officer because of illness which he contracts in the service, we lay it down that it can be done only with the consent of the Minister, but in the case of a person who dies, as we all must die, it is solely at the discretion of the mental hospital authority.  It <Col N="1467" /> does seem to me to indicate a certain confusion and it would be much simpler, if we felt that there is an obligation in respect of certain of these officers, either because of their service as such, or because of illness contracted or injury sustained, that it should be mandatory to meet it and there should be no element of doubt about it.</P>

      <P>I wish to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary again on this section generally, because, under the 1909 Act, a man had to die from a specific disease before his widow got anything. This section is one which will definitely encourage every married official to choose to be dealt with under this measure, because no matter what a man dies from while in the service, his widow will get something, whereas, under the 1909 Act, as I say, a man had to die from a specific disease. Unless the doctor who certified death gave the appropriate certificate, his widow or dependents got nothing.  If the Parliamentary Secretary would finish off his good work by agreeing to insert &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo; everybody would be delighted.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to make the matter much more clear than I have already made it.  Section 68 may be regarded as more or less an omnibus section, giving general powers.  The intention behind the section is to provide for the contingency of a dependent who might not be a widow or orphan, if such a dependent could exist at all. I think it is rather a generous gesture to try to cover such a contingency, and, in the circumstances, it is well that we should leave a discretion to the mental hospital authority to determine whether a grant ought to be made.  It might be a matter of an aged parent&mdash; quite a number of degrees of relationship could be envisaged in which such a grant would be desirable.  In the case of amendment No. 101, as Deputy Larkin points out, the position is somewhat different.  A mental hospital authority may, in their discretion, make certain payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1468" /> Amendment No. 101 deals with a person who is permanently incapacitated, by reason of injury, from performing his duties.  If such a person receives compensation from some other source&mdash;he might, perhaps, be entitled to compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act&mdash;the mental hospital authority would be entitled to exercise a discretion as to whether they would make a payment under this section. They would take that into account. Apart altogether from that possible contingency, that other sources of compensation might be available, Deputies will observe that the section provides that they may &ldquo;grant to him such annual allowance and lump sum as in all the circumstances of the case they consider proper.&rdquo;  There is not much point in putting a statutory obligation on them to make a payment so long as you give them a discretion as to the amount of the payment.  Deputies say that if we put in the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; the mental hospital authority will then be obliged to make a payment, but it will be such a payment as they think proper.  I think that, in all the circumstances, nobody will suffer any hardship or injustice by leaving the entire discretion with a mental hospital authority, subject to the approval of the Minister. I do not think the mental hospital authority will abuse that discretion, nor do I think that they will perpetrate an injustice on any of their staffs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We would prefer to see the Parliamentary Secretary approach this question from the point of view that the individual has acquired certain rights.  If he agrees that that should be the basis of the application of the section, then I suggest he need not unduly concern himself as to what takes place when a man dies, or to whom payment should be made. I take it that he is in agreement with the general principle that a payment should be made. There must be some basis on which the payment is founded.  I presume it is the basis of service.  On this question of discretion, it may be that you will have unsatisfactory decisions <Col N="1469" /> given from time to time.  Would it not be in the best interests of the mental hospital authority itself to take the long view?  If the Parliamentary Secretary accepts the main principle behind those amendments it should not be beyond the wit or the resource of the Parliamentary draftsman to prepare an amendment along the lines that we are seeking.  If he will give the House an assurance to do that at a later stage, I am sure it will satisfy the House.</P>

      <P>In amendment No. 101 we are dealing with a specific case where definite qualifications are laid down.  First of all, the officer or servant of the mental hospital authority is injured otherwise than through his own misconduct while discharging his duties; the injury is directly attributable to the nature of his duties; he is certified by the appropriate medical officer to be permanently incapacitated by reason of the injury for performing his duties, and he has been in the service of the mental hospital authority for less than ten years.  Each of these conditions is very definite and specific, and can be considered by the mental hospital authority.  The Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out that two questions arise.  The first is the power to make a payment and, secondly, to determine the amount of it.  He takes us to task because we challenge the provision where the power to decide to make a payment is left subject to the discretion of the Minister.  We are not questioning at all the discretion given to the mental hospital authority in regard to the amount of the payment. If, however, we have definite conditions governing the granting of the amount, surely there is no need to have a provision to the effect that payment shall be subject to the consent of the Minister. The Parliamentary Secretary says that he does not think there is any fear that this power will be used in an unfair way by a mental hospital authority.</P>

With regard to the point raised by the Parliamentary Secretary of payments being made from some other source, such as under the Workmen's Compensation Act, that, of course, would not apply in the case of ordinary illness.

If a case is brought under the Workmen's Compensation Act, the arbitrator might say that it is not a case that comes under the section.  I feel that the Parliamentary Secretary should make it conditional, where the man meets with an accident, that the local authority shall, with the consent of the Minister, pay the money.</P>

      <P>(4)  For the purpose of this Act it shall be assumed that every person whose name is registered in the register maintained under this Part of this Act was in a condition of good health at the time of such registration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is possible that this amendment may be unnecessary in view of the Ministerial amendment No. 103.  I had in mind in drafting this amendment the type of case that has been very common in other services, where a person develops tuberculosis and, on submitting a claim, is informed that he was affected with the disease before he entered the service, although on entry he was subjected to a very rigorous medical test.  In view of the amendment which has been moved by the Parliamentary Secretary, I take it that that position would hardly arise under this Bill.  I am not quite clear as to that because the word &ldquo;contracts&rdquo; is retained. It might be argued that if a person did not actually contract the disease in the course of his service with such authority he would not be entitled to come within the provisions of this Bill and that in so far as it was proved that he had a particular disease before he entered the service he was excluded from the benefits of the Bill. My amendment was intended to deal with the case of officers who pass a <Col N="1474" /> medical test on entry to the service and who, therefore, in the normal course would be accepted as being in good health and, at least, free from the more serious forms of disease, particularly pulmonary disease which, in certain institutions, seems to take a very heavy toll of these men and women. If in later years they are compelled to retire because of illness contracted during service with the authority, the argument should not be used that that illness was latent in them before they entered the service.</P>

They would be subjected to very exacting examination in future if that principle were embodied in the code.  We need not worry about it now, because under my amendment, if they contract illness in the service, they are entitled to retire and to enjoy superannuation rights regardless of the nature of the illness.</P>

      <P>It has been a bone of contention.  It has given a lot of trouble in administration because of the fact that an effort has always been made administratively to link up the illness with the nature of the occupation. That created a very difficult administrative position, because it was <Col N="1475" /> often a matter of opinion between medical men as to whether in fact the conditions of service contributed to or were responsible for the nature of the illness.  Now we get away from that.

      <P>In sub-section (4), line 29, after the word &ldquo;service&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;and in the case of an officer or servant having contracted tuberculosis in the discharge of his duties the allowance and lump sum granted shall be calculated on the basis of twenty-five completed years of service&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposes that in the case of an officer or servant contracting tuberculosis in the discharge of his duties, a lump sum shall be granted to him calculated on the basis of 25 completed years of service.  It is admitted that there is no occupation in which officers are more liable to contract tuberculosis than that of mental hospital attendants.  If you take the record of some of these institutions in County <Col N="1476" /> Dublin you will find that a very large percentage of the attendants, although having undergone a very stiff medical examination before being put on the staff, after a few years are certified by the medical officer as being incapable of discharging their duties because of tuberculosis.  It has been admitted that they have contracted that disease in the course of or arising out of their employment.</P>

We have other plans in mind and other schemes under way for dealing with tuberculosis. Mental hospital attendants will be eligible under these schemes the same as anybody else.  Our approach to the matter raised by the Deputy in this amendment I think logically would be that, if an employee is ill and unfit for duty of has to retire because of ill-health, it is much the same to us whether it is rheumatism, heart disease, bronchitis or tuberculosis; that the matter that must count with us is his degree of incapacity and the fact that he is no longer able to provide for himself.</P>

      <P>Before Section 70 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>70&mdash;(1) A mental hospital authority shall, with the consent of the Minister, grant to any officer or servant in their service, who has been in the service of a mental hospital authority for not less than ten years and&mdash;</P>

      <P>(2)  Where an officer or servant of a mental hospital authority becomes entitled to be granted an allowance and lump sum under this section, and he would, but for this sub-section, also be entitled to an allowance and lump sum granted pursuant to Section 64 or Section 66 of this Act, such officer or servant shall not be entitled to the latter allowance and lump sum, but, without prejudice to Section 71 of this Act, the allowance and lump sum which are granted to him under this section shall not be less respectively than the allowance and lump sum which he would have been granted under the said Section 64 or the said Section 66 (as the case may be) but for this sub-section.</P>

      <P>We have already dealt with the principle embodied in this amendment. Sub-section (3) deals with the case of an officer or servant who is registered and who loses his employment through illness and who has been in the service for 10 years or more, and entitles him under Section 65 or Section 67 to an annual allowance and lump sum.  Sub-section (3) of Section 71 enables the mental hospital authority to increase the annual allowance or lump sum in the case of a registered officer who contracts the illness otherwise than through his own misconduct.  The amendment proposes to delete the words &ldquo;discharge of his duties&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;service of such authority&rdquo;.  We have twice to-day discussed the far-reaching principle embodied in this amendment&mdash;that, in future, any illness or injury sustained in the service of the authority will entitle the officer or servant to benefit under the superannuation provisions.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1) (b), line 45, before the word &ldquo;refuses&rdquo; to insert the word &ldquo;unreasonably&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide that where, under sub-section (3), a person is in receipt of an allowance under Sections 67, 69 or 71, he should not be called upon unreasonably to submit himself to medical examination. <Col N="1480" /> In other words, if he unreasonably refuses to submit to medical examination, the mental hospital authorities shall be entitled to cease payment of the allowance.  It is a recognised practice in dealing with workmen's compensation cases, especially where a person has not got suitable advice, to submit him to continuous demands for medical examination. The purpose of the section is to provide that a person in receipt of the allowance shall reasonably submit to this requirement and provide reasonable medical proof of this claim to the continued receipt of any such payment. It is largely in this case a drafting amendment, to which I can see no great objection.  It is merely a safeguard and does not in any way prohibit the mental hospital authority from requiring the recipient of the allowance to submit to such medical examination as is necessary from time to time, but it does afford some protection to the recipient against unreasonable demands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to assume that the mental hospital authority would unreasonably ask a recipient of an allowance to submit himself to examination.  I think it is eminently reasonable to provide that the mental hospital authority be entitled under law from time to time to ask recipients of allowances to submit to examination.  If we have any such term as &ldquo;shall not unreasonably refuse&rdquo; I think we are going to store up for ourselves considerable difficulties in administration.  I do not know how we could determine whether the refusal was reasonable or unreasonable. If we were to accept the amendment, we would have to concede two assumptions that I would prefer not to concede.  The first is that the mental hospital authority would act in an unreasonable way.  Perhaps with greater reluctance would I concede that the medical officer who would be called upon to examine the person would act in an unreasonable way.  You would need to have collusion between the mental hospital authority and the medical officer called upon to carry out the examination in order to provide the setting for the type of <Col N="1481" /> injustice Deputy Larkin anticipates.  I do not think there is any ground for it whatever.  I do not think it would be desirable to insert such an amendment in the Bill.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1) (c), lines 53 and 54, to delete the words &ldquo;certificate of the medical practitioners&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;cancellation thereof&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment and amendment No. 115 are consequential on each other. Amendment No. 114 merely seeks to regularise the position that might obtain between the granting of the certificate and the question of cancellation; it seeks to ensure that in the interim period the allowance would not be withdrawn, that is, the allowance in connection with incapacity.  Amendment No. 115 is the more important one.  It reverses the position which the Bill seeks to take up, and asks that the allowance should not be withdrawn until a suitable appointment has been offered to the individual affected.  That ensures that the individual's rights would be protected and he will have the offer of an appointment before his allowance is cancelled.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to consider amendment No. 114 and I will look into the matter between this and the Report Stage.  I am not so favourably disposed towards amendment No. 115. That amendment must inevitably raise a rather difficult administrative principle, inasmuch as the authority may not have such a post in their gift at the time.  The conception behind the amendment is all right; the principle is not objectionable, but the actual administration of it might entail some difficulty if we were to put this statutory obligation upon the hospital authority.  Naturally, if the hospital authority determine, after medical examination, that a person in receipt of an allowance is, in fact, able to work, they will offer the most suitable work they have to that person, but to put them under an obligation to offer a particular <Col N="1482" /> type of work might be difficult to discharge.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with persons who, on the certificates of two medical practitioners, are in a position that their incapacity has ceased.  That is a somewhat different type of case to cases arising under the Workmen's Compensation Act, where a person is certified for light work. <Col N="1483" /> The question arises whether the work provided by the employer is of a suitable nature.  In this case the person presumably has recovered full capacity to perform his duties.  The only question is whether there is a vacancy of a kind and at a salary similar to what he possessed when he went out, not the actual suitability of the employment from the point of view of the person's capacity.</P>
      <P>In this regard we should pay attention to the type of case with which we are dealing.  We are dealing not only with the case of a person who, through contracting ordinary illness in the service of an authority, is incapacitated, but with the case of a person injured in the service of the authority. If a person is injured in the service of the authority, and, therefore, in discharge of his responsibilities towards patients, and if he is certified as having recovered and we say he is no longer entitled to the allowance made to him, surely we should not allow a gap to be created between the cancellation of the allowance and his restoration to employment?</P>
      <P>We have a certain obligation to him and, while it may be quite true that the wording of my amendment could give rise to disputes as to whether the employment is suitable or not, I think the main question would be, if it is the case of an attendant, that the employment offered to him should be of a similar nature.  I think the overriding question should be that the salary or wages would not be less than what he was in receipt of at the time the incapacity commenced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That leaves a broad field to the hospital authority.  If they were to offer employment to him as a worker in a boiler house, or offer him manual work which he might not be capable of performing because he was accustomed to another type of work of a lighter nature for a long period, then a difficulty would arise.  So long as the employment would be of a similar nature there should not be any difficulty from the point of the recipient accepting the employment.  Where we are dealing with men or women who have sustained injuries, it would be unjust and <Col N="1484" /> unfair to permit the cancellation of the allowance and thereby possibly create a gap until such time as employment was offered.  Nobody wants to take up the position that the authorities will adopt an unreasonable attitude, but it is always possible, once a person gets caught up in an administrative machine, that a certain delay might take place without any bad intent.</P>
    <P>I presume that, in these cases, the determining factor would largely be the resident medical superintendent, or the city or county manager.  It might also be conceivably left for consultation with the full committee.  The committee might not meet for a month or so, which would mean that there would be a period during which this person would be without any financial support, except what he might have saved, what his relatives might provide or what he might obtain from the public assistance authorities.  That would be a very invidious and objectionable position, and, whatever may be the difficulty in accepting the amendment, I think the Parliamentary Secretary should agree that the principle we are trying to get at is good, that men who have sustained injury in the service should not be penalised by the creation of a period between the cessation of their allowance and the date on which they are able to take up employment.</P>

    <P>The Bill sets out that the allowance <Col N="1487" /> payable under this sub-section shall cease finally on the attaining by the child in respect of whom the allowance is granted of the age of 16 years or earlier death.  The Parliamentary Secretary will appreciate that where both parents are dead and the child is solely dependent upon whatever allowance he gets under this Bill, his secondary education, at any rate, will not have been completed at the age of 16.  In a case where the parents intended to give the child a secondary education, the Parliamentary Secretary should consider continuing the allowance until he child will have completed it, which would be at about the age of 18.  If no allowance is to be given once the child has reached the age of 16, it would be too had if it had to depend on relatives or friends.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke (Co. Dublin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the very enlightened and intelligent advance which amendment No. 132 represents. The Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out that the child is to be looked after until it reaches the age of 16 years.  That is a good advance on the provisions in the 1909 Act.  Where a parent in the employment of a mental hospital authority dies in the discharge of his duty, leaving his children dependent on the mental hospital authority, I am sure that the latter will use its discretion for the benefit of the children. Perhaps something further might be done so that the children would be looked after until they got a job. Perhaps a little more could be done for such children on the lines indicated by Deputy Cafferky.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not consider giving a certain discretionary power to a mental hospital authority in the case, say, of children who had won scholarships to secondary schools or more advanced <Col N="1488" /> educational establishments?  If a child succeeded in securing the benefit of a scholarship provided by a local authority it would be very unfair if it had to relinquish the scholarship because of any consequences flowing from this mandatory sub-section. Under the sub-section there is a discretionary power given to the mental hospital authority to reduce, increase or restore allowances.  Why not provide for the exercise of a discretionary power in exceptional cases such as I have referred to, especially where you have studious, intelligent children who have secured for themselves the very limited educational advantages afforded in the way of scholarships?  Why not enable them to take advantage of those scholarships rather than place obstacles in their way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I think when it is realised that I have provided in the framework of the Bill reasonable economic shelter for the children of the deceased officers of the mental hospital authority, the House ought not to press me to go as far as this amendment asks.  We are seeking to make provision for the children until they reach the age of 16 years.  The amendment is a nice gesture all right.  I welcome it particularly from Deputy Cafferky speaking on behalf of the Farmers' Party.  Once again, I have to say that the cost of the extension of the financial provisions to cover the widow and the orphan, and the injured or ailing breadwinner will fall upon the local rates. The proposals which I have in mind regarding the improvement of salary conditions will, as I have already said, throw a very substantial additional burden upon the rates.  I would not consider that a very convincing argument in itself were it not for the fact that the provision which I am making in the Bill is a reasonable one.  As Deputy Burke has said, it is a substantial advance on any provision made previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from these important aspects that have to be taken into consideration, the fact remains that the local authority has ample statutory power to provide educational facilities for the orphans of mental hospital attendants just as it has for the children of any <Col N="1489" /> other section of the community.  It seems to me that, if we concede the principle in relation to the orphans of mental hospital attendants, we cannot logically resist it in relation to the orphans of other officers and servants of local authorities or, indeed, of the State authority.  Now that we have the Farmers' Party with Fianna Fáil taking the field with some Labour support and some support from Fine Gael, we ought to be able to revolutionise the conditions of employment in the local services, if we all stand together. I am the only resistor to the generous treatment that is being offered by the various sections in this House.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I do anticipate some criticism when the huge cost of the new salary scales which will fall on the rates, and which I estimate will amount to £80,000, comes to be considered by the local authorities.  We ought to be reasonable and ought to leave well enough alone.  We ought to be satisfied.  It is discouraging to a representative of the Government, no matter how generously he treats any section of the community, to be asked &ldquo;why are you not more generous?&rdquo;, and that comes from Deputies who can be very critical of the cost of Government, whether it be in regard to the mounting cost of the rates or of the taxation that is necessary to maintain the services of Central Government.</P>
    <P>The proper approach to this question, I suggest, would be this: if it is thought desirable that special educational facilities should be provided for the classes under discussion, the proper way to do that is to see that the local authority, in the exercise of its powers and functions in relation to the provision of scholarships, will be more generous.  In fact, the local authorities have a very wide discretion at the present time in that matter, but when they come to consider the relative merits and claims of the orphans of mental hospital attendants with the claims of other sections of the community, they may decide that the orphans of the former have already been reasonably provided for, and that, perhaps, some of them have been better provided for than many of the <Col N="1490" /> ratepayers are able to provide for their own children.</P>

      <P>The ratepayer does not object to money being wisely spent. What he objects to is the unwise spending of money.  When the Estimates come up for discussion I shall point out where economies can be effected which may make up the extra capital needed for the administration of this Bill.  I hope the Government will put the economies into effect and apply the saving to the administration of this Bill.  Apart from that, I feel our purpose should be, not merely in relation to the children of mental attendants, but in relation to all children, to give them every opportunity to secure better and more modern education. <Col N="1491" /> Orphans of mental hospital attendants should be cared for under this Bill.  I admit that the Parliamentary Secretary has gone a long way but it is no use going two-thirds of the way.</P>
      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary had gone the full length, there would have been no need for my amendment.  I am sure he will admit that 16 years is not a sufficiently high age for the completion of studies to such an extent that the boy or girl would be able to take up a position in the Civil Service, or any other State organisation.  Nineteen years is the minimum age, and it is because of that that I tabled this amendment.  I have no apology to offer for doing so, and I think the Parliamentary Secretary is taking a narrow view of it in representing to the House the increased expenditure involved. The Parliamentary Secretary should take more courage, and if he has done a lot of things that are wrong, he should do a few things that are right. If he accepts my amendment he will not lose his seat at the next election on that account.  He may head the poll.  There is no need for him to worry as to how we are going to explain this to the farmers when we face them at a local or general election.</P>

      <P>There are a lot of amendments here and they cannot all be put.  That is the tragedy. I make the suggestion that we take a decision on Nos. 135, 136 and 137 and, if Deputies are not satisfied, they will have an opportunity on Report. Amendment No. 133 suggests a maximum annual allowance of two-thirds of the salary.  I think Deputies will admit that that is conditioned by the proposal, which was negatived, that the superannuation would be based on sixtieths rather than eightieths.  It is hardly feasible, I suggest, to qualify for a half salary rate as pension on eightieths; still less to exceed it. Amendments Nos. 133, 134 and 140 need not, therefore, be moved. Amendments Nos. 135 and 136, which increase widows' allowances, can be discussed together, the question to be put, of course, that &ldquo;one-third&rdquo; stands.  Amendment No. 137 will then be taken, the decision thereon excluding Nos. 138 and 139.  Amendment No. 139, I think, is in any case, largely based&mdash;Deputy Larkin will admit&mdash;on his proposals in amendment No. 80. That is the best, I think, that can be done to fit in the amendments&mdash;to discuss Nos. 135 and 136 together and to have one decision and then to take No. 137, governing Nos. 137, 138 and 139, and if there is any point omitted it might be tried on Report.

The Oireachtas as, I suppose, most of its members are aware, in July of 1940, enacted a measure providing that officers and employees of local authorities any part of whose remuneration was paid as a bonus regulated by the cost-of-living index figure would, after the passing of the Bill, that is from the 1st day of July, 1940, have that bonus calculated by reference to a cost-of-living index figure of 185.  That Act, accordingly, has controlled and stabilised the salaries of the officers falling within the category to which I have referred, that is officers part of whose remuneration consisted of a bonus based upon a basic figure and regulated by the cost-of-living index figure.  Their salaries, as I said, have been stabilised since 1st July, 1940, at the amount at which they stood at that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently the Government decided that as the standstill policy in regard to remuneration in general had not become effective until the cost-of-living index figure had risen to a point <Col N="1494" /> equivalent to 210, the Civil Service, whose remuneration, as the House is aware, carries with it a cost-of-living bonus, should have their cost-of-living bonus computed by reference to a cost-of-living index figure of 210.</P>
    <P>In view of that fact, and in view of the decision of the Government, it is felt that it is only equitable that officers of local authorities, whose remuneration was determined in the same way, should be placed on the same basis henceforward as the officers of the State are, and accordingly this Bill proposes that where a cost-of-living bonus forms any part of the remuneration of an officer of a local authority, it will be computed by reference to a figure of 210; that is to say, by reference to a figure 25 points higher than that which prevailed after the date upon which the Principal Act was passed in July, 1940.  This principle will also extend to officers of local authorities whose superannuation has been calculated by a reference to the cost-of-living index figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister ought not to leave the House under that impression, because he is dealing with a matter which still leaves a very large and important section of local officials completely as they were before the enormous increase in the cost of living started since the beginning of <Col N="1495" /> the war.  Whatever the position may be elsewhere, in Dublin there is a situation in which officials who were above the £400 a year rate of income have been completely left untouched by any arrangement to give any increase related to the enormous increase in the cost of living which has taken place since the war.</P>
      <P>The position is that officers whose salary normally reached £400 a year and above that, and who were entitled to a cost-of-living bonus prior to 1922, at some particular time after that year had their salaries stabilised on the assumption that the cost-of-living figure would range at about 150.  They were somewhat disappointed with the way in which things developed with regard to the cost of living after their salaries were stabilised in that way. But, whatever disappointments they suffered before that, they were in the position when this emergency began&mdash;I quote from the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> of September 17th, page 133&mdash;that the cost-of-living index figure for August, 1939, was 173.  Therefore, the position was that officials of the Dublin Corporation who were on the £400 mark, which had been stabilised on the assumption that the cost of living would remain at about 150, were already in September, 1939, suffering as a result of that stabilisation.  But the cost-of-living figure which affected them adversely then at a rate of 173 has risen to 296.  Actually, last year the cost-of-living figure in February was 296; in May, 292; and in August, 296.  I do not know what it was in November, but the figure published for mid-February was 295.  So that you have a situation that everybody with £400 a year or above that in the employment of the Dublin Corporation at the present time is suffering from severe hardship as a result of the enormous increase in the cost of living that has gone on since the war began.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister whether it is not a fact that representations have been made to him by the Dublin Corporation, or, at any rate, by the city manager, on whom the responsibility for dealing adequately with staff problems is now placed.  I suggest that <Col N="1496" /> the Minister has had formal representations made to him as to the very great hardship that is being suffered by officials of that kind and their families. I submit to him that the House would like to know what examination he has caused to be made into that situation, and what he proposes to do in the matter.  It does suggest to anybody who knows how difficult it is to maintain a family with the enormous increase in the cost of living to-day, as disclosed by the figures, and to anyone who has any experience of the normal cost of living in respect of those matters which are not able to reflect themselves in the cost-of-living index, what is being suffered by the families and by the officials themselves.  They see their families squeezed by the present emergency circumstances.  I would ask the Minister whether he has gone into that matter, and whether he proposes to do anything to apply the same type of relief to the officers of local authorities over the £400 level as is applied to officers on similar scales of salary in the Civil Service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect of this problem that I do not think is touched by the Bill, but which is a very closely related problem.  This Bill seems to concern itself with the case of certain persons whose bonus agreement was stabilised by the 1940 Act, but there is the case of other persons who are affected by what flowed out of the 1940 Act, and flowed from the Government's stabilisation policy.  I refer to the case of the ordinary employees of the Dublin Corporation.  In February, 1940, following a dispute between the Union representing those employees and the city manager, an effort was made to devise a basis of regulating the wages of what might be described as the general workers employed by the Corporation.  It was then suggested to the Union concerned that they should consent to an arrangement by which the wages of the manipulative staff would be regulated by reference to a cost-of-living index figure which was to be ascertained periodically by the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to avoid any friction then <Col N="1497" /> or at a future date as to the regulation of wage scales and in order to have the matter put on some satisfactory basis, the union, speaking for the employees concerned, consented to this arrangement. In other words, they accepted the principle of regulation of wages by reference to a cost-of-living index figure.  However, when they asked the corporation to indicate to what extent wages would move having regard to the movement in the index figure, the corporation offered certain proposals which the union viewed as unreasonable, as the index figure would have to rise pretty substantially before they received anything like reasonable compensation for the rise in prices.  A deadlock then occurred between the union on the one hand and the city manager on the other hand.</P>
    <P>While they were endeavouring to overcome the difficulties which had been created and were trying to get some kind of agreement with the corporation as to the rate at which their wages would change in future in relation to the index figure, the Government announced its general stabilisation policy.  It implemented that policy in Emergency Powers Order No. 83, the effect of which was to prevent any employee securing an increase in wages at that stage.  Subsequently, that Order was modified and certain increases were permitted.  Those increases have now reached a permitted maximum of 11/- a week.  The employees of the Dublin Corporation concerned, that is, the manipulative staff, have always felt that they got a rather raw deal.  They were endeavouring to put their wages on a cost-of-living bonus basis and have them regulated according to a rise or fall in the index figure, but, whilst the negotiations were in progress, Emergency Powers Order No. 83 clamped down on the general level of wages and prohibited any increase in the wages paid on the 5th May, 1941.</P>
    <P>If the Government had not implemented the Order at that time, it is quite likely that some solution of this difficulty would have been found and then the corporation staff would have their wages regulated to-day, not on the 1941 rates plus the emergency <Col N="1498" /> bonus amounting to a maximum of 11/- but rather to the rise and fall in the index figure.  That would ensure them much better compensation for the rise in the cost of living than they are receiving by reason of the meagre maximum allowance of 11/- per week. This Bill deals only with the amendment of the 1940 Act and, perhaps, cannot be applied to cover a case of that kind, but I would ask the Minister to examine the merits of the issue and give sympathetic consideration to the recommendations which may have been made to him, or certainly will be made to him, by the union concerned.</P>
    <P>There is at least a case for sympathetic consideration of the claim and, if the Minister would examine it, he may find it equitable to permit the manipulative staff to receive a higher rate of remuneration than that which they are receiving at present by reason of the fact that their wages were clamped down by the operation of the Emergency Powers Order.  The Minister may be familiar with the issues involved and, if so, perhaps he would say now whether he has examined the matter and will hold out any hope of permitting an increase in that case because of the unusual circumstances surrounding the collapse of the negotiations which were on foot when Order No. 83 was introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I had not the benefit of hearing the Minister's opening statement.  Some members may wonder as to the necessity for this Bill and why its application is confined to the officials of the Dublin Corporation.  The history behind it is that in 1919 the staff of the corporation went on strike and, as a result, they were conceded a cost-of-living bonus as then applying to the Civil Service.  Strange to say, however, there was no provision made for any further fluctuation, so that in 1920 and to the end of 1921 the position was that corporation officials had a higher cost-of-living bonus than civil servants actually had at that period.  The Government of the day intervened and suggested to the corporation that the matter should be put on a uniform basis.  As a result of that request, the <Col N="1499" /> whole question of salaries and scales was examined and a number of new grades and scales were introduced.  On that point I would like to support the plea put forward by Deputy Mulcahy in regard to certain officials of the corporation.</P>
      <P>They decided then, on what was deemed to be good advice, that it would be better to have certain scales on a stabilised basis, on the understanding that the cost of living steadied itself at about 50 over the 1914 figure.  Actually, that position did not materialise and it adversely affected the staff on stabilised salaries up to 1933, so that they lost considerably.  At that stage, the cost of living fell, but the international situation round about 1934 and 1935 began to have influences here and the staff were subsequently hit still more as a result.  Since 1939, the position has been aggravated.  The Minister will appreciate that there are certain anomalies arising out of these grades and scales introduced at that time.  I am making this plea because those grades were hitched on to a cost-of-living bonus and were switched over on account of the circumstances which I have related.</P>
      <P>Take, for example, the grade of minor staff officer in the Dublin Corporation. You have a glaring anomaly there at present.  There is a very valuable official who got promotion in the Housing Department some time ago, from minor staff officer to staff officer, and his position, as a result of the operation of this bonus, will be that his promotion will mean a loss of £42 a year.  A very good case, therefore, can be made, considering all the circumstances of the period when the stabilisation of these salaries took place.  Having regard to the serious amount the officials have lost by reason of the arrangement made in 1922, consideration should be given to this matter along the lines of the Civil Service as a whole, where the bonus applies from the position of messenger to that of secretary.  I think a very good case can be made, on sympathetic grounds, even at this stage, so far as these officers are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will join with Deputy Norton in <Col N="1500" /> asking the Minister to give us some indication with regard to other grades in the service.  Naturally, the wage-earning sections will find themselves in an invidious position if they are excluded from the operation of any advantages that will accrue from a change in this cost-of-living figure.  I understand the unions have made representations and I should like to hear the Minister's view on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Minister that in 1919, when these salaries were arranged, there was a man in the Department of Local Government who was at that time attempting to break, and who eventually succeeded in breaking, the British rule in this country.  From that until 1922, or even later, was a rather troubled period, with the result that, whatever arrangements were arrived at then to meet the situation, they were not regarded as permanent and these officials should have come in under the stabilised salary category.  They are in the position that at the moment the increase which Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned does not apply to them.  Some of them have been promoted and they are in a worse position as a result of the promotion than before they were promoted.</P>
      <P>I will ask the Minister to consider this matter sympathetically.  While I appreciate that asking for an increase for one section swells an already large bill, nevertheless, I would like him to investigate the circumstances under which these officials were originally established and their salaries fixed. Perhaps he will also consider the peculiar circumstances and particularly the effect which the stabilisation at a certain time and at a certain rate has on the present cost of living, and if possible, accede to the request which the city manager made in the circular forwarded to the Department as far back as last December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Deputy O'Sullivan, is correct in suggesting that this Bill is applicable only to the Dublin Corporation? I feel that was a narrow interpretation of it, and I have reason to believe that it embraces at least one <Col N="1501" /> man in Limerick.  I would like to join with Deputy Norton and Deputy O'Sullivan in asking the Minister to give sympathetic consideration to those who are excluded from these provisions. I think the case that has been made for the workers in Dublin would apply with equal force to the workers of other corporations.  I should say that they would apply equally to the workers in Cork or Galway.  I do not think that this matter should be approached completely from the metropolitan angle.  The workers were denied any increase between 1939 and 1943 when many others got increases. Then somewhat belatedly they did get an increase, but we must remember that there was a big gap when prices were mounting strenuously and steeply.  That period must be borne in mind.  I think there is a good case for a commensurate increase, and it ought to be considered seriously by the Minister, as regards the workers who are not covered by this Bill.</P>
      <P>With regard to the officers whose remuneration is not fixed on a basic rate, plus cost of living, I would like to point out that, while there is only one man in the public service in Limerick who will benefit by this, when their salaries were fixed in the old days they had strict relation to the then cost of living and I suggest the 11/- emergency bonus given to these officials since then is in no way comparable to the sufferings they have undergone, and they are carrying out the same important duties.  I have known cases where the basic salary, plus the cost-of-living bonus, in the old days would have been higher than the fixed salary of the officials excluded from the provisions of this measure.  There is one case that deserves very sympathetic consideration, and that is the case for an advance to the men who are excluded, workers in Limerick, Cork and Galway.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that a big part of the discussion which we had on this Bill is rather beside the point.  This is an Act to amend the Local Authorities (Cost of Living) Act, 1940, and, naturally, the discussion must fall within the Long Title of that Act, which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1502" />&ldquo;An Act to restrict the upward variation of remuneration and superannuation allowances payable by local authorities which are variable, in whole or in part, by reference to the cost of living.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I tried to make it clear, when I was introducing this Bill, that it applied, and was intended to apply, only to a section of the officers or servants of local authorities, that it applies to the officers or servants of local authorities, without any territorial limitation, who come within the ambit of the original Act, that is to say, officers or servants, any part of whose remuneration is calculated by reference to the cost-of-living figure.  Accordingly, it does not apply to the officers or servants of public authorities in general, and it does not apply to any section of officers who, their remuneration having been formerly regulated by reference to the cost-of-living figure, decided, for reasons which I am sure at the time seemed good and sufficient to themselves, to abandon that system of payment and to accept instead a consolidated figure or a stabilised figure.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to argue the merits or demerits of the case.  I do not wish to enter into any controversy with Deputies who have raised the matter here, but I would like to say this, because it has an important bearing on the matter, that as regards an arrangement which has persisted for over 20 years, an arrangement on the basis of which people who were not in the service of local authorities at the time it was made, have since entered into contracts of service, we could not depart from that unless the Government intended to alter its policy in regard to remuneration, salaries and wages in general.</P>

We all know that the cost of <Col N="1503" /> living has risen, but the Government, for reasons which were good, reasons which were upheld in this House and which have been justified by the people at two general elections, decided that, in the interest of the nation as a whole, a certain policy should be pursued in regard to remuneration, salaries and wages.  It has been pursued, and I do not think it would be relevant to start a discussion of it on this Bill.</P>

I was saying that it was quite obvious that one could not, in relation to a general class of public servants, such as those Deputy Mulcahy has in mind, depart from the general policy of the Government in relation to this matter of remuneration and wages without abandoning the policy as a whole, and therefore it would be quite unworthy and very reprehensible on my part if I were to say at this stage that there is any great hope that the general body of officers and servants of the local authorities will be given the benefit of the provisions of this Bill.  The Bill does not apply only to the officers of the Dublin Corporation.  It applies to that section of the officers and servants of local authorities in general whose remuneration, prior to the passing of the Act of 1940, was calculated by reference to a cost-of-living figure.</P>

In Section 75, he limits the extent of the discretion to one-third of the yearly salary or wages in the case of widows, and to one-half in all other cases.  The object of amendment No. 136 is to make the limit one-half in both cases.  It seems to me that it is only fair that the widows of deceased officials especially should be equitably treated, because I know some of these people who are living at present in very poor circumstances.  It is only in recent years, as a matter of fact, that they were entitled to any consideration at all, because of the death of their husbands.</P>
      <P>More especially to widows with large families, as some of them have, the allowance which mental hospital authorities are permitted to pay under the Bill is small, and I do think the Parliamentary Secretary might see his way in this instance to increase the amount to one-half.  I must say that the Parliamentary Secretary has dealt rather well with the staffs of mental hospitals.  He has made reasonably good provision for them and for their dependents in case of death or disability, and I suggest that in this instance also he might be able to see his way to make the amount uniform, and allow one-half in the case of widows as well as in all other cases.</P>

It would appear to me that under Section 75 there is a limit, in one case, of one-third, and in another case of a half.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 138:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-paragraph (a) (ii) and paragraph (b) of sub-section (1), lines 37 to 41, and substitute the following three new sub-sections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  For the purposes of this Part of this Act all registered officers and servants of a mental hospital authority who have completed thirty years of service shall be entitled to resign.</P>
      <P>(3)  In no case shall any registered officer or servant be allowed to continue in the service of a mental hospital authority for more than forty years.  The ceiling with regard to lump sum payable and annual allowance shall come into operation after thirty-five years' service.</P>
      <P>(4)  Any officer or servant who is about to retire shall be given the option of claiming an annual allowance based on one-fiftieth of his, or her, annual salary or wages for each completed year of service instead of the lump sum payment and annual allowance to which he, or she, is entitled.</P>
      <P>There is the feeling that the provision whereby staffs can serve for 40 years in mental hospitals retards promotion very much.  Of course the circumstances in certain cases have to be taken into consideration where, for example, a man has a large family.  He might not be in a position to retire after 35 years' service.  There is the feeling, however, that the period of 40 years is too long.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment which I put down is in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1508" /> In sub-section (1) to delete sub-paragraph (ii), lines 37 and 38, and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>(ii) in any other case, one half of such salary or wages where the person to whom, or in respect of whom, the allowance is payable has not more than 25 years' service, and</P>
    <P>(iii) sixty per cent. of such salary or wages where the person to whom, or in respect of whom, the allowance is payable has more than 25 years' service.</P>
    <P>I feel that the principle in my amendment is somewhat different from the one we are now discussing.  In a number of sections various rates of superannuation are calculated under different headings.  I did not submit any amendment on that point because of the viewpoint I had already expressed, namely, that we could not reasonably expect the Parliamentary Secretary to accept a position which would lead to the payment of a larger superannuation sum under the present Bill than that provided in the 1909 Act.  In drafting amendments to this part of the Bill, I confined myself largely to Section 75 in order to try to achieve what I had already submitted to the Parliamentary Secretary, namely, that while we might not be entitled to expect an improvement, it was reasonable to ask him to grant to the officers and servants who would opt to come under this measure at least the same financial return as they would enjoy under the 1909 Act.</P>
    <P>The purpose of my amendment, as Deputies will see, is to substitute the ceiling of a half of the yearly salary in respect of annual allowances by first of all setting out that, in the case of officers having not more than 25 years' service, we would accept half the annual salary or wages as being the ceiling governing the maximum allowances paid annually, but that in the case of officers having more than 25 years' service we would try to meet their position to the extent of raising the ceiling to 60 per cent. of their annual salary or wages.  The 60 per cent would afford a very slight increase on what they would obtain <Col N="1509" /> under the 1909 Act.  I have already submitted to the Parliamentary Secretary that we could accept the principle that these officers should not lose on the basis of the average number of years that they enjoyed their superannuation allowance after retiring, and that if we could arrive at an even lower percentage than 60, which would be an equitable figure, it would meet the situation fairly.  So far, the Parliamentary Secretary has not shown any indication of accepting that point of view.  He persists in telling us that only in cases where they were drawing the superannuation allowance for a very considerable number of years would they suffer an actual financial loss.  He knows that is not correct, and that the loss would start to accrue in the seventh or eighth year of the average period during which superannuation allowances are drawn by those persons&mdash;the period in which the allowance is at its highest.</P>
    <P>There is an attempt in this amendment to try to meet the Parliamentary Secretary's difficulties, and at the same time retain the good points of the scheme so far as the lump sum is concerned. He should be prepared to see if it is possible to meet the submissions which have been made to meet that.  I accept the ruling of the Chair on this matter, although I feel that the principle embodied in my amendment is entirely different from that in the amendments we are now discussing.  I am accepting the ruling of the Chair subject to being able to raise this matter on a later stage of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated to the House, many times in fact, that I regard the superannuation provisions in this Bill as being exceptionally generous.  I have suggested to the House that there is not any superannuation code applying either to officers of local authorities or to officers of the central authority with equally advantageous conditions from the point of view of the officers and servants affected.  Notwithstanding repetition of that, notwithstanding demonstration of it by example, the same old arguments are trotted out on every amendment&mdash;could you not be a little more generous in this respect and in <Col N="1510" /> that respect?  I can only say that the financial structure of this superannuation code has been very carefully worked out.  I have been as generous in that code as it is possible to be and there are some very minor amendments which I have already conceded.  Consequently, however anxious Deputies may be to exact still better terms, I have to say to the House that I have nothing further to concede.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke's series of amendments under the heading of one amendment are, in fact, contrary to principles that have already been established in relation to the Bill.  Sub-section (2) of Deputy Burke's amendment is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For the purposes of this Part of this Act all registered officers and servants of a mental hospital authority who have completed 30 years of service shall be entitled to resign.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The House has already agreed, and it is incorporated in the Bill, that they must have reached the age of 55 years before they can retire.  They enter the service of the mental hospital authority between the ages of 18 and 26. Let us take 20 years of age.  After 30 years' service the average attendant in the mental hospital service would be entitled, if this amendment were accepted, to retire at the age of 50.  We dealt with that principle already and it was decided by the House, and it is not proposed to permit these attendants to retire at the age of 50.  Let me again point out that in all this matter we are discussing, not attendants whose health has broken down in the service, not attendants or nurses who are mentally or physically incapacitated, but attendants and nurses who are deemed to be in full physical and mental health.  If they are unfit physically or mentally for the full discharge of their duty, the superannuation code already incorporated in the Bill makes ample provision for retirement and for the addition of years, if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand why all this pressure should be put upon me in relation to the retirement of able-bodied men at 50 years of age or before 50 years of age.  I do not think it is a principle that should be forced <Col N="1511" /> upon the Government or, in fact, I do not think it is a sound principle at all. I do not see any reason why a man or woman who is physically and mentally fit and in enjoyment of a sheltered post should not continue in the public service until he or she is at least 55 years of age.</P>
    <P>Under sub-section (3) of Deputy Burke's amendment, an unregistered officer, a clerk, in the employment of a mental hospital authority, could retire, if he entered the service at 18, at the age of 58.  That principle has never been conceded by the House to any class of officers of a local authority.  I do not think the principle is likely to be conceded, but, at any rate, it is contrary to the sections of the Bill that have already been accepted by the House.  One gets tired going over this ground over and over again.  It seems to me that I might as well be talking to myself, in my room.  Deputies, apparently, have a certain attitude to maintain here.  Certain speeches must be made, apparently, and we are going over the same ground over and over again.  If I have said once, I have said half a dozen times to-day, when Deputies suggest that hardships would actually be inflicted on mental hospital attendants under the superannuation code in this Bill, as compared with the provisions of the 1909 Act&mdash;and apparently I must say it again before it will sink in&mdash;that the officers and servants who are themselves immediately concerned, want the terms of the Bill in preference to the terms of the 1909 Act.</P>

        <Col N="1512" /> On a point of explanation.  As I have already indicated to the House, it is really a personal matter as to whether the person going out would like to get the terms of the 1909 Act or the terms of this Bill.  One man or woman might like to get the two-thirds, and ten might like to get the lump sum.  Nobody can definitely say that there would be 100 per cent. in favour of the lump sum or 100 per cent. against it.  Personally, I think that this Bill is a big advance on the 1909 Act, as far as a married official is concerned anyway.  His widow is looked after under this Bill, whereas under the 1909 Act death had to be due to some specific disease in order that the widow might benefit. The doctor had to certify that should that man live he would be unable to carry out any further duty.  Personally, I regard this Bill as a big advance on the 1909 Act.</P>

      <P>I am not aware, and Deputy Murphy has not told us if any difficulties have arisen in relation to the principle that this amendment is intended to cover.  I have never heard of any such difficulty regarding the collection of arrears and contributions. But I should like to point out to Deputy Murphy that, under the terms of the Bill, officers and servants who have not been entitled to superannuation under the 1909 Act may now become pensionable under the Bill. Consequently, if we were to be restricted in the method of collecting arrears of contributions, we might encounter some difficulty in bringing them within the terms of the Bill. There are certain classes who will be <Col N="1514" /> pensionable under this Bill who were not pensionable under the 1909 Act.  In some cases considerable arrears may have accumulated and one of the matters to which we have to direct attention is a suitable arrangement under which these arrears can be collected.</P>
      <P>They may have to be spread over a period, because the arrears taken in one lump sum might perhaps be more than the officer or servant could conveniently bear.  I do not think the Deputy need anticipate any difficulty of the nature that his amendment is intended to meet.  But the acceptance of the amendment would definitely involve administrative difficulties afterwards when bringing in certain classes under the superannuation code who were not pensionable before.</P>

      <P>In page 36, to insert before sub-section (2) a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Where an officer or servant of a mental hospital authority dies while in their service and such officer or servant had been in the service of a mental hospital authority for less than five years, the mental hospital authority in the service of whom he died (whether such authority have or have not made a grant in relation to him under Section 73 or 74 of this Act) may, in their discretion, pay (subject to the proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 31 of the Finance Act, 1922) to his legal personal representative the aggregate amount of <Col N="1518" /> the contributions of such officer or servant under this Part of this Act.</P>
    <P>This provides that where an officer or servant with less than five years' service dies, the mental hospital authority may pay the aggregate amount of his contributions to his legal personal representatives. If he has served five years or longer a payment may be made under Section 68 to his legal personal representative.  Over five years, a payment in made under Section 68; under five years, there is to be a refund of the contributions.</P>

      <P>There is a group of amendments here all relating to the return of contributions to a female officer of one of these institutions who retires on marriage.  There are two points which arise.  One is the power of the authority to withhold a refund and the other is an addition to the amount of such refund.  If we take amendment No. 149, the two points are combined and Deputies might prefer separate decisions.  That could be achieved if we take amendments Nos. 152 and 153, where the two points are isolated.  It is for the Committee to decide, but if amendment No. 149 is taken now and decided upon, on the Question: &ldquo;That the words proposed to be deleted stand,&rdquo; the other amendments will fall.  Once it is decided that the words in the Bill stand no more amendments can be offered to those words.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Keyes I move amendment No. 149:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), page 37, to delete all words after the word &ldquo;period&rdquo; in line 1 and substitute the words &ldquo;such authority shall pay to her the aggregate amount of her contributions under this Part of this Act together with three per cent. thereon calculated at simple interest.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This proposes first of all to withdraw the discretionary power given to the mental hospital authority as set down at present in the Bill, and to make it <Col N="1519" /> mandatory to pay to a female officer about to marry an amount equal to the aggregate of her contributions. Secondly, the amendment proposes that, in addition to such contributions, the authority shall pay a sum equivalent to 3 per cent. interest thereon. There is some difficulty in discussing this proposal, in view of the way in which the amendments are linked together, and, in so far as other speakers would deal with other proposals, I would prefer not to enlarge on the suggestion of the payment of interest, and at the moment I merely move the amendment formally.</P>

      <P>In addition to a refund of the contributions made by a female attendant who retires for the purpose of marriage, it is proposed that she shall also be entitled to a lump sum equivalent to one month's salary and emoluments for each year of service. In support of amendment No. 151, I advance the case of the civil servant or the vocational teacher.  So far as I know, it is the rule in the Civil Service that a female officer retiring for the purpose of marriage gets such a payment, and if it is right in the case of the civil servant and the vocational teacher, surely it cannot be wrong in the case of the female attendant in the mental hospital.</P>

      <P>The section, as it stands, provides that a mental hospital authority may, in its discretion, pay the aggregate of the amount of the contributions <Col N="1520" /> under the Act to a female attendant who resigns on marriage. The first question that is raised is to substitute the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;may,&rdquo; in order that the authority would be under a statutory obligation to make a refund of the contributions under such circumstances.  I have no rooted objection to that, but I doubt if it is necessary.  I believe that, in every such case, the mental hospital authority would, in fact, refund the contributions.  However, I am prepared to look into the point between this and the Report Stage.</P>
      <P>The next point we are asked to concede is that, in addition to refunding the contributions, we should give 3 per cent. interest on them.  I do not look upon that with so much favour. In fact, it comes very near to the question of a marriage gratuity and, if I were disposed to make such a provision, I would prefer to make it by way of a marriage gratuity straight off, rather than by the circuitous way of giving her interest on her contributions towards a pension.</P>
      <P>I would like to remind the House of this fact in relation to these contributions towards pensions, that they are a very small percentage of the actual cost of the pensions to the rating authority.  Not only that, but the local authority has not the use of that money.  The pension contribution is not, in fact, collected.  The payment is deducted from the salary of the attendant when the payment is being made. It would be quite true to say that, to such an extent as the local authority has not to pay the full salary, they have the enjoyment of the contribution; but, at the same time, it is, in fact, the ratepayers who have the enjoyment of it, because the ratepayers do not contribute it.  While I say that, I think we might get rid of all these amendments and I am prepared to consider the question of the marriage gratuity.  We cannot have a refund of contributions with or without interest, plus a marriage gratuity, plus a whole lot of other things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were to make a concession, I would prefer to try to make provision for the marriage gratuity.  Deputies will, of course, be understanding if I <Col N="1521" /> try to meet them in this regard, and they will appreciate in advance that the amount of the marriage gratuity will have to have an upward limit. Deputy Pattison talks about one month's salary for each year's service. That principle might be all right up to a point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the things you will have to guard against.  There would have to be an upward limit. Probably a reasonable limit would be a maximum of a year's salary.  Anyhow I am prepared to look into the matter further.  Whether it would be necessary to fix a minimum period of service before she would become entitled to a marriage gratuity is another matter that will require some consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">

      <P>On the other hand, if we accept Deputy Pattison's suggestion, while a lot could be said in its favour, at the same time it might have certain social disadvantages.  If we make the sky the limit so far as the marriage gratuity is concerned, the temptation might be to remain in the service very long, and we might have real old maids as a tempting bargain in the marriage market.  We do not want to encourage that.  If we are going to get them married at all, I would prefer to get them out of the service in time, so that they might give other service to the home and to the State.  At any rate, I think the House will be satisfied that I am trying to meet the different viewpoints that have been put up here, but Deputies must be satisfied with modest proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In the Bill, as drafted, there is provision for the appointment of visiting committees by the mental hospital authority to <Col N="1526" /> visit other institutions and accommodation maintained by them and, under sub-section (4) of this section, it is specifically laid down that the visiting committee shall not inquire into or receive any complaint or make any report in relation to the services, remuneration, privileges or superannuation of the officers and servants of the mental hospital authority by whom the committee were appointed or any of such officers or servants.</P>
      <P>I am moving the deletion of that sub-section because I cannot see the justification for denying such facilities to a visiting committee.  Let us be clear that what is proposed here is merely the receipt of complaints and the making of inquiries into them and not in any way the making of decisions in regard to wages, salaries, privileges, superannuation and so on.  I am aware that visiting committees of this nature do perform a very valuable function in forming a connecting link between members of the staff and the joint committee.  I know that, under the present system, the manager exercises this power, but so long as we have a visiting committee, charged with the duty of inspecting the general condition of, say, a branch hospital, the welfare of patients and the upkeep and maintenance of the institution and also of seeing that the conditions under which the staff carry out their duties are satisfactory, they should be given facilities to inquire into and receive complaints for transmission to the responsible authority which has the power of making the final decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The very fact that in many cases the members of a visiting committee are persons who have either a personal knowledge of the duties performed by the staff, or, as in the case of officers of trade unions acting on visiting committees, a knowledge of the conditions generally recognised and observed in relation to the duties being performed, helps the sifting and analysing of many of the complaints which cause disquietude and worry to various members of the staff.  If the Parliamentary Secretary would agree to afford these committees the facilities to carry on what they have been doing for many years, he would not find any advantage being taken of it, or any difficulties <Col N="1527" /> created in respect of the management of the institution.</P>
    <P>I do not know what exactly is the reason for the inclusion of the sub-section, except possibly to safeguard and keep clear the very definite line of demarcation as between the manager and the joint committee, but so long as we confine any such powers as may be given to a visiting committee merely to inquiry and report, I cannot see, subject to the good relations existing between the manager and the joint committee which the Minister for Local Government reminds us are the relations which should exist, that there could be any friction or any reason for restricting the powers of a visiting committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary by this time has abundant information to show that this is a very undesirable provision in the law.  I know that in regard to my own part of the country, of which I can speak with a certain amount of knowledge, some of which at least has reached the Department, that it is very unwise to have this provision.  Apart from the fact that people connected with the employees' trade unions may be members of the visiting committee, it is desirable that members of the staff should be able to bring matters concerning conditions inside the institution to the notice of other members of the committee, and I think it very desirable that the Parliamentary Secretary should make some provision whereby such a committee will not be confined merely to consultation with patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the section, in the main, is to enable visiting committees to be appointed in order that they may make periodic visits to an institution, with a view to satisfying themselves that the patients are being properly looked after.  The restriction imposed by sub-section (4), as Deputy Larkin has pointed out, is keeping in step with the County Management Act.  It says that a committee</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1528" />&ldquo;shall not inquire into or receive any complaint or make any report in relation to the services, remuneration, privileges or superannuation of the officers and servants...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is not part of their business to inquire into services, remuneration, privileges or superannuation.  They are to concern themselves, and their primary and particular purpose is to concern themselves, with the patients, conditions of treatment and with receiving any complaints the patients may have to make and forwarding them to the proper authority.</P>
    <P>Deputies are well aware&mdash;the matter has been very fully discussed in the House on many occasions&mdash;of the procedure already provided in the Local Government Act, 1941, for officers and servants having any complaint they may have as to their conditions of employment investigated and determined.  It is set out definitely in the Act of 1941.  They can appeal to the Minister and the Minister can investigate and take such steps, if any, as may be necessary for the purpose of fully protecting the interests of officers and servants.</P>
    <P>I think it would be a wrong principle and could lead to nothing but confusion and trouble if a visiting committee, which is intended to have an altogether different function, should begin to poke its nose into the conditions of service of officers and servants and to receive complaints and make reports.  If, in fact, a committee busies itself with that kind of activity, in all probability it will fail to serve the purpose for which it is to be appointed.  I realise the desire of the members of the Labour Party who perhaps belong to labour organisations to be in a position to receive complaints from members of their unions and to be in a position to pursue them, but they will have to operate their trade union activities through trade union channels and not through membership of a visiting committee of a mental hospital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I protect against the last few words of the Parliamentary <Col N="1529" /> Secretary?  There is no desire to utilise the machinery of a visiting committee to do the work of a trade union.  Rather has the reverse been the case.  I have in mind two instances which arose lately.  In one case, where a strike occurred among men bringing fuel into an institution, the trade union officially would not countenance a strike and there was a deadlock.  Only because an official of that union was acting as a member of the visiting committee for the period, was it possible to bring about an adjustment and to see that a supply of fuel was restored to the institution. On another occasion, when acting as a member of the visiting committee, he found that the conditions under which steam was being raised in the institution were unbearable and of such a kind that difficulties were being created in the institution by reason of lack of steam and heat.  A solution of that problem not only involved arrangements for the proper handling of turf but a consideration of the payments to be made.</P>
      <P>I ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether he is not aware that visiting committees have been carrying on for many years what he now prohibits them from doing.  On the whole, I do not think it has given rise to any difficult situation, even since the coming into force of the 1940 Act.  He knows quite well that while members of a visiting committee are officially prohibited as members of a visiting committee from making these inquiries and reports, the inquiries and reports will be made just the same.  All he is concerned with here is to try to preserve the letter of the law when he knows that the whole spirit is contrary to what he has in the Bill.  The deletion of this section does not mean that thereby positive powers are given to such committees to carry out these inquiries and to receive reports.</P>

    <P>It merely explains the situation that has obtained for quite some time and that, so far, has not given rise to any objection.  The fact that members of these visiting committees have close and possibly more intimate contact with members of the staff very often brings out certain difficulties that very <Col N="1530" /> often are not easily dealt with by the ordinary official machine.  It is quite correct to say that any employee who has a grievance in regard to his salary, remuneration or privileges can communicate officially with the mental hospital committee through his trade union, but, while that is so, it very often happens that a long period elapses before the matter is adjusted. If, instead, the matter could be inquired into on the spot by the visiting committee, and under the conditions in which the person concerned is carrying out his duties, possibly the whole thing might be cleared up at once, and there would be no need whatever to make a report to the manager or the other responsible authorities.  I myself have come across cases of persons carrying out certain additional duties.  It was merely a question not of making a formal application for an increase of remuneration but of witnessing the actual work they were doing on behalf of the patients.  As soon as that became known to those in authority they readily agreed that there should be some recognition for it.</P>
    <P>If such matters had to be dealt with by correspondence and through the ordinary official machine, they would probably be still going on.  I feel that this amendment is of such importance that it is necessary to press it.  I submit that no case has been made by the Parliamentary Secretary for taking away, if you like, the privileges which the existing visiting committees enjoy and which have not given rise to any gross abuse that would justify the insertion of a section like this in the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is quite misinformed when he says that in this Bill we are taking away any of the privileges the visiting committees enjoy at the present time.  Under Section 34, sub-section (4) of the County Management Act, 1940, it is provided:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The visiting committee of a district mental hospital shall not inquire into or receive any complaint or make any report in relation to the services, remuneration, <Col N="1531" /> privileges or superannuation of the officers and servants of such hospital or any of such officers or servants.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Deputy's amendment is accepted by the House it just means that the law will remain as it is at present. What I am doing here is this&mdash;I am doing a little tidying up.  I am repealing that sub-section in the County Management Act and inserting it in the mental hospital code.  I could leave it in the County Management Act and there would not be a word about it.  Of course, I will not repeal it if Deputy Larkin's amendment is accepted.  I think the Deputy is under a misapprehension if he believes that, in fact, I am depriving visiting committees of any privileges they enjoy at the present time.  I am not.  As he has said himself, there has not been any complaint since the passing of the 1940 Act.  That provision has worked admirably.  The committees have not found themselves restricted in any way in their work, and I think it is a pity to interrupt such harmony.</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary not aware that a great many protests have been made against this provision in the local government code by many of the committees throughout the country?  In the case of some county councils, when the appointment of these visiting committees <Col N="1532" /> comes before them, they say: &ldquo;What is the use of appointing them; they can do nothing only interview the patients.&rdquo;</P>
