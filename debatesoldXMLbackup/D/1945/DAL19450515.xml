    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state when the operation of the Emergency Powers Act is to be ended.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows the Emergency Powers Acts will automatically expire in September next if they are not previously terminated by Order of the Government or are not extended for a further period by legislation. The Government has already divested itself of a considerable number of important powers which were taken under the Acts, and the position is being examined with a view to determining what further Emergency Powers Orders can be revoked without detriment to the public interest.  It is obvious, however, that so long as the position regarding essential supplies remains as it is at present, the Government will continue to require the powers in regard to production, rationing, price control, etc., which have been exercisable since 1939.  While I can assure the Deputy and the House that the Government has no desire to retain the Emergency Powers Acts in operation for a moment longer than the public interest requires, it is necessary to say that, so far as conditions can be foreseen at this moment, it is not likely that all the powers conferred by the Acts can be dispensed with in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach's reply, while I am perfectly aware that the Taoiseach has divested himself of certain powers <Col N="330" /> that he had no hopes of retaining in an independent Parliament, what I am asking him now is if it is proposed to retain the instrument whereby he can revest himself with these powers at a moment's notice?  The moment after the Presidential election we may have the censorship and all these other measures back again.  Is it not true that when the Taoiseach sought for these wide powers for a Party Government at the beginning of the war he undertook, most solemnly, that the moment the emergency was over he would reject this method of legislation and resume the normal method of seeking each individual power he required to deal with the situation from Dáil Eireann by a specific Act? If the scarcity of commodities is to be a ground, a new ground, on which he requires special powers, surely he could get them <i>ad hoc</i> from Parliament as he requires them and not through the machinery of the Emergency Powers Acts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told the Deputy that we are examining the situation and getting rid as fast as we possibly can of any powers not necessary at the moment.  When the position is completely examined, then the question of the powers that it will be necessary to retain in the public interest will appear very clearly.  At that time, the Government will have to consider with the Dáil what powers and what general Acts will be necessary, whether it will be desirable to repeal any part of existing Acts or to continue them.  That is a matter which it will take some time to consider. I have indicated the general position of the Government towards this question and I am not in a position to give any further information to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Taoiseach does not suggest to the Dáil that he contemplates the possibility of incorporating into the permanent legislation of this country any part of the Emergency Powers Act which he got at the beginning of the war?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows perfectly well, as well as any other <Col N="331" /> person, that the emergency is not over, as far as we are concerned, in a number of respects.  Surely the Government is entitled to get some time to examine the situation and to see what are the powers which it will be desirable to retain?  Surely it is desirable, if we come to the conclusion that other legislation is required, that we should not divest ourselves of our existing powers until that other legislation is enacted?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that up to recently Córas Iompair Éireann carried school children on buses from Newbridge to Kildare at 4d. per return journey, but that the fare has now been increased to 1/2 for the return journey; and, if so, and in view of the hardships which are caused to parents by having to pay the increased bus fares, if he will request the company to reintroduce the lower rate of fares for school-going children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that up to recently, through a misunderstanding on the part of a few omnibus conductors, certain school children travelling between Kildare and Newbridge&mdash;a distance of seven miles&mdash;were permitted to avail of a special reduced single fare of 2d.  Under the present practice of Córas Iompair Éireann the special reduced charge of 2d. per single journey for school children applies for distances between three and five miles.  The practice was not general and other children paid the correct fare &mdash; namely, the juvenile weekly season ticket rate of 5/3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply is he aware that this practice has been in operation for some time under which children were permitted to go from Newbridge to Kildare to secondary schools for a return fare of 2/- per week?  The effect of the recent decision by Córas Iompair Éireann is that 7/- must now be paid for a ticket which cost 2/- previously. <Col N="333" /> In the case of families who are not in affluent circumstances that means a very heavy tax on the family income where two or three children are attending a secondary school.  Bearing that in mind would the Minister arrange with Córas Iompair Éireann to continue the arrangement previously in force so as to give the families concerned an opportunity to make alternative arrangements without putting them in the position of having either to bear this heavy impost or abruptly discontinue the attendance of their children at secondary schools in the middle of the school year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>My function in this matter is to ensure that the rates prescribed by Order, are not exceeded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be the Minister's precise legal function, but I am sure he recognises that in the case of a man, who may be a carpenter, who previously sent two children to school at an inclusive charge of 4/- weekly, he is now required to pay 14/- weekly for the same two children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>He does not have to do that.  If the Deputy studies my reply he will find that reduced weekly rates are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>These weekly rates will still impose a much heavier charge on the family.  Will the Minister ask the company, at least, to defer the introduction of the recent scale of charges, until such time as the family have time to adjust themselves to the position which has now been discovered by Córas Iompair Éireann?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There has not been a change in the rates charged.  Apparently some omnibus conductors made a mistake, but others did not.  The company rectified the position and established the rates which are prescribed.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if <Col N="334" /> he will state the present position of the trade agreement made with the British Government on April 25th, 1938; whether, if its provisions were suspended during the emergency, he will state the conditions governing the suspension and the instrument in which they are set out; whether notice of the intention to terminate the agreement was given by either party under Article 19 thereof before the expiration of the three months' period mentioned in that article; and whether it is the intention of the Government to revive or revise the agreement in the near future or at all; and what steps, if any, are in contemplation to give practical effect of the intention expressed in Articles 5, 8, 9, 10, 13 and 16 of the said agreement.</P>

      <P>Notice of the termination of the trade agreement between the British and Irish Governments made in April, 1938, has not been given by either Government.

      <P>Since the Urban District of Howth was added to and became part of the County Borough of Dublin the occupiers of agricultural land in Howth have been rated on one-half of their land valuations in the same manner as the occupiers of land in every other part of the county borough.  Inclusion in the county borough may have had the effect of increasing the rate on land in Howth but there would be no ground for granting relief in respect of land in Howth on a different basis to that which was granted in respect of other land that had been included at an earlier stage in the county borough.  I would point out to the Deputy that, whilst the rate on agricultural land within the city was in 1944-45 equivalent to 10/5 in the £, in County Dublin in the same year the net rates on first £20 of land valuation were as follows: Balrothery, 7/6; Dublin North and South and Celbridge, 8/0½d.; Rathdown, 7/2.  On the part of the valuation above £20 the rate might be as high as 10/6½d. (Balrothery), 11/6 (Dublin North and South and Celbridge), and 10/7½d. (Rathdown) if the occupier was not entitled to employment allowance.</P>

      <P>The incidence of blight in the 1944 potato crop in most of the areas from which Dublin's supplies are drawn was unusually severe and further substantial damage was caused by the heavy frosts of last January.  These are the main factors responsible for the decrease in supplies of potatoes to Dublin.</P>
      <P>The scarcity of cauliflowers and cabbages is due to damage caused to these crops by the severe weather last January.</P>
      <P>The increase in the prices of potatoes, cauliflowers and cabbage is due to the reduction in supplies.</P>

      <P>I have received representations from the Bandon Board of Conservators and others as to fish mortality resulting from the discharge of effluent from flax ponds into the Bandon River.  There is no practicable method known to my Department whereby such effluent can be rendered harmless to fish life, and, as conditions of soil and situation vary with the location of ponds, no measures which will be universally applicable can be devised to obviate pollution from such sources.  An inspector of fisheries some time ago inspected flax ponds in Bandon district and suggested certain safeguards in some cases, while in others he made it clear that the continued use of particular ponds was not permissible. The advice of the fisheries staff will likewise be at the disposal of the conservators in any further cases that may be brought to my notice.  Nothing which is practicable and within the resources of my <Col N="341" /> Department will be left undone to prevent pollution of fishing waters from flax ponds.</P>

      <P>Section 92, sub-section (1), empowers an officer or servant who is aggrieved by the grant made by a mental hospital authority, or by their neglect or refusal to make a grant, to report the facts to the Minister not later than six months after the termination of his office or employment.  The case was made in the Seanad that the period of six months was too short.  To meet this view, an amendment was proposed empowering the Minister to extend the period in any particular case to a period not exceeding 12 months.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Pádraig Pearse contended that what education in Ireland needed was less a reconstruction of its machinery than a regeneration of spirit.  He was prepared to leave that particular portion untouched, or practically so.  A machine, however, cannot make men, but it can break men, if improperly <Col N="355" /> applied.  In the same way, a soulless thing cannot teach, but it can destroy. The educational system in this country was criticised very widely by the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Mulcahy, and also by Deputy Dillon. So far as the system is concerned, the principal fault which Deputy Mulcahy found with it was that it was not efficient in its working and that there was not sufficient co-ordination in its methods.  There may be a certain amount of truth in the second contention. But this nation, though old, is yet young in the administration of its own affairs and, if there are defects, what Deputies and the country should look for is that, as a result of the discussions here and outside the House in assemblies interested in education, as years pass by efforts will be made to remedy any defects that appear either in the proficiency of standards or the working out of the system.</P>
    <P>So far as primary education is concerned, a local administrator will be necessary, and the present system, whilst it may have some defects, at any rate, has worked very effectively and, to my mind, there are thousands of reasons why it should not be changed. As to the machinery of the system, the local management generally by the parish priest has worked out very well, and he generally is aware of the efficiency of the schools under his control. As the Bishop of Galway stated at the last teachers' congress, there are in education three main things to be considered.  First, there is the matter taught; secondly, there is the teacher who diligently applies himself to his work; and, thirdly, there is the building.  So far as the subjects taught are concerned, these are arranged in the curricula of the Department of Education.  A certain latitude, not very wide indeed, is allowed to the teacher to fill in so far as he can some matters which may apply to his particular locality.  I have had connection with all types of schools, and I have spoken to people at home and abroad who have an extensive knowledge of education, of the subjects taught, of the standards of efficiency in the various classes, and the general idea is that the standard here and the <Col N="356" /> capacity of the pupils is as high as in any other country.  I have discussed that matter in America during a short visit to that country with Christian Brothers who taught here and they agreed that our system here in its main lines, so far as the subjects, the programme and the efficiency of the pupils were concerned, is as good as that in any other country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy states that the recent Report of the Vocational Commission criticised the defective education of pupils going to the secondary, vocational and agricultural schools from the primary schools.  It is here that some of Deputy Mulcahy's criticism may deserve consideration, because we all know that oral Irish is stressed in the primary schools and that Irish as a subject gets a very high place in the course of instruction.  But, in the secondary schools, the same value is not placed on oral Irish and I would say that the same applies also to the vocational schools and to the agricultural colleges.  It is a question which deserves consideration and, to my mind, as Deputy Dillon, I think, stated, there may be need to harmonise the curricula of the various types of education so that pupils from the national school would naturally fit into their course of studies when they leave that school and continue in other departments.  Pádraig Pearse made reference to that and I think the best thing I can do is to quote his actual words.  In an article entitled &ldquo;When We Are Free&rdquo; Pádraig Pearse stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We can all see that when an Irish Government is constituted there will be an Irish Minister for Education responsible to the Irish Parliament and that under him education will be drawn into a homogeneous whole, an organic unity, directed by a single intelligence under the Minister; there might well be the chiefs of the various subdivisions &mdash; elementary, secondary, higher and technical &mdash; in the same building and not entrenched in strongholds in different parts of the city.  A council of some sort with sub-committees would doubtless be associated with the Minister, but I think its function should be advisory <Col N="357" /> rather than executive, that all acts should be acts of the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, then, would be my first recommendation to the Minister, to try to co-ordinate the various systems of education so that pupils coming from the national schools would fit in with the general progressive system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon stated that Irish was being made the hall-mark&mdash;I think that is what he called it&mdash;of mediocrity in this country.  He was very far wide of the mark in judging the results of the scheme and the general desire of the country to revive our own language when he stated that he would wish to see the position of Irish in this country analogous to that of French in Russia. That is an extraordinary statement from a Deputy who states that he is in favour of the Irish revival.  He stated he wished to see Irish regarded as the hallmark of efficiency and higher education, just as the Oxford accent is so regarded in England.  He might be near the mark in that conclusion, though the two statements do not appear to accord with one another.</P>
    <P>Mediocrity may be standardised to a certain extent in the system of education. It could be done&mdash;and I wish to call the special attention of the Minister and Deputies to this matter&mdash;in combined classes and in amalgamated schools.  You have classes combined, and this applies to the greater part of our rural population.  From the infants up, the first and second class standards are amalgamated in the schools; sometimes you have boys and girls, the girls being away for two hours in the week from the rest of the class, doing needlework.  You have the third and fourth standards amalgamated and the fifth and sixth combined with the higher classes.  Then the question arises of deciding on readers that are not too difficult for the lower standards of each group and that will still be useful for the upper standards. To my mind, it is so difficult to fit in things in that regard that there is a certain movement, in the natural course of events, to deprive the senior standards of the initiative they would have if they were passing into a new reader and into a new class and were not bound up with the same class they had been in the previous year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="358" /> Formerly, under the national system of education, there was an independent reader for each class, and that was worked out by reason of the fact that in those days the teacher could have a monitor or pupil teacher, some person who would be in preparation for the training colleges.  The monitor or pupil teacher was very often able to supervise the desk and written work.  The teacher has no help of that kind now.  Consequently, the classes are combined for many subjects and that is, generally speaking, detrimental to the standard of education in the rural schools.  That is my own opinion, and I am speaking from experience.</P>
    <P>A difficult problem arises with regard to the staffing of the schools in rural areas.  It is hard to have the staffing, in areas where the numbers are small, on a basis which would reach the ideal, and the Department in its wisdom, having examined the question very fully, has come to the conclusion that the existing system is the best system to adopt.  I have my doubts in that regard.  I think the classes in the cities are in many cases far too large, and in the country districts, even though the numbers are not so large, the teacher has a bigger number of classes to deal with in the space of each half-an-hour.  He has to put the pupils to work at various subjects and, at the same time, he has to give adequate instruction to each standard which will suit the inspector when he comes along.  The inspector looks for a good average standard in the class, but the teacher, particularly in the senior standards, who is out for the good of those who wish to develop their talents, will move in line with the capacity of the best pupils in the school.  The worst pupils, some of them, at any rate, together with the class below, will probably remain in the same combined standard for the subsequent year.</P>
    <P>It is not to turn out any class according to pattern that the teacher is giving instructions.  The child is more than a unit in the attendance and education means the development of a personality, the full development of mind and body to fit children for their duties in life.  The teacher who knows <Col N="359" /> his work and does it conscientiously should not be at the mercy of too stringent regulations or of those who come into a school, perhaps once or twice in the year, and have a very cursory knowledge of the locality or the capacity of the pupils or the work of the teacher during the year.</P>
    <P>There was one thing I advocated here last year and I will advocate it once more, and that is that there should be two standard sets of Irish readers available for the various schools, with adequate provision for the dialects of the different provinces. That would get over some of the criticism offered during the debate to the effect that the school books are becoming too costly.  I presume the vested interests in printing and other departments would wish to see new books every year.  In the old days we recollect that one book passed along from one child in the home to another in due course.  At the present time, while that might not be practicable under the system that is working here, if there were two readers, even with the combined classes, the teacher would be able to change during successive years from one book to the alternative one, and in a great measure cut down the cost of school readers.</P>
    <P>Formerly parents had to buy an English book only, but now they have to buy Irish and English readers for each member of the family.  While I know that provision is made in certain cases for the supply of free books, at the same time, where books have to be bought, the charge is high in the case of a large family.  Furthermore, my suggestion would tend more to help the general education in the school, because it is most disconcerting for a pupil who saw a word spelled one way in a reader last year to find in the next year the same word spelled differently in another reader.  It would be better to have the books standardised because I know that a few years ago, if children in a national school spelled words in the way they are now spelled in the Official Reports of the Dáil Debates, they would get a very poor mark for their spelling in the Irish language. I know we are in the transition stage and that all due allowance <Col N="360" /> should be made for these things.  At the same time, I do not think we ought to keep our views to ourselves in this matter; we ought to make them public and prepare for the day when this development will be made effective to the advantage of our system of education.</P>
    <P>I followed Deputy Mulcahy's remarks very keenly, and I came to the conclusion that, apart from co-ordination&mdash;with which in the main I agree&mdash;between the different systems of education, he was looking for something more modern in education to fit the present scheme of things in the world.  Pádraig Pearse made reference to that.  He said we might as well look for a lively modern faith or a serviceable modern religion as for a modern education, because modernism is as much a heresy in education as it is in religion.  What we want in this country, assuming that the national school is the foundation of all education here&mdash;and it is recognised as having played a great part in this country&mdash;is to have the fundamentals well taught so as to fit the pupils for both higher education and for their particular sphere in life when they leave school.</P>
    <P>The question of the school-leaving age has been mentioned and it has been suggested that it should be raised to 16.  Certain schemes are in force in certain cities now, giving opportunity for continued education to those who have left the national schools and even to those who have gone into business. On certain days in the week, they can attend vocational schools and so continue their education.  Professor Domhnall Ó Corcora once wrote an article entitled: &ldquo;Tá na soillse ar lasadh&rdquo; or &ldquo;The lights are burning&rdquo;. He made special reference to the fact that, on every night during the winter, in practically every parish, the lights in the school were burning and the national teachers or the múinteoirí taistil Gaedhilge were teaching the people of the parish their language and their native dances. What has taken the place of that now? It is in the commercialised dance hall that the lights are burning now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="361" /> The payment the teachers are getting for their service has broken their spirit in that regard.  They did far more voluntary work some years ago than they are prepared to do now, as they have not been adequately paid for the work they do.  Deputy M. O'Sullivan spoke on that matter.  He is a man who speaks very directly and very sincerely in this House, and he made a very strong case for the teachers.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a tendency sometimes to ask the question: &ldquo;Where is the money to come from?&rdquo; However, adequate pay for service is never a loss to the country.  Improving the purchasing power of those who are employed in the State is never a disservice to the national finances.  As a matter of fact, the contrary is the case.  The first requisite for any success in business, in education, or in any other walk of life, is that the people operating those systems should be contented and satisfied, in a great measure, with their lot.  There seems to have been more enthusiasm for the Irish language last year than I have experienced since the old Sinn Féin days.  People have gone in for learning the Irish language in a way that has amazed me.  Some of the people who are advanced in years are now turning to it.  They are satisfied that the revival of our national language is a thing to be done by the citizens of the country.  The national teachers were the pivots in many cases around which that movement revolved.  However, I have heard them say that from henceforth they will give up the part they have played in the national life of the country, that they will give up the voluntary services they gave to the State, on account of the treatment they are getting from the State, and that they will devote themselves only to the service of the day and the hour in their schools.</P>
    <P>The criticism has been made that they have not been treated in the same way as other servants of the State.  I do not wish to criticise the way in which other servants of the State have been treated, as whatever emolument they received they worked and gave service for it.  I hold that the teachers' salaries should be brought up <Col N="362" /> in the same way.  Their salaries have been cut repeatedly from the year 1923, in regard to various special grants they were getting for teaching extra subjects, for certain evening schools, for rural science, for gardening, and things of that sort.  All these have been cut down and the teacher now has to agitate publicly all over the country to try to get a measure of justice.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest blows the rural teacher got was when the rule was brought in that women teachers should retire on marriage.  I am now only giving my own opinion and this does not concern me personally.  We know that the child usually is father to the man and when the child in a home is brought up in an environment where both his parents are teachers, the day comes, if heredity counts for anything, when he is anxious to follow the profession of his parents.  However, now that their income has been cut to half, they are not able, in many instances, to send a child on for continuous education, so as to fit him for that profession. Neither is there any desire in the case of many parents to do so, seeing the emoluments that now accrue from years of service as national teachers.  We know that the best people in various walks of life are those who have followed in the same profession as their parents.  We know that the sons and daughters of teachers went into the church and the teaching profession.  That was the case when the parents had a sufficient salary between them to look after their children and to provide for their future.</P>
    <P>I think that the lot of the teacher should be improved and that the first step in that regard should be the restoration of the 1920 scale of salaries right away.  I appeal to the Minister to restore that scale, or a scale on the same lines, without further delay, so as to satisfy the teachers that their appeal, which is backed by the clerical managers and by the Bishops of the country, is being considered.  He will then get from them again the cooperation which they have given so far in various walks of national life and in the social activities for the benefit of their respective parishes.</P>
    <P>These few years are vital regarding <Col N="363" /> the Irish language.  We are told that our Celtic temperament is such that we have great enthusiasm for a time and then we cool off and have not the same energy.  I presume it is the same in almost every nation.  Yet, if each wave of enthusiasm that comes along pushes the national ideal a bit further ahead, good work has been done.  I appeal to the Minister at this juncture, when the movement for the restoration of our language has got such an impetus, to bring the teachers into the forefront of the movement again, by improving their lot financially.  As Pádraig Pearse said: In the school there should be freedom for the teacher and he should be free from the influence of parsimonious officials.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is much else that I need say.  The debate has covered a wide field.  Deputy Flanagan came along and spoke in Irish here. That, in itself, is a sign of the times but, of course, you will sometimes find people doing that and then, in the next breath, criticising the language because you have &ldquo;bean&rdquo; one minute and &ldquo;mná&rdquo; another minute, and saying that the Irish language should be standardised and that these various inflections, cases, and so on, should be removed from the Irish language. Now, the Irish language, in its composition, is far more regular than the English language, and the difficulties that do exist are sometimes exaggerated, and that is one way of exaggerating them.  If Deputy Flanagan were to consider the matter for a moment he would see that the same word in English, &ldquo;woman&rdquo;, is referred to in the first case as &ldquo;she&rdquo; and in another case as &ldquo;her&rdquo;.  It is the same in the case of &ldquo;bean&rdquo; and &ldquo;mná&rdquo; in Irish.  Take the various words: &ldquo;is&rdquo;, &ldquo;are&rdquo;, &ldquo;was&rdquo;, &ldquo;were&rdquo;, &ldquo;be&rdquo;, &ldquo;been&rdquo;, &ldquo;being&rdquo;&mdash;all parts of the verb &ldquo;to be&rdquo;.  Why do not these people come along and say that the English language should be standardised?  The English language is far more irregular in its composition than the Irish language. There are only about half a dozen irregular verbs in the whole sphere of the Irish language, and there <Col N="364" /> is nothing wrong with it.  In my opinion, however, what should be standardised in connection with the Irish language is the spelling, so that during the whole course of the children's time in the schools, they would come across one system of spelling, and one only.</P>
    <P>The other matter to which I wish to refer is the question of the unity of the teachers behind the language movement, because there is no use teaching the language as a subject in the school if its influence is not felt outside the school and if it is not used fairly generally by the children outside the school.  I have no doubt that the Irish language is going ahead by leaps and bounds.  It is going ahead, and will go ahead, and will get behind it the momentum of the people of this country, conscious that it is the national tradition that they should speak their own language, and if the work of the schools is co-ordinated, then, with the general occupations in life of the pupils, by giving them in their post-primary education such other knowledge as may suit their state in life, our systems of education will be fulfilling what they should fulfil &mdash;to improve the knowledge and the culture of our people, to develop the brain, the soul, and the mind of our race so that we would march forward, not only as a brave race, which the world knows we are, but also as a cultured race, a race that will take their place, as they have in the past, as the light of the world again.</P>
    <P>The question of school buildings has been dealt with, and I shall only say just a few words in that regard.  To my mind, the reason why better progress has not been made is that the schools in a parish&mdash;and generally there are two or three of them&mdash;are all bad at the same time, and the manager wants to deal with one before he brings further debt on himself by contributing the one-third for the rebuilding of that school.  I think the Minister is now going further in that regard, and that where two or three schools are bad he takes into consideration the combined factors in the parish.  When things become normal I hope that we shall have better <Col N="365" /> schools for our children, so that not only will they be places of education for the children, but an ornament to the parish and an incentive to the pupils to carry on in their homes what they have been taught in the schools, and that in that regard a general enlightenment will spread for mind, for soul and for body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>So many things have been touched upon, especially during the last week, that it is difficult to bring in anything new except to emphasise and repeat what most of the other speakers have said.  However, the last speaker drew attention to the cost of school books on the parents, especially when there is almost a double set of books to be provided, such as the reader in English and the reader in Irish, which is very costly.  He went on to say that he was aware, however, that there was a free-school-books scheme, but he did not look at the Estimate and draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the Estimate for free school books is reduced by £1,000 for the coming year. I think that that is a step in the wrong direction.  The last speaker drew attention to the increased cost of the extra readers having to be supplied, and I think it is unfortunate that the Estimate for the provision of free books for necessitous children is reduced by £1,000.  I think that it should be increased and that the means test should be withdrawn, or that at any rate the form which parents have to sign in order to get these free books should be modified, as it is somewhat objectionable and some of the parents will undergo hardships in order to raise the money for the books rather than fill in the forms that are necessary.  I hope the Minister will take note of that and make it a little bit easier for necessitous children to get the free school books which are necessary so that the teachers may impart to them the knowledge that is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall not touch on that subject further, but I wish to join with the other members of the House who have drawn attention to the conditions of the teachers in this country.  Only within the past few weeks I heard of a <Col N="366" /> couple of school teachers applying for passports to go to England as the conditions there were much better than here, and because they felt that, even if they did not get into the profession for which they had been educated, they would have a chance of earning a better living at other types of work than by continuing as school teachers here.  The anxiety and uneasiness of mind amongst them are breaking some of them down in health.  Take the case of a school teacher who a few years ago thought he should try to own his own house and entered into an agreement, under the Small Dwellings Act, with the Dublin Corporation or any of the councils that have adopted that Act.  That teacher now finds himself running into arrears with his payments, with the result that he receives the usual unpleasant letters demanding immediate payment &ldquo;or else&rdquo;, and when he, or she, as the case may be, sees the &ldquo;or else&rdquo; attached to the letter it upsets that unfortunate man or woman for a considerable time, and he, or she, is not able to impart the knowledge to the child that he or she should.</P>
    <P>With regard to teachers' salaries, we all know that young teachers would be quite willing to marry if their salaries would allow them to pay the rents demanded for flats and houses in this city.  Rents have doubled in the City of Dublin within the past year and for the most ordinary flat, a flat of two rooms, a man will have to pay 25/- a week.  These young teachers, though anxious to get married, cannot undertake the responsibilities involved on the moderate salaries which the Government pays them.  We all know, too&mdash;I do not say it in any disparaging way; I know that teachers will not object to my saying it, because I have previously drawn attention to their appearance&mdash;that a young teacher has to make a suit of clothes give twice as much wear as a suit gave a year or two years ago.  One sees them in threadbare, shiny clothes and they cannot face the purchase of a new suit of clothes, because it means a month's salary.  I defy anybody in the House to go into a shop here and buy a suit of clothes under eight guineas.  He will be lucky if he gets it for eight guineas <Col N="367" /> at present, and the school teacher on his present salary cannot afford to give that amount for a suit of clothes. That, of course, applies to many other professions, but we are dealing at the moment with the teachers and it is our business to put these points to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I have here, as I am sure every other Deputy has, a copy of &ldquo;The Voice of the Pensioned Teachers from the Provinces&rdquo;.  It is signed by several people&mdash;from Clare, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Limerick, Mayo, Tipperary, Westmeath and Wexford.  It sets out that, according to figures supplied by the Minister, 320 teachers have pensions not exceeding £52 per annum, after devoting their lives to educating children and training them for business and the professions.  It is one of the teacher's boasts that he can point to pupils of his who have been successful in life, but when they go out on pensions that is the way we treat them.  A total of 320 teachers have £52 per annum; 136 have £78 per annum; 230 have £104 per annum; and 129 have the maximum of £208 per annum.  If they had given that service to a municipal authority or any other branch of Government service they would have been treated much better.  I remember hearing the Minister praising the teachers and telling them that the future of the country depended on what they imparted to the children.  We all, and especially those of us who are in public life and who get so many kicks, like to hear a word of praise and it is nice for the teachers to hear it, but an extra £1 per week in their pay envelopes would be more welcome, and would be a practical form of appreciation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the school buildings, Dublin in the past 20 years has risen to the occasion and we have some fine schools on which we can pride ourselves. I should like some of the Deputies from the country districts to pay a visit to Crumlin school or to the new Cabra schools.  They are magnificent, but there are other schools&mdash; old houses turned into schoolrooms, with rickety staircases&mdash;and the sooner they are done away with, the better.  In the very heart of the city, <Col N="368" /> not too far from here, there is a school which is not a credit to the country and I hope that all such schools will be removed quickly.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like the Minister to give consideration is the medical examination of children in the schools.  I know one school in which the medical examination takes place in a little space about 12 feet by 12 feet which has no hot or running water.  The medical officer has no facilities for washing his hands when he is finished and has to go out to the yard which is used as a school playground. The Minister should see that proper equipment and accommodation for the medical officer will be available in all future schools.  It is unfortunate, too, that the school which I suggested Deputies should see and which is a credit to the Government and to the country, has no room in which the children can take their midday meal.  The fact that no such room was provided was probably due to an oversight, but the fact is that there is no place for the children to take their glass of milk and sandwich, except the yard or school desks.  There was a certain objection to children eating bread and jam on the new school desks and I hope the Minister will see to it that, especially in those new schools in which the School Meals Act is availed of, a small dining hall suitably equipped for children to take their midday meal will be provided.  It is called a midday meal now, but I hope the day is coming when we will be able to give a hot meal.  At the moment, it consists of a glass of milk and a jam sandwich or a cheese sandwich.  It is much appreciated by the children and the parents and we believe it is doing a lot of good.</P>
    <P>Earlier in the debate, a speaker drew attention to the treatment of mentally defective children.  Their position is deplorable.  I know there is one in every parish in Dublin.  You may see a small golden-haired child of about seven years of age standing outside a school, and when you ask her why she is not at school she replies: &ldquo;They will not take me in; they say I am backward.&rdquo;  If you inquire you will find that the child is not more than 10 per cent. deficient in <Col N="369" /> something that I am not able to explain, but, at any rate, is it not deplorable that no provision is made for backward children of her type?  She may be one of a very large family.  Her father may be employed in some industry earning, say, £3 a week.  If the child is to be taken into an institution he will be called upon to pay 7/6 a week for her maintenance.  Since he cannot afford to do that, there is no place where the child can be properly educated.  I was greatly impressed by the appeal which was made by a Deputy on the Government Benches&mdash; I cannot recall his name&mdash;on behalf of children of that type.  I believe you will find one or two such children in every parish in this city and in the towns and villages of the county, and that the total number in the country would be 500 or 600 or perhaps 1,000. Those children are considered backward in school.  Because of some little mental weakness, they are not able to absorb the instruction given to them, and in consequence are left behind in the classes.</P>
    <P>With other members of the House I would appeal to the Minister to provide an increase in the grants given for the heating and cleaning of schools.  During the emergency the managers found it extremely difficult not only to get fuel for schools but to meet the cost of it, since the grants given for that purpose are not at all adequate.  I would join with other Deputies in appealing to the Minister to increase the grants.  A deputation, on which there were three members of the Government Party, came to this House and appealed to Deputies of all Parties to do their best to get the grants increased so that the children and the teachers would be spared the hardships they had to endure in previous winters.  I would also ask the Minister to do something for old teachers who are finding it so difficult to live on their small pensions of £52 a year.  About 12 months ago the Minister for Finance, when speaking on this matter, encouraged us to believe that he was sympathetic to the claims made on behalf of those old pensioned teachers.  He said he would rather do something for them than have them applying for home assistance or for <Col N="370" /> relief from benevolent organisations. A woman pensioned teacher who has reached the age of 65, 67 or 68 years of age and has to pay 5/- or 6/- a week for a room in the City of Dublin out of her small pension of £52 a year is surely worthy of the Minister's sympathetic consideration.  The moderate pensions fixed in pre-war days, when rents and food prices were only half what they are to-day, should, I submit, be substantially increased.  I hope that the claims of these old pensioned teachers will meet with the Minister's sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of school meals, about which managers are a good deal harassed.  This may not be a matter for the Minister for Education, but I think that he has joint responsibility with the Minister for Finance as regards the working of the School Meals Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that I have any responsibility for school meals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister answered one or two questions which I put to him on this, and I simply ask to be allowed a minute or two to show what is happening.  When new schools are opened the school manager applies for, say, 1,000 bottles of milk and 1,000 sandwiches.  He anticipates that he will have that number of children attending on the opening day.  It may happen that only 922 children turn up, so that the actual requirement is 922 bottles of milk and 922 sandwiches. Because of the fact that 1,000 children did not turn up to avail of the number of meals supplied, the manager or reverend mother in charge of the school is subsequently heavily fined and becomes irritated because of the deduction made in respect of expenses. I would ask the Minister to bring this matter personally to the knowledge of the Minister for Finance, and see if arrangements cannot be made to allow for a 5 per cent. margin between the number of meals estimated to be required and the actual number consumed. The present arrangement is causing a great deal of embarrassment to parish priests and the reverend mothers in charge of the schools, because <Col N="371" /> when it is found at the end of three months that the number of meals ordered was not actually consumed, deductions in administration expenses, of from £20 to £40, are made.  Those responsible have to find the money somehow.  I would ask that the Minister should, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, do something about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of this debate a great number of Deputies have spoken of the low standard of education in our schools and, particularly, in our primary schools.  That is no new thing.  That complaint has been common among employers not only since this Government came into office but throughout the period of the previous Government's administration, and for many years before that. Employers speak of how poorly equipped primary school children are found to be on entrance into business or into offices.  They speak, as if they expected, from the products of the primary schools, a standard of efficiency which only some years of training in a vocational or secondary school could give.  In recent years there has been an added amount of criticism.  In large part it appears to come from people who are hostile to the effort that is being made to restore the Irish language.  From time to time we see a great number of letters on this subject in our newspapers.  Generally, we find it pointed out in those letters that the standard of education in our schools has gone down very much owing to the efforts that are being made to revive the Irish language.  Now, that type of criticism does not come from any particular class or creed.  Fortunately, I think the number who criticise from that point of view is small, but they are very vocal and very clamorous and, possibly, their criticism does a good deal of injury among people who have not the time, opportunity or educational equipment to ascertain the facts to enable them to give a balanced judgment.  I do not wish for a moment to identify any speaker on the Opposition Benches, or in any other part of this House, with those people to <Col N="372" /> whom I refer, because I must say that the personal acquirements of some speakers and the encouragement they give to others to emulate them in the use of the language would make a charge of that sort not only unjust but absurd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the greater number of the people who criticise the low standard in our schools are quite in earnest and that they are sincere in their belief that there has been a great reduction in the standard.  They bring forward facts to show that their belief is correct.  They say that handwriting is very much worse than it was in the old times, that spelling is not as good as it formerly was, that children leaving school nowadays know no geography or grammar, and so forth. I think that most of those who speak in that way confuse fact-knowledge with true education.  True education aims at mental, moral and physical development&mdash;the formation of character. Mere fact-knowledge will never give any of those things.  If people want only fact-knowledge, they need do no more than learn to read.  They will get hundreds of thousands of facts from such papers as <i>Tit Bits</i> and <i>Pearson's Weekly.</i>  It is true that, in former days, a great deal of the teaching in our schools was directed to filling the minds of the children with cut-and-dry facts.  Before the universal use of the typewriter, very great importance was attached to handwriting. Children spent hours and hours of the school week laboriously copying headlines and, by sheer industry and practice, they succeeded in reproducing copper-plate writing.  That universal excellence of handwriting does not obtain to-day.  We admit that.  But very few who look into the matter will differ with me when I say that the writing of the average schoolboy leaving a primary school compares very favourably with the writing of the average doctor or clergyman.  I think that that statement will go unchallenged. Day after day, I get letters from persons who have had a full secondary education, and even a full university education, and I have very great difficulty in deciphering the writing or even the signatures.  The writing of our school children is quite <Col N="373" /> good in comparison with the writing of those people.</P>
    <P>As regards spelling, it is true that the simultaneous acquirement of two or more languages does tend to unsettle spelling.  Spelling is, possibly, not as good in our schools as it was in the past, when English only was taught, when hours of the school week were devoted to learning lists of words by heart and when dictation was a daily exercise.  Here, again, you have no loss in mental development. Very erudite scholars are often &ldquo;wobbly&rdquo; on spelling.  The boys and girls in our Irish schools and the boys and girls in English schools would, certainly, lose marks in an examination if they were to spell in the way the best American writers spell.  I think that there is no alarming falling-off in spelling, either. Geography, in the old times, was merely a matter of facts.  A boy with a good memory, when leaving school in the old times, could tell you the length of every river, the area of every lake, the population of every town and the height of every mountain in Ireland, but these were mere facts.  If they were wanted in after-life for any particular purpose, they were always available in an elementary textbook or in a gazetteer.  If the children of to-day are not masters of those cut and dried facts, they are at no educational loss.  The ordinary people notice that they have not those useless facts and they think that the standard of education has gone down.  The same would apply to grammar.  On the whole, those constant complaints we hear about the reduction of standard in our education are analogous to the complaints of the old, dyspeptic, retired military officer who is constantly grumbling that the Army has gone to the dogs.  These complaints are just in the same category.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon spoke at some length about the mental anguish which our young children undergo by learning through a language which they do not understand.  I wish to assure Deputy Dillon that no mental anguish is experienced from that cause.  Young children can acquire two languages at the same time with almost as much <Col N="374" /> ease as they can acquire one, given, of course, a reasonable teacher and proper methods of teaching.  Some years ago I saw two Italian children&mdash; brothers&mdash;enter a school.  One was about ten years of age and the other was a mere infant.  The younger boy had not a word of English and had to be put into the lowest English class in the school.  Before the end of the first day he had picked up the phrase &ldquo;leave out, please,&rdquo; and he made himself a perfect nuisance to the teacher for several days by shooting up his hand and, with a grin from ear to ear, saying &ldquo;leave out, please.&rdquo;  In the course of a few weeks, by some extraordinary method, he made himself intelligible to the younger children and seemed to understand them.  Within a year that boy became a veritable chatterbox and he was as happy as possible during all that time.  The elder brother, before he had been two years in school, got the first prize offered by the Royal Lifeboat Society for the best essay in English and he also became very good at Irish.  Here were children who, at first, did not understand either the teacher or their companions.  They enjoyed the process of learning and eventually lost nothing in proficiency.</P>
    <P>A good teacher especially in the infant classes will relate new words, phrases and sentences to actions and drawings.  The children pick up the language quite naturally and seem to enjoy the process.  There is really no falling off either in efficiency or in the enjoying of the school work on the part of the infants.  It is a common thing to find in our schools that the infant classes taught through Irish are the happiest classes.  Anyone who is in constant contact with the schools will tell you that is true.  As regards efficiency we frequently get, especially in city schools, boys and girls who have been in English schools and Scottish schools and the common experience of our teachers is that our Irish pupils are better on the whole than those who come to us from outside schools. I am firmly convinced that a boy or girl leaving a good primary school at the present time has a better and a broader education than the boy or girl who left our old schools 30 or 40 years <Col N="375" /> ago.  But a very unfair comparison is sometimes made between the children who left school 30 years ago and the children who leave school to-day.  In the old times, before the spread of vocational schools and smaller secondary schools throughout the country, pupils remained in the primary schools until they were 17 years of age or even older.  In the later years they worked apart from the ordinary pupils.  The teachers marked out a certain amount to be learned by them.  They sat alone and worked apart from the general body of the pupils and the teacher corrected and checked up on their work just as opportunity offered.  The work was done exactly on what is now called the Dalton Plan, a plan that is said to have been discovered recently and boosted as a new discovery.  It was in use 30 or 40 years ago in these schools.  These boys or girls at 17 or 18 years of age went directly into the junior Civil Service or into business. It is between such pupils and those who leave our schools at the normal age at the present day that this unfair comparison is frequently made.</P>
    <P>I again assert that the boy or girl leaving a primary school to-day at the normal age has a better and a broader education than the boy or girl who left school at the normal age 30 or 40 years ago.  I say that they have a broader education and that they are better equipped to acquire further education and knowledge for this reason.  The broad distinction between primary and secondary education is generally that in the primary school all the work is done in the vernacular, whereas in the secondary schools in addition to the vernacular, there is another language or possibly two or three taught.  A second language in every school throughout this country means that a boy leaves the primary school with a great deal of the advantage which was formerly enjoyed only by the boy who had a secondary education.  In other words, the boy who leaves a primary school at 14 years of age now has had the advantage of a secondary education to some extent.</P>
    <P>I do not for a moment mean to say that everything is well in education. There are certain signs that, I think, <Col N="376" /> point to danger and I hope the brake will be applied before the trend that appears to be there becomes too marked.  Somebody has referred to the schools here in Dublin which are claimed to be the finest in Europe or possibly in the world.  I have heard that assertion made, but I think these schools have been the greatest mistake. Unfortunately, the corporation in its housing activities instituted three or four huge building schemes.  I think it would have been much better from every point of view if they had carried out quite a number of small schemes instead.  These huge schemes entail huge schools.  Some people refer to them as monster schools.  They do not intend to disparage them in any way by the use of the word &ldquo;monster&rdquo;. They are monster schools and in a certain sense they are monstrous, in that you have the type of children at a dead level throughout the whole school, from the infant classes to the top&mdash;not a leavening of any sort.  They have not the advantage of the influence of children coming from a different type of home, possibly homes in which there is a little more culture.  Now, the children of the poor are quite as good if not better than those of the rich, but I think one mass of the very same type of children throughout a school is a bad thing.</P>
    <P>I hope that future schemes carried out by the corporation will be on a smaller scale and that the schools that will then become necessary to accommodate these districts will not be schools of the size of these enormous buildings to which I referred.  I think they are very bad in a great many ways.  The children never even get to know each other thoroughly.  They never get to know their teachers intimately.  They have not even the same intimate touch with their clergy as in smaller schools.  That may seem strange but, after all, there is a great difference between a priest or parson visiting a school of some thousands and visiting a school where there are, say, 100 or 200 children.  The teachers in these huge schools have of necessity as it were to live outside the community in which they are teaching.  That is a bad thing.  The children that are going <Col N="377" /> to them know nothing of the home life of these teachers and they cannot get an example in that direction.  They do not know their clergy as thoroughly and the clergy do not know them as thoroughly.</P>
    <P>I urge, therefore, that it would be preferable if we could get schools of the nine-teacher type.  A nine-or ten-teacher school should be the outside size.  I know that these schools are sub-divided and that there is a certain number of principals.  With the increased transport we are promised centralisation of schools.  I hope that centralisation will not go too far.  My ideal is this, that within each parish there should be full opportunity for primary, secondary and vocational training.  The ideal thing would be to keep children as far as possible in their own parishes and under the influence of the parochial clergy.  There is a practice growing up at present of great numbers of children leaving their parishes and going off at nine or ten years of age to other parishes for further education, and from that time until they go out into the world these children are spiritually nobody's children.  Therefore, I hope the idea of centralisation will not go too far.</P>
    <P>Another thing that I regret, the effects of which will be plainly seen some years hence, is the passing of the married couple as heads and guides of small schools.  The married couple in a school or in adjoining schools give a wonderful example.  They are in intimate touch with the clergy, they are sort of liaison officers between people and clergy; they know every child in a parish from the infant to school-leaving stages.  They know the children personally, and their households, and the children also know them so that a tradition was built up down through generations that made for stability of thought, as well as uniformity in national and religious outlook that was all to the good.  If the monster school takes its place, and if centralisation goes too far, we may get the sort of efficiency that industrialised countries are supposed to have, but that efficiency will be a poor exchange for the traditional heritage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="378" /> If I had time I should like to deal with the examination system.  Unfortunately, I think our whole system right through is examination ridden. That is a great pity.  I know it is largely due to the fact that we are under-industrialised, and that there is no outlet for a boy except through some examination, so we have an examination-ridden system of education which is very bad.  However, I do not see a way out because there must be some means of selection and tests at various ages.  The position is due largely to the fact that we have no industries to absorb our young people, and that they can only escape through the examination channel.  But the flaw is there.</P>
    <P>In any discussion on education it is a great pity to have to bring in teachers' salaries, but if these salaries are such as to exclude the best material from the teaching profession, and are such as possibly to militate against the work done in our schools, it is the duty of every public man to protest.  The teachers at the present time are fighting hard for an increase of 13 per cent. in salaries.  The demand is altogether inadequate.  I was surprised to find that it is simply a demand for 13 per cent.  I was surprised at the teachers' executive making such a demand, but they explain that they thought it better to look for something that they were pretty sure to get rather than to put up with a demand that might be considered too high.  When I asked how they arrived at 13 per cent. they said that they did so largely on the judgment of the educational authorities. A scale of salaries was imposed in 1934, but by 1938 the cost of living went up 22 points, and in order to compensate them they were awarded an increase of 5 per cent.  The thing to remember is that the 1934 scale was an imposed scale, and that the teachers were not consulted.  From that it is reasonable to assume that the authorities thought it was a fair scale.  Evidently they thought so when they gave an increase of 5 per cent. in 1938.</P>
    <P>By 1941 the cost of living had gone up another 57 points, and the teachers <Col N="379" /> estimated that an increase of 13 per cent. would just cover that, so they made their demand on the foundation that was laid down by the educational authorities.  Between 1923 and 1934 the teachers suffered a loss of 19 per cent. in salaries.  Of that 19 per cent. they have recovered 5 per cent. so that without infringing the spirit of the standstill Order I cannot see why an additional 14 per cent. cannot be given. They lost 19 per cent., of which they recovered 5 per cent., so that I think teachers could recover the further 14 per cent. without any infringement of the spirit of the standstill Order. &ldquo;Give us this day our daily bread&rdquo; is a prayer, I assure Deputies, that is said with great earnestness, and even with anxiety by married teachers throughout the country to-day.  The scales of salaries everywhere are too low and, in Dublin, hopelessly inadequate. The young teacher of marriageable age in Dublin simply cannot dream of getting married at the present time.  He has no hope of saving out of his salary anything that would approach the purchase price of a house.  He could not put down a deposit that would be accepted by any vendor or auctioneer.  If by some miracle he did acquire a house, he could not purchase the furniture, unless he purchased riskety stuff on the ruinous deferred payment system.</P>
    <P>Teaching is a very exhausting occupation and it is only the unusually physically strong teacher who can go out in the evenings and nights to earn something to supplement his ordinary salary, but they are doing it all over the country&mdash;all over the city at any rate.  They are giving private tuitions in the evening; they are looking for jobs in grinding schools&mdash;that most exhausting of all occupations&mdash;they are keeping the books for shopkeepers, estimating their income-tax and profits; they are doing all sorts of work of that kind for their more fortunate neighbours.  Their hardship is extremely marked in Dublin at the present time.  At the moment I am losing a young teacher from my school.  He has given 12 years' service.  He came to me in 1933.  He is a good teacher, well fitted by nature, by inclination <Col N="380" /> and vocation for the teaching profession but he is leaving the teaching service to go as secretary to the Dublin G.A.A.  That in itself points to the seriousness of the situation.  I besought that man to remain in the profession. I tried to assure him that things would look up.  He showed me his budget and he could not afford to do it.  His initial salary as secretary to the Dublin G.A.A. is higher than his salary as a teacher after 12 years' successful service in the profession.  I may add that the two runners-up for the position were also teachers.  The three people who were at the head of the list of candidates were teachers.</P>
    <P>I do hope that the Minister for Education and the Taoiseach will reconsider the salary question.  I feel &mdash;and I hope I am right&mdash;that the Taoiseach possibly thought that the teachers were basing their claims too much on emergency conditions and, of course, the feeling was abroad at the time the Taoiseach interviewed our teachers that the emergency was drawing towards an end.  I hope that his opinion is that the time is ripe for the settlement of the salary question on a permanent and normal basis.  I know the Taoiseach well enough to believe that his sense of justice and fair play will not allow the fixing of the teachers' salary question on a normal and permanent basis to be unnecessarily delayed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a very long debate, one of the longest debates on education that I have heard in the House, and I regard that as a sign of the importance we all attach to the matter.  One of the things to ask ourselves about education is, are we getting value for the money we spend on it and are we turning out the type of child equipped to meet modern conditions and to face the difficulties of the modern world?  I do not believe that in this State we are doing that. We have not got children to whom we can point and say: &ldquo;They are the products of the Irish system of education and we are thereby proud of that system&rdquo;.  I consider that there are many very good points about our system of education.  We have, for instance, a managerial system by which <Col N="381" /> ministers of various creeds give the most devoted service to the cause of education.  The State and we as legislators ought to pay tribute to the devoted service we get from these people and we should appreciate their value to the children not only in what I might call the purely educational sense but in the moral sense also.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out that most of the Deputies who took part in the debate, with the exception of Deputy Butler, found fault, by and large, with the system.  I should like to refer to the teachers and their salaries.  Many Deputies have referred to the salary question and I do not wish to labour the matter.  I regard the children of Ireland as our most precious heritage. We have nothing half so valuable in the country or half so dear to us.  The teachers are the men and women to whom we entrust the teaching of this inestimable asset, but we do not pay them on a scale commensurate with the dignity of their occupation.  That is all I will say about that question, and I think it sums it up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Education is a very big subject.  It has a philosophical and a practical side and one could talk for a long time about both aspects.  Deputy Butler referred to the question of teaching through the medium of Irish.  He said that many people who are hostile to the effort to revive the Irish language took the view that teaching through the medium was bad, and that the reason they took that attitude was because of their hostility to the revival of the Irish language.  I am hostile to teaching through the medium, but I am not hostile to the revival of the Irish language.  I sincerely believe that teaching through the medium will eventually kill the Irish language&mdash; that is to say, teaching through the medium outside Irish-speaking areas. I believe that sincerely, and that is a thing I should not like to see happening. It is against every tenet of education.  For heaven's sake, when we discuss education, let us keep to education.  If you put another subject on to education, something that is outside it, and make education carry that, you are running the risk of damaging education.  I regard education <Col N="382" /> as one question, and the revival of the Irish language as another question. But the revival of the Irish language has become indissolubly linked with education, and education has suffered and is going to suffer thereby.</P>
    <P>As I say, it is against every philosophical tenet of teaching to try to teach children an unknown subject through an unfamiliar language, and is in the long run impossible.  You may have brilliant boys or brilliant girls who will rise superior to the difficulties of that system.  You may, here and there, get splendid results, but remember where you have a brilliant pupil and a brilliant teacher you can get any result.  Those of you who have read the writings of people like Montessori, Pastalozzi and Froebel, or one hundred and one other brilliant teachers, will be struck particularly by what those people can do. Looking at their achievements it will be seen that they can do anything with a pupil.  That was where you had a really brilliant, gifted teacher.  Thank goodness, we have some brilliant gifted teachers in this country, and, as I have said, where you have a brilliant teacher and a clever pupil you will get very fine results.  But, unfortunately, we are not all brilliant.  Not all our teachers can rise to the very greatest heights, and not all our pupils are as brilliant as we should like them to be.  Those are the ones who fall by the wayside, handicapped by this very difficult system which we are imposing on them. I say that in all sincerity.  We are putting a load on to education which I doubt that it can bear.  Education, judged as education, is the sufferer.  I think it is a great pity that the revival of the Irish language should not be made the work of a separate Ministry, with a separate Minister in charge, divorcing it somewhat from education. I believe that in that way better results would be achieved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Butler referred to an Italian boy arriving at a school here to learn English, and he told us how quickly he picked it up.  But there is no analogy there.  The boy who arrived here to learn English hears it spoken not only in school but all around him. That is the whole point.  That boy was <Col N="383" /> not only learning English in school; he was learning it every time he went outside his parents' house.  Everywhere he went, into a bus, into a shop or anywhere else, English was spoken, and so, naturally, he picked up English very quickly.  I have known children who went to France knowing very little French and after going to school there for a year they were able to take their places in class with the French children.  That is what I would expect. But it is a very different thing when a child goes into school to learn an unfamiliar subject through an unfamiliar language, and who, after he leaves that school, does not hear a word of Irish until he goes back again.  Therefore, let us keep our minds clear on that matter, and compare like with like.</P>
    <P>We have heard talk about the standard of education of boys who come to various employers for interview.  I cannot compare their standard with that of boys of a similar age 20 or 30 years ago, but it has been said that the standard has deteriorated and has deteriorated very steadily.  I would not mind their handwriting very much. Handwriting, of course, used to be taught at very great length, and I think that it was to a certain extent a waste of time, but still there is a necessary standard&mdash;namely legibility. If the handwriting falls below legibility, then there is something wrong. To get anywhere, a boy must be able to write a hand that is legible, and many boys of to-day do not write legibly.  Deputy Butler referred to doctors and clergymen who write a bad hand.  Of course, doctors are notoriously bad writers; I do not know so much about clergymen's handwriting. It is said that it is the writing of prescriptions that makes doctors' handwriting so bad.  In the past anyway, they liked to write them in a way which was rather difficult to read.  But I will say this about most professional men, men who have been through a university, that during a number of years of their lives they have been taking notes.  Anyone who has taken notes in longhand will find after some years that his handwriting has deteriorated very much, and most people <Col N="384" /> of the professional classes do not write a very good hand.  Indeed, sometimes they may not write as legible a hand as a person who is in a much humbler occupation, but, unfortunately, in this imperfect world in which we live, the bad handwriting of the doctor or of the clergyman will be taken as the idiosyncrasy of a genius or of the clever man, whilst the bad handwriting of the boy who has not had the same advantages will be taken as the sign of imperfect education, and so the fact remains that there is a standard of handwriting below which the pupils should not be allowed to fall.</P>
    <P>Various Deputies talked about the standard of the national school buildings. I do not want to dwell at any length on that, because we have been through a period during the last six years when any rebuilding programme was very difficult if not entirely impossible, and I think the Minister is alive to the necessity for having as good buildings and as well-heated buildings as it is possible to have.  I personally hope that a very large programme of changing the buildings and the lay-out of the buildings will be introduced as soon as building materials are available and that the day will come not so very far in the future when we can point with pride to all our Irish schools, and not, as is the case now, only to some of them.</P>
    <P>Another point which has been raised by other speakers is the constant changing of the books.  I do not know how much that may be due to the policy of the Department of Education or how much it may be due to the whim of individual teachers.  The fact remains, however, that the books are constantly changed, especially in the secondary schools.  The books used by the older member of a family one year will not very often do the next in family after moving into that class the next year because the books have been changed.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that I consider that we are not getting from the Department of Education the value which we ought to get.  Children are being turned out of the schools without that exact knowledge which their fathers had; exact knowledge of <Col N="385" /> a few subjects.  They do not seem to learn by rote, and I think that is a very good thing; but they have not acquired that philosophic concept which Deputy Butler seems to think they have.  If they had acquired that, I would be very pleased.  I am not one who thinks that the old method of teaching boys and girls lists of the names of towns and countries and rivers was a good system; I do not think it was.  But they do not seem to have grasped the more modern methods by which it is sought to teach the children courses instead of long lists.  However that may be, the fact remains that we have had a very long and interesting debate on education, and I think no good case has been put up for our present system here.  I say to the Minister in all sincerity that I believe children are expected to take in too much during the brief period they are at the primary schools and, as a result, they are not being fitted for this modern world in which we live.</P>

      <P>I should like to make my brief remarks in the national language, but I expect that I would not be understood by the last speaker who is a revivalist of the language but objects to its being taught in our schools.  I have little or no respect for those of our youth who are in a financial and social position to become speakers of their native tongue but do nothing more than say that they are behind the language revival; who complain of the language being taught in our schools and yet say that they want to make it the language of our country.</P>

      <P>It has been stated during this debate that the present system of education is bad; that there is no good case in its favour.  But there has been no good case made against it and that is what counts.  I think anybody genuinely interested in our schools and in our youth must admit that the primary school-going child to-day is a wonder child.  There is no doubt about that. In general knowledge and in subjects <Col N="386" /> that are concentrated upon in our schools, the children are far ahead of any children of their age in years gone by.  Why people interested in this country should not realise that and admit that I cannot say.  In face of that, which is the general opinion and which is generally admitted by educationists who count, you find people stating that our standard of education is low, that our system is wrong, that our teachers are no good, and that the Minister for Education is not alert enough.</P>
      <P>The complaint generally is that there is too much time given to Irish in the schools and that because of that general education loses.  I do not think that is so, because the standard generally is very high.  If the results of the concentrated teaching of Irish in our schools are not what they should be the fault does not lie with the national teachers or with the Department of Education.  The fault lies with the general public who, instead of trying to help, try to hinder by adverse criticism the advance that is being made in teaching Irish in the schools.  The effort to teach Irish in the schools is generally killed at the school gate by the public outside, by those critics who pretend to want an Irish revival and who do everything to hinder and hamper it.  Nobody in this country has done more for the revival of the Irish language in face of great difficulties than the national school teachers.  They have done wonders for the Irish revival in years past, regardless of any feeling they have about Irish or politics or anything else, and very often their efforts are killed, as I say, by the public, or by the secondary school, or by the vocational school, or by the university, and, particularly, by opponents of the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we had a proper recognition amongst the professions in this country that Irish was the national language; if they would give it a standing by encouraging its use in the professions and in places where French or some other language is the hallmark of education and where Irish must be mentioned as a joke; if Irish was made a language to be proud of in the upper circles of this country, <Col N="387" /> you would have the vast effort in the schools made a tremendous success. As it is, in spite of the present atmosphere, it is a success.  The young child leaving the primary school is very well versed in his native language; he is also very well versed in the language of the foreigner and is an able child. I know that from the ordinary primary schools we have pupils competing for Civil Service posts and getting very good places against pupils from special grinding schools, which pay particular attention to pupils' qualifications.</P>
    <P>I deplore the continued effort to throw cold water on the present system of education, on the magnificent work of our primary schools and the teachers there.  It may be that, as regards some subjects dealing with rural Ireland, agricultural subjects, it would help considerably if you could introduce them into the schools&mdash; establish a system by which, in rural Ireland, agricultural subjects could be taught.  To my mind that is a matter for future years.  We are coming gradually into a system of vocational education, under which quite a lot of time will be given to agricultural subjects. If, as time goes by, our Department of Education could have attached to each school an agricultural plot, a demonstration plot, where some hours might be spent taking an interest in plants and seeds, it would help to improve the children's outlook, especially in rural Ireland.  But it will take money and time and a lot of trouble to get the teachers and the pupils in on that system.  You cannot do it all at once.  The public mind has something definite to concentrate on now and not a particular subject in the school.</P>
    <P>There are three things that the Department should try to put into operation.  One is the standardisation of books.  It is impossible, I agree, to get that all at once, but gradually we are coming to a time when the standardisation of books should be adopted.  Standardisation would be very effective and helpful.  Secondly, it is very necessary to have a high standard of personality among the inspectorial staff.  You have a very <Col N="388" /> high standard of education among the inspectorial staff so far as degrees and qualifications are concerned.  Very often these degrees and qualifications are secured by intense study.  I prefer a high standard of personality, a high gentlemanly standard among inspectors rather than a high standard of education.  It may seem strange, but those things do not always go together.  You do not always have a high gentlemanly standard where you have a high standard of education.  It is more necessary, in my opinion, to have a high standard of personality in an inspector than even a high standard of education.</P>
    <P>Because you have not that high standard of personality, there are highly-educated inspectors going into schools more anxious to find fault than to help, more anxious to aggravate a particular weakness in a teacher than to cure it and, perhaps, bring him in on better ways.  That is an annoying thing.  If the Department tried to find a better standard of personality among inspectors, the teachers would not always feel that the inspectors are their enemies.  I would always like to feel that the teacher regards the inspector as an assistant, anxious to help him over his weaknesses, if he has any, and anxious to instruct him in a better system, rather than declare his system wrong or, if the teacher has a weak spot, not saying anything to the teacher about it, but entering it on the school register and sending in a report behind the teacher's back.</P>
    <P>I know that some inspectors are fine fellows.  They are enthusiastic, sometimes too much so.  You cannot find a teacher in a hum-drum countryside school always as enthusiastic on a particular subject as an inspector may be. If there were more give and take, more confidence displayed and more discussions between teachers and inspectors, it would improve the system considerably.  It has been argued that there should be conferences and discussions between teachers and the Department.  I think if discussions and conferences were held between the teaching body and the inspectorial staff from time to time in a free and easy manner and not in <Col N="389" /> a brow-beating manner, such as may be carried on by inspectors overenthusiastic in relation to certain subjects, it would improve the situation and encourage the teachers who are trying to do their best.</P>
    <P>Few people realise that the teachers have such a hard job.  They live in a countryside where they have a very critical public, a public that likes to find fault with men who, in their opinion, are receiving large salaries, who are generally regarded as being well-off.  The position of the unfortunate teacher in a country district is far from happy.  Deputy Butler talked of teachers grinding pupils in the afternoons or acting as part-time bookkeepers for the proprietors of business houses.  I regret to hear that that is being done.  I regretted still more hearing Deputy Butler make a special case for the Dublin teacher, saying that his case is crying out for immediate redress.  I do not think the case of the Dublin teacher is more deserving of redress than the case of the country teacher.  The Dublin teacher has many advantages that the country teacher has not got.  He has various schools and colleges at his door, whereas the country teacher has to undergo heavy expenses sending members of his family to secondary and other schools.  The Dublin teachers keep their children in their own homes and their schooling does not cost anything like the huge fees that are the lot of the country teacher.</P>
    <P>Do not divide the claims of the Dublin teacher from those of the rural teacher; it would be a grave mistake, and I deplore very much the case made by the Dublin teacher for himself.  I think the Dublin teachers have put entirely out of focus the proper claims of the general body of teachers.  It may be because of over-enthusiasm, or for some other reason.  I think it is time the teachers should be placed on a definite salary basis, so that they would not have to cry out year after year for consideration.</P>
    <P>The third thing I would suggest is, now that the emergency appears to be coming to an end, that the Minister should raise the teacher to the standard that his calling demands and <Col N="390" /> ensure that a proper salary will be fixed once and for all.  If you do that, it will encourage the teachers to continue to live in rural Ireland.  The teacher is the centre of interest in rural Ireland.  That tradition has continued from the days of the old hedge schools.  Very often he is the only man to write a letter for people in the country.  He runs most organisations&mdash; the Red Cross, the L.D.F., the L.S.F. and other such organisations. He is the man of interest in a rural centre.  To my own knowledge, those men give so much time to things of local interest that they very often imperil their own financial standing. They are not in a position financially to justify their taking the great interest they do take in those public matters.  Yet unless you have those social interests in rural Ireland for the people and unless you make the teachers financially able to keep up those social interests for the people, you will take away from rural life a great deal of the glamour and interest it should have.</P>
    <P>It is deplorable that teachers do not live in the school centres and school districts.  It is deplorable that the Department does not make provision for housing accommodation up to the standard required to keep the teachers in those centres.  It is deplorable that they do not make the salary scale one that would encourage them to live there and to be ornaments, socially and otherwise, in the district.  I know that there is something to be said for tying salaries and wages down, but I think it is admitted generally that the time has come when the national teachers should be brought up on the salary scale and given a decent increase in their allowances.</P>
    <P>The position of the teachers has been seriously handicapped in recent years by the rule making the local teacher's wife retire at an earlier age than hitherto thought of or arranged for by the teacher, when he was fixing his family budget for the education of his children.  There has been another injury, in not allowing lady teachers, after a certain year, to continue as teachers after their marriage.  Taking those points into consideration, a really just case can be made for the <Col N="391" /> teachers and, now that the emergency is fizzling out, it should be feasible for the Minister to take a serious view of the salary scale.  I feel that he is genuinely anxious to settle this matter and I would like to point out to him that he should not let it stand as it is much longer but should make his views public, at least in regard to a post-emergency scheme.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to mention that anybody who states that our standard of education is low does not know what he is talking about.  I would emphasise that the primary school child is a wonder child to-day. Let anybody take a fifth, sixth or seventh standard composition book in Irish, and he will find that it is, a marvel.  I think it is far ahead of the standard of English that you get in some of the old copybooks of 20 or even ten years ago.  Those who want to criticise should spend a night studying the school bag of the sixth-year school-child.  They will discover that the child has been a wonderful pupil, that the teacher has been a good teacher and that the system of education is a first-class system.  We should have a public mind more aware of what is being done and more anxious to encourage than to criticise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister must be surprised that Deputies from all Parties, and especially from the Government Party, have made special appeals to him to reconsider his attitude towards the salaries of national teachers.  I should like to support that, as 90 per cent. of the children that I represent have no other education than that which they get in the national schools.  If they are to receive the full benefit of it, the teacher must be put into a position to devote his whole time to educating the youth of the country and that can be done only by removing the fear of want and hardship from the teachers' minds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to school meals, I would appeal to the Minister to impress upon the Government the necessity to extend the school meals system to the rural areas.  I am in an area where, for the last ten or 20 years, we have given hot meals&mdash;not milk and sandwich <Col N="392" /> but good Irish stew, three days a week.</P>

      <P>I am aware of that, but he has influence as a member of the Government.  The teachers in the rural areas, often out of sympathy, pay from their small salaries to supply food to necessitous children who have to travel three or four miles to school.</P>
      <P>I would like to deal with the vocational schools.  I have heard nothing about that white elephant, which exists at present in the country.  We see that over £447,000 out of the tax-payer's pocket, apart from the 50 per cent. from the rates, is spent on vocational education.  What are we getting in return?  Contrast the favourable treatment of the vocational teachers with the salaries of the national teachers.  The vocational teachers are treated more generously, because we are trying to bolster up and window-dress a scheme which I will prove is a failure in the towns and cities.  I will not include the rural areas in that.  I can give instances from my own knowledge and from my membership of vocational committees over the past 25 years, even when they were known as technical education committees, to prove this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We find that, in the month of September, notices are inserted in the papers that the classes will re-open on a particular night.  Full of enthusiasm, many people enrol in the classes and then we have to make arrangements for extra teachers. After a month or so, we find the class has dwindled down to six or seven and we get a return of 50 per cent. average attendance out of six or seven in <Col N="393" /> a class.  The inspectors are aware that many of the people attending the class are people for whom vocational education was never intended.  We have professional people, the rich and the well-off, taking up the time of the teachers, merely as a hobby.  I know of one wood-working class in a certain area.  What is it composed of? If we had a true report on the application form, we would find that they sign &ldquo;male&rdquo; but &ldquo;of adult age,&rdquo; and that they are pensioners, professional men and others who are attending the class to make up the number, merely as a hobby.  They are keeping the teacher there in the town, and the rural area is neglected.  On that account, the committee has not the money to provide a teacher for the rural areas, except for six weeks in the summer time.</P>
    <P>I always thought that vocational education meant that a young boy or girl attending in a particular trade would have his knowledge improved and would become a better craftsman in that particular trade.  However, we find the unemployed and the idle rich ladies attending woodwork classes in a certain town, and I am sure they are not attending in order to earn their livelihood by wood work.  I am sure that it comes as a shock to the Minister to know that we have a teacher being paid 7/- or 8/- an hour to teach these ladies woodwork for two hours a day&mdash;ladies who have nothing else to occupy their minds during the winter time except in learning woodwork as a hobby.  Surely, technical or vocational education was never intended for these people?  In my own constituency, a man who has taken a very great interest in education for many years has proposed that the entrance fee should be increased to a guinea in order to keep out those people, who can and should be in a position to pay for their education in a secondary school or other such places.  He pointed out that they only wanted to learn woodwork as a hobby.</P>
    <P>Now, take the case of the continuation schools.  You have about 70 per cent. of the students coming in from the rural areas to the urban areas where these continuation classes are <Col N="394" /> being held, because in the national schools in the rural areas there are no such facilities for children over 14 years of age, and they have to come in on their bicycles in order to get this so-called education.  I think that if we were to extend the school-leaving age to 16, we would get much better results, and at less cost than is involved at the present time.  I admit that the technical and vocational schools that exist in the rural areas are giving good results.  Instruction in agriculture is given in rural areas, where these schools exist, to the people who require that education; and you have also domestic economy classes, and woodworking classes, but they should not be there for people to learn these crafts as a hobby.  Their real purpose should be to enable the sons of farmers to learn woodwork so that they might be able to make or repair the machinery parts that would be required in their own homes.  It is only in a few rural areas, however, that such facilities are provided, and even where they do exist they are closed down for most of the year and only open up for six weeks in the summer time.  What happens is that the parish priest, from the altar, asks these young people to attend the classes for the weeks during which they are opened, but that is the busy season, when the people concerned are engaged in agriculture in the rural areas and have to work, and, accordingly, these people are not getting the facilities that are afforded in the towns, where you have secondary schools and where other arrangements are made to cater for such people.  As a result of this, you are depriving the rural people, who are taxpayers and ratepayers, of the facilities that are granted to people in the urban areas, and they are not getting educational facilities from any of the committees that I know of.  After all, what could one learn in six or seven weeks, even if you had the requisite number of pupils to enable a class to be held? The facilities are only granted in the months from July to September, but these are the months when the people concerned are working on the farms, and they are also the months when the teacher may want to go up to Dublin <Col N="395" /> or some other centre in order to take a special course.  You give them these six or seven weeks, and then you concentrate on the people in the towns for the rest of the year.</P>
    <P>Let me come now to the question of teachers of the Irish language.  I know of the case of one man&mdash;a native Irish speaker&mdash;who, simply because of the regulations of the Department, was unable to take out some degree to teach in Irish and who is therefore classed as a part-time teacher.  The man to whom I am referring is a man who gave service to the fostering of the Irish language in a time when it was not popular to do so and when there were no fees for teaching it except from the collection of moneys at meetings, concerts, and so on. Simply because he had not the necessary qualifications to enable him to get certain degrees, he can only get nine months' employment in the year and is classed as a part-time teacher, whereas other people, who can qualify in Irish or English, can get a job of teaching for the whole year.  The man to whom I am referring, I believe, has been treated harshly, simply because he is not able to take out these other degrees.</P>
    <P>I shall come back now to this matter of classes in woodwork.  If the teacher can teach through English or Irish, that qualifies him.  Take the case of the headmaster who is supposed to teach commercial subjects, such as shorthand, typewriting and so on.  He will get in an assistant to teach a continuation class, and that continuation teacher must attend an Irish class to learn Irish, but the headmaster, although he himself is not an Irish speaker, can employ that man.  I am in favour of teaching Irish, and I have seen very good results during the last 10 years in the case of children attending national schools.  The only hope we will ever have of reviving the language is through the teaching of the children in their infant stages.  Our only hope is in the youth of this country, and I believe that, within another 10 or 20 years' time, with the co-operation of all Parties in the State, instead of criticism, we will achieve the restoration of the language.  I believe <Col N="396" /> that that can be achieved, if not in our time, at least for future generations.</P>
    <P>As I have said, with regard to the continuation schools I do not think we are getting value for what the scheme is costing us.  I have often seen, in the case of a scheme costing £12,000 in a county, £9,000 of that going for teachers' salaries.  In other areas you have the secondary school.  At one time, the secondary school was known as the poor man's college.  It is not.  I challenge the Minister to look at the names and types of students in the secondary schools, and I think he will find that they are being used in a way in which they were never intended to be used, so far as the rural areas are concerned at any rate.  I am satisfied that we could improve the rural areas by having other schools or by taking teachers from the towns and sending them into the areas where we have no schools and providing continuation classes in those areas.  Providing continuation classes in those areas for six or eight weeks is only a waste of time. Some of these pupils would have to come in 10 or 15 miles to the centre, and when it is a busy time in agriculture you cannot expect the farmers' sons to come in to attend these classes. You will not get real results from a six weeks' or eight weeks' course in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>I have informed the Minister of some of the cases that have come to my notice, and in this connection I must protest against the unfair treatment that is given to caretakers.  While officials of the Department are granted travelling expenses and so on, the poor, unfortunate caretakers only get a few shillings a week&mdash;much less than the standard rate of wages in the area. In one case, 45/- a week was the standard rate of wages in the area, but the caretaker there was only sanctioned by the Department to have 42/- a week.  That case was pointed out to the Department.  It was pointed out that he was getting less than the standard rate of wages being paid in the area. I would ask the Minister to give particular consideration to such cases, and also to the case of teachers who travel out into the rural areas to hold classes at a time when the students cannot <Col N="397" /> attend.  I think that we would get much better results if such steps as I have outlined were taken.</P>
    <P>The general complaint is: what are the people getting in return for what they are paying in the matter of education?  Where we have good vocational schools, in Carnew and Baltinglass, we are getting good results, because in these areas there are no other things to occupy the minds of the children.  They are attending these schools and we have got some very excellent results from them. Some of the pupils have got very good positions and some have even passed the examination for the Cathal Brugha Street School of Domestic Economy. That is due to the fact that there are no pictures or other distractions in these areas and they can devote their whole time to the classes.</P>
    <P>I ask the Department to consider carefully the position with regard to these continuation schools.  Would we not get much better value for the money spent if the school attendance age were increased to 16?  The Minister will find that the 70 per cent.  I have mentioned as attending the continuation classes in the daytime are children from outside the town areas. What is the position of the teacher? There is not the same discipline as there is in the national school because the teacher tries to play up in order to keep a certain number on the rolls. I am not in favour of compulsion of any kind, but I say that if we are to achieve anything&mdash;in this I agree with Deputy Butler&mdash;it is in the period from 14 to 17 years that we will get the results.</P>
    <P>I have heard comments about a school, not under the jurisdiction of the Wicklow committee but in the same county, in which the teachers were devoting their whole time to professional men who were attending special classes.  It was commented on within the last month by a very prominent supporter of the Government who is a member of the committee and who protested against the teacher devoting all his time to these professional men and neglecting the children.  There are a number of these classes in regard to which an inquiry by the Department <Col N="398" /> is almost necessary in order to see if the position can be improved.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied from 25 years' experience that some improvement must be made because we are not getting value commensurate with the cost to the ratepayers and taxpayers.  We shall have to concentrate more on greater facilities for the children leaving school in the rural areas.  I make these comments in a spirit of constructive criticism and not from the angle of an attack on the Department.  I am sure that if the Minister makes inquiries, he will find that a large number of men who have been members of vocational committees will agree with me that an improvement in the position is necessary in the schools throughout the country.</P>

Ní bhfaigheann páistí na tíre, ach amháin seacht fén gcéad, aon oideachas ach bun-oideachas, sé sin le rá, tá oideachas na tíre ar fad nach mór ag brath ar na múinteoirí náisiúnta.

Má leantar leis an réim atá fén Rialtas anois, ní raghaidh sé chun maitheasa na tíre, chun maitheasa oideachais nó chun maitheasa an chreidimh, agus achainím ar an Rialtas an cheist d'athbhreithniú. Tá múinteoirí sa chathair seo atá i gcruadhchás agus is féidir leo rudaí do dhéanamh ná beadh tairbheach dóibh féin agus ná beadh, go mór-mhór, tairbheach don tír.</P>
      <P>Maidir le ceist na Gaeilge, aontaím leis na Teachta adúairt go bhfuil deagh-obair á dhéanamh sna scoileanna, ach nílim sásta go bhfuil an scéal ag dul ar aghaidh mar ba cheart.  Má labhrann tú le buachaill nó cailín in oifig nó siopa tar éis fiche bliain, is iongantach an beagán Gaeilge atá acu.

      <P>Tá rud eile ag cur go mór in aghaidh ceist na Gaeilge sna scoileanna, sé sin, na ranganna móra.

B'fhéidir leat ceol nó amhránaíocht do mhúineadh dhóibh ach ní féidir leat Gaeilge do mhúineadh dhóibh.  Ba cheart go ndéanfaí riail ná beadh thar dhá scór páiste in aon rang.

Is mar an gcéanna linn-ne.  Cur i gcás páistí na Gaeltachta.  Níl focal Béarla acu.  Nuair a théigheadh páistí na Gaeltachta ar scoil, ní bheadh aon Bhéarla acu agus is trí Bhéarla a tugtaí a gcuid oideachais dóibh, ach tar éis tamaill bhíodh Béarla maith acu.

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to the case of those women teachers who are in receipt of a salary of only £2 10s. per week.  Over a year ago, I asked the Minister a question about teachers in this category.  He replied that he hoped in the near future to increase the pay of those teachers. Quite recently, I had a communication from one of them&mdash;a teacher in a comparatively small school in a rural area &mdash;whose salary amounts to £2 10s. per week.  I am sure that the Minister realises that such a salary is at present entirely inadequate to meet the requirements of any individual who has to pay for board and lodging in addition to keeping herself, as a teacher must, in a respectable, well-dressed way.  Those salaries were fixed when the cost of living was, probably, about half what it is at present.  No teacher can be expected satisfactorily to discharge her duties to her pupils if she has to live on £2 10s. a week.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter. We must realise that a teacher in receipt of such a salary who has charge of children from the infant class upto 14 or 15 years of age cannot be expected to have her heart in the work and cannot be expected to give the type of service which young children and more mature children should have.  I ask the Minister to consider, particularly, the case of those teachers who have to provide themselves with accommodation at places other than their own homes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke (County Dublin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that, in speaking to the Minister on some of the matters with which I propose to deal, I am really pushing an open door.  I know that he has the interest of the teachers at heart and that he is doing his best for them.  I have heard a number of heartrending <Col N="402" /> stories from teachers in County Dublin.  Some of them say that they are not able to meet their ordinary liabilities.  That is bound to react unfavourably on the pupils and on the nation as a whole.  The teacher has the sole responsibility of moulding both the Christian and national outlook of the child.  If the teacher goes to school in the morning with the expectation that somebody will call upon him during the day to collect a debt, he cannot give of his best to the pupils. I know that the Minister has been doing his best but, in the post-emergency period, the young teachers, particularly, should get a higher rate of salary.  As other speakers have pointed out, a teacher is looked upon as the first man in the parish.  He is expected to subscribe generously to everything.  He is expected to join every committee and give a subscription. There are heavy demands on the teacher as compared with any other individual.  For that reason alone, I feel that he has a good case and I am sure that this matter will be given favourable consideration when the question comes up for decision again. I heard some references here to the special case which can be made for city teachers.  I admit that it is more expensive to live in the city than it is to live in the country, but there is the contrary argument that the teacher in rural Ireland is at a good deal of expense which the city teacher avoids. When he marries and has a family, he has to send his children to school, and it is not easy to send children to a good secondary school from the country. What the city teacher loses on one hand, I think he gains on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people consider that there should be a slight diversity in the school programme&mdash;that the programme should be arranged to suit particular areas.  If the area is industrial, the child going to school there should be told about the industries of the locality, particularly if it is probable that the child will, in after life, enter one of those industries.  I do not say, of course, that there should be a hard-and-fast rule.  As regards the agricultural parish, I am a great believer in the teaching of rural science because I think a child should be prepared <Col N="403" /> during school days for the occupation which he will probably take up later in life and that his interest in it should be intensified.  That is an opinion I have heard expressed by a number of people.  I consider it rather unfair that so high a percentage of teachers should be recruited from the Gaeltacht areas.  The argument is used that children will learn more Irish from a man who comes from the Gaeltacht than they would from a man who comes from the Galltacht.  I completely disagree with that.  I have attended a number of Irish classes from time to time.  The most successful teachers, so far as I was concerned, were those who had learned the language themselves and who appreciated the difficulty of the learner.  I am not saying anything against the people of the Fior-Ghaeltacht but I think that every child in the country should have an equal chance of entering the preparatory colleges with a view to becoming a teacher.  From my own experience, the man who has to make an uphill fight to learn the language will be more in sympathy with the pupil than the man who acquired his knowledge of the language without difficulty.  I should like to see the teachers satisfied, because I feel that the destiny of our country depends upon them.  There is no doubt that some of the greatest men we had in the fight for national freedom, were indebted for their patriotic outlook to the teachers.  In the area from which I come&mdash;North County Dublin&mdash;Tomás Aghas imbued the young people with a spirit of patriotism and hence we had Ashbourne.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephHallide" hpid="Mr. Halliden Mr. Halliden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halliden</NameTxt>
      <P>The great drawback of our scheme of primary education is that it is not sufficiently thorough. Fully 95 per cent. of the children of the poorer and middle classes receive no education, training or discipline after the age of 14.  When they reach the age of 14, they leave the national school.  It is at the age of 14 that their characters are being formed, but, unfortunately, it is at that time that they are, as it were, let loose on the world. I appealed to the Minister last year, and I appeal to him again to-day, to <Col N="404" /> put into operation a scheme of post-primary education so that boys and girls at the age of 14 will receive some training that will enable them to develop their natural talents and to secure the positions in life that will be most suitable and congenial to them. At the present time very little discipline, control or guidance is exercised over them once they reach the age of 14.  In my opinion, their education should be continued after they reach that age.  The great problem with parents at the present time is to know what to do with their children when they leave the primary schools.  Very often, the children take the cross-roads as the standard of their culture.  For a number of years after they leave the primary schools they just do what they like, so that when they reach the age of 18 they have very little to show for their time.  They then get dissatisfied. Through a system of post-primary education steps should be taken to develop the natural abilities of the boys.  In the case of the girls, it is, I suppose, true to say that 75 per cent. of them will, in later life, be engaged in housekeeping. Therefore, they should get some training in domestic economy to fit them for housework.  In the recently issued report of the Vocational Education Commission I read that there is a wastage in the homes of this country to the extent of something like £14,000,000 a year.  I think that is largely due to the fact that girls receive no definite training to fit them for housekeeping between, say, the ages of 14 and 18.</P>
      <P>That is, I submit, a great drawback in our educational system.  It should be the policy of the Government to do all they possibly can for children when they reach the age of 14 years.  Even if many of them have to leave the country later it is better that they should go out as skilled workers rather than as unskilled workers as so many of them are doing to-day.  When they go to a foreign country too many of them have to take up work as hewers of wood or drawers of water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point which I wish to emphasise is that if we want to make Irish a living language instruction in it must be continued after a child reaches the <Col N="405" /> age of 14 years.  I agree with Deputy O Cléirigh that; no matter how brilliant a child may be, if he returns from school to a home where no Irish is spoken he soon forgets his Irish when he leaves the school atmosphere, and when he does not hear it spoken at the fair, the market or on the sportsfield, whereas if you had a system of post-primary education his instruction in the Irish language would be continued and, as he advanced in years, he would gain greater facility in the use of Irish so that it would gradually become his every-day language.  Until we reach that position it will be a difficult, if not an impossible, task to make Irish the spoken language of the people.  In my opinion 95 per cent. of our people get no education other than that which they receive in the national schools.  While that is thorough enough, more should be done to develop the natural talents of the children.  That is the part of education which, I think, is most neglected.</P>
    <P>It is a pity, I think, that no effort has been made, so far as the children of the poorer classes are concerned, to enable them to enter the Civil Service or the professions.  They are precluded from both because the knowledge of Irish that is essential for entrance can only be obtained in the secondary schools.  We know that, in the case of those who desire to enter the Civil Service, their education must be up to leaving certificate standard, or they must have matriculated.</P>
    <P>It is true, of course, that most of the county councils provide scholarships to enable the children of not well-to-do parents to get a secondary education, but no matter how brilliant those children may be&mdash;and I am aware that we have many brilliant children amongst the poorer classes&mdash;they never get the chance of advancing, so what happens is, they are thrown into the open market after they reach the age of 14 and their education is never completed.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service at the present time is, I am afraid, confined to those whose parents can afford to send them to secondary schools.  In my opinion, neither the Irish language nor the children of the poorer classes will get a fair chance until we have a system <Col N="406" /> of post-primary education.  Even in the case of parents who can afford to send their children to the secondary schools, they find the cost of the provision of books for them a heavy drag on their resources.  I can speak on that subject with a good deal of experience. So far as the use of books is concerned, there is a great deal of overlapping. A set of books that may do a pupil for a year or two will not do a little brother or sister entering the secondary school two or three years later. New sets of books have to be provided for the latter, and in that way a great deal of expense is put on parents.  I think standard textbooks should be used to a greater extent, and in that way parents could be saved a great deal of unnecessary expense.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is much more I have to say.  The leader of our Party is here now and he will have something to say as to what the outlook of the Farmers' Party is in connection with primary education and particularly on the topical subject of the teachers' salaries.  I agree with what Deputy O Cleirigh and Deputy Butler have said.  I am well aware that teachers' salaries are entirely inadequate, and that they have grievances in so far as they believe and know that they are not getting fair treatment as compared with other public servants.  The pensioned teachers and the married teachers also have grievances.  All these subjects have been discussed at great length by previous speakers, and it is not my intention to labour them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that primary education is of such importance that we should spare no money and no effort to give our youth the very best education that the country can afford. In my opinion we have far too many of the higher schools.  There is the old saying that &ldquo;a little education is a dangerous thing.&rdquo;  I think in this country we have far too many misfits, men who have a fair amount of education but who have no scope for it and cannot find positions.  I really believe they are the greatest nuisance.  A man with a little education who has not a position is really a nuisance because he will not settle down to the humdrum life of ordinary people.  He wants <Col N="407" /> something that he cannot get in this country, and he is not man enough to go across the water to try to find scope for his energies somewhere else. We cannot help these things, but I do believe we are not devoting sufficient time, energy or patience to looking after the ordinary people of this country.</P>
      <P>Ninety-five per cent. of the children of the country go to the national school and no further.  I think that the ordinary child who attends the national school until he or she reaches the age of 15 and who has had a good teacher, gets a good sound education and is well fitted to take his or her place in any sphere afterwards.  Many Irish boys and girls of 40 or 50 years ago, who attended the ordinary national school and who went all over the world afterwards&mdash;to America, Britain and Africa&mdash;attained to the highest positions in these lands.  They brought great honour to themselves, to our country and to the Church.  Some of them became the highest dignitaries of the Catholic Church, yet before leaving this country the only education they received was that which they acquired at the national schools.</P>
      <P>At the present time our teachers have a very hard time in trying to instruct the younger generation in two languages.  At one and the same time, they are trying to restore the Irish language and to give the children a sound knowledge of the language they already know.  One thing of which we may be sure is that the great bulk of our people want the Irish language restored, if it is at all possible.  I believe it will be restored but not immediately. It will be restored in the course of two or three generations.  I think that far more patience should be shown by inspectors and other people to the teachers who are entrusted with this task.  Throughout the country we have a great many Gaelic enthusiasts, who come principally from Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These people, who are native speakers, are very impatient with other people who are trying to acquire a knowledge of the language, people such as those in County Meath which was formerly part of the Pale.  The <Col N="408" /> people of Meath were ground down by the British in the past and they never had an opportunity of learning Irish. The English language was forced down their throats but they survived all that presecution.  I say that Irish teachers coming from the West and the North have not sufficient patience with these people.  They are driving children away from their classes and the parents are getting disgusted with them.  They are just as enthusiastic about the Irish language as anybody else, and it is time that those who have not sufficient patience with them should be told where they get off.</P>
    <P>We have had a great revival of Irish in County Meath for some years past. There was hardly a parish that was not reorganised and there were classes with a membership from 15 to 25 in nearly every parish.  They started with a great flourish but more recently I find that the attendance has been falling to five or six or seven at the classes.  The explanation of that may be found partly in the fact that many people think that the enthusiasm of the new Gaelic speakers who came into the county is not so much for the restoration of the language as for the jobs they are able to get because they speak it.  We find that men from the Irish-speaking colonies are getting job after job and are putting themselves over everybody else.  In that way they are creating a spirit of opposition amongst the people of the county generally. I admit that the men who came up to these colonies are entitled to get these positions, if they are sufficiently educated and have the qualifications for them, but they should get these positions in some outside county.  It is not a good thing I suggest to give them positions in the county where they are being nourished and fed over the heads of ordinary native people.  On the question of the revival of Irish, I think there could be a good deal more harmony amongst Gaelic Leaguers in the midlands.  In the old days we had a number of Gaelic Leaguers.</P>

      <P>Does the Deputy suggest that the Minister should go down and try to reconcile these differences?</P>

    <Col N="409" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to let him know what is going on.  I find that there is a vast amount of disagreement, but there is really nothing in these differences if somebody would make the attempt to get them to work in harmony.  I should like the Minister to make some effort through vocational committees to get these people to pull together rather than let matters drift as they are.  With regard to the question of dissatisfaction amongst national teachers, I know that a very big problem faces the Minister.  In many cases the teachers have a genuine grievance&mdash;young teachers, for instance, who have no home near the school in which they are teaching and who have to cycle a considerable distance to their work.  I know other cases where two principal teachers are married to each other and are doing very well.  They are the élite of the surrounding locality.  Teachers who are married to farmers or people in good positions, are also fairly well off. It is, as I say, a difficult problem, but I think that something should be done for the young teacher starting in the profession who has not a sufficient salary.  I think some effort should be made also to provide teachers with residences adjacent to the schools in which they teach.  There is no suitable housing accommodation in most country areas, and that is a big grievance amongst the teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that in some quarters it is a popular thing to advocate increased salaries for teachers, but I know, on the other hand, that amongst the agricultural community to suggest increasing teachers' salaries is the same as holding a red rag to a bull.  There is not the slightest doubt about that.  I know that to a large extent the teachers are responsible for this unpopularity themselves, because some of them were amongst the most feather-headed class in the country.  That is why they have not the sympathy to-day that they should have.  I hope that when their grievances are ended they will take a tip: keep out of politics and look after their jobs.  If they do that, they will get more respect from farmers, workers, and business people.  They certainly have my sympathy, because I know they have <Col N="410" /> a hard, difficult job.  Since they have been compelled to teach the children two languages, the difficulties of their work have been intensified.  I speak with some personal knowledge of this matter, because I happen to be married to a teacher.</P>
    <P>When she comes home in the evening she is utterly tired out, far more tired than a person rearing pigs, ducks or hens in the farmyard througout the day.  Many people would not believe that, but I know that when many teachers come from school they suffer from tired heads and what they really require is to go to bed immediately. Their job is altogether too heavy. Something should be done to ease the programme in the schools or else give the teachers more help.  The programme is really beyond the teachers. They are doing their best but it is imposing a very heavy strain upon them.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal to the effect that the standard of education has gone down immensely, that we are a nation of illiterates.  I do not believe that.  Education may have gone slightly back in this generation, but that would be no harm if we were able to carry the Irish language forward.  I think it is worth making a sacrifice in order that we may have our own language restored.  There are too many seeking higher education in this country and too many misfits looking for jobs.  As I said before, they are a danger to everybody.</P>
    <P>We have too many ordinary people going in for higher education.  When they finish that course they cannot find suitable positions.  The finest type we have consists of boys and girls who are willing to work for good wages with decent farmers, either as servants or as messengers.  These can make good, and are amongst the best types we have. At the present time many young people turn up their noses at the suggestion of becoming farm servants or errand boys.  They want to skip off to the city to get into a factory.  We know what happens to them after a short time.  When they return home for week-ends they make a nuisance of themselves asking their parents for money.  Some of the old people may <Col N="411" /> be getting the old age pension, but they have to give some of it to the young people in order to help to keep them in Dublin.  We want to develop a decent sense of proportion in our young people; we want them to realise that although their parents worked for a living with neighbours at small wages, they made good, and married well.  They were not like many of the young people to-day, who try to imitate the example of some film stars. That is really what has happened. Many of our people have lost their sense of balance.  Of course, I will be told that these are old-fashioned views, but it is better to be old-fashioned than new-fashioned because the new fashions will not bring our youth anywhere.</P>
    <P>Coming to vocational education, I consider it to be very expensive, and suggest that more care would want to be taken with such schemes.  An enormous amount of money is being spent on vocational education and I do not think it is producing good results. We got grants from the Department to provide vocational schools in my constituency, but I think some of them are white elephants, and that the teachers spend most of their time trying to get pupils to attend the classes. I consider these vocational schools to be a failure.  I am sorry that that is so, because the scheme is a good one. If there were more night classes for boys and girls at which ordinary subjects could be taught I think the results would be better.  I do not care who is asked to express an opinion about the vocational schools, whether parish priest, national teacher or Gárda sergeant; all, I believe, will say that the money being spent is wasted. I ask the Minister to stop building huge schools in country districts, unless the Department is satisfied that they can be filled with the proper type of students.  These schools are not now being attended as they should be, and while the teachers are drawing salaries, they are worried, because they cannot get sufficient students to attend.  I suggest that the Department should get back to the night classes for young people between 14 and 16 years of age, where ordinary national <Col N="412" /> school subjects could be taught with advantage.  I went to an ordinary national school and I made good use of my time there.  I took prizes in whatever classes I attended.  I learned carpentry and, if necessary, I could build my own house as a result of what I learned at night classes.  Students who attended other classes are now also able to undertake certain engineering work also, as well as carpentry, in their homes and farms.</P>
    <P>We have heard a good deal about the necessity of an agricultural bias in national schools.  Wherever there is a practical national teacher in a district the pupils will always have a bias towards agriculture, because he understands the growing of different crops. What is wanted in the country is facilities for a good sound education, reading, writing, arithmetic and geography. I consider that pupils really begin to learn from 14 to 16 years. They do not want higher studies; they want commonsense.  I do not believe in trying to give everybody higher education.  Everything depends upon the child.  If a child has not the brains it cannot make progress.  If it has the brains it will make good even without education.  There is no use in blaming the Minister or the schools for all the duds that we have in this country.  If children have the brains they will learn and fit into certain spheres, but we must give teachers all the facilities they require for their work.  The groundwork depends on the teaching and moulding of character.  We have fine teachers in our schools.  Unfortunately, they have a grievance at the present time, and I ask the Minister to do his best to remove that grievance. I certainly belive that it will be a hard job to do that, seeing that so many classes of teachers are affected.  While some married teachers may be living on farms containing 200 acres, and be comfortable, many other teachers are living in a state of dire destitution.  The position of a man with 50/- a week, who may have to cycle five miles to his school, is a hard one.  I believe that our young teachers should have higher rates of pay.  If a teacher is not able to deserve the respect of everybody in a parish he will not be thought much <Col N="413" /> of.  Shopkeepers, farmers and workers in a parish look to the teacher as being next in importance to clerymen. When local people have problems to solve, forms to be filled, or require letters of recommendation, they go to the teacher to help them.  In fact, the local teacher is regarded as the parish centre.  It is nearly always the teacher who acts as secretary of a parish council, or the Gaelic League branch.  Teachers cannot undertake work of that kind on a niggardly salary.  We should treat them decently.</P>
    <P>This topic is a dangerous one for Deputies to touch upon because, during the past 15 or 20 years, some teachers may have made themselves unpopular by dipping into politics and, naturally, that had unfortunate results.  I think that such teachers have now learned their lesson, and that the Minister might see his way to ease the grievances under which they suffer.  It would be a good thing for the country, as well as for the teachers, if that could be done.  We do not want to have a teachers' strike.  That would be one of the worst things that could happen.  If the children saw that the teachers were on strike, and if the schools closed, what respect would there be for education?  We cannot afford to have that situation, but if something is not done we are definitely going to have it.  I am absolutely opposed to allowing anything of that kind to happen.  I ask the Minister to do everything in his power to see that a spirit that would bring about such a position should not be allowed to spread.</P>
    <P>At present national teacher cannot deal with unruly children in the way in which they should be dealt with. They cannot slap a child that needs a slap.  Many children need corporal punishment because they are not getting proper training at home from their parents.  In the past, children were thrashed by their parents when they needed it and they had respect for their parents.  At present if a teacher punishes a child, the mother or father goes to the Guards and has the teacher prosecuted.  The teacher does not know where he stands.  He may be brought to court for giving a <Col N="414" /> child the thrashing that he needs.  We all know that very few teachers would injure a child, but a good teacher would give a child a slap on the hand and it would be very good for him. If the teachers knew where they stood there would be far more discipline and there would be more respect on the part of the children.  There are too many mamma's pets in this country, little darlings who, if they only sneeze, will not go to school; they get a certificate from a doctor that they are ill and, unfortunately, there are too many doctors in this country who are ready to give certificates in such cases.  There are many poor farmers' children suffering from hunger and there is not a word about them.  There are others, poor darlings, who are fed by the State from the time they are born until they die and who get too much to eat.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister in future to look after the primary schools, first, last and all the time.  The colleges are there for the children whose parents have money.  In the case of a child of poor parents who displays aptitude or intelligence the State should take over that child, whether a boy or a girl, and give him or her full education.  There are many children of the poorer classes who have brains but who have no scope to develop them.  The State should help them.  In the past generation many of our poorest children did well in life because they had brains and because they had scope to develop their brains. The majority of the children have not very much brains and those who have the brains should not be neglected.  It would be a good thing that the State should make a generous effort in this direction.  In the case of any child who shows promise in any particular direction, the State should give him full education, and I think it would repay the State a hundredfold.</P>
    <P>When the emergency has ceased and when building materials are at their normal price, I would ask the Minister to tackle the question of school buildings, especially in Westmeath, where there are seven or eight schools that are in a very bad condition.  I would also suggest the provision of teachers' residences where they are not already available.  These matters <Col N="415" /> are of the utmost importance now when plans are being made for school building and for education generally.  The scheme should be ready to be put into operation when the emergency is over.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to grumble against the Minister.  I know he has a difficult task and I know that he is a tough man.  At least, I hear he is one of the toughest Ministers to get around. That may not be a bad thing.  However, if a matter is put up to him in all reasonableness, I think he will see to it that it is met in a reasonable way. I hope that neither the teaching profession nor the Minister will allow the matter at present at issue to come to a deadlock, but that they will meet in a round-table conference and settle their differences, for the sake of the coming generation.  They can do it and I hope they will do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has dragged to considerable length, and I will try to be as brief as possible.  It is very gratifying to hear from all sides of the House high appreciation of all that has been done for the revival of the Irish language.  I am sure that there is nothing nearer or dearer to our hearts than to see, if not the attainment of an all-Irish speaking nation, at least a good foundation laid.  That will not be accomplished in a short space of time, and I doubt if it would be healthy that it should be accomplished in a short space of time, because anything accomplished in a hurry very often has not a lasting effect.  Deputy O Cléirigh said that the children are wonderfully well grounded in Irish when they leave the national school&mdash;that is perfectly true; they are reasonably good, anyhow&mdash;but he said it died at the school gate because of the attitude of the public. I cannot agree with that.  I think Deputy O Cléirigh went part of the way but did not go the whole way.  In my opinion, the cause of the trouble, in the rural districts, is not that the public have a hatred for the language or are inclined to sneer or gibe at the Irish revival but because the children realise, even while they are going to school, that they will have to emigrate to England or to America, in <Col N="416" /> order to earn a living.  The natural desire of the children to learn their native language is destroyed by that fact.  Therefore, I say, if the Government wish to put the revival of Irish on a permanent basis, the first step is to stop emigration.  There is no use in trying to force Irish on children when they know quite well that after school they will emigrate.  It is emigration and the influence of emigration on the children and on the adults that is killing the desire to learn Irish. If the children knew that there would be a livelihood for them at home, in which a thorough knowledge of Irish would be required, they would learn Irish with a will.  At present they are only half-hearted in the matter of learning Irish and emigration is the real cause of the trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the commencement of this debate we had a demonstration in this House such as never occurred here before. That demonstration was not made without a good and sound cause.  I am referring now to the subject of teachers' salaries.  The national school is the poor man's university.  Next to the parent, the national teacher has the greatest influence in moulding the character and outlook of the future generation of Irish men and women. It is absolutely essential that the profession that occupies such a high position should be placed beyond reach of penury and financial distress.  There is a big argument put up that the conditions of city and rural teachers differ a lot.  I will not go into the fine points of that, but surely it must be within the scope of the higher officials of his Department or of the Minister himself to deal with that situation, and to give those teachers a decent salary, a salary in accordance with their calling, in order to put the whole body of teachers in a fairly independent position.  Some of them are in an independent position at the present time; others are not. That matter must be set right; otherwise, we are heading for a very serious state of affairs.  The last speaker mentioned a teachers' strike, and I think that is not outside the bounds of possibility. It had not occurred to me until I heard him mention it, but, as I have said, I can see that it is not outside <Col N="417" /> the bounds of possibility, and it would have dreadful reactions if it were to occur.  That is all I will say on that subject.</P>
    <P>On the matter of vocational education, from every side of the house the big schools have met with disapproval, and I think rightly so.  I should like to see some kind of system inaugurated under which there would be set aside for this purpose a room or small building attached to each of the national schools all over the country.  In reply, the Minister will probably point out the enormous expense of that, but I would suggest that a start should be made by way of experiment.  There would be big difficulties in the way of putting up the necessary buildings and equipping them, providing the necessary teachers and so on.  Nevertheless, I think a start should be made in that direction, because at the present time a deplorable state of things exists.  We should like to see the young men and women of this country leaving school with a good, sound knowledge of agriculture. I know that away back in the British days, there was a course in agriculture in the schools.  That, I think, was prior to 1900.  Since 1900 that subject has been dropped out of the curriculum, and I should like to see it restored.  It is desirable also that they should have a bit of training in a few trades, such as carpentry, and so on.</P>
    <P>That would give the young men of the country more of an interest in their homes.  At the very least, they should have the ability to brighten and improve their homes, and also to repair their own farm implements. In that way, the farmers and the farmers' sons could usefully employ their spare time on wet days.  It would give them very much more of an interest in their home lives, and would also effect a saving in expenditure.  I hope the Minister will pay attention to those few points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>Many Deputies here have discussed vocational education, domestic economy, rural science, and so on.  To my mind, the best way to get results in that direction is by the introduction of such courses into the schools during the school age.  When <Col N="418" /> a boy or girl leaves school, it is very difficult to get them to attend classes either in the daytime or at night.  I suggest the provision of accommodation adjacent to the national schools in the towns and rural areas, so that such classes could be carried on at least during the last two years of the child's school career, even though it, may involve the appointment of extra teachers in domestic economy, in rural science, and in the ordinary vocational training.  I think that would be money well spent, and it would be the means of providing suitable employment for some of our young boys and girls who may otherwise have to leave the country to seek a livelihood in a foreign land.  Teachers might be appointed to attend a number of schools during the week.  They could attend for an hour or so at each school, and would get in about 12 schools during the week.  I know of cases where young boys have made all the furniture for their own homes. That is a credit even to the system which is in existence, but those are only exceptional cases.  In many cases, both in the rural areas and in the towns, we find the life of the home upset because the young girls have not been properly trained.  The inability of young girls to deal with their household duties is responsible for much discontent and unrest in the homes, and that disability in turn is due to lack of proper training during their school careers.  That is the point I want to stress.  Any money spent on the introduction of such a system as I have mentioned would be money well spent, because if those classes are not provided during the school-going period, you will never get satisfactory attendances afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may have been reasonable grounds for the outburst we had here a short time ago in connection with the conditions of teachers throughout the country.  You have young teachers away from their own homes, paying for &ldquo;digs&rdquo;, and trying to provide transport to attend their schools, and I would suggest to the Minister that in such cases an allowance should be made available if accommodation adjacent to the schools cannot be provided. To my mind, that would meet <Col N="419" /> the situation.  If such a scheme were introducted I think it would go a long way towards improving the conditions of the teachers who in many cases are badly hit at the present time.  The cost of living has certainly gone up on the teachers as well as everybody else, and I think something should be done to meet their demands.  Like everybody else, I suppose they have a grievance, and I think the Minister would be wise to do something about it in order to avoid any clash or the danger, as has been suggested, of a strike.  I think that would be very bad policy as strikes are very bad things.  I think it would be a very bad thing for the youth of the country, for the children going to school, to encourage such a thing.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I brought to the notice of the Minister the condition of a school in my area, and I think the Minister is very unfair in trying to force the manager to build a new school.  The school is in an outlying country area.  The building is a good one, and with an expenditure of £300 or £400 I think a right good job could be made of the school.  I think it is grossly unfair for the Minister to try to force the manager to build a new school when we take into consideration that, previous to the taking over of the school, it was under the control of a very wealthy landlord.  That was the period when the Minister should have seen that the landlord put the school into proper repair or built a new one. Now that the manager of the school is satisfied to expend a sum of £300 or £400 on the building, I think the Minister would be wise to agree to the suggestion of the manager and not try to force him to build a new school.</P>

Ní dóigh liom go gcabhróidh sé mórán le cúis na múinteoirí ná leis an gcás atá dá phlé acu.  Tá Cumann na Múinteóirí ag obair go láidir ar fud na tíre. Is dóigh liom, d'ainneoin an ghleo go léir go bhfuil cás láidir ag na hoidí scoile mar gheall ar scéal an tuarastail. Baineadh deich fán gcéad de na múinteoirí scoile sa bhliain 1923.  Sin é an chéad laghdú tharla nuair a bhí Rialtas eile sa tír agus glacadh leis gan mórán gleo mar gheall air. Baineadh deich fán gcéad eile de thuarastal na n-oidí scoile sa bhliain 1931 agus, más cuimhin liom i gceart é &mdash;agus sílim gur cuimhin&mdash;sarar cuireadh an laghdú sin i bhfeidhm bhí comdháil ag Cumann na Múinteoirí Náisiúnta.  Thánadar le chéile i mBaile Atha Cliath agus de thoradh breis mór guthaíochta glacadh leis an tarna laghdú de dheich fán gcéad.  Deineadh socrú sa bhliain 1920 i dtaobh tuarastal na n-oidí scoile agus sílim go raibh na hoidí sásta leis an socrú sin an uair sin.  Sílim go mbeidís sásta dá gcuirfí an scéim sin i bhfeidhm arís.  Sin é atá dhá mholadh agamsa, mar dhuine amháin, don Aire agus don Rialtas&mdash;chomh luath agus is féidir, é a dhéanamh, dul siar ar an socrú sin agus é chur i bhfeidhm arís.</P>
    <P>Tá a lán ag brath ar na scoileanna agus ar na hoidí scoile i láthair na huaire agus sna blianta atá romhainn amach.  Dúradh sa díospóireacht seo, agus deirtear go minic anso agus ansúd ar fud na tíre, nach bhfuil réim an oideachais chomh hard anois agus a bhí sé fiche, tríocha nó dachad bliain ó shoin.  Níl le hinsint agamsa faoi sin ach mo scéal féin.  Is cuimhin liom nuair a bhíos ag dul ar scoil nach Gaeilge ar an scoil náisiúnta agus ní raibh focal Gaeilge dá múineadh sa scoil sin.  Níor fhoghlaimeas focal Gaeilge ar an scoil náisiúnta agus ní raibh eolas agam ach go raibh teanga ann go dtugtaí Gaeilge uirthi.  Béarla agus Béarla amháin a bhí ar siúl ó mhaidin go hoíche nuair a bhíos ag dul ar scoil.  Bhí múinteoir taistil faoi Chonnradh na Gaeilge ag teacht ar scoil agus ag múineadh Gaeilge ar feadh <Col N="422" /> uair a chloig nó mar sin cupla uair sa tseachtain ach, taobh amuigh de sin, ní raibh ar siúl ach an teanga iasachta. Ní mar sin atá an scéal anois.  Gach scoláire atá ag dul ar scoil i láthair na huaire bíonn dhá theanga aige.  Sin mar atá i bhformhór na scoileanna sa tír seo agus sin céim chun cinn.  Na daoine atá dhá-theangach is treise a n-aigne agus a n-eolas agus a gcuid oideachais ná na daoine nach bhfuil acu ach an t-aon teanga amháin.  Féadaim fhéin an méid seo a rá mar ghaell ar na scoláirí i láthair na huaire go bhfuil eolas agamsa orthu, sin iad na scoláirí atá sa dúthaigh go bhfuilimse im chomhnaí ann agus sa chomharsanacht mór-thimpeall, mar gheall ar a n-eolas ar an nGaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tá sé de nós agamsa Gaeilge do labhairt le daoine óga nuair castar orm iad agus tig liom a rá gur féidir le formhór mór an aosa óig a castar ormsa agus go labhraim Gaeilge leo, mé do fhreagairt go fras sa teanga sin.  Sin rud ná féadfaí a rá fiche bliain ó shoin.  Táim sásta go bhfuil céim mhór ar aghaidh déanta againn in aibheochaint na teangan le blianta anuas agus ná fuil le déanamh anois ach an chéim ar aghaidh sin do chur i gcrích.  Ach sin fadhb, a Leas-Chinn Chomhairle, agus obair atá romhainn.</P>
    <P>Brathann an chuid is mó agus an chuid is troime den obair ar na bun-scoileanna agus ar na hoidí atá ag múineadh sna bun-scoileanna sin.  Sin é an fáth go mba mhaith liom go socrófaí ceist an tuarastail go buan. Tá bás nó beatha na Gaeilge&mdash;sin é, bás nó beatha an náisiúin&mdash;ag brath ar na scoileanna agus ar na hoidí scoile.  Tá a fhios agam go maith go bhfuil gleo agus clampar ar siúl ag Cumann na Múinteoirí Náisiúnta mar gheall ar an scéal seo agus go bhfuil sé ar siúl le blianta.  Ní bhíonn comhdháil ó bhliain go chéile ná bíonn an scéal céanna dá chíoradh ann.</P>
    <P>Tá an oiread san cainte ar siúl go gcuirfeadh sé déistean ar dhuine. Molaim don Aire agus don Rialtas aghaidh do thabhairt ar an scéal chomh luath agus is féidir agus é do shocrú go buan agus deireadh do chur leis, ar mhaithe leis an oideachas, ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge agus ar mhaithe leis na hoidí féin.  Nuair a bheidh scéal an tuarastail socraithe, tig leo <Col N="423" /> aghaidh do thabhairt ansan ar obair na scoile, obair na Gaeilge agus obair na tire, mar atá an chuid is mó den obair sin ag brath ar na hoidí scoile.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios agam go maith go bhfuil deacracht sa scéal, gur shocraigh an Rialtas ar chaighdeán áirthe, nuair a thosnaigh an aimsir éigeandála, i gcás dreama áirithe agus nach féidir dul thairis sin.  Chomh luath agus a bheidh deis ag an Rialtas, measaim gur chóir an cheist do láimhseáil agus do shocrú. Measaim mar dhuine amháin go mba cheart dul siar ar an sean-shocrú a deineadh sa bhliain 1920.  Tá fhios agam go maith go mbeidh sé sin an-chostasach. Níl a fhios agam an méid a chosnóidh sé.  Beidh an tAire Airgeadais páirteach sa scéal chomh maith leis an Aire Oideachais agus b'fhéidir go mbeidh níos mó le rá aige síud ar an scéal ná mar a bheidh le rá ag an Aire Oideachais.  B'fhéidir go mbeidh breis dá éileamh ar an bpobal chun an scéal do réiteach ach is fiú é a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Níl a thuilleadh le rá agam i dtaobh an Mheastacháin seo.  Tá súil agam go bhféadfaidh an tAire socrú buan eigin a dhéanamh i dtaobh tuarastal na n-oidí scoile.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasCarter1921" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words about education as I find it and as I hear about it.  We receive from the general community many suggestions for the improvement of education, primary and technical.  I submit that we will have to increase the school-leaving age from 14 to 16 years if we are to get what one might call a finished product or even a half-finished product in the poor man's college.  We who come from the back of the Bill know very well that the old schoolteacher was the man who moulded the youngsters of the country and was always very national in his outlook. We know that at the moment there are young teachers who are working very hard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards children who leave school at 14 years, we cannot expect a terrible lot from them.  They have scarcely any knowledge of agriculture and they have no knowledge of arts, crafts or trades. Trades are going to be the big factor in this country in the immediate future. Trade is the friend of the poor man's <Col N="424" /> child.  We are not taking up technical education in a proper manner.  We are teaching technical subjects, carpentry and other trades, in old boreens throughout the country, in old stables that should be condemned by the county medical officer of health.  We have them in my native place.  I am a member of the committee in my county and I submit that until we get down to hard facts and make technical education compulsory, we will not make much progress.  We should see to it that young lads will learn trades, and we should insist that no boy will be apprenticed to any business unless he receives a certificate from his technical school.  If we do that, we will be getting somewhere.</P>
    <P>I have been speaking to many farmers who are only too anxious that their sons should be absorbed in trades.  The holdings are too small to maintain all the children.  I represent many small farmers.  There might be five or six boys in a family and the only outlet for them is emigration.  We do not like to see them going away and we should do our best to keep them here, because we need young men badly.  We would like to have all these young lads in the near future assisting us in building up our own country, and we will never make much progress in that direction unless these young fellow are properly trained. There are plenty of contractors ready and willing to take on young men.  If they could get young fellows who had experience in a technical school for at least two or three years they would be very glad.</P>
    <P>With regard to the teaching of Irish in the schools, I must say that the teachers and the inspectors are working very hard, but the whole difficulty arises because the youngsters do not speak Irish to any great extent when they come from school.  I seldom hear it spoken by the children coming from school, and I travel a good deal through the country.  I seldom hear young fellow saying &ldquo;Go mbeannuigh Dia dhuit&rdquo; and I do not know why.  I was speaking to a prominent educationist, an inspector of schools who is a neighbour of mine, and he told me they were doing their best to form a society among the <Col N="425" /> youngsters so as to ensure that they would speak only Irish.  Unfortunately, that is not meeting with any great success.  As a matter of fact, if one of the youngsters speaks Irish the others will start laughing at him.  That is one of the things we must put down. Our teachers are doing their best to see that the youngsters will talk as much Irish out of school as they talk while in the school.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out to the Minister that there are many young teachers very badly paid.  The old teachers will naturally ask why they are not being considered.  I say that teachers in general are not sufficiently paid for the work they do.  I might point out that a young man, an assistant teacher, receiving £180 or probably less and living in a country town, is not able to keep himself decently on that sum, nor could he do so even if he had £200.  He has to move about His position demands that he should attend Feiseanna, football matches, and so on, and I am sure that he will drop a few shillings everywhere he goes, if only in subscriptions.  I make this appeal to the Minister, and I think he would be well advised to give kindly consideration to the question of the teachers in general, because they are a very dissatisfied body at the moment.  The worst way we could treat them is to ignore them.  We should meet them and discuss these matters with them.  They have given of their best to the education of the youth of this country.  They are not going behind the door.  They have given and are giving their best to the imparting of knowledge and learning to the youth of this country, and I hope that the Minister will kindly consider all the contributions that have been made to this debate, in general, because I am sure that there is no member of this House who is not really anxious to see that the teachers should be satisfied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with this problem of education I have no doubt at all that the present Minister has had many headaches, since so many complaints&mdash;and justified complaints&mdash; coming to the fore, are probably not <Col N="426" /> within his ambit of approach to the problem.  For instance, many demands are made for the provisions of new schools&mdash;which are quite necessary&mdash; for repairs to existing buildings, for better payment for teachers, and so on, but at the same time the financial problem remains unsolved.  First of all, there is the question of how all these demands are to be financed, and secondly, there is the question of how far are we progressing in the essential matter of giving proper education to our children to fit them for their future callings.</P>
      <P>I shall refer very briefly to the demands, which I consider very justifiable in so far as the State can afford to meet them, for the provision of better schools.  I admit that that demand is rather hackneyed, but in my opinion very considerable outlay is required on the provision of those buildings and a very considerable improvement is also required if the necessary atmosphere is to be created in which the children of this country may imbibe knowledge and be inspired for a better outlook in life.</P>
      <P>As regards the condition of the teachers, the case made by those teachers, undoubtedly, calls for investigation. I accept the fact that, in the most favourable conditions, teachers are comparatively well-to-do, but it is an appalling thing to find that the payment of teachers in this country is so low as not to reach the standard to which the ordinary road-worker or man engaged in turf-cutting can go, and that these men are better paid than the teacher.  That is a poor lead to give to education in this country, and it certainly is not inspiring to the youth of the country.  You cannot hope to see an inspired group of teachers in this country leading the minds of the young people, to whom they are responsible, to great ideals and to noble purposes, unless these teachers and their families are made at least comparatively safe as regards their very existence, and I do not see how they can be expected to do that on a payment of £2 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another irregularity which I find from time to time is concerned with <Col N="427" /> the recognition or, rather, lack of recognition of certain teachers, usually junior assistant teachers, in schools.  I find that there are more than two or three of these teachers, or even a half a dozen, in my own district, who, for some reason or another, have been teaching in schools there for as long as seven years, and who are not recognised by the Department of Education or paid for by the Department of Education.  Nevertheless, their services have been given in these schools, which, I suppose, must be under the Department of Education and, although they have saved the Department expense, in so far as they have not been paid by the Department for their services, I presume that they must have had some qualification for their positions.  If not, I would say that the Department of Education are criminally culpable for allowing people who do not know their duties to continue in the service of educating the children.</P>
    <P>If these people have not proper qualifications, and have passed seven years in such positions, the children must necessarily have suffered severely in so far as these people were not capable of imparting knowledge.  If the Department of Education permit of such service and refuses to pay for it, then somebody should be brought to justice, and to my mind, the Department of Education are primarily responsible for a serious injustice both to the children who have been taught by these people, if they had not proper qualifications, and also, to the teachers for not having paid them their salaries if they had the proper qualifications to impart knowledge to the children.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of education, in general, I think there should be closer co-operation between all the branches of education for which the Department are responsible.  They may not be entirely responsible for some of them, but there should be closer co-operation between all the educational systems in the country.  For instance, if it is a good thing that the State should take responsibility for bearing the full cost of educating our children <Col N="428" /> up to the age of 14 years, then I think they might take responsibility for a longer period.  It is not entirely a question of the amount of book-learning you can impart to the child up to the age of 14 years or during the years in which he or she may subsequently attend technical or secondary schools. It is not the amount of book knowledge that matters, but rather of the extent to which we can bring our knowledge and experience to bear on directing these young people towards the course of life to which they are best adapted.  Our present system of education seems to be chaotic.</P>
    <P>We have through the country parents who can ill afford the expense of paying for their children in secondary schools and universities, and then not infrequently find that their money was not merely wasted but that the young lives they had endeavoured to serve were also wasted.  Surely some scientific method or knowledge should be brought to bear on the children, both in the primary and secondary schools, as to the most suitable courses for them to follow, and in advising their parents accordingly.  If education means anything, I suggest our Department of Education should strive to put itself in a position to be able to advise parents on the end to which the education of their children should be directed.  As it is, they are left without advice, and more or less without any indication as to the purpose to which their children's education should be directed.  I think that closer co-operation could usefully be brought about between our various educational departments.  It is not always the boy or girl who qualifies for a scholarship that proves to be the most useful citizen in after life.  There are more things to be considered than the mere passing of an examination.  There is character, temperament, outlook and adaptability. I think that the sooner the Department get away from this theory of mere book knowledge&mdash;of a good memory for the retention of knowledge of a technical sort&mdash;the better.  That, in itself, should not be the end.  There are other qualities which should be borne in mind.  One is that the average boy or girl at school is usually <Col N="429" /> found to be the most practical citizen in after life.  We should try to adapt our educational system to meet the average mentality of our people rather than aim at specialisation in mere book knowledge, in the ability to retain such knowledge as will produce good results in examination tests.  Our educational system, well intentioned as it is, is not to my mind producing the desired results.  I ask Deputies to consider the comparatively large number of young people that we have attending our secondary schools and universities who have no prospect whatever of getting employment in this country, and, consequently, must emigrate.  In view of that, something should be done to help to direct them to follow useful courses of study, so that later they may be able to take up positions as technicians, or employ themselves in some other useful capacity, at home.</P>
    <P>The spread of the national language is a national problem, and nobody would say that Irish should not be taught.  The Department of Education, however, should take serious note of the fact that after more than 20 years' effort to make the teaching of Irish a compulsory subject in our national schools, Irish, as a spoken language, is more silent in the countryside to-day than it was 25 years ago. Many of us had not the opportunity of learning Irish at school, but while that was so we were at that period enthusiastic about the revial of Irish and voluntarily attended night classes to acquire a knowledge of it.  In those days one heard more Irish spoken than is the case to-day, and that despite the fact that the children of the present day have been taught Irish.  I have no suggestion to make as to how that situation can be remedied.  In my opinion, the results are not commensurate with the amount of money that is being spent on the revival of the language.  I have no doubt that if the Minister and his Department direct their attention to that problem they will probably find a solution for it.  It is one that should be seriously considered, and somehow or other a solution for it should be found.  If it is essential that the children should learn Irish it should also be essential to have the language spoken.  It should <Col N="430" /> not be a medium merely for acquiring a certain amount of knowledge through which a job may be found in the service of the State.  As a layman I am simply putting forward these few points.  I am not an educationist.  I think it is important, however, that the Minister and the Department should get the layman's point of view on this question, and should direct their attention to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite a lot has been said on this Estimate.  In a way, I feel glad that there is a tendency here to break away from a system, portion of which, I suppose, we inherited, and portion of which we developed ourselves.  The real object we should have in view is, unquestionably, the teaching of good citizenship. That, of course, means the teaching of Christianity.  Although the teaching of Christianity is being carried out to a very high degree, I still think that something more remains to be done in the teaching of good citizenship. Unless we do that I do not think that, as a nation, we can properly develop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we have enough nationality around our schools.  I see no indication of a national flag. Neither do I see any sign of a parade before school, and there is no singing of the National Anthem.  The children get a slight smattering of local history. They are taught something of general history, very often a little tainted, containing quite an amount of error.  I think there is a tendency in the Dáil to break away from these things.  The system previously in operation in this country was modelled by Great Britain, a great manufacturing country with huge distribution.  In those days there was an utter neglect of the teaching of subjects relating to agricultural production, cookery and the management of food in the household. During the war they had in that country to make an effort to provide a remedy for the results of that system, although I believe the tin-opener is still in fairly general use there.  Our outlook should be totally different from that of a great manufacturing country. I think that a greater effort should be made in the schools to teach children how to use their hands.  I find that, <Col N="431" /> if a man knows how to use his hands, it changes his character.  It makes him confident and determined.  He knows that there is something he can do.  In my experience over the world, I did not find many people on the dole or utterly down and out who were able to use their hands.  Consequently, that should be oue of the objects of education&mdash;to teach children how to use their hands, and thus give them the courage and confidence which are essential in life.  I am aware that the school programme is fairly full.  I have personal knowledge that the programmes both in the elementary schools and secondary schools are almost overloaded.  They have to do quite a lot of work which has not a very close bearing on life.  Somehow, it gets into the minds of the children and their parents that, if they acquire the knowledge which is imparted to them in the schools, they are certain of a job.  There is hardly any indication in all that teaching that production is fundamental.  I am glad to see that, in the Dáil and in educational circles, there is a tendency to remodel the type of education which we have had up to the present.</P>
    <P>That is a very big task and involves enormous difficulties.  We have established vocational schools, we have a number of secondary schools and I suppose we have a university.  It is a university but, whether it is national or not, I do not know.  Between the people and the university, there are a great many barriers and the only institutions we have for imparting culture are really the secondary schools. I do not think that we have any other institutions to give a cultural outlook to students.  That should receive a great deal of consideration.  The university should be available to all sections of the community.  I understand that its charges are now enormous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out that I have no responsibility for the universities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to give you responsibility.  These are some of the barriers which we want to remove. The secondary schools are really our <Col N="432" /> only vehicles of culture.  The vocational schools have, perhaps, been more successful in the large towns and cities than in the country districts. That is due to transport and other difficulties.  At the same time, there is a great want of uniformity as regards the teachers in the vocational schools.  They come from different branches and have been trained under different conditions.  Consequently, there is no uniformity of method and they cannot impart a culture of the type to which I have referred.  Another handicap from which we suffer in the country districts is that the vocational schools are a long distance from the homes of many children.  Their parents object to their going such long distances and one might say that, in the rural areas, vocational education is hardly available.  Therefore, I am in favour of the suggestion that, in the rural districts, a room or house should be attached to the elementary schools for the purpose of providing vocational training.  The boys could be taught carpentry and agricultural science and the girls could be taught cookery and household duties.  They should be enrolled in those schools just as they finish their period in the national schools or we could raise the age to 16 and have the last couple of years devoted to the teaching of these very essential subjects.</P>
      <P>That would be teaching pupils how to use their hands.  If they had to emigrate, as I said before, they could leave with the knowledge that they were able to do something besides sweep the streets.  But that training would prevent emigration because it would give these young people the necessary courage and character to enter upon some form of production here.  I am quite sure that the Minister knows as well as most of us that it is only by production we can eventually subsist.  It is only by increased production we can get jobs.  Therefore, this matter should receive a good deal of attention from the Minister and the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the teaching of Irish, I have heard a few Deputies say that no great progress has been made.  Perhaps that is the case in some counties, but I must candidly say that, in <Col N="433" /> County Meath, the progress that has been made is surprising.  I think that we should be honest about this matter. It is an extremely difficult thing to revive a language.  People who had to learn other languages in foreign countries appreciate the difficulties and the advances made in the teaching of Irish often surprise them.  I do not know a great deal about the question of the teachers' salaries but I have met young teachers, well trained, who, I was informed, had lower salaries than that of a road worker. That should not be the case.  They should get something better than that and they should be given a chance of standing up amongst the community. There is nothing more demoralising than inability to keep your head above water.  That section of teachers, at any rate, should receive consideration. So far as I know, there is a big difference between the other teachers, too. Many of them are quite well off but many of them are not well off.  The salary does not seem to be in any way uniform.  I think that we should try to improve the salaries of the lowly-paid teachers.  They have to work extremely hard and they have quite a lot to do.  If we want them to assist us in swerving, or changing, from one form of education to another to suit the needs of the country, it will be a big task.  We should try to give them every encouragement, because a sound, national education is fundamental to the future of the country.  The teachers should be made content. Perhaps what they are allowed might be sufficient to bring that state of affairs about.</P>
    <P>The Minister should know a good deal about that.  I am merely dealing with odd cases which I came across, and it is my opinion that, in those few cases, young teachers have barely sufficient to keep body and soul together.  That is a pity, because most of these young people are brilliant. They could have a great future and they could give the greatest possible assistance to the country.  It is education that this country wants, but education along the right lines.  If our people have that, they will be able to fight the battle of life and, if they have to go abroad, they will do so with the <Col N="434" /> knowledge that they can use what God gave them&mdash;their hands and their heads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the suggestion that the Minister should now recognise that the position arising out of the discontent of teachers with their present salaries is assuming very serious dimensions.  The Minister does not need to be told from this or any other quarter of the House that there are discontented teachers.  There is no doubt whatever that that discontent is very manifest all over the country and that it represents a very unsatisfactory position from the point of view of education generally.  A new situation has arisen with the passage into law of the Education Act in Great Britain.  That has resulted in most attractive offers being made to teachers to take up employment there. I know that quite a number of teachers from this country have gone to Great Britain in recent months.  Very attractive possibilities are held out to them to take up work in the educational sphere in Great Britain.  I think the Minister should recognise that if that condition grows it will represent a very unsatisfactory position for educational authorities in this country. Teachers have been trained here to perform their duties in their own country and their services are being given outside the country.  They are going because attractive working conditions have been offered to them.  I think the bulk of the teachers, like other sections of the people who leave the country, would be quite content to accept considerably more modest conditions at home if there was any assurance of such conditions being avail able.  I think the Minister must recognise that a new situation has arisen in which whatever barriers divide the policy of his Department from the reasonable demands of the teachers will have to be removed and removed quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that a very proper note has been struck in the course of the debate by the suggestion that more should be done towards pointing the road to children towards a subsequent career when their education is finished.  Unfortunately, <Col N="435" /> one of the problems with which we have to deal is that not alone are there comparatively few opportunities for children who are educated, but that a great many children very often, almost at the end of their school career, seem quite undecided as to the particular type of career they would like to undertake. I am aware of the fact that a good many educationists and people connected with schools do a great deal individually to put pupils on the right road towards earning a livelihood, but I think some sort of national policy in that respect for the purpose of providing children with the opportunities for which they seem to be suited and adapted would be a tremendous step forward.</P>
    <P>I have already expressed, in this House and outside, my views in regard to the present vocational system in this country.  I grant that where vocational schools work close to centres of industry there is a reasonable prospect for the pupils, but I think that certainly a policy of having, say, in remote areas, commercial classes where girls are taught typewriting, shorthand and kindred subjects and as a result of which they are offered such attractive terms as 10/- or 15/- per week when they are qualified, is simply a waste of public money.  I should like to see some revision of policy in that respect that would relate the particular subjects under instruction to reasonable opportunities for the pupils.  Where they are near industrial centres a good many opportunities arise but, in fact, the position in the rural areas is to a large extent unsatisfactory. No amount of official explanation or of inspectorial statements on this matter will remove what is an obvious source of dissatisfaction to people who know exactly what is happening.</P>
    <P>With regard to school buildings, I think the Minister does not need to be impressed with the great need there is, now that the emergency is likely to terminate in a short time, for wiping out as far as possible the eye-sores that still masquerade as schools in certain areas.  Here and there buildings have been condemned for many <Col N="436" /> years and, while no one in any part of the House would expect miracles to be achieved overnight, a more extended programme in that direction is certainly called for in this country.</P>
    <P>Let me also refer, because I want to touch only on a few points, to the problem of another section of children under the care of the Minister, namely, children in industrial schools.  I have very grave doubts about many aspects of that system also.  I should certainly like to impress upon the Minister one view that I think should be present to his mind, if he is not familiar with it already, and that is, that some effort should be made to keep in touch with boys and girls&mdash;boys particularly, because I have come across a number of these cases&mdash;after they leave these institutions. They very often drift into conditions of employment, or even of unemployment, that are extremely bad for them.  I think there should be some kind of liaison arrangement between these industrial schools, through the Department officially, and the boys, afterwards.  Generally their lot is unhappy enough because many of them start under a very considerable handicap.  Where they can be advised and helped and where the need for protection does arise&mdash;it does arise in a number of cases&mdash;I think it would be a fine Christian gesture for the Department of Education, through the schools, to maintain that connection with them to see that they get the most adequate assistance that they can in circumstances that are usually very difficult for them in after life.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that in recent years there seems to be a very great extension of secondary school facilities in the rural areas.  It is a matter of very considerable importance for parents and children generally, especially for parents who are unable, by reason of their circumstances, to send children long distances to secondary schools in the cities and larger provincial towns. The fact that schools of that kind have been set up through the enterprise of individual teachers, with the co-operation of the Church authorities and the Department of Education, is quite a healthy sign, but I think we could do with even a wider development in that respect.  For the purpose of providing better schools for secondary education, <Col N="437" /> there are numbers of public buildings throughout the country, not always in use, that could serve in that connection if that system were developed. What has happened in that direction recently has afforded opportunities to children who would never have got such facilities.  They are appreciated by many parents who have availed of them.  A good deal has been said about the overloading of the programme. That, of course, is quite true, and presents difficulties when Deputies are asked to make suggestions.</P>
    <P>One thing very urgently needed is some effort to inculcate a better spirit of discipline in many children, more respect for public property, more respect for superiors, as well as a better exhibition of courtesy and politeness generally.  The bulk of Irish children are naturally polite, but one is rather appalled at the damage done to public property in many places in recent years, and the growth of a spirit of carelessness, or lack of interest in what ought to be a matter of importance, on the part of a good many children.  Anybody, who realises the importance of home training knows that parents have a special responsibility in that respect.  I appreciate that teachers generally do their utmost for their pupils, but more attention must be given to present-day tendencies.  If example is not given in the homes, something must be done in the schools to afford teachers the opportunity of impressing on young minds the need for the creation of a better civic spirit generally as regards property and behaviour.</P>
    <P>I do not think that I ought to close without expressing, after 20 years' experience, appreciation of the manner in which public representatives are met in the Department.  I always got the greatest courtesy there, every possible attention, and the most complete cooperation in matters on which I made representations, even when, as a public representative, I was not always fortified with details of questions under consideration.  Speaking from many years' experience, I think it is due to say that of this Department.</P>
    <P>I think that is the general view, from <Col N="438" /> contact with officials of the Department of Education, and I should like to take this opportunity to express the gratitude I feel for the very worthy and hard-working officials of that Department, in the course of public work, during which one has to ask harassing questions about different matters that arise.  It is a pleasure to be associated with the officials of the Department, and I think the Minister, who has intimate knowledge of the working of the Department, must be aware of the great attention and courtesy extended to the public by his officials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had rather a long discussion and some very good speeches, but on the other hand we have had some which have not greatly enlightened us-Listening to them one would ponder, that it is rather strange that those persons who, I take it, normally would be extremely careful to avoid dogmatising too much about matters about which they cannot have deep knowledge, are so prone to feel themselves quite free to criticise in very general and condemnatory terms when dealing with education.  The only explanation one can think of is that it seems to have grown to be the custom, because a person has had the advantage generally of being at school, that he considers himself to be an expert on education, and in a position to hold forth at great length on the contents of the curricula, the deficiencies of the system and so on.  It would be really as logical and as reasonable for a man who was able to distinguish between the different crops to hold himself up as an expert in agriculture. As to the criticism we have had this year, while I welcome it in the sense that some effort has been made to deal with general principles, on the other hand we have had condemnatory statements for which there was very little foundation.  In general, there has been an improvement in the discussion, and if Deputies would occasionally, as I did when I was in Opposition, read what had been said before on the subject in recent years, it would, at least, save an amount of valuable time, not least the time of the Minister, because we have the same <Col N="439" /> topics brought up year after year, and it would be quite impossible for me, unless I occupied the time of the House for three or four hours, to deal with them in the way I would wish.  It would be better if, as has been the case in a general discussion on Government policy, we could adhere to a few main points, let us say, technical education, the apprenticeship system, the school-leaving age or teachers' remuneration; to pick out one or two main topics for discussion, and to try in that way to get a really valuable discussion, rather than wandering over a great many problems, bringing in very small points that are of purely local significance, and that cannot be regarded as of importance, if we are to discuss general principles.</P>
      <P>The criticism this year has followed the tradition that would seem to me to be in existence since this country began to have an educational system at all.  I think it would be true to say that there has been hardly any period, certainly not any lengthy period, in which there have not been people ready to affirm that the standard of primary education and the educational system generally are in the greatest need of overhauling.  Facile, general statements of that kind are hard to combat, particularly when the evidence is left so much in the air.  I think one has a right to ask, what is the evidence which inspires these criticisms? I am pretty certain that it is not of a character that will stand up to careful sifting and cross-examination, that it is not the type of evidence one would expect from responsible persons who have a good if not a thorough acquaintance with the work of the schools, who have come to their judgment after carefully considering their opinions and who have the necessary knowledge, skill and training to enable us to accept them as critics of value if the real work of the schools is to be assessed and if we are to be enabled to say definitely whether we are in fact making progress or not.</P>

      <P>The Deputy spoke of a famine in ideas in my Department and of dark recesses in Marlborough Street and perhaps there might be some people who would conclude from his remarks that there is something secret and subterranean going on in the Department of Education.  Of course, that is not so.  Everyone knows that all the proceedings and all the affairs of the Department of Education are open to public criticism and public discussion in the Dáil.  In so far as there is anything tangible in the criticism I have been listening to, it seems to be this, that there have been suggestions by Deputies, chiefly on the Front Bench of the main Opposition Party, that the complaints by parents and others that there has been a decline in the standard of education have been more numerous than they were formerly and that that is due, according to some Deputies, at any rate, to the injurious effect of the Irish language and of teaching through that language; while, according to others, it is due to the inefficiency of the Department of Education.  The allegation that there has been a decline in standard is based almost entirely on the alleged prevalence of these complaints. One would expect, therefore, that these complaints or complaints similar to them were not made at a former time, or that they were not as numerous, but if we look back upon the history of the system, we shall find that such complaints have been common for the last 40 years or longer, not alone here but in other countries, and also that they were more frequent and, in my judgement, based on better authority some years ago than they are at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="441" /> Let us, for example, take the following quotation:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Too many candidates were utterly illiterate and failed to get 10 per cent. on the whole paper.  The worst candidates could hardly spell at all and there were few who made no slip.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That quotation is taken from the published report of the examiners in English for the Junior Grade Intermediate for the year 1921.  It refers to the knowledge of English possessed by candidates who had completed the primary school course and had spent at least one year in secondary schools, so that it can hardly be alleged that the Irish language was to blame in any way for the low standard of education of the candidates mentioned.</P>
    <P>If we read the official reports on educational matters in England, will we be able to say that the authorities there are quite satisfied with the teaching of English?  Is it not a very notable fact that one of the most important reports issued there in recent years dwelt particularly on the importance of giving more attention to the teaching of English and, in fact, recommended that every teacher in the school should regard himself as a teacher of the mother tongue as well as a teacher of his particular subject if a proper standard and if the ideas and wishes of that particular commission were to be carried into effect?</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to complaints regarding the backward standard of education of pupils coming from primary schools into vocational schools.  We have had complaints of that kind for a very long time.  I find that so far back as 1905, at the Annual Congress of the Irish Technical Instruction Association, Father Dowling, C.M., stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have often gone round the young fellows and asked them to attend technical schools, and the answer they have given me is: &lsquo;Father, I did not learn sufficient to take it up&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Fletcher, the representative of the former Department of Technical Instruction, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Our work in the evening contiuuation <Col N="442" /> schools cannot by any means achieve any full measure of success until students coming there are better prepared than at present. I know that all who have experience of the work in the technical schools feel this difficulty acutely.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. P.T. Daly, a Dublin representative, stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I agree with Father Dowling that we have many of our children who have not sufficient education to fit them to go into technical schools.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Similar complaints to those I have quoted have been made regularly by persons connected with vocational and technical schools but, I suggest, they are less frequent in recent years than they were formerly and I think that we may attribute them partly to a certain, perhaps understandable, desire which vocational teachers may have to emphasise the difficulty of their work and partly, no doubt, to the fact that there is frequently an absence of uniformity in the standard of education of pupils on their admission to vocational schools.  There is always a minority who, through lack of ability or some other cause, are more backward than others, and it is the existence of this minority that is responsible for the complaints about which we hear so much.</P>
    <P>Deputy Butler brought out the very important point that in looking back on successful students in the past, it will be found that they remained for a longer time at school than is normally the case now.  While it is true that one of the great features of our education since the School Attendance Act was passed is that the higher classes generally have filled up and that the pupils remain on to continue their education until they complete it at 14 years of age, nevertheless, as has been stated, a very large percentage leave at that period.  When we think of what happened during our childhood days, particularly those who went to very good rural national schools, which were special academies, which had a special reputation in their areas for the preparation of candidates for the British Civil Service, we think of <Col N="443" /> the very specially talented students who went through these schools and who, as Deputy Butler has pointed out, were working by themselves, with some little attention from the master, in the 7th and 8th standards, and who continued at school, perhaps up to the age of 17 years.</P>
    <P>In regard to the criticism that is now made that our standard of primary education has fallen, there is nothing equivocal about the evidence in disproof of this which the Department of Education can offer.  In the first place, there is the large body of efficient and highly efficient teachers working diligently day in and day out in our schools throughout the country.  The assertion that the standard is low&mdash;&ldquo;shockingly low&rdquo;, I think, was the verdict&mdash;is a direct indictment of those teachers; it accuses them quite plainly and directly of not carrying out their duty faithfully and conscientiously, and I suggest that it is difficult to reconcile that accusation with the alleged sympathy with their claims which we have heard so much about in this debate.  If the standard all round is shockingly low, then our teachers cannot be efficient, not to speak of highly efficient.  Every member of the Dáil, I suggest, is in a position himself to judge whether or not the teachers are inefficient and whether or not they are doing their duty as conscientious public servants.</P>
    <P>Let us take the results of the primary certificate examination.  Close on 50,000 candidates were presented for that examination and the percentage of passes has been over 70 for the past two years.  This examination is set and conducted by skilled and trained personnel whose work in life is education, and surely their verdict is more reliable than that of individuals here and there who have no particular educational skill or training, whose experience of educational standards is necessarily narrow and who are, in the main, generalising from particular cases.  Again, there are the reports of our inspectors, the evidence of men and women who have been themselves teachers, and who have had long experience of and special training in the <Col N="444" /> assessment of school work.  Our inspectors are not amateurs; they have no thesis to prove; they report what they find in the schools&mdash;not what would be favourable or unfavourable to this or that preconceived estimate&mdash; and their verdict is that, as regards trained and skilful teaching and success in directing that teaching power towards the development of the intelligence of the pupils, our present system is far superior to anything that preceded it.</P>
    <P>I do not, of course, deny that individual pupils may be found who have not reached a satisfactory standard. No system could lay claim to a 100 per cent success, but I do claim that pupils of normal intelligence, who attend school regularly and devote themselves with reasonable attention and diligence to the instruction given and the exercises prescribed for them, are given as good an opportunity now as was given such pupils at any time. When you consider the distractions to which children in the cities in particular are accustomed, and the plethora of amusements that are provided for them, and when you consider that in such a large part of our country in so many counties the daily attendance represents an absence from the schools of roughly one-fifth of the school-going population, I think that, on the whole, the results can be claimed to be satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the problem of mentally defective children. That is a very difficult question, which is being examined.  There is the whole problem of how to devise a system and procedure for the ascertainment of mental deficiency.  I trust that, in due course, where provision cannot satisfactorily be made in our ordinary national schools, special provision will be made for those children.  There are individual pupils here and there who fail to benefit because their intelligence is below the normal standard. There is certainly, in the opinion of medical experts, a small percentage&mdash; it may be 2 per cent; it may be less than 2 per cent.; it may be more than 2 per cent.; let us for the moment say 2 per cent.&mdash;of children who might be described as being sub-normal.  If we subject these children to the same <Col N="445" /> tests as we apply to ordinary, normal children, then of course the results will be most disappointing.  The fact is that these backward or retarded or defective children may be a year or two years or three years, or perhaps more than three years, behind children of the same real age, so far as mental attainments and achievements are concerned. Their mental age may be up to three years lower than that of their classmates.</P>
    <P>It frequently happens also that young persons are subjected to some kind of an educational test when they are seeking employment and long after they have finished their primary school course.  These will naturally have become rusty in the interval, and have forgotten much of what they learned at school.  But instead of making allowance for the rustiness and unreadiness consequent on the long interval since school days, the critics jump to the conclusion that the explanation is that those persons were not properly taught when at school. If a boy or a girl who has left school at 14 or 15 years of age is put through a test of that kind at 18 or 19 years, or even at 17 years, it may not be at all a fair test of the work the young person did at school.  I fear it is on cases such as those I have mentioned that criticism is usually based.</P>
    <P>I think I may assure the Dáil and the public that there is no real foundation for the gloomy picture of our educational system and standards which has been painted here.  The young people of this country are as well equipped educationally as the young people of any country with which we have been able to make a comparison.  Our experience of refugee children in our schools affords proof of the truth of this statement.  Clearly, conclusions drawn from such very exceptional cases, and which purport to form judgments upon the efficiency of our educational system as a whole, are unwarranted and likely to present an entirely false picture of the work of our schools.  There would certainly be much less danger of error if we were to select the cases of those who have done well rather than those who have done badly in tests for employment and to argue that their success is proof <Col N="446" /> of the efficiency of the work in the schools.  There are, I am quite certain, enough such cases to warrant our drawing conclusion the direct opposite of those we have had to listen to, and I should be greatly surprised if the more favourable conclusions had not more solid, informed, and responsible opinion behind them than the unfavourable conclusions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon was at some pains to depict what he considers the miserable plight of the children in the infants' classes.  His picture is as remote from the correct situation as that of Deputy Mulcahy.  When a child begins school here it is not, as Deputy Dillon would have us to believe, a case of a young imp of mischief going amongst other and perhaps greater imps of mischief, and the whole class in the charge of an unsympathetic or tyrannical teacher. Anyone who has taken the trouble to visit any of our infant schools knows that there could be no greater misrepresentation of the true state of affairs.  In fact, what happens is that the beginner finds himself or herself a member of a happy little community supplied with all the material necessary to keep them occupied and interested, and presided over by a teacher sympathetic and patient, and with the skill and equipment necessary to impart the training appropriate to their age and in accord with their interests.</P>
    <P>The regulation that infants are to be taught through Irish in every case where the teacher is capable of doing so is based on the sound maxim that, if young people are to acquire the language, the sooner they begin the better.  It must always be remembered that the time infants spend at school each day is only a very small fraction of their waking hours&mdash;not one-third, probably&mdash;and if they are ever to have a real foundation in Irish they must hear it and use it as much as possible in that short daily interval. A Welsh educational writer has said that a kindly Providence has endowed the young child with an exceptional gift for acquiring a strange language, to meet its more immediate needs, in a very short time.  The case which Deputy Butler cited of the <Col N="447" /> Italian children, if not completely satisfying, is at any rate sufficient to show that where the atmosphere is thoroughly Irish, where nothing but Irish is spoken and the infant hears only Irish, he is likely, the adaptability of young children and their power of imitation being so great, to acquire the language, at least in my belief, better than under any other system.  If the present procedure is to be blamed, I would suggest that parents have some share of responsibility.</P>
    <P>I venture to say that, if there are schools where the infant classes under competent teachers are not giving the results we would wish, the parents are somewhat to blame.  We know that the children of Italians or others who wish to learn English or another language <Col N="448" /> learn it because they receive the necessary encouragement at home.  I am quite certain that if our children received the same encouragement from their parents, if they were encouraged with the vocabulary and the words that are necessary at the beginning, they would soon make very rapid progress. If the position is that they will be hearing and using English during the other two-thirds or more of their daily lives, there is no fear but that they will have a good knowledge of that language.  I beg to move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; the Committee to sit again.</P>
