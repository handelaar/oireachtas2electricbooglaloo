    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not proposed to modify the restrictions on the use of hackney vehicles for attendance at sports fixtures and, accordingly, facilities cannot be granted to greyhound owners for the purpose of conveying their dogs to racing tracks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a great hardship and the Minister should consider allowing some mode of conveyance in areas where there is a certain number of dogs.  They will not be taken in buses; there are no train facilities.  In my area an application was made for a permit to take dogs to the train for one evening per month, to have them taken to a greyhound racing track 30 miles away.  The application was refused.  I ask the Minister to reconsider matters of this kind and to give an opportunity to an industry that is important to the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Are not horses being brought to race tracks in motor-driven horse-boxes?  If that concession can be made to horse racing, why cannot some similar concession be made to greyhound racing which in certain <Col N="4" /> parts of the country and amongst certain elements of our community is just as important as horse racing?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But is not it true that petrol-driven horse-boxes are provided to bring horses to racecourses?  If it is possible for the Department to give that concession to persons owning horses, why is it that the owner of greyhounds, who is not usually as large a person as the person who owns a horse, is denied a similar privilege?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware that many persons have largely increased their fruit crops and that these supplies will go to waste if the growers are unable to utilise them in making jam; and, if so, if he will state if any allowance of sugar for jam making will be made to people who have grown their own fruit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information as to the extent to which individual growers of fruit may have increased their crops this year.  Adequate supplies of sugar were made available to jam manufacturers during last season to enable them to take up the maximum amount of fruit possible from producers and I hope to be able to make reasonable supplies available to them again this year.  It is not proposed to make any special allowance of sugar available to fruit growers for domestic jam making.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not referring to jam manufacturers.  I am referring to those people who grow fruit to a small extent.  The farmer who produces sugar beet gets paid for the sugar beet and gets an allowance of sugar.  The person who grows fruit <Col N="6" /> has his fruit stolen and gets no allowance of sugar for jam making.  Is it any wonder, then, that the fruit supply is about one quarter of what it ought to be?</P>

Surely something should be done to ease the situation?  People who have been standing in a queue for an hour are not sure of getting a seat, and many of them are business people who have to get away.

At that meeting a communication was received by the urban district council from the Kerry County Council in which it was intimated that the possibility of utilising the buildings referred to for the accommodation of persons living in condemned houses had been investigated but that the buildings were in a dangerous condition and unfit for housing.  As regards the latter part of the question the Tralee Urban District Council have carried out a good deal of site development of future housing schemes, and it has been intimated to the council that favourable consideration will be given to a proposal to proceed with the erection of houses thereon.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will cause inquiries to be made into the number of &ldquo;notices to quit&rdquo;<Col N="10" /> served on tenants of Dublin Corporation cottages and flats in the two years ended 31st December, 1944; and if he will make representations that these be withdrawn, where the failure to pay the rent can be proved to be due to the breadwinner being unemployed or a patient in a hospital or sanatorium, or where death has left a widow and family to exist on widows' and orphans' pensions, which do not include a rent allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has been a member of the Dublin Corporation for very many years and has been several times Lord Mayor.  He must be aware, therefore, of his responsibilities in this matter, which is one for the corporation alone.  He knows that it is not my place to make such representations as he suggests.  Accordingly I do not propose, at the behest of the Deputy, to arrogate to myself that function, particularly as I believe that, if it suited his purpose, he would be among the first to cry out against any such unwarranted interference on my part.  I may say, moreover, that I am satisfied that the corporation in collecting its rents acts with due consideration for the circumstances of its tenants and is never unreasonable in its attitude towards them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister look at the last line of the question, which draws attention to the fact that when a tenant dies, and the widow and family are left on widows' and orphans' pensions of 24/- or 25/-, they are not able to pay 12/6 for a cottage, and will he see that the eviction notices are withdrawn in such cases?  I cannot give orders.  The managerial mind is passed along into heads of departments, and they are afraid of the local government auditor, who insists on collection of the rent, whether the tenants have the money or not.  I want to stop the evictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reason whatever to believe that the corporation acts unreasonably in relation to tenants who are in arrears with their rents.  On the contrary, they act with the utmost consideration.  There are 5,000 tenants in arrear, and of that <Col N="11" /> number active proceedings have been taken against only 31.  The Deputy knows the circumstances; he knows his responsibility; he knows that those houses are the property of the Dublin Corporation; he knows that he can bring about effective pressure to secure that nothing harsh or unjust is done in relation to this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>The basis of the remuneration of teachers of national schools differs widely from that of civil servants.  The remuneration of the latter consists of two portions, a fixed scale of salary and an addition by way of bonus in respect of the increase in the cost of living since July, 1914.  The amount payable in respect of bonus varies, except in so far as the Civil Service (Stabilisation of Bonus) Regulations, 1940 to 1944, apply, with the alterations in the cost-of-living index figure. <Col N="13" /> The salary scales for teachers in national schools are not related to a cost-of-living index and the rates of salary at which they were paid on the 1st September, 1939, cannot, therefore, be regarded as the equivalent on that particular date of a basic salary with the addition of a bonus to represent the appropriate cost-of-living figure.  In the circumstances, it is not possible to adjust their rates of salary on the 1st September, 1939, to the increases which would have been payable to civil servants in respect of the cost-of-living variations between that date and the 31st March, 1945, had the stabilisation regulations not been operative, or to calculate the amount of extra money referred to in the question.</P>
      <P>As regards the latter part of the question, which refers to employees of vocational education committees whose salaries include a cost-of-living bonus, it has not been possible, in the time available since the question was received, to calculate what the extra cost would be if the bonus payable to these employees had not been stabilised.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ministers for Finance all over the world have in the last five years been creating new records in the matter of State expenditure, supporting this by taxation and <Col N="18" /> borrowing at unprecedented levels. Belligerent and non-belligerent countries alike have been affected, and as the European war closes I can only hope that it will usher in a period when the unparalleled calls on our Exchequer and on our taxpayers will come to an end.  During the last five difficult years we have, I submit, handled our financial affairs in a way that though it called for sacrifice, did not impose unnecessary hardship. While expenditure could not be curtailed and had, indeed, to be allowed to expand in many directions, I attempted in meeting it to steer a middle course between austerity and prodigality.  I tried to restrain the inflationary forces that get loose in every war, even among the nations not directly participating.</P>
      <P Just="Center">
        <i>Restraints on inflation.</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inflation can be almost as great a disaster as war itself.  It destroys the economic fabric of society and creates a series of strains and stresses that have their outcome frequently in revolutionary violence.  Our efforts to check it by high taxation, rationing, control of prices, dividends, wages and other remuneration, and the absorption of savings were not entirely successful. But I submit that in the absence of such remedial measures the situation would have got completely out of hand, with painful results to all sections, but most of all to wage-earners and the lower income groups.  While exercising these restraints, we have not hesitated to make use of State credit freely when the occasion demanded.  From 1st April, 1939, to 31st March, 1945, the difference between Exchequer issues for Central Fund and Supply Services and Exchequer tax and non-tax revenue amounted to £15,675,000 which had to be financed altogether by borrowing.  Various other payments falling to be made from the Exchequer brought this total up to £16,800,000, a not inconsiderable figure in relation to our obligations.  The gross liabilities of the State as at 31st March last (including liability for housing and land bonds) exceeded £93,000,000.  In addition to these there are State guarantees of various kinds <Col N="19" /> running into many millions to which I will refer later in detail.</P>
    <P>The expenditure as measured by Central Fund and Supply Services has risen from an actual figure of £33,110,000 for 1938/39 to an estimated figure of £52,367,000 for the current financial year, an increase of 58 per cent.  In the same period net expenditure by local authorities from revenue, less amounts derived from Government sources, has risen from £7,464,000 to an estimated figure of £9,600,000 for the current year, an increase of 28 per cent.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Economic Background.</i>
    </P>
    <P>The concomitant increase in taxation must be considered against the general economic background.  Between 1938/ 39 and 1943/44 (the latest period for which statistics are available) the gross output of agriculture rose in value by 79 per cent. while the value of net output of agriculture (or the value added to the materials by the agricultural process) increased considerably more&mdash;by 103 per cent.&mdash;because of the decline in the volume and value of materials.  This increase in the net value of output of agriculture was due principally to a marked increase in agricultural prices&mdash;which have nearly doubled since the outbreak of war.  On the other hand, the gross volume of agricultural output declined by 11 per cent. in the same period. Between 1938/39 and 1943 the value of net output of industry increased from £35,546,000 to £41,212,000, or by 16 per cent., but the volume declined by 24 per cent.  Building, the principal nonagricultural industry in this as in other countries, was operating in 1943 at only one-third of its pre-war volume. The value of the combined net output of agriculture and industry increased by 64 per cent. between 1938/39 and 1943/44.</P>
    <P>As regards our external trade, the value of imports in 1944 declined by 32 per cent. and the volume by 70 per cent. as compared with 1938.  In the same period the value of exports increased by 22 per cent., but the volume declined by 44 per cent.  Despite the numerous obstacles in the way of trade visible imports since the beginning of <Col N="20" /> the war had up to the 31st March last exceeded visible exports by some £16,000,000 in value.</P>
    <P>These various economic indices do not all point in the same direction. The general picture is that, since pre-war, wholesale prices have doubled and the quantum of goods available for consumption has declined by about one-fifth.  There is, unfortunately, no prospect of an early substantial improvement in the supplies position since, with war-torn nations as our competitors, we shall not be specially privileged to obtain materials, though there should be ample demand for our products.  Vigilant care by all countries will be required in the immediate postwar period lest in the scramble for goods the price situation, under fairly satisfactory control so far, should get out of hand.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to draw from the available statistics any hard and fast conclusion as to whether our expenditure in general and particularly our taxation have outstripped the economic capacity of the country to bear them. Judging by the pressure to which the Minister for Finance is subjected from many quarters to reduce taxation, the shoe pinches in more than one place, so far without causing actual lameness. On a general survey I am satisfied that, apart from exceptional cases, the burden has not been disproportionate to the economic strength of those called upon to bear it.  In the urban areas the high cost of living has affected the population to an extent not felt in the rural, while taxation pressure has also been more severe in the former.  Fortunately, the cost-of-living index showed no further rise during the year, the figure of 296 (base, July, 1914=100) being returned in both February and November, 1944. It has, indeed, fallen slightly since. The agricultural price index (base, September, 1938, to August, 1939=100) showed a downward trend during the year, falling from 198 in January to 187 in December, 1944, and recovering to 194 in March, 1945.  The high level of agricultural prices is, of course, the incentive held out to the farmers to maintain or increase production, and considering the variety of obstacles with which they have had to contend, <Col N="21" /> they have risen to the occasion in these critical years.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Revenue and Expenditure.</i> 1944-45.</P>
    <P>Despite the standstill character of the two previous Budgets, the yield of tax revenue continues to expand, thus confounding the pessimists, who were to be found everywhere.  The aggregate of tax and non-tax revenue at £46,175,000 in 1944-45 was £395,000 in excess of the Budget estimate and £2,395,000 in excess of the yield of the previous year.  Expenditure, though high, was below the anticipated level, with the result that the deficit for 1944-45 worked out at approximately one-half of the anticipated figure.</P>
    <P>A few words as to the yield of various duties may not be out of place. In the forefront, property and income-tax, including surtax, at £12,517,000 was well over £1,000,000 in excess of the previous year.  In 1938-39 the yield of these duties was £5,803,000, so that the direct taxpayer has increased his contribution under this head by 116 per cent. since pre-war.  The other main direct tax&mdash;corporation profits tax&mdash;yielded £4,042,000 as against £3,781,000 in the previous year.  The yield here has grown seven-fold since 1938-39.  There have been substantial increases in the duties mentioned and it should be our first task, on the passing of the emergency, to see that expenditure is reduced and to accord to the direct taxpayer some relief from his heavy burden.  There is no doubt that the present high rates of taxation on both personal and company income operate as a deterrent to individual effort and as a drag on industrial and commercial enterprise.  It may still be important at present to restrict personal spending power and at the same time to remove obstacles to business revival and expansion.  While rationing of so many commodities continues and while imports are so limited and home production is curtailed by shortage of materials, release of additional purchasing power may have a certain inflationary effect, but it should be one of our prime objectives to lessen the burden on the sources of production and employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="22" /> The reactions of high rates of indirect taxation are, of course, also felt throughout the national economy, but not to the same extent.  While some of the indirect taxes have an influence on the cost of living many can be avoided by abstinence or restraint.  Of these indirect taxes tobacco duty continues to soar and now approaches the £9,500,000 mark.  The excise duty on beer advanced by £230,000 and on spirits by £199,000 in the last year. Betting and entertainments duty between them yielded £100,000 more at £789,000.  Estates duties and stamps also showed a welcome expansion, while the Post Office registered additional receipts of £100,000.</P>
    <P>Not all movements have been favourable to us.  There has been a virtual cessation of beer imports since June, 1944, while clearances of imported spirits and sugar have fallen considerably. In the aggregate customs revenue was £312,000 below anticipations.</P>
    <P>The income from motor vehicle duties, which falls into the Road Fund, suffered less from petrol restrictions than was expected, the yield at £621,000 being in excess of anticipation.</P>
    <P>Deputies will see from Table I of the tables circulated to-day that the realised deficit in the national accounts for the 12 months to 31st March last was £1,749,000 as compared with £3,375,000 anticipated. Even at this reduced figure it was nearly £1,250,000 more than in the preceding year, and this despite a big increase in the yield from taxation. There continues to be heavy expenditure on the Army and defence services associated with it.  Exchequer issues for Army purposes in the year just closed were £8,147,000 as compared with £8,189,000 in the preceding year. In the last complete year of peace&mdash; to 31st March, 1939&mdash;Army issues were only £1,766,000,. so that they have increased nearly 4½ times.</P>
    <P>The over-all expenditure, like the over-all revenue, thus reached new heights and the task of the Finance Minister must be to secure a reduction in the former before he can, with any <Col N="23" /> confidence, set about reducing the latter.</P>
    <P>Table II compares Exchequer issues for supply services in the years 1943-44 and 1944-45.  The services on which issues were greater in 1944-45, or were unchanged, are set out in the first part of the table, followed by the services on which issues were less.  In all cases the principal causes of any major variations are stated.</P>

      <i>National Indebtedness.</i>
    </P>
    <P>In Table III, showing the capital liabilities of the State at 31st March, 1945, there is an increase in liabilities of £919,000 and a decline in assets of £512,000, the aggregate of the former at 31st March last being £83,731,000 and of the latter, £36,501,000.  The estimated capital value of the State liability for Exchequer contributions payable under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932, towards the annual loan charges of local authorities on account of moneys borrowed for housing amounted to £9,351,000, making a gross total of £93,082,000 for the liabilities of the State.</P>
    <P>On 31st March, 1944, the gross indebtedness of local authorities amounted to £37,500,000 approximately. After allowing for the value of State contributions towards housing and for certain electricity and technical instruction loans, the net debt outstanding was £24,356,000.  If we assume an increase of £800,000 in the liabilities of local authorities in the last 12 months, the aggregate gross liabilities of the State and local bodies at 31st March of this year may be put at £131,382,000, an amount which is offset by the assets referred to.</P>
    <P>The liability to depositors in the Post Office Savings Bank and to trustee savings banks amounted on 31st March last to £31,199,000.  This figure, which includes £3,434,000 in respect of trustee savings banks, represents an increase of £6,642,000 over the actual figure at the corresponding date last year.  The liability for savings certificates, including accrued interest, is estimated, on 31st March last, at <Col N="24" /> £14,547,000, or £1,361,000 in excess of the liability at 31st March of last year.</P>
    <P>The number of depositors in the Post Office Savings Bank is now 558,000 and in the trustee savings banks, 34,000, while the number of savings certificate holders is 247,000.</P>
    <P>We had a special publicity campaign last year directed to those who were not already availing of the facilities afforded by our savings institutions.  It was intended to help in the formation of thrifty habits, to absorb a certain amount of excess purchasing power, and so act as a minor check to inflation. The campaign had some success judging by the figures I have quoted.  The increase in the monetary circulation, to which I shall refer later, continues but there is evidence, as the Central Bank points out in its latest annual report, that substantial quantities of notes are being hoarded in the rural areas.  To some extent, the money already withdrawn from consumption-spending was diverted by our campaign into savings institutions and the effect on the size of the average deposit was probably more marked than on the number of depositors.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will have noticed, information additional to that given in previous years is contained in the three remaining tables published in connection with the Financial Statement. Table IV shows for each year, from 1938-39 onwards, Government expenditure and revenue as well as the net revenue expenditure of local authorities and the amount of rates collected. Tables V and VI contain the Exchequer statements for the years 1938-39 and 1939-40 and the corresponding statements for 1943-44 and 1944-45. I would commend these tables to the attention of the House as giving a composite view of national and local finances over a critical period.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Revenue Prospects.</i>
    </P>
    <P>The White Paper circulated some days ago shows the actual receipts and disbursements under various heads in 1944/45 and estimates under the same heads in 1945/46.  Based on the rates of taxation at present in force, the tax revenue is estimated to yield in the coming year an additional £1,880,000, <Col N="25" /> while the non-tax revenue is down by £60,000.</P>
    <P>This assumption of a net increase of £1,820,000 over the yield of what was admittedly a good year may seem optimistic.  The advent of peace in Europe should, on the one hand, help revenue.  The continuance of the war against Japan will, however, prevent anything like a complete change over of industry in the belligerent countries to a peace footing, and the demands of the civilian population will, for the present, have to take a back seat.  But the forces of recovery will, I hope, assert themselves in many directions which will be beneficial to the Exchequer before the 31st March next.</P>
    <P>I am, accordingly, assuming an expansion of £457,000 in customs revenue.  Petrol imports I expect to be about the same as last year.  The stock position of imported spirits and of wine continues to deteriorate and we must allow for a substantial fall of revenue under these heads.  No imports of sugar are likely in the current year.  Tobacco, the pride of the customs, is expected to yield £9,450,000.  It is assumed that imports of raw leaf will continue and that we will be able to maintain clearances on the basis of 90 per cent. of the 1939/40 figure.  There has been pressure to raise this percentage, but much as I would like to do so in order to get the additional revenue, I feel that the stock position in regard to leaf would not justify such a step.</P>
    <P>As regards excise, the prospects are rated as favourable for the coming year and an expansion in Exchequer receipts of £631,000 is anticipated. Beer, spirits, betting and entertainments between them are expected to provide £7,800,000 out of a total of £9,515,000.  The consumption of beer continues its upward trend and we are counting on a further rise in the intake of home-made spirits.  The increase in the number of racing fixtures, both here and in the United Kingdom, during 1945/46, justifies us in raising substantially the estimate of yield from the betting duty.  The public appetite for amusement seems insatiable, and the entertainments duty, which is drawn mainly from cinemas, is expected to give us no less than £600,000 <Col N="26" /> in the coming year.  The yield of the excise duty on sugar is conditioned by the limited supplies available, but the expectation is that the amount cleared will not differ substantially from last year's figure.</P>
    <P>On the inland revenue side the same favourable view of the course of events is taken, and the estimated Exchequer receipt of £19,380,000 assumes an improvement of £763,000 on the preceding year.  The main feature is, of course, income-tax, which is expected to reach a new record at £12,240,000.  The expected fall of £80,000 in the yield of surtax and supertax is accounted for by a single large payment in the past year which was in the nature of a windfall.  The upward trend of profits makes it feasible to raise the anticipated yield of corporation profits tax by £338,000 over last year's figure.  The yield from motor vehicle duties has, for obvious reasons, been relatively stagnant in recent years, but we anticipate a slight improvement at £650,000 in the coming year.</P>
    <P>On the non-tax revenue side the White Paper reveals little difference between the two years covered.  Total income from the Post Office is unchanged but the surplus income from the Central Bank is up by £50,000 to £350,000.</P>
    <P>The estimated receipt for land purchase annuities shows a slight falling off due to an anticipated fall in the amount of redemptions, as acquisition of land for public purposes is on a declining scale.  May I remark here that the arrears of annuities outstanding are still high, £582,000 on 31st January of this year?  This is indeed a great improvement on the figure of £1,228,000 returned on 31st January, 1940, but it is desirable that these arrears should now be cleared, and agricultural income has risen to such an extent as to make that possible.  Local rates have, of course, been an increasing charge in rural as well as in urban areas but, as a class, farmers have got off lightly during the emergency in the matter of taxation, and this, with the halving of the annuities, leaves little excuse for such a large arrear.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Expenditure</i>, 1945-46.</P>
    <P>So much for the various categories of Exchequer revenue during the coming <Col N="27" /> year.  On the expenditure side, Central Fund and Supply Services are estimated to cost £52,367,000, of which the latter account for £47,166,000, which constitutes a fresh record.  The original net provision for Supply Services last year was £44,983,000 and as compared with this figure the provision for the coming year is up by almost £2,250,000, due mainly to the following factors: an increase of £1,224,000 in the Estimate for Supplies, principally caused by further subsidies on food and fuel; an increase of £682,000 in the Estimate for Children's Allowances, owing to provision being made for the first time for a whole year, and an increase arising from the grant of additional bonus to civil servants, teachers and Gárdaí, amounting to £620,000 approximately.</P>
    <P>In the coming 12 months we are providing no less than £4,503,000 for food and fuel subsidies as compared with £4,026,000 last year and £2,564,000 in the previous year.  The aggregate of the special provisions included in the various State services in order to mitigate the impact of increased living costs on those least able to bear them, amounts to no less than £8,000,000. While it is not claimed that this, plus the expenditure of local authorities, will succeed in entirely eliminating hardship from the lower income groups in the country, it represents, I submit, a very substantial contribution to that end.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Aids to Employment.</i>
    </P>
    <P>The peace-time difficulties of securing maximum employment are, of course, for neutral countries intensified in a world war, but we are trying to make the maximum use of the employment values inherent in the resources of the country.  For this purpose liberal State support has been forthcoming. We are providing again this year £1,250,000 for employment and emergency schemes, such as farm improvements, urban and rural employment schemes, development work in bogs, seed and lime distribution schemes, and miscellaneous schemes for the relief of unemployment and distress. This expenditure will be supplemented <Col N="28" /> by a contribution of £171,000 from local authorities and of £26,000 from beneficiaries under the rural improvements scheme.  On turf production and development a sum of £860,000 is to be provided by the State, and on housing grants £630,000.  The building trade, which normally provides a large volume of employment, has, as already pointed out, been severely hit by the war but, as shown in the White Paper which we have published on the subject of post-war building development, we are making every effort to ensure that the industry will resume its wonted activity as quickly as possible.  On constructional works in connection with airports, £507,000 is to be provided.</P>
    <P>The Public Works and Building Vote will contribute £390,000 for new construction, while expenditure from other Votes for development purposes, including land improvement, drainage, coal and minerals development, fisheries and Gaeltacht services will also help to provide or stimulate employment.</P>
    <P>These various services make up a gross total of £4,571,000.  Over and above this there is provision for capital issues, as indicated in the White Paper, for development works in connection with electricity supply, tourist traffic, telephones and roads, totalling £805,000, making an aggregate of over £5,250,000.  In addition, as Deputies are aware, the State has assumed liability for various activities directed towards the provision or maintenance of employment.  We have, for example, given guarantees for trade loans and for large overdrafts, many of which are still current, for such operations as the importation of fuel, oils and fats, and grain.</P>
    <P>During the year we guaranteed issues of debenture stock by Córas Iompair Éireann under the Transport Act, 1944, to the amount of £9,889,000. This operation brings the total amount of guarantees secured by the Central Fund to almost £60,750,000, including over £15,000,000 in respect of Land Bonds which is really part of the direct public debt as the service is provided from annual Votes.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="29" />
      <i>Development of Resources.</i>
    </P>
    <P>As regards the Government's long-term programme for the development of our natural resources, plans are being framed on lines which it is hoped will result in turf being made available for domestic and industrial purposes, not only as a satisfactory fuel, but also at an economic price.  We are all, both as consumers and taxpayers, too well aware that the arrangements for its production which had to be improvised during the past few years have been costly.  There is reason to anticipate, however, that the plans at present being laid will show improved results.  These schemes will have the further merit of providing employment. In the present year the Exchequer will, as stated above, be called upon to the extent of £860,000 to finance turf production.</P>
    <P>The company which was specially set up under legislation in 1941 to prospect for and develop minerals, other than coal, has concentrated on the production of phosphates and pyrites, thus supplementing our limited supplies of superphosphates.  With it, under recent legislation, will soon be merged the company which was set up at the same time to develop our coal deposits. The companies will receive advances of £55,000 in the current year and possibly also grants to cover prospecting for the above and other minerals.  The limit of advances to the combined companies has been extended to £400,000.</P>
    <P>Emergency conditions have operated against the more rapid development of afforestation.  The shortage of fencing materials and tools still continues, while suitable seed in quantity is also hard to obtain.  Pending easement of the supplies position steps continue to be taken to increase the home collection of seed and to raise larger stocks of seedlings, as well as to maintain the trained executive and labour staffs which have been built up.  There is obviously much leeway to be made good, but it may be taken that everything is being done as opportunity offers to facilitate development.</P>
    <P>Since my last Budget, legislation has been enacted for a comprehensive scheme of arterial drainage.  The scheme involves a fundamental departure <Col N="30" /> from past policy in regard not only to incidence of cost but to the actual work, which will be undertaken on a catchment area basis&mdash;the only really sound procedure&mdash;and not in the piecemeal manner which has hitherto been adopted.  As was the case last year, the provision required for arterial drainage during the present year will not be substantial. It will not be out of place here to mention that in the absence of actual detailed surveys it was not possible, as will be appreciated, for the commission to furnish accurate estimates of the area of lands hitherto subject to flooding or of the cost, otherwise than in pre-war terms, of the necessary remedial works.  The results of a survey recently completed in the Brosna catchment have shown that the area of lands to be improved there is more than double the area upon which the commission based its estimate and it is, of course, probable that similar results will be found in other areas, so that the commission's estimate of cost of the entire scheme, which they put at £7,035,000, as well as having to be adjusted to post-war values, may have to be more than doubled.</P>
    <P>I referred last year to the Government's intention to establish and equip the Shannon Airport on lines worthy of a centre of international civil aviation. Since then, as the recent discussion in the House on the Air Agreements reached at the Chicago Conference last autumn has shown, it has become a matter of urgency to complete the scheme of development, and this is being pushed forward.  Competition between different centres for international air traffic will be intense, and it is of vital importance that the Shannon Airport should be in a position to offer facilities of a kind which will render it attractive to air transport companies operating on international routes.  As matters stand, I think we should be pleased with the agreement reached with the United States, and it is to be hoped that agreement on similar lines with other countries will be found possible. Approximately £1,000,000 has been <Col N="31" /> spent on the Shannon Airport.  Apart from staff charges, £407,000 is being provided for works and maintenance this year, and that will be by no means the end of the expenditure.  I may add that it is the intention to improve still further the Dublin Airport by concreting the runways, at a cost of £350,000.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise here that our extensive programme of post-war development in these and other spheres can become a reality only if the cost of Supply Services after the war is radically curtailed and if the necessary services, such as food and fuel allowances and subsidies, disappear.  The country cannot carry the double burden of emergency services and post-war development.  In an earlier part of the statement I pointed out the size of our existing debt.  Its annual service now absorbs almost £4,000,000. Further additions to borrowing can only mean further additions to taxation, and unless our burdens are eased in other directions, our contemplated programme of post-war development will inevitably be hampered.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Defence Expenditure.</i>
    </P>
    <P>We are facing the present year with a total State expenditure of £52,367,000, or more than £1,000,000 per week.  I had hoped, when introducing the 1944 Budget, that the progress of the war towards a conclusion would have relieved me of the need to provide again for defence expenditure on the large scale of the past five years, but the estimate for the Army this year again exceeds the substantial figure of £8,000,000.  Hostilities are, however, ending in Europe and the demobilisation of the Army can soon be undertaken without involving risk to the security of the country.  It is the Government's intention, therefore, that the release of personnel will be put in hand at an early date in accordance with an ordered plan.  This will, of course, result in savings under many heads of the Army Vote&mdash;pay and allowances, rations, clothing and the rest&mdash;but any such savings will afford little comfort in the present year to the Minister for Finance.  In <Col N="32" /> fact, they will be more than offset by issues in respect of demobilisation gratuities, deferred pay, and provision for the unemployment insurance of demobilised personnel.  Indeed, on the best estimate that can at present be framed, it is likely that such issues will involve my having to find a substantial additional sum of money for the Army in the course of the year.  I am sure that, much as the taxpayer has looked forward to the end of the emergency for an easement of his burdens, he will not cavil if easement has to be deferred a little longer, so as to permit of some further recognition of the services rendered by these men, many of whom will be faced with difficult problems of resettlement.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Taxation of Industry.</i>
    </P>
    <P>Apropos of our tax burdens, it has been represented to me within the past 12 months by different bodies of industrialists and by individual trading concerns that alterations should be made in income-tax law, so as to afford special reliefs to industry for the post-war years because of various difficulties which it may encounter in that period. On this I should like to invite attention to a few important points that are sometimes passed over lightly.  It is well to remember that there has not been in this country a 100 per cent. tax on excess profits, that is, profits made during the emergency in excess of a previous standard.  The standards provided have been generous.  A circumstance that industrialists have been prone to overlook is that excess profits made before the 1st January, 1941, have not been subjected to the excess tax.  I mention these matters for the reason that reliefs have been asked for on the lines of those included in the Income Tax Bill introduced this year in the United Kingdom where a 100 per cent. charge on excess profits exists and where the standard rate of income-tax has been 10/- in the £.  It should be borne in mind, too, that our industries have not had to suffer, for example, the dislocation entailed by switching over to war production, not to mention the process of changing back.  Incidentally, these considerations illustrate the unreasonableness of the contention, all too familiar <Col N="33" /> nowadays, that simply because a thing is done in another country it should be done here.</P>
    <P>It is a plain truth that, taken as a class, those who derive their income from trade have prospered in, and I may add in consequence of, the conditions that have existed during the emergency.  In this connection I have withstood in the past four years considerable pressure to increase the levy on excess profits to 100 per cent.  It has been argued that no trader should be allowed to make and retain for his own use any excess profits arising out of the emergency.  From another standpoint it has been suggested to me that in the peculiar conditions of trading obtaining here in recent times, not only income-tax and corporation profits tax but also excess corporation profits tax were being passed on to the consumer in the same way as the duties on sugar, tobacco or beer are passed on and that in the interests of the consumer a 100 per cent. excess tax was essential.  I do not feel it necessary to comment on that view.  It is the fact, however, that I did not seek to have the charge raised to 100 per cent.  One of my reasons in not seeking it was my desire that provision should be made for the position of industry in the years immediately following the war.</P>
    <P>As far back as 1941, when proposing the excess corporation profits tax, I made this statement in the course of my Budget speech:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In my proposals in regard to corporation profits tax I have been careful to interfere no more than is necessary with the possibility of companies accumulating resources in order to meet the inevitable shocks of post-war adjustment.  While others may differ from my view, I feel that the 25 per cent. margin which we have allowed to remain with them will be adequate for this purpose.&rdquo;&mdash;(Official Report, 7th May, 1941, Col. 43).</P>
    <P>In my Budget speech of 1943, I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is a large body of opinion which, considering... the effect of the taxation on the proprietors of all companies which are making <Col N="34" /> excess profits, would say at once that the taxation is, in fact, too low.</P>
    <P>There is, however, the post-emergency standpoint.  Because of it, we have framed our legislation so as to leave to companies liable to excess corporation profits tax 25 per cent. of their excess profits, and have, at the same time, by Emergency Powers Order, imposed a limit on the distribution of the profits of public companies to their shareholders. Our policy in both respects has been dictated by the consideration that business concerns should be enabled to provide for the changed conditions that will arise after the war, and also to help in providing employment for our people then....&rdquo;&mdash;(Official Report, 5th May, 1943, Col. 2202).</P>
    <P>I then proposed special reliefs, which in due course were given the force of law, by way of increases in the substituted standards, although.  I felt at the time that the existing standards gave a full and fair measure for assessing the tax.  I went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I want to emphasise the fact that these concessions are not designed to enable shareholders to get bigger dividends; they are intended to encourage the companies which benefit by them to plough back into their businesses as much profit as possible and thus put themselves in a position to give increased employment after the emergency.&rdquo;&mdash;(Col. 2294).</P>
    <P>I must confess to some disappointment at the seeming forgetfulness of industrialists and others of the limitations which I have had imposed on the extent of the tax.  As a result of such limitations it has been possible for them to accumulate reserves against the dangers which they fear in the unforeseeable conditions that will exist after the war.  May I add that the total amount of these reserves should by now be not inappreciable?</P>
    <P>I hope what I have just said about the history of the matter will show that I did not wait to be pressed before considering the question of the post-war difficulties of industry and, what is more, that I did not hesitats <Col N="35" /> at an early stage to translate the results of my consideration into practical form.  If the representations referred to are to be further considered at any time in the future, the use to which industry has put or plans to put the reserves which it has accumulated out of excess profits will be taken into account.  If further reliefs to industry are sought at the expense of the general body of taxpayers, the extent to which protection will continue to be afforded in the home market may also naturally fall to be considered as a relevant factor.</P>
    <P>I trust that nothing I have said will be misunderstood and, above all, that nobody will infer any change in my general attitude towards industry.  I am always ready to listen with sympathy to the claims of industry and to do whatever appears to be just and feasible.  For instance, I have already recorded the opinion that if there is a fall in the market value of stocks following the end of the period of the charge to excess corporation profits tax, it is inevitable that suitable legislation should be passed to deal with the matter.  But the chief relief to industry must come from a fall in the main rates of taxation, which is in turn dependent on a fall in expenditure.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Further State Liabilities.</i>
    </P>
    <P>There are other liabilities accumulating for which the figure of £52,367,000 mentioned as the Exchequer commitment for the current year makes no provision.  Under the Fertilisers Credit Scheme for wheat we had accumulated up to 31st March last a liability of £700,000, and a further liability will accumulate during the present year of about £380,000.  The deferred pay to the credit of members of the Defence Forces amounted on 31st March last to £655,000 and the liability was then growing at the rate of £290,000 per annum.  The largest of the liabilities for which we have made no provision is the superannuation and retiring allowances of various classes of public servants.  A rough estimate of the capital value of our present liability in respect of superannuation benefits for present established civil servants and existing pensioners <Col N="36" /> is £21,000,000.  It is hoped to have prepared up-to-date estimates of our liability for other pensions, such as teachers, Gárda and military service pensions, for which the State has assumed complete or partial responsibility. The latest actuarial figure we have in this connection is that in regard to national teachers, in respect of whose pensions liability as at the 31st March, 1938, was estimated at over £15,000,000.</P>
    <P>Even without actuarial examination it is clear that the steady growth of pension commitments must be a matter of concern to the Minister for Finance. This will, I am sure, be appreciated when I mention that our gross estimates in respect of Civil Service, teachers, Gárda and military pensions of various kinds have increased by about £300,000 a year since 1938/39. Any further increase in this type of disbursement must be firmly opposed.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Growth and Cost of Civil Service.</i>
    </P>
    <P>As regards the Civil Service, the growth to which I have referred in previous years still continues, and on 1st January of this year, the total number of persons employed reached the peak point, so far, of 30,333 civil servants.  This was 787 higher than the number on the same date last year and 1,252 above the 1943 figure.</P>
    <P>The cost of the Service has risen in a still more disquieting measure.  The annual outlay on remuneration of civil servants is now estimated at £7,300,000. The corresponding Estimates for 1943 and 1944 were £6,100,000 and £6,470,000 respectively.  The increase in the rates of ordinary and emergency bonus was the main element in the expansion here.  Payments of bonus were estimated to amount to £2,029,000 in 1933; £2,210,000 in 1944, and £2,942,000 in 1945.  Deputies will recall that, when I brought the latest rise in the rates of bonus before the House some months ago, the only criticism made was that I should have been more generous.</P>
    <P>The figures of cost I have given so far refer to the salaries, wages and bonus of civil servants, including part-time employees, of whom there are a <Col N="37" /> great many in the Post Office.  They do not include payments for overtime or travelling and subsistence expenses. Nor do they include payments to persons remunerated on a piece-work, task-work, capitation or fee basis or to persons employed on schemes of work of a temporary nature, as none of these persons can be regarded as a civil servant.  Adding all these payments to the £7,300,000 I have already mentioned as the amount which we are now spending on Civil Service remuneration, we arrive at a total figure of over £8,100,000.  I can remember a time when the entire cost of government for the 32 counties of Ireland was not much more than that sum. Now, it represents less than one-sixth of the Government expenditure of the 26 Counties.  We must, of course, allow for the fact that in the meanwhile the value of money has fallen to one-third, but we surely have here the evidence of an alarming expansion. It is certainly time for us to consider whether the welfare of the country does not demand that we should now set a limit to the extension of Governmental activities, which otherwise threatens to continue indefinitely.</P>
    <P>As I said last year, it is the expansion of State activity itself rather than the growth of the Civil Service that causes me the greater concern.  I look upon the restless activity of the State as the disease and the growth of the Civil Service, however distressing, as merely one of the symptoms.  But I would remind those who regard the symptom as the greater evil, that we cannot have the disease without the symptom.</P>
    <P>Government policy has raised the tempo of activity in every Department of State but, as Deputies know, the rise had until 1939 been greatest in the Departments concerned with economic affairs and the administration of social services.</P>
    <P>I could give many instances to drive home my argument that we cannot have more State services without more State servants.  To think otherwise is a pure delusion, and those who in this House, in the Seanad, in the local boards and elsewhere make speeches and propose <Col N="38" /> motions in favour of additional measures of social security, guaranteed markets, guaranteed prices, minimum wages, further land division, extended afforestation and regulation of a hundred and one activities are all, in effect, advocates of a larger and more costly Civil Service, of what in other moods some of them would call a bigger bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>There are, I admit, spheres in which the extension of Governmental activity was and is inevitable, in which the results aimed at are in the public interest and can be achieved only by the Government, or can be much more effectively achieved by it than by any other agency.  But are we sufficiently critical in judging whether this condition is fulfilled in each particular case?  I am convinced that we are not, that, on the contrary, most of us &mdash;and this is true of all Parties in Dáil and Seanad&mdash;whatever theories we may profess, show in practice a bias in favour of Governmental action and against leaving desirable reforms to the initiative of persons and organisations outside the charmed circle formed by the Oireachtas and the Government.</P>
    <P>My remarks on these matters in previous speeches have evoked such a poor response that I do not feel hopeful of being able now to impress the House with a sense of the dangers we are incurring.  We cannot continuously increase the power of the central Government without restricting the freedom and undermining the morale and the self-reliance of the citizen.  Those most hostile to totalitarianism are often the warmest and most persistent advocates of direct State activity in many spheres.  State control carried far enough is totalitarianism.</P>

      <i>Social Services.</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have referred to the interest which the Government has continually displayed in the welfare of the economically weaker sections of the community, and it may not be out of place to mention that the social services proper account, in our Estimates of expenditure for the coming year, for an outlay <Col N="39" /> of no less than £9,686,000, of which old age pensions call for £3,807,000, children's allowances for £2,230,000, unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance, £1,302,000, and food and fuel allowances, £697,000.  The aggregate of the corresponding figures in 1944/45 was £9,273,000 and in 1943/44, £7,494,000, so that the expansion in recent years has been considerable.  It is still more considerable if measured by reference to the similar services provided, say, ten years ago in 1934/35, which accounted in the Volume of Estimates at that time for a total of £5,750,000.  These payments represent, of course, the redistribution, not the creation of wealth.  Social services, social security, full employment, and allied topics occupy a prominent place in public discussion just now and alluring vistas are held out of communities freed from want and disease and, almost, from toil.  No one will want to dismiss these dreams as entirely Utopian, but, having regard to the economic structure of this country and, I think, with the present constitution of the average individual here, we must make do with the less perfect instruments for which the above outlay provides.</P>
    <P>Many, without realising the magnitude of our current outlay on these matters, press for further expansion, and the favourite suggestion is that we should announce here a scheme of what is called social security, on the lines of that proposed by Sir William Beveridge for the United Kingdom. The various services which he proposed fall under four heads&mdash;social insurance, national assistance, children and family allowances, and health and rehabilitation services.  The first-named covers unemployment, sickness, disability and retirement benefits as well as widows' and guardians' benefit, and marriage, maternity and funeral grants; the second covers various forms of unemployment assistance; the third and the fourth are self-explanatory. The total present cost to the State here of services of the kind covered by the Beveridge recommendations is approximately £8,200,000, and the total expenditure on benefits, <Col N="40" /> exclusive of administrative expenses, is £9,450,000.  After serious study I can state that the total expenditure here on benefits as proposed for Britain by Sir William Beveridge would be £38,800,000, of which the State contribution would be £23,500,000.  These striking figures seem to dispose of the suggestion that such a scheme is practicable here. Even if we were to follow the somewhat less costly scheme suggested in the British White Paper, the total expenditure involved would be £36,000,000 per annum, of which £20.2 million would be contributed by the State, the remainder coming in the form of contributions from various sections of the population.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Economic Factors.</i>
    </P>
    <P>In framing the social security budget, Sir William Beveridge assumed that in the industries now subject to insurance in the United Kingdom the average rate of unemployment would in future be about 10 per cent., and that over the whole body of insured employees in the first of the five classes into which he divided the total population, unemployment would average about 8½ per cent.  The applicability to conditions in this country of these and other assumptions and inferences on which estimates of cost of the Beveridge scheme are based is open to doubt.  Considerations appropriate to Great Britain would not apply to a mainly agricultural country such as ours.  The unemployment problem here is different in character and its solution seems to be connected more with the efficient development of our economy as a whole than with the offsetting of cyclical disturbances or mass unemployment.  The relatively low proportion of employees in the working population leaves us less exposed than more industrialised countries to general fluctuations in the volume of employment.  The 1936 census inquiry into unemployment showed clearly that even in the employee class protracted unemployment is experienced by relatively few; so that the employee class might well find social security payments to be a tax from which they personally would derive very little benefit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="41" /> Inequality of incomes is less marked here and outlay is, therefore, a more stable quantity.  We do not possess the heavy industries which are most subject to trade depression; our industries cater mainly for the home market, under the shelter of protection. Fluctuations in investment are for us of less significance, while variations in our national income and in employment arise chiefly from vicissitudes in the export prices of our agricultural products.  Further points of difference may be noted: our sickness experience is worse than the British.  The age composition of our population is also less favourable to employment and to a high standard of living.  We have a higher proportion of old people (65 and over) and a smaller proportion of people of working age (15-65) than Great Britain.  Old age pensions place a severe strain on the public purse and their aggregate amount militates against social payments to other classes on a more generous scale.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Budget Finance,</i> 1945-46.</P>
    <P>Our survey of the financial position for the coming year has shown total tax and non-tax revenue of £47,995,000 and total expenditure on Central Fund and Supply Services of £52,367,000. Before striking a balance we make certain deductions, as in the past, for capital and abnormal items to be met by borrowing, which amount this year to £718,000, leaving a sum of £51,649,000 to be met from revenue. In the latter we propose to make only one change, relating to matches&mdash;with which I shall presently deal&mdash;involving a loss of £53,000, thus reducing our income to £47,942,000 which leaves us with a deficit of £3,707,000, all of which I propose to meet by borrowing. Members will be pleased to know that while existing taxes cannot be diminished, I am proposing no new burdens.</P>
    <P>In 1941 the main rate of excise duty on matches was increased from 3/8 to 8/4 per gross boxes, following consultations with the manufacturers regarding the price of matches.  The increase in duty was agreed on the understanding that a review of the position would be made when the <Col N="42" /> effect of the increased duty had been observed.  In November last strong representations were made for such a review on account of reductions in output and increase in cost of materials and overhead expenses.</P>
    <P>I may say that the output of matches from our home factory has been kept up to its present not unsatisfactory level largely through the efforts of the company in procuring suitable raw materials in spite of grave difficulties.</P>
    <P>The present position has been thoroughly examined, and as any increase in the price of matches would be most undesirable at the present time, the only other alternative, viz., a reduction in the rate of duty, seems to be warranted, on the understanding that the position will be again examined on the return of more normal conditions.</P>
    <P>I propose, therefore, to make provision for a reduction in the main rate of duty by 2/1 per gross, which, of course, will not admit of a reduction in price, but will ensure that the public will be able to purchase matches in reasonable quantities at the prices now current.  The loss of excise revenue in the current year will, as stated, be £53,000, and in a full year, £58,000.</P>
    <P>On the Committee Stage of last year's Finance Bill an amendment was tabled which, the Deputy moving it explained, was intended to operate in relief of certain professional bodies receiving fees in connection with the registration of members.  The Deputy recommended the position of such bodies to me for favourable consideration and asked that a provision be made to enable them, when losses are sustained in such transactions, to set the losses against profits for tax purposes.  I undertook at the time to have the matter examined and, as a result, a section is being included in the Finance Bill to secure generally that losses sustained in transactions, which in the event of a profit would have given rise to Case VI liability, may be set off against profits taxable under Case VI.  The section will, in addition, secure that any unexhausted <Col N="43" /> balance of loss may be carried forward and set against Case VI profits for the six following years.  The estimated annual cost of the relief is inconsiderable.</P>
    <P>There will be a section to afford exemption from income-tax in respect of deferred pay which, in accordance with Defence Force Regulations, is credited to the pay account of a member of the Defence Forces and in respect of certain gratuities which it has been decided to grant in respect of service with the forces.  Provision will also be made for a death duties exemption.  Here again it is considered that the cost will not be appreciable.</P>
    <P>The Bill will contain a section affecting corporation profits tax and excess corporation profits tax.  The technicalities of this particular matter should perhaps be outlined first.  The Great Southern Railways Company was exempt from the tax in consequence of its falling within the scope of a temporary relieving provision for public utility companies which incidentally was renewed for a further period by last year's Finance Act.  On the other hand, the Dublin United Transport Company was liable to the tax in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>Both companies were, of course, dissolved under the Transport Act and their undertakings transferred to Córas Iompair Éireann, which was incorporated by virtue of that Act.  The new company, Córas Iompair Éireann, by reason of the nature of the undertaking transferred to it from the former Dublin United Transport Company, falls outside the terms in which the temporary relieving provision is framed.  Accordingly, as the law stands it is liable to corporation profits tax and excess corporation profits tax on its entire profits.</P>
    <P>In view of the existing exemption for railways, it would have been necessary, if no change in the revenue position obtaining prior to the Transport Act were contemplated, to propose that Córas Iompair Éireann should be exempt from the tax on that part of its profits which arises from the undertaking transferred to it from the railway <Col N="44" /> company.  I propose, however, that the company should be relieved from the tax in respect of all its profits.  The charge to income tax is not affected.  I am speaking of corporation profits tax and excess corporation profits tax.</P>
    <P>The exemption which I am proposing and which will be covered later on by a section in the Finance Bill will take effect only up to the end of the year 1946, which is the date when the general exemption for public utility companies expires.  The position of Córas Iompair Éireann for periods beginning after that date will, no doubt, be then considered in conjunction with the question of renewing the general exemption of public utility companies.</P>
    <P>The benefits which will flow to the company from this exemption, which represents an extension of the exemption existing prior to the incorporation of the company, should be a help in the initial stages of transport reorganisation.</P>
    <P>The first accounting period of the new company is the 12 months to the end of December, 1945.  Corporation profits tax on the profits of that period would normally not be collectable until the financial year 1946-47.  It follows, therefore, that my proposal involves no surrender of revenue for the current financial year.  Next year's loss of revenue will depend on the success in the year 1945 of the company's operations in regard to the undertaking transferred to it from the Dublin United Transport Company.</P>
    <P>So far as the Budget proper is concerned, my task is now complete. There are, however, some other important matters on which I wish to touch.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Relief of Distress Abroad.</i>
    </P>
    <P>Members of the Dáil will remember that during the last year we were happily able to give modest financial help to parts of the world where, owing to conditions created by the war, such assistance was urgently required.  This assistance was gratefully received and acknowledged.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental committee <Col N="45" /> has been for some weeks examining the question of the possibility of our aiding in the relief of the people on the Continent now in distress owing to the war.  The committee was asked to make a report to the Government on the help that could be made available by the people of this country, and how such foodstuffs and other materials as we might be able to provide could be conveyed to the countries most needing relief and how best they might be distributed.</P>
    <P>The problems involved are not easy of solution and there are many difficulties to be overcome before any of the food that might be made available here can be transported overseas. When they have been overcome&mdash;and we hope that with goodwill they shall be&mdash;a full statement on the subject will be duly made in the Dáil.  I am certain that all Parties in the House and the whole community will earnestly desire that this country should give such assistance as may be practicable not merely in money but in the form of food and other essential commodities, supplied even at the sacrifice of reducing our own consumption.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Estimates of National Income.</i>
    </P>
    <P>While I do not think we can achieve &ldquo;joy through statistics&rdquo; I propose on this occasion to make an innovation of a statistic character, inaugurating, albeit in tentative fashion, a series of official national income estimates for this State.  Heretofore, the only estimates available were made by private investigators, notably those by Dr. T. J. Kiernan, our present Minister to the Vatican, and the well-known more recent series covering the years 1926 and 1929 and 1931-1940, inclusive, by Professor G.A. Duncan, made, in the first instance, for the Banking Commission and continued in the Statistical Society journal.  These estimates were extremely useful and the official investigation has established their general reliability.  Heretofore, the official service has been unwilling to assume responsibility for estimations of national income, though rough approximations have occasionally been made for Departmental use.  This official reluctance has been due partly <Col N="46" /> to the rather considerable sectors of the national economy on which the knowledge of output was uncertain; partly to lack of agreement as to the definitions of national income.  Also no clamant desire for these figures manifested itself and the official statisticians had, and have, plenty of other work to do.</P>
    <P>The auguries have latterly become more favourable.  The measure of international agreement on definition has much improved, particularly as between countries with which we would be interested to compare the absolute level and the general trend of our income.  Furthermore, in connection with the consideration of public policy, more detailed knowledge of the money and real value of the national output of goods and services and of its distribution amongst the different economic classes is essential.  Most important of all, improvement in the quality and quantity of relevant statistical data, even during wartime, has perceptibly lessened the zone (especially for service employments) in regard to which the economic information has hitherto been of a somewhat conjectural character.  For the compilation of the figures which I shall quote in a moment, special inquiries of an onerous character had to be undertaken and, indeed, these inquiries are not yet completed, though notable progress has been made.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Definition of National Income.</i>
    </P>
    <P>For the purpose with which I am concerned the national income is the aggregate value, at current rates, of incomes in money and kind of persons normally resident in the State, before payment of taxes and rates, for services whether performed currently or in the past; thus, the figures include the value of pensions paid to persons for services rendered in the past, but exclude old age pensions, unemployment assistance payments and the like, which are regarded as &ldquo;transfer payments&rdquo;. In the latter category is also interest on the national and local debt; which exclusion, in whole, is perhaps more difficult to justify (and I do not propose to try to justify it here); at any rate, it means that we avoid the <Col N="47" /> paradoxical situation whereby the larger the national debt the larger the national income.  The total includes the value (at prices which farmers receive for produce sold) of farm produce and turf consumed in farm households without process of sale, which output constitutes an important and, indeed, an increasing proportion of the value of the national output, as will appear.  In the concept known as private income, which is most relevant to the study of national expenditure and national savings, transfer payments are included, but miscellaneous Government income is excluded.  As I have said, the inquiries are still proceeding and even the total figures which I shall now quote are to be regarded as provisional and possibly subject to revision as better information become available.  I do not consider, however, that important changes will be necessary, except, perhaps, for the year just ended.  The figures for the years 1938-1944 are:&mdash;</P>

    </table>
    <P>It is satisfactory that our income makes a relatively good showing and that the proportion borne by the agricultural community has increased from 25 per cent. in 1938 to 35 per cent. in 1944.  To curb at once any extravagant hopes that may be based on the present level of the figure, it should suffice to say that the increase in the income is purely a monetary phenomenon: excluding farm produce and turf consumed on farms without sale (the estimated value of which was about £13,000,000 in 1938 and reached almost £32,000,000 in 1944) and confining attention for the moment to goods which enter the economic process, the increase in the national income between 1938 and 1944 was equivalent to 55 per cent. as compared with 70 per cent. in the official cost-of-living index <Col N="48" /> number, indicating a decline in the real income of goods and services in the aggregate.  More striking still, it is estimated that at 1938 prices (retail for goods sold and at agricultural prices for home-consumed farm produce and turf) consumption of goods has declined from £124,000,000 in 1938 to £102,000,000 in 1944, or by 18 per cent., due entirely to declines in the consumption of goods other than foodstuffs: in volume the consumption of food, drink and tobacco has been well maintained.</P>
    <P>I may refer also to a few other interesting items included in the aggregation. The national income figure at the present time contains remittances from abroad to the value of £13,500,000 per annum as compared with £3,000,000 per-war, and in the post-war period the figure will probably tend to revert towards its former level.  The output of turf shows an important increase. The estimated value of the output (including consumption on farms) was £3,000,000 in 1938 and £10,000,000 in 1944 (exclusive of subsidy).</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Distribution of Incomes.</i>
    </P>
    <P>There have also emerged from the present inquiry for the first time in this country statistics of the number and value of incomes (other than agricultural incomes) classified by size for the years 1938 and 1943 in the £150-£1,500 range&mdash;the figures for over £1,500 are, of course, available from surtax statistics.  These figures are essential for accurate assessment of the taxable capacity of the community. In the former year, that is, in 1938, the total value of non-agricultural personal income of persons with income exceeding £150 per annum increased from £59,000,000 to £75,000,000, while the proportion of these totals received by the surtax class (i.e., with incomes over £1,500) increased slightly from 17 per cent. in 1938 to 18 per cent. in 1943.  To obtain a more correct picture of the share of the owners of higher incomes in the total income of the State, account should be taken of (a) the income of persons other than agriculturists earning not more than £150, which amounted to £51,000,000 in 1938 and £68,000,000 in <Col N="49" /> 1943; (b) the income of persons engaged in agriculture, forestry and fishing.  Heretofore it has not been possible to classify agricultural income by size, though consideration is being given to the possibility of obtaining these particulars through broadly based farm surveys.  In any case, the great bulk of agricultural income, even at the present time of comparative prosperity, is in the under £150 class. The proportion attributable to the over £1,500 class in the total personal income (that is, of £150,000,000 in 1938 and £228,000,000 in 1943) was 6.6 per cent. in 1938 and 6.1 per cent. in 1943. I should explain that personal income is defined as the aggregate of incomes from all sources (including income in money and kind, pensions, gifts, social payments, interest on the public debt and dividends) at the disposal of individuals normally resident in the State but excludes undistributed profit of companies.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the small proportion of total income falling to the wealthier classes even at the present time, it is obvious that the possibilities of extracting further taxes from these classes, for purposes however worthy, are circumscribed, if, indeed, the limit has not been reached as it is.</P>
    <P>As regards the lower income groups, non-agricultural incomes not exceeding £150, together with total income in agriculture, forestry and fishing, increased from £90,000,000 in 1938 to £152,000,000 in 1943, which figures constitute 60 per cent. and 67 per. cent. of the aggregate personal income in the respective years.</P>
    <P>The general conclusion which emerges from the statistics is that in this State incomes are relatively evenly distributed, which fact militates against the raising of large sums by direct taxation.  To a very large extent increased payments for social services, for example, can only be made through taxation of the lower income groups.</P>
    <P>Of equal importance with the national income is the national pattern of expenditure but, unfortunately, the statistical information on the subject <Col N="50" /> at the moment is much more imprecise, particularly in regard to personal expenditure in travelling, amusements and personal services generally; and, indeed, information on the subject of expenditure on goods could also be considerably improved.  It should be feasible to supplement existing information on this subject by systematic inquiries into family budgets: the question, with that of farm surveys, is being examined.  At the moment the principal value of the estimates of expenditure (containing, as I have said, conjectural elements) is for the confirmation they afford of the general reliability of the statistics of the national income.  Though the two aggregations are not completely independent, it was satisfactory to find that without adjustment they agreed quite well, leaving increasing balances for savings in the last three years of about £10,000,000 in 1942, and over £20,000,000 per annum in 1943-44.  One cannot, of course, place too much confidence in these figures since they are balancing figures which bear the brunt of all the errors of estimation in both aggregations.</P>
    <P>These observations represent merely some first reactions to these extremely important statistics which it is hoped shortly to publish with full explanations as to method and displaying the figures for many economic groups.  I know that it is unsatisfactory that I should whet the interest of Deputies in this statistical pabulum without satisfying their appetites in full, but I would crave indulgence.  For a first inquiry on so important a matter it is necessary to submit the figures to the closest expert scrutiny, to check and counter-check, before publication.  This is all the more necessary since there remains a zone, admittedly a small one, in which recourse has still to be had to the sorry device of conjecture.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Currency, Deposits and Debits.</i>
    </P>
    <P>Before concluding, I would like to say a word on the general position. With war-time conditions still prevailing, the tendency towards inflation continues to be a major cause of anxiety both here and elsewhere.  In our case the past year has again witnessed a considerable increase in the <Col N="51" /> volume of money of all kinds unattended by any increase in the volume of goods available for consumption. Money in the form of notes and coin in the March quarter of this year averaged over £38,500,000 as compared with about £35,000,000 a year ago and £17,500,000 in the same quarter of 1939.  The increase of this item since pre-war is thus 121 per cent.  The rise in the volume of deposits of the commercial banks, while proportionately less than for notes and coin, is still very considerable.  In the March quarter of this year these deposits averaged about £194,750,000 as compared with about £177,000,000 a year ago and £116,500,000 in the same quarter of 1939.  These figures represent an increase of 67 per cent. since pre-war.  Potential purchasing power in the form of deposits at the Post Office Savings Bank, including trustee savings banks and savings certificates, has also continued to expand, the aggregate addition to these heads during the past year being about £8,000,000.  These figures concerning the volume of various categories of purchasing power do not, of course, give a simple and ready clue to the degree of inflation as much of this purchasing power is not in active use, as such, but is held by the owners as unspent savings.  Some indication of the position as regards the turnover of money in actual transactions is given by the available statistics of bank debits.  These debits for the year 1944 amounted to £987,000,000 as compared with £926,500,000 for 1943 and £755,500,000 for 1939.  The figure for 1944 represents an increase of 30 per cent. over 1939, which is much more moderate than the percentage increases already stated in the volume of money.</P>

    <P>As regards the price level it is possible to get some limited satisfaction from the fact that the cost-of-living index has remained stable for the past 18 months, but it must be tempered by the consideration that this stability at more than 70 per cent. above pre-war is at an unduly high level for a country which is essentially a food-producer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="52" /> From a currency standpoint this figure compares unfavourably with the corresponding figure of about 30 per cent. for the United Kingdom and in the interest of maintaining the internal and external purchasing power of our money it is desirable that an appreciable downward movement of this index should be secured.  The agricultural prices index has receded slightly from the very high level of the beginning of 1944, when it was about 100 per cent. above pre-war.  The recession continued up to November, but the index has risen continuously in each of the four subsequent months.  It is very desirable that the rise should be checked and that agriculturists should look for their income to higher production rather than to the continuance of the present abnormal price level. The generally inflated character of our price structure has received further interesting illustration in the efforts made by the Statistics Branch to develop a wholesale price index.  The information was disclosed some months ago that such an index for this country showed a wholesale price increase at June, 1944, of 98.1 per cent. above the base period of October, 1938.</P>
    <P>The time has come for recognising seriously that the large advances which have occurred in prices of all kinds as reflected in these indices leave us less free to travel further along the path of liberal expenditure than if the existing price increases had been more moderate.  High budgetary expenditure and deficit financing are the most potent of all inflationary forces and their effect is most harmful where, through heavy rates of taxation, enterprise is deterred from an extension of productivity.  Expenditure in productive enterprise, by the very fact of its productivity, provides its own assurance that it will not be inflationary.  Where the State or other administrative bodies are driven to provide funds for the primary purpose of affording remunerative employment, the necessary link with useful production is far more difficult to ensure, and the rate of remuneration, which is no less important than the price level, is less responsive to any objective test of the value of the services rendered.</P>

      <i>International Monetary Proposals.</i>
    </P>
    <P>In all countries these are basic considerations in the working of the economic and social system.  In every country, including our own, the right ordering of them is primarily a task for domestic treatment.  Such treatment must, of course, be supplemented by proper relations with the outside world, and especially so when the limited character of the national resources demands a high proportion of external trade.  The acute realisation of this situation has, during the past year, led many nations to confer, through their representatives at Bretton Woods, as to the best means of securing that, in the future, the monetary system in its international workings will make the maximum contribution to a freer and larger flow of international trade.  It is too soon as yet to say whether the proposals of that conference will come into operation and, in the meantime, their possible bearing on this country must remain indeterminate.  It would be well, however, that no exaggerated hopes should be entertained that the Bretton Woods scheme would provide us with any simple or magical solution of the grave difficulties to be anticipated in the financing of our future external trade, especially outside the sterling area.  The proposed international monetary fund has for its main purpose to provide resources to enable a member country to tide over temporary emergencies affecting current transactions in its balance of payments. Facilities for this purpose would be very strictly limited.  Accordingly, it is clear, and has been emphatically stressed by many exponents of the scheme, that it does not and cannot do anything to relieve any member of the inalienable obligation to keep his own house in financial order and to procure imports by the old and essential method of maintaining a sufficient volume of exports to appropriate places on an efficient and competitive basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>A very relative term.  I do not think I will be anything like quarter as long as the Minister. This year, the Minister is turning to provision for the Shannon airport and apparently the same idea is being pursued.  There was a certain amount of ridicule here last year in finding that our hopes were based entirely on tourist development.  One wondered if the tourists were to come here to be transported over a derelict transport concern, to look at the ravages of poverty and disease, and to take a side glance at the prisons where, according to the Minister for Justice, the number of occupants leaves us in the position of stabilising crime at twice what it was before the war.  Possibly the Minister will tell us what advantage financially this country is going to get from the expenditure of £1,000,000 upon the Shannon airport and the concreting of runways around Dublin at a cost of something approaching another £400,000?</P>
      <P>After that, as far as this Budget is concerned, the next relief that is granted is in relation to matches.  One firm is to get remission of the duty on matches and the promise to the consumer is, not matches at a cheaper rate but matches in more reasonable quantities at the same rate.  The only other relief that is proposed for the hard-pressed community is that the transport concern, which was set up under such magnificent auspices here recently and with such laudatory comments as to its possibilities in the future, is to be relieved from the impact of corporation profits duty and excess corporation profits duty, if it should ever earn enough to get inside that class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the only hope that is contained in the Budget is the Minister's view that the situation has now reached a point when we may begin to think of the demobilisation of the Army without interfering with national security.  The Minister will find that, as usual, his time lag in the appreciation of that point of view is somewhere in the neighbourhood of one year to two years behind that of other people.  He also tells us, in a flight of great imagination, that plans are being <Col N="57" /> formed which it is hoped will result in turf being produced for this community which will be a satisfactory fuel and will be produced for an economic price.  It has taken five years to bring the Minister even to promise that plans are being formed which it is hoped will have that result. It is no wonder, when he looks back upon the hardship that has been put upon the community by unsatisfactory fuel at a shocking price, that he should have moved very hastily away from that, without giving any idea as to why these hopes are better formed than the realisation of hopes has been in the past.  Outside those things, the Minister neither gives us the promise of relief immediately in this Budget nor any hope of relief in the early future.</P>
    <P>Certain people, of course, are going to be kept well in a favoured position. The upward trend of profits is considered so certain that the Minister budgets for a big increase in his revenue arising from these profits.  He states what he thinks of Irish industry and of the amount of money there is in it.  Quite recently, in the Seanad, when this matter was discussed, the question was put to the Minister as to whether he believed that there were millions of pounds held and stored in reserve by Irish industrialists and he replied that not merely did he believe it but he knew it, and he hopes it will continue for the next year.  He will gain a little bit of extra revenue from this upward trend of profits which, he presumes, is going to continue during the year.</P>
    <P>Beyond that, the Minister has given us as a new weapon this year figures which really show the difficult position in this country in a better way than it has ever been known.  On page 35 he goes into calculations of national income and shows the rise from £150,000,000 in 1938 to £250,000,000 in 1944.  Then he says that, of course, &ldquo;it should suffice to say that the increase in national income is purely a monetary phenomenon;&rdquo; so at least we have accepted now what has been said often in this year and has been as often denied from Government Benches.  The Minister for Supplies and his colleagues will tell us <Col N="58" /> we can still get 20/- for the £.  He accepts that still, and you can still get two sixpences out of a shilling.  The Budget statement shows that we have now £250,000,000, so to speak, of national income.  At least, it is put under the heading of &ldquo;pounds&rdquo;.  In the year 1938, it was £150,000,000, and now it has jumped to £250,000,000, and if any man were to delude himself by thinking that because he has £5 in his pocket, and thinking in the terminology of half-sovereigns, that he now has £10, his reasoning would be something like that of the Minister for Finance now, but if he has to purchase goods and pay for them, he will very soon know what is the purchasing power of that money.  However, that is one side of the question.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that the increase in the cost of living is about 70 per cent., while the increases given in certain directions on salaries is 60 per cent., and he also points out that there has been a decrease in the consumption of goods, other than foodstuffs. He also says that what the financiers call the dead-weight debt of this country is somewhere in the neighbourhood of £100,000,000.  So, here we are.  The community, so to speak, has been put on half-pay since the war started, despite the rise in the prices of various commodities, and yet the Minister for Finance solaces himself this year as, indeed, he did last year, by saying that, judging by the pressure to which the Minister for Finance is subjected from many quarters to reduce taxation, even though the shoe pinches in more than one place, so far it has been without causing actual lameness.  Last year I asked how far the shoe pinched without causing loss to the community, and I asked, particularly, what the stabilisation of the cost-of-living bonus of the civil servants in 1940 would mean, and I was told that it would mean about £1,000,000 a year.  In other words, that is the loot that has been gathered in from the civil servants by reason of the way in which the cost of living has been allowed to grow without any corresponding increase to compensate these people.  Let us remember how <Col N="59" /> that has been allowed to occur.  Many years ago the Taoiseach addressed the civil servants and told them:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In my opinion, it would be a bad thing for Labour to agree to get rid of the sliding scale.  I am as certain as I am standing here that world prices are going to go up and that the cost of living will go up, and when prices do go up it is a great boon to civil servants to know that salaries will go up to meet the cost of living&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In respect of that class of the community, the Secretary of the Department of Finance, in 1931, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Civil servants have made an outstanding contribution to national economy.  The cumulative saving thereby effected in Civil Service pay since 1922 is nearly £2,000,000.  No other section of the community has so substantially contributed to national economy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That saving of £2,000,000, of course, was effected by reason of the fact that, while the cost-of-living bonus went down, or was stabilised, the cost of living went up, and that to a certain extent their emoluments were so fixed as to enable them to keep pace with the cost of living as it increased or decreased.  The Taoiseach gave them the promise, having asked them to hang on to the cost-of-living figure, that their salaries would go up according as the cost-of-living figure went up, and that it would be a great boon to have their salaries so related to the cost-of-living figure.  Then we had the stabilisation of the cost-of-living bonus, bringing in a saving of £1,000,000 a year.  Recently, however, we had the case of a deputation to the Taoiseach from the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, asking for an increase in their remuneration as a result of the increased cost of living, and they were told by the Taoiseach that they could not get any increase because the teachers' remuneration was not formally or directly governed by the cost-of-living figure.  It is a pity that it was not because, if so, they would have been told by the Taoiseach that it would have been a great boon to them; but here, when they recently <Col N="60" /> went to the Government, they were told that their salaries were not governed formally or directly by the cost-of-living figure and that, therefore, there could be no cost-of-living bonus; whereas the civil servants were told that they would be deprived of an increase in the bonus because of the emergency.  I wanted to raise the question to-day of the national teachers as an index of the hardships inflicted on the middle classes of this community and the workers in this country&mdash;those who have to depend on their wages at the end of the week for services every day and who have had their wages or salaries controlled by the standstill Order.  Possibly, it will be a satisfaction to the civil servants, the national teachers, and so on, to know that some of the millions of pounds that have been raked in from them have been given to the development of industry in this country and that the Minister hopes that the upward trend in industry will continue so that he will be able to get a little extra in revenue.  Then, at the end of his Budget Statement, the Minister indicates that, with the usual time-lag, he has now come to the conclusion that various movements with regard to international trade may be of value to this country; and that certain committees or commissions are sitting dealing with these matters which may be of interest and have relevance to the needs of our community here.</P>
    <P>He has told us that we must balance our imports, the imports we require, by exports on an efficient and competitive basis.  It is a pity the Budget does not contain some indication of what the Minister has done to see that whatever goods we have to export will be allowed to enter the places which require them.  One sees around the world arrangements being entered into with Great Britain on a five, six and eight years' basis for the provision to Great Britain of the particular foodstuffs in which we are competitive.  We have yet to learn that any approach has been made to Great Britain with regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>People recently have been writing to the newspapers to know what is our situation with regard to the holding <Col N="61" /> of moneys other than sterling.  If we require goods from America, have we any store of dollars for the purpose? Apparently the Minister for Supplies, round about the new year, began to appreciate that the old conditions under which sterling was freely exchangeable into dollars no longer hold and are not likely to hold in the future, but have any steps been taken to find out what amount of our exports can be diverted, or must be diverted, to countries outside the sterling areas and what are our resources in the way of holdings of these other currencies for the purpose of purchase?  Can we send exports to these countries to get the necessary currency and, if not, what are we going to do?</P>
    <P>During the war, we have worked on a policy of piling up assets of a sterling type in England.  Again, about the new year, the realisation hit members of the Government that it was possible that we would not be able to cash in on these resources at once and might not be able to cash in on them for many years, and apparently now there is a realisation that we may have to take whatever goods England likes to send us.  There is also a realisation that the goods we require are what are called capital goods and that we may be fobbed off with ordinary consumer goods.  Finally, there is dawning on the Government the realisation that for any pound we have packed away abroad in sterling assets we may hereafter be fobbed off with a payment of about 10/-.  Are we, notwithstanding that, going to continue a policy of piling up these credits abroad without knowing whether they are to be frozen, for how long they are to be frozen and when they will eventually be liquidated and in what manner?</P>
    <P>So far as the internal situation is concerned, the Minister has quoted Sir William Beveridge.  He has contented himself, in the main, with referring to his proposals with regard to social security, but surely the Minister must know that Sir William Beveridge's plan is in two: he talks of the conditions required for a decent community in the future in the way of social standards, standards of living, but he also <Col N="62" /> has projected for what is called full employment.  The two plans are conjoint. So far as I understand his plan, he has no belief whatever that the amenities of social life which he wants to give to the people of England can be obtained unless there is something in the way of full employment.  He has his plans for full employment and it was only as late as the year 1939 that there was any scientific approach to the problem of employment and unemployment and it was generally appreciated by most of the decent countries all over the world that there could only be full employment, or something approaching full employment, if there was effective demand, that if there is a deficiency in demand, it leads to unemployment.</P>
    <P>One again would have expected to feel that there was some realisation of that in the Minister's mind and that he would have told us, even though it was something projected in the future, what were his plans for increasing production in this country.  We have had in relation to this tot of £52,000,000 with which we are being charged nationally, some reference to moneys to the extent of £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 which are called aids to development &mdash;most of them in connection with housing and some others in connection with roads; but we have not heard of moneys being provided or of plans being made directly affecting production, and particularly agricultural production.  The Minister knows that without an increase in national income, in real national income, it will not be possible to have any of the benefits which neighbouring countries propose to give their citizens.</P>
    <P>We know that, lying as close as we do to these countries, there will be a mass invitation to our people to go over there.  We have seen from speeches made in England since the recent Budget there that one of the matters about which they are concerned is that they have not available a sufficiently large labour supply, and I suppose that any man would at least come to this conclusion, that if they have not a big enough labour supply and if we have more than we can <Col N="63" /> occupy at decent wages, there will be started again the outflow of emigration which has always been bewailed in this country.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding all that, the Minister presents us with this Budget.  He tells us of the £100,000,000 which we have piled up more or less as deadweight debt, but he does not tell us that he intends to spend another £100,000,000 which we would like to hear was to be spent so long as it was devoted to productive purposes and so long as it was possible to say there would be some return.  All we get are some trifling reliefs in respect of the box of matches and in relation to Córas Iompair Éireann in connection with something which may never arise.</P>
    <P>The Minister in this Budget has failed, as he failed in every Budget since he took over, and it is lamentable that he leaves this country now merely with the realisation that under a series of controls, finance, economy, development, he and his colleagues have been responsible for bringing us to the condition where actual income has declined.  It was declining before the war started in relation to the cost of living and has declined seriously since then and the Minister does not show us that there is any means whatever present to his mind for reversing that position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in his Budget statement last year, gave it as his opinion that taxation had reached saturation point.  Yet this year we have still further increases. How does the Minister reconcile these two positions and in what way does he hold that the taxable capacity of the people, the income of the vast majority of taxpayers, has increased sufficiently to warrant the further increase this year?  We had all hoped that, at the very least, taxation would be stabilised, or kept at a steady level, but we are faced instead with increases again this year.  I wonder when are matters to be levelled out.  Now that the end of the hostilities in Europe is in sight, the Government should exercise the most rigid economy in relation <Col N="64" /> to all expenditure and should keep down all needless expenditure, because we shall be facing a very difficult period in the next five years.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the farmers and said that farmers as a class have got off lightly.  He took very good care not to mention the increased costs which farmers have to bear&mdash;increased costs in respect of fertilisers, labour, fuel, machinery and machinery repairs, not to mention the stab in the back they got about this time last year from the Minister for Supplies in the cutting of the price of wool by one-third. The Minister on many occasions has tried to convince the House and the country that farmers are a very well-to-do class and what often struck me is why, if they are so well-to-do, if farming is such a profitable occupation, the Minister has not left his comfortable seat and taken up farming as a living.  Perhaps he may do so in the near future.</P>

      <P>We on these benches have made a few efforts, in response to his repeated calls, to show the Minister ways in which expenditure could be cut down, but each time we have made an honest effort to suggest ways in which it could be clipped, we have been met with nothing but opposition and ridicule from the Government Benches.  I cannot see the use of making any further suggestions.</P>
      <P>The Minister is faced with one or other of two situations.  He sheds tears occasionally because he has to increase taxation, and, at the same time, admits failure to cut it down. There is only one other way in which to do it, that is, to increase the remuneration of those who are the principal taxpayers who, I maintain, are the farmers.  They are the only producers in the country and all taxation in the final analysis must come from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards emigration, the Minister admitted that we here are in a different position from the country <Col N="65" /> across the water.  He admitted that, as compared with England, a far smaller number of our people between, say, the ages of 16 to 18 are at work here.  That is nothing new.  It is due to the fact that our young people are leaving this country and going across the water.  No genuine attempt has ever been made to stop emigration.  As the last speaker said, if the Government advocated the spending of £100,000,000 on production, this Party and, I suppose, every other Party in the House would welcome it.  It is the only way in which we can ever succeed in keeping our young manhood and young womanhood from going to America or to England.  I imagine that, if the ports were open in the morning, there would not be enough ships to accommodate all who would leave our shores.  The only way to tackle that problem is to have big sums of money put into production.  If that were done, it would help to keep our young people at home.  A proposal for expenditure of that kind would get the backing of every member of the House.  We have been enjoying self-government now for a good many years.  It was hoped that one of the first things we would do when we got our freedom was to make an effort to stop emigration, or at least ease it off. No genuine effort seems to have been made in that direction, and hence I say the Government have clearly failed to stem this tide of emigration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister treated us to a lengthy exposition of his views on the national financial position. After hearing his views on that matter, I think we can describe the Minister's Budget as a standstill Budget, standstill not merely because of the fact that it imposes no new taxation of a considerable character, but a standstill Budget in ideas as well.  So far as his Budget speech is concerned, the Minister, apparently, has not a single new idea with which to approach the future, or to apply to the very serious problems which are likely to arise in the future.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce recently delivered a speech to the Cork Chamber of Commerce. It was one of those ambitious <Col N="66" /> speeches which the Minister makes from time to time to unquestioning audiences; one in which the Minister painted a picture of an Utopia on which his colleague, the Minister for Finance, poured ridicule to-day.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce talked about the desirability of full employment. He gave the impression that it was the Government's policy to aim at the implementation of a policy of full employment.  One would imagine that the introduction of the budget was an occasion which would be availed of by the Minister for Finance to indicate the precise manner in which the Government's policy of full employment was to be given effect.  I have searched through the 43 pages of the Budget statement of the Minister for Finance, and I cannot find a single sentence which makes any reference whatever to the Government's intention to promote a policy of full employment. The Government's only policy appears to be to promote full employment for the Irish in Great Britain. That is where we are implementing our policy of full employment&mdash;by failing to provide employment for our people at home.  We are doing that by the issue of permits to those of our people who have in Britain the employment which they were once promised here by this Government.  When the Minister for Industry and Commerce goes to Cork, or elsewhere, to indicate the Government's policy of a full employment scheme he, at least, ought to make sure that his colleague, the Minister for Finance, will be prepared to indicate, in a subsequent Budget statement, the manner in which a full employment policy will be given effect to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Budget is not merely a standstill Budget from the point of view of taxation and ideas, but it is pretty liberally seasoned with the mentality that this country has got to stay as it is.  The Minister for Finance has told us that the social services are costing approximately £9,600,000. When one reads the Minister's statement carefully one sees that the Minister's approach to that fact, and to the social services generally, is with the mentality that we cannot spend any more money on social services.  The <Col N="67" /> Minister must know, of course, that it is necessary for us to spend £9,600,000 on social services because of the large amount of unemployment which exists here, because of the high prices which prevail here and because of the Government's low-wage policy.  That sum of £9,600,000 is required largely because of the fact that there is a considerable stratum of our people unemployed, that there is a considerable stratum of poverty throughout the country, and because of the fact that it is necessary for us to spend that sum in order to try to apply some salve to the economic abscesses which are permitted to grow unchecked in this country. One would imagine that if the Government lament the fact that the social services are costing so much, an effort would be made to avoid that expenditure, or, at least, such portions of that sum as it is now necessary to apply for the relief of poverty, by providing work and decent wages for those who are not able to get work or decent wages to-day.</P>
    <P>I think that everyone who is concerned with the well-being of this country and with the standard of life here, will acknowledge at once that there is no effective substitute for employment. The provision of employment means the creation of wealth.  A nation can only live on what it produces. There is nothing else on which it can live.  If we are going to create a situation here in which we can produce an abundance of wealth which will sustain our people on a better standard of living than that which obtains to-day, then we can only do that by developing the nation's resources to the fullest, and by implementing a policy of full employment for all.  I gathered, listening to the Minister's speech, that he seemed to take considerable satisfaction in saying that certain sums would be spent on the provision of employment this year.  In the main, the same sums were spent on the provision of employment last year, but notwithstanding the expenditure on employment last year, and of similar expenditure on the provision of employment this year, we were not able last year, and I suggest <Col N="68" /> that we will not be able this year, to absorb all the persons seeking employment here.</P>
    <P>Every week last year, the employment exchanges registered the fact that there were 70,000 people, odd, unemployed and we were, apparently, satisfied with a condition of national economy in which 70,000 persons remained unemployed for 52 weeks of the year.  That number would have been very much larger were it not that, during a substantial portion of the year, we were issuing permits to others who would normally be employed here to go to Britain for work they could not get at home. Therefore, we have got this position: we have unemployment provision in this Budget which is of an utterly inadequate character, unemployment provision which still leaves a hard core of 70,000 unemployed people at the labour exchanges each week and we are, apparently, satisfied, if the Minister's speech represents Government policy, that that situation should continue and that 70,000 unemployed persons, able and willing to work in an undeveloped country, should be denied an opportunity of working in their own land.  That is the position to-day.</P>
    <P>We are told by the Minister that there is to be early and orderly demobilisation from the Army.  We may have 30,000 men catapulted out of the Army within the next few months. Where are they to go?  Are they to go into employment?  Are they to go to the employment exchanges to get unemployment benefit or are they to go there when their gratuities are exhausted?  Is there any provision for re-settling those men in industry or anywhere else?  I suggest that what the Government will do with those people who are discharged from the Army is provide them with a gratuity and the right to obtain unemployment benefit and take no further interest in them.  I expect that 30,000 of them will be looking for jobs before this year is out.  That will be 30,000 in addition to the 70,000 whom we already have.  What about the returned emigrants, then?  The Minister told us that the national income takes cognisance <Col N="69" /> of the fact that emigrants' remittances amount to £13,500,000, the prewar figure under that head being approximately £3,000,000.  Then, he went on to say that, at the conclusion of hostilities, it was quite likely that the £13,500,000 would move back to £3,000,000.  As the £13,500,000 moves back to £3,000,000, so will the emigrants move back here.  What do we propose to do in that situation?  We have a hard core of unemployment, represented by 70,000 persons at present.  We shall have, in all probability, 30,000 men demobilised from the Army.  What of the impact on our economic and employment position when large numbers of these emigrants come back at the conclusion of hostilities in Britain, because of lack of opportunity for employment there?</P>
    <P>Recently I asked the Taoiseach to say how many people obtained permits to go to Britain to employment since 1940.  I was told that, approximately, 170,000 persons got permits to go to employment in Great Britain and Northern Ireland since 1940.  This is a substantial number of people&mdash;people who would normally be anchored to life in this country.  Many of them have homes and relations here and are anxious to come back.  Many of them will, doubtless, endeavour to come back when the war is over.  Many may have no choice but to come back. Have we any proposals for dealing with that problem?  There is none in the Budget.  The Minister ought to tell us what his Government proposes to do, particularly after the speech by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in which he said that the Government believed in a policy of full employment.  Where is the policy and when is it to be implemented?  In his Budget statement the Minister mentioned that prices had risen over 70 per cent. since 1939.  From a currency point of view, he said, this compared unfavourably with the 30 per cent.  increase in the United Kingdom and, in the interest of maintaining the internal and external purchasing power of our money, it was very desirable that an appreciable downward movement in this index should be secured.  Secured by whom?  Who <Col N="70" /> is to carry out this pious intention of securing an appreciable downward movement in the index figure?  With the Government in control, the House cannot do it.  The consumer cannot do it.  The public at large cannot do it.  This policy can only be implemented by Government action.  When the Minister puts a statement like that in his Budget speech, he should tell us what steps the Government propose to take to implement the idea which, he admits, is desirable in the national interest.</P>
    <P>As Deputy McGilligan said, I do not think that the Government have any interest whatever in curtailing the rise in prices.  As the Budget indicates, they have a natural interest in allowing prices to remain at their present level.  The Government collected £4,000,000 in the form of corporation profits tax.  That was collected from firms who made profits in excess of what this House and the country believed they were entitled to make and the calculation was a very generous one.  The State is collecting £4,000,000 from the profit-making class &mdash;the excess profit-making class&mdash;and it is permitting the cost-of-living index figure remain 70 per cent. higher than it was in 1939.  I put it to the Minister that there is an easy way of applying a remedy to the high cost of living in respect of a large range of commodities, that is, by conducting a searching inquiry into these excess profits and by compelling those who are making exorbitant profits to plough them back, so as to effect a reduction in the price level.  So long as the Minister requires £4,000,000 for his Budget, he is perfectly satisfied to allow the public to be &ldquo;salted&rdquo; by profit makers.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, this is a dull Budget.  It will be welcomed by the profiteers who will again get away with their swag during the coming year.  It makes no provision for the development of our economic resources, for the implementation of a policy of full employment or for the building up of a code of social services which will provide reasonable treatment for helpless sections of the community and it shows no appreciation whatever of the serious situation which <Col N="71" /> will confront the country when tens of thousands of our people who went to Britain during the last five years come back this year and next year and claim their natural right to work for a living in their own land.</P>

Deputy Blowick, the leader of Clann na Talmhan, said to-day and rightly said, that, in the last analysis, the source of the national income in this country is the land, and that, unless that economic fact is appreciated and unless due regard is had to it, no plan for the rehabilitation of the country can succeed.  Deputy Blowick did not elaborate that and I venture to say that he did not elaborate it because he was afraid of Deputy Cogan, sitting beside him.  The land is the ultimate source of income in this country so long as a profit can be earned by those who live upon it.  The produce of our land is sufficient to provide our people with all the food they are capable of consuming, assuming that everybody in this country will get enough, and then there are 7,000,000 acres of land over and above.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite aware of that, but I propose to speak now on the first Resolution.  The first Resolution makes provision in regard to income-tax. It is very necessary to ascertain clearly what sections of the community that Resolution is going to touch.  I think it will be agreed by all sections in this House that it is eminently desirable that the largest possible proportion of the community should be liable to income-tax by the measure of their earnings.  The more people who have to pay income-tax in this country, the lower will be the rate of income-tax necessary in order to raise the revenue requisite for the Minister's purposes.  If we could secure that the income of every individual in this State reached the level at which income-tax would be levied, I think the House would agree that we could fix, instead of 7/6 in the £, a rate perhaps as low as 5/- in the £. The reason it is necessary to fix a rate of 7/6 is that so small a section of our community are earning incomes which make them subject to income-tax.  The vast majority of our people are not paying income-tax because their incomes are not sufficiently high.  I want to make some <Col N="74" /> proposals which will operate to reduce the standard rate of income-tax by bringing within the ambit of the tax a very much larger section of the community than is at present liable.  The first thing necessary to bring a larger section of the community within the ambit of the income-tax laws is to ensure that a larger section of the community shall enjoy a larger income than they have at present.  The only way a person can secure an income in this country, if he is not a wage-earner, is to earn a profit in his trade or business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I want to bring a particular section of the community into the ranks of the income-tax payers of the country, I think, naturally, of the largest section, whose introduction into the ranks of income-tax payers would provide the largest measure of relief. The largest section of the community are those who live on the land.  I want to secure a situation in which every farmer will be earning so large an income and so high a profit on the land he works that he will come to have an income as high as those who are at present paying income-tax.  What is the farmer's profit?  What is this fund we seek to raise?  What is this fund we seek to increase?  The farmer's profit is the difference between his cost of production and the price he gets for his finished product.  In this country we could control the price that is paid for farm produce if our farm produce came from no larger area than 5,000,000 acres, but the farmers of this country live on 12,000,000 acres, so that we have got to dispose outside of Ireland of the produce of 7,000,000 acres if the farmers are to make a profit.  The only place in which they can dispose of their produce, bitter experience teaches us, is Great Britain.  Now, there is no use deceiving ourselves that we can raise the price of agricultural produce in Great Britain, because we cannot.  We have got to take in Great Britain the best price we can get for our agricultural produce.  If we bear in mind that the farmer's profit is the difference between that price in Great Britain and the cost of production, and <Col N="75" /> if we realise that we cannot raise that price in Great Britain, we must ask ourselves is there any other means by which we can increase the farmer's profit.  I suggest to the House that, inasmuch as profit is the difference between the cost of production and the price realised, if we cannot raise the price and thus increase the profit, we can bring down the cost of production and that will have the same effect.</P>
    <P>To that end, therefore, and in order to raise the income of the farmers to a level which would bring them within the ambit of this Financial Resolution, I ask the Minister for Finance where is there in his Budget any proposal to achieve this purpose?  I suggest to him that unless and until he brings forward concrete proposals to reduce the cost of production for the agricultural community and thus increase their profits and their incomes, every other effort to rehabilitate financial and social conditions in this country is futile.  So long as the Minister retains taxes on the raw materials of the agricultural industry, he is making permanent a condition which renders it impossible for the farmers living on the land to earn the profit they should have and makes it permanently impossible for them to reach the level of income which he should desire.  What is worse, so long as that situation continues every other scheme he has in mind is hamstrung by the inescapable fact that the one ultimate source of real profit in this country is made profitless and that all other elements in the community must, under this Resolution, bear an undue share of the tax burden or, if they are wage-earners, fail to get in their own country that measure of employment which would relieve the social services of the country and thus render the taxation under this particular Financial Resolution less burdensome than it already is.</P>
    <P>There is the fundamental fact underlying the whole budgetary position of this State; there is the fundamental fact to which no Deputy&mdash;the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader <Col N="76" /> of Clann na Talmhan, or the Leader of the Labour Party&mdash;made any reference whatever.  It is one fact to which the Minister for Finance made no reference, and I challenge him in the course of his concluding observations to say if it is his intention to remove from the raw materials of the agricultural industry, the taxes, restrictions and quotas that have increased costs, and thereby diminished farmers' profits, or is it his intention to leave them on?  If he takes them off, we can begin to go places; if he leaves them on, all the Budget statement is moonshine, because the ultimate source of the entire national income is being dried up, without which no section of our community will survive, leaving nothing behind it but poverty and degradation.  Let the Minister take the requisite measures, remove taxation and restore to those who live on the land, their ability to make profits.  We can then plan and achieve the purposes that have been referred to in the various speeches made to-day.</P>

      <P>I heard the Minister's Budget statement clearly, but perhaps he would be kind enough to give the House certain further information.  Is it not unusual to give an <i>ad hoc</i> subsidy to one firm in respect to matches? Is the Minister in a position to say if the Prices Commission have conducted a careful inquiry into the profits of this match company, and required the company to make a fair contribution in regard to the price of matches, before it is proposed to give them a State subsidy of £53,000 a year?  Is there any precedent for giving that firm a subsidy of £53,000?</P>

When everything was gone into, I am satisfied, in order to keep the industry going, that it is the barest justice to them to reduce the excise duty by this amount. The prices section of the Department of Supplies went into this to the fullest possible extent at my request, and into all figures relating to the cost of production in this case.</P>

The Minister stated that part of the money is going to be used for the relief of wholesalers and retailers.  If the House is to be asked by this Resolution to provide this money, it ought to be told how much is going to the proprietors of the match company and how much is going to wholesalers and distributors. It ought further be given an undertaking by the Minister for Finance that he would keep the whole finance under review, to ensure an equitable division between the three parties mentioned as long as this concession extends to the match company.

      <P>I am wondering if on this question the Minister has told us all the facts.  Is this the position, that if the price of matches is increased to the public the result will be that a certain sum of money will be brought in and that there will be a very substantial <Col N="81" /> increase in profits?  Would a very small increase result in a tremendous increase in the amount of money received?  That seems to me to be a possibility the Minister has not mentioned. I wish to associate myself with what other Deputies said, that this is a most undesirable precedent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>To increase matches by even a halfpenny per box would be costly on consumers and would bring in a much larger revenue to the company than at present.  It would meet the problem.  We think the company should get this.  We do not think it possible to ask consumers to pay an additional amount for matches.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>When concluding on Friday last, I was emphasising the position to which the primary teacher had been reduced in this country, as instanced by the fact that the parent teacher was no longer allowing any member of his family to enter the profession and that parents as a whole were not allowing their children to take up teaching as a profession but were diverting them to other channels. In amplification of that, to-day I say that it is a serious position so far as education generally is concerned and that we are fast heading for a state of affairs in which the children will be denied the services of the expert teacher, which is their natural right. We are heading for a position in which there will be an inferior type of candidate for the training colleges and I am informed that the rot in that particular direction has already set in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="84" /> The real cause of the trouble so far as this vexed question of salaries is concerned is, in my opinion, due to the attitude of the Government, since it has taken office, in attempting to relate the teacher's salary to a scale that was generally agreed to be wretched and inadequate, as indicated by the large number of teachers who receive pensions of not more than £1 a week.  Instead of the Government trying to adopt a new line so far as the salary question was concerned, there has been a strict adherence to that outmoded policy.  My view is that there should have been a general break from that position and that the teacher should be compensated on the basis of the work he performs and the value of that work to the nation.  In this respect, it is appropriate to ask why is it that there is discrimination all along the line against the primary teacher, who may be regarded, in every sense of the word, as a State servant?  Why is he treated on a different basis from the civil servant, or even, within the teaching world, on a different and more unfavourable basis from those engaged in vocational, secondary and university education? In my opinion, none of these three could function if it were not for the work of the primary teacher.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that we are heading to a crisis so far as our teachers are concerned.  I regard the position as serious, and because it is serious, I am suggesting to the Minister that before he concludes this debate he will give some indication of easement so far as the salary question is concerned.  There is evidence, unfortunately, that the patience of the teachers is becoming exhausted and that they are prepared to thrust aside pride and discipline in a vigorous effort to right their position.  I suggest that there might be serious reactions so far as education generally is concerned from such a course.  I am loath to believe that the Minister is personally opposed to an uplift so far as teachers' salaries are concerned. In fact, I should think that, because of his close personal association in his earlier days with the teaching profession, his sympathies would lie the other <Col N="85" /> way, but I do ask him now to take his courage in his hands, to consult the Taoiseach and the Cabinet and introduce here, without undue delay, a standard of salaries that will give proper compensation to the teachers for their work and that will, once and for all, put this vexed question of salaries outside the realm of public controversy.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the question of salaries, might I remind the Minister of another condition of service imposed on the teacher which I regard as archaic?  I believe it has been referred to here on previous occasions.  It is the regulation imposing on the teacher, after 31 days' absence from his school owing to illness, the obligation to employ a substitute at his own expense for any period over the period of 31 days.  Again I refer to the practice in the Civil Service and in ordinary commercial life and once again I ask, why is it that discrimination is exercised against the primary teacher in this respect as against all other sections of the public service? I may also remind the Minister&mdash;as indicating that it will not unduly upset budgetary or financial relations&mdash;that the removal of this disability would cost the State only between £6,000 and £10,000 a year.  I suggest to the Minister the necessity for removing that disability forthwith.</P>
    <P>On the question of the heating of schools, I understand the regulations are that 50 per cent. of the cost is borne by the Department and 50 per cent. by the managers of the schools, but if the 50 per cent. contribution is not available from the local manager&mdash; in many cases it is not available because of the circumstances of poverty which operate in particular parishes&mdash; apparently there is no easement of the position so far as enabling the schools to have proper heating is concerned. So far as I can see, the Department simply allows such a situation to take its own course.  Last winter, in the City of Dublin, when we had a very hard and bitter spell of weather, it was quite a common thing, in a number of the schools in any case, to see this picture of primary education in operation: in dreary buildings a number of <Col N="86" /> teachers with their overcoats on imparting education to children a number of whom were badly fed, others badly clad and the whole of them frozen with the cold.  I understand that a census which was taken showed that in that period no fewer than 8,000 of our children in the city suffered.  Again, I ask why is it that in this year 1945 only our primary schools can be subjected to treatment of that particular character?  You have proper heating in the vocational schools; you have proper heating in the secondary schools, and I am sure you are bound to have it in the universities, but in the primary schools, the foundation of them all, the picture that I have given you is unfortunately not overdrawn.  I suggest to the Minister that, where the local contribution cannot be met, such a case should be dealt with on the basis of a full grant from the State.  The importance of primary education makes it necessary that it should be conducted under the most congenial conditions.</P>
    <P>One final word so far as primary education is concerned: last year the Minister referred to the fact that 1,000 schools required to be rebuilt; 500 were so bad that they needed immediate attention, and 1,500 required considerable repairs.  The Minister and his Department deserve congratulation for the considerable advance which has been made in that position so far as Dublin City is concerned, but I would remind him that there are still some black spots.  The education of a number of children in this city&mdash;I am sure the Minister knows this&mdash;is still being conducted in the crypt of an old church.  Such a state of affairs should not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>I will leave primary education, with those criticisms, and turn for a moment to technical education. Because of the criticisms which I felt it necessary to make with regard to primary education, I am glad to be able to present a more pleasing picture here.  In Dublin in any case, of which I have personal knowledge.  I am pleased to say that technical education is on the right lines.  We have a number <Col N="87" /> of magnificent schools, splendidly equipped, and manned by an excellent staff.  I am glad to say that the whole system is receiving from the Department a measure of active sympathy and co-operation, which is all that might be desired.  I should like to say that a good deal of that co-operation, that sympathetic attention, is in no small measure due to the magnificent standard of administration set by a former chief inspector of the Minister's Department.  I would express the hope that the influence which he spread over that whole section will be continued.  As a supplement to the picture I have given of technical education in Dublin, I should like to say in conclusion that we have at all times found the Minister himself sympathetic and anxious to conduct negotiations with the local committee.  In view of my previous criticisms, I feel that I should pay that compliment to the Minister.</P>

      <P>We are asked here to vote out of public funds £5,500,000 for education.  We are asked to provide the sum of £4,500,000 for primary education.  Our function here is definitely to ensure, when we vote away the people's money, that the people are getting reasonable value for it.  Particularly, when we vote away enormous sums of public money for the education of the youth of the country, we should ensure that at least the parents, who are the taxpayers, are reasonably satisfied that their children are, in fact, being educated.  To my mind, there is a vast difference between instruction and education. Nobody questions the fact that the children in our primary schools systematically receive so many hours instruction every day; that the syllabus is adhered to, and the face of the clock respected.  But what parents are concerned about, and what Parliament should be concerned about, is the result.  Is education, in the broad and general sense, advancing, or is it going back?  As a result of observations, as a result of contacts, as a result of what I read, and as a result of information gleaned from those I <Col N="88" /> meet, whether in professorial life, in business life, in professional life, or a fair cross section of the parents of this country, I am bound to say that there is thorough and absolute dissatisfaction with our present educational results. The Taoiseach established a commission selected by himself, a commission of experienced men, reasonably mixed with regard to their knowledge of life, their experience and their contacts. That commission, the Vocational Commission, sat throughout a very lengthy period, and carried out their work conscientiously and energetically.  It was presided over by a very distinguished Irish Bishop, who himself could rightly be regarded as an authority on education.  That commission felt bound to report the complete dissatisfaction of the parents with the education being given to their children. The teachers themselves inquired at great length into the same subject and the teachers, on behalf of the parents, again reported that parents are entirely dissatisfied with the results being obtained from the millions we are voting.  Businessmen will tell you that in recent years the type of young recruit they are getting is best described, from their point of view, as nearly totally uneducated. Time and again I have listened to discussions and ordinary conversations between people engaged in secondary and university education and, in recent years, every time such a group get together and discuss education they will always come round to the same point where they deplore the evidence of retrogression in the type of students coming up to them from below.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no great confidence or no enthusiasm in raising this particular question here because for 13 years back we have been met in this House by a kind of sphinx-like immobility, the kind of force and strength that comes from weighty inertia.  Having experience of that kind of very heavy indifference, it is with no enthusiasm, with no confidence, or with no hope of anything resulting that one approaches such a subject <i>vis-a-vis</i> the present Minister.  We had here last week a discussion on a motion which suggested <Col N="89" /> that some advisory council should be brought into being so as to advise on this immensely important question of education.  We had the parrot-like reply that we have been hearing for years.  We had this Vocational Commission brushed aside. They know nothing; the political chief and the permanent advisers know all. We had the teachers' own report treated with equally scant courtesy. Nevertheless, some of us here remember, before the customary somersault was done, the Taoiseach standing up in that bench some seven years ago and telling us he was entirely dissatisfied with or felt rather uneasy at the results being obtained and that he felt that some commission should inquire into these results.  However, be that as it may.  There is ample evidence up and down this country that parents are dissatisfied with the outcrop from our schools; that the children are not being fairly equipped for the life they have to face afterwards and that the educational standards of the country generally are dropping.</P>
    <P>Under the Constitution we are bound&mdash;and the Minister is the instrument to carry it out&mdash;to ensure that the youth of the country gets proper education and proper facilities for being educated.  If there is dissatisfaction on the part of the general run of parents, or if distinguished authorities on educational matters that are called on by the Government and Parliament to inquire into the matter report adversely, then there is a responsibility on the Minister and on the Government to have the whole matter exhaustively inquired into.  When that particular request is made to the Government by such a body and when that is endorsed and followed up by a similar appeal on behalf of the organised teaching profession who say that things are bad, that children are not being properly educated, that the rule of the Department is interfering with the education of children, or depriving some of them of education, then we have got to lean back and consider whether we are not, in fact, violating the rights given under the Constitution and whether others of us here are entitled lightly to trip through the <Col N="90" /> Lobbies and vote another £5,500,000 of public funds for a purpose that is not being achieved.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, the teachers, 15 years or so after the policy was adopted of endeavouring to teach the young population principally through the Irish language&mdash;a policy that, at its inception, was heartily and enthusiastically endorsed and demanded by a very high percentage of teachers&mdash; being conscientious, high-minded professional people with a sense of responsibility and observing the results and feeling, perhaps, uneasy at the finished product, themselves carried out a very lengthy and detailed inquiry into whether that policy was or was not having an adverse effect on education.  That particular inquiry was confined to teachers who were sufficiently competent in the Irish language to teach through that language. After years of investigation they submitted their report.  I am not sufficiently intimate with the subject to say whether the findings in the report were, in fact, correct or otherwise, but I am sufficiently conversant with what the functions and even the normal courtesy of a Minister should be to know that a document of that kind deserved the very fullest and deepest consideration by any servant of Parliament who is highly paid to take charge of education in this country.  There were things in that report to make anybody who is responsible for the education of the youth of Ireland lie awake at night wondering whether he was sinning against the young children of the country.  There were pages in that report that would bring tears to the eyes of anybody with human feelings towards little children.  You read of the little children who want to give expression to their feelings by conversation, and they find themselves surrounded and regimented and given orders through a language that is strange to them, and you observe the result of the curbing and checking of the little impulses of those children and the disastrous effect on the human make-up eventually.</P>
    <P>When you have a report calling attention to that kind of thing, expressing the dissatisfaction of parents with <Col N="91" /> the teaching, and directing attention to the feeble efforts of not well educated parents to teach their children at home, then I submit that there is something to be inquired into.  Let those who are competent to carry out such an inquiry and pursue such investigations look into the matter thoroughly and then come back to Parliament and tell us &ldquo;We have established a commission in which all Parliament can have confidence; the members of that commission have investigated the whole matter; here is their report and this is what influences the Department of Education.&rdquo;  If the Minister feels comfortable and feels convinced that the policy he is pursuing, and which he has intensified, is getting suitable results and that the children are being adequately educated, then he should welcome such an inquiry; but as long as there is any doubt on that particular point, in the interest not only of the taxpayers but of parents and, above all, in the interests of the little children who will have to face the world inside or outside this country in a few years and should be adequately equipped for that hard struggle for existence, we should feel bound to hold up such an Estimate as this.</P>
    <P>We have that hidebound, callous disregard for the opinions of the teachers; we have the same callous disregard for the views of the parents; we have the same contemptuous disregard for the results and the published views of the great commission that inquired into the vocational system in this country. Are we to take it that teachers are wrong, that parents are wrong, that the Vocational Commission is wrong and that the only one who is right is the Minister?  Are we to take it that the people who move here and there getting the views of professors in universities, of businessmen, of those who are looking for clerks and taking them from among those who have recently left school are wrong?</P>
    <P>I had an experience in a hospital recently where there were applicants for a certain very junior post.  They applied verbally and were taken into a room, 11 of them.  They were told to whom a letter should be addressed <Col N="92" /> and each one of the 11 was told to write a very short application for the position.  I happened to see those 11 applications and no person outside an inmate of Grangegorman would give the lowliest post to any one of them on the written applications.  The grammar was appalling, the spelling was atrocious and there was no such thing as punctuation.  The person to whom the application was made was addressed in varying terms&mdash;&ldquo;honourable gentleman,&rdquo;&ldquo;honourable sir.&rdquo; These applicants were turned out as educated for the ordinary battle of life. One-syllable words were spelled incorrectly and there was no punctuation from the beginning to the end of the letter of application.  I would say these 11 people were a fair cross-section.</P>
    <P>On education we spend £5,500,000 a year.  That is the amount spent for the education of the generation that is growing up.  That generation will be the future Irish nation, the fathers and the mothers of future Irish men and women.  That is the standard that will be passed down to the following generation. We have every authoritative body that has spoken, with the exception of the Minister, either condemning the system <i>in toto</i> or demanding or appealing that there should be some inquiry held.  This year, the same as every other year, the bell will ring, the troops will move, the money will be voted, and they will pick the pockets of the people for this.  Year after year we have to stand for it.</P>
    <P>Leaving that question on one side, just leaving it at the point that there is at least something to be inquired into, there is something else to disturb the public mind and there has to be some system of checking-up other than the examination system.  I will remind the Minister that the Taoiseach felt there was a matter to be inquired into. Is everything, other than what the children are learning inside our schools, as it should be?  Do we think we will breed confidence in our educational system when we have school teachers, the people who have to set an example in citizenship and good conduct to the children, behaving in the manner we witnessed here within <Col N="93" /> the past two weeks; when you have those charged with the responsibility of teaching the youths who are growing up driven to such a frenzied pitch of distraction that all restraint and discipline and all respect for State institutions are completely forgotten? We have in mind the antics that took place in this particular House.  Is there not something to be inquired into on that particular front?  If a person charged day after day with responsibility for transmitting knowledge to hundreds of little children is demented and distracted with financial worries at home, do you think that his instruction will ever adequately be transmitted?</P>
    <P>I can speak with a certain amount of ease on this particular question.  I was one of a commission of this House that dealt with Ministers' salaries a few years ago.  The case made and conceded, and the case I supported and advocated, was that Ministers could not adequately carry out their functions if their minds were to be distracted by financial worries, that they could not live reasonably, according to the standard of life they should occupy, if the salary was merely £1,000 a year.  I advocated as strongly as I could that, if their functions were to be properly carried out, they should be relieved of anxiety, distress and worry, not only with regard to the present but with regard to the future. The salaries were increased by 50 per cent. and very generous pensions were provided after five or seven years' service. I believe that that action was taken in the public interest; that, if they were to be haunted by the terror of the bailiff or the bum, demanding payment for bills they could not meet, their functions could not be carried out adequately.</P>
    <P>Yet we view with lofty, callous disdain the distractions, the worries and the appeals of family men with incomes of from £3 to £5 a week.  They have no right to be worried, they have no right to look for more; the Minister's door is slammed in their faces, the Taoiseach's door is slammed in their faces, and all avenues of appeal are closed to them.  That is what we are asked to subscribe to here.  The £1,000 <Col N="94" /> a year people must get an increase to relieve them of financial worry, so that, with a brain free from distraction, they may bludgeon others whose income is £150 or £250 a year.  Is there not a case to be met and answered; is there not at least something to be inquired into, when teachers are driven to that mutinous stage where they are driven to forget even respect for the very high function they are called on to fulfil in human life, in setting an example to the next generation?  Is the Minister still going to hold that there is nothing to inquire into, and that parents have no right to be dissatisfied?</P>
    <P>It may be that the teachers, in their report, attributed the lack of education to the wrong cause&mdash;attempting to teach through a language that most of the children never hear outside school; or it may have been the mental worry of the person teaching; but there is definitely something to be inquired into.  There is an obligation on the Minister to have a full inquiry made, to allow in the bright light of day, to come back here and tell Parliament the result of that inquiry, and then to ask for his £5,000,000, either to keep going a scheme which has been stamped and branded as unsatisfactory, or to put in its place a scheme which we can confidently expect to give satisfaction.  However, to come year after year asking for an increasing amount to bolster up a system about which, to say the least, people are doubtful, and to have that education given by agents who are driven demented by the rising, galloping, bounding cost of living, and the impossibility of keeping a home going, is something into which an inquiry must be made.</P>
    <P>There is another point.  Nobody can go in or out of any school without noticing the size of the classes which our teachers are called on to instruct or educate.  You would not have to be a teacher or need any experience in educational matters to know that it is absolutely absurd to have one teacher charged with the responsibility of teaching classes of 60, 70 or 80 pupils. It is expecting the impossible from the teacher; it is grossly unjust to the children, and it is not fulfilling our <Col N="95" /> obligations to the parents.  We know that the strength of a chain is the strength of the weakest link, and that the rate of progress of a class is, in the main, the speed at which the dullest child can progress.  We know there is somewhere a limit in numbers beyond which the teacher is incapable of instructing properly and adequately.</P>
    <P>Then we have the condition of the schools themselves; we have what Deputy Martin O'Sullivan referred to, the school in the area where there is so much poverty, and which in the cold winter months is inadequately heated.  There are very many schools inadequately lighted.  There is the delay, some of it unavoidable, in replacing schools that should not be inhabited even temporarily by goats, but where classess are assembled every day. Little tots who have come miles through all kinds of weather assemble there.  Above all, a school should be a place where children learn more than mere instruction in so many subjects. The school, merely by the school routine, should instil a knowledge of cleanliness and hygiene into the children, so that later on they will carry with them through life a knowledge of decent standards of cleanliness and hygiene.  When our children are packed by the hundred into hovels where coats and caps are heaped on top of other coats and caps, where there is no facility for washing filthy hands, where there is no use in the teacher calling attention to filthy faces or filthy hands, as there is no facility for cleaning them, what can anyone expect as a result in the end?</P>
    <P>Even when we have new schools going up at great expense, but with no running water in very many of them, and no flush water in most of them, what kind of standard of hygiene or cleanliness are we aiming at?  The Department of Education and the other Departments of this State will have either to knock down or bore through the walls&mdash;the high walls&mdash;that separate one Department from another in this State.  I find that it is easier for the Department of Local Government <Col N="96" /> and Public Health in this country to get in touch with the corresponding department in America than to get in touch with the Department of Agriculture in this country.  Seemingly there is a wall between the different Departments in this country that cannot be climbed over or got through.  Everybody knows that we have all kinds of commissions or conferences of one kind or another inquiring into the spread of infectious on contagious diseases, but yet in our schools we have the caps of children suffering from ringworm planked down on top of the caps of other children not suffering from that disease. We have the caps of children who are lousy being put alongside the caps of other children.  Everybody knows the reason for that, but there should not be anything of that kind in any country in the world in this twentieth century.  The whole lay-out of our schools should aim at a standard of cleanliness, and every facility for cleanliness and proper hygienic conditions should be provided in our schools.</P>
    <P>Take the case of even the new schools that have been provided here. It seems to me that we have started without the slightest conception of what real education is and what should be the functions of any educational establishment.  We have all kinds of bogeys, such as financial worry and debt, dogging the steps of the unfortunate teacher.  Then there are a lot of hoary, antiquated bogeys crossing the practice, policy and aspirations of other Government Departments; and, of course, you have the old bogey of &ldquo;averages&rdquo;&mdash;the terror of every teacher&mdash;the terror that if the average, for any particular reason, falls, some assistant will walk the road, some assistant will be out of work.  You have all kinds of a wrong outlook and limitations on the particular circumstances involving absence from school.  Naturally, the teacher wants to protect his average, but these restrictions are such that there is no protection for the teacher.  That, in itself, is a matter that should be inquired into.  That, in itself, is a matter that should be inquired into by the advisory council.</P>

      <P>Education, as far as the majority of our people is concerned, consists of primary education, and the question naturally arises, first of all, as to whether it is desirable to confine free education to those under the age of 14 or whether that age-limit should be raised.  Many views have been expressed on this question, but I think it should be approached from a realistic point of view.  My view in regard to the matter is that wherever you have reasonable facilities for providing technical or vocational education in a particular district, the school-leaving age should be raised to 16.  In many of the urban areas and some of the rural areas we have technical schools and schools of domestic science, and I think that most of these schools would be found capable of providing education for boys and girls over the age of 14.  I would not be in favour for a moment, however, of raising the school-leaving age in rural areas, for example, where there are no vocational or technical schools of any kind and where there are not adequate facilities for providing higher education. There would be no point in sending a boy or girl, over the age of 14, to a school unless there were facilities for providing vocational or technical education in one form or another. Usually, I think that the ordinary primary school teacher would not be equipped to provide higher education, or the type of vocational training that would be required for a boy or girl over the age of 14.  When a boy who intends to engage in manual work for the remainder of his life reaches the age of 14, he has reached an age when he should be acquiring a vocational education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>When a girl who intends to take up domestic work&mdash;and the overwhelming majority of girls must eventually become housewives&mdash;reaches the age of 14, she should be receiving a vocational education.</P>
      <P>It may be said, and, I think, can be truly said, that at the age of 14 many boys and girls are very badly equipped educationally.  I will deal with that point later, but even assuming that at the age of 14 a boy requires further education in the ordinary subjects, he has reached an age when he must be given some amount of vocational or technical education, and in a vocational school there should be ample provision for a boy or girl to increase his or her ordinary education while at the same time equipping himself or herself for whatever vocation in life is chosen.  To suggest that, because a boy who has reached the age of 14 is not as well equipped educationally as he should be, he should continue to dawdle on at the national school is absurd.  If he has not reached a certain definite standard at that age, he is not likely to improve after another year or even two years at the same school.  That is my experience of children I know and see in rural Ireland, so I am not talking from the theoretical point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is admitted that the standard of education is low.  We cannot dispute the evidence produced by so many authorities that the standard of education, so far from having improved as it should have improved during the past 20 years, has declined.  There are various causes to which we may attribute the low standard of primary education.  We have to ensure that those engaged in the teaching profession are of the highest standard which can be found, and we have to ensure that they regard their profession as the highest in the land and take a pride in it.  We must have in the teaching profession the same outlook as we find in the higher learned professions&mdash;an outlook of pride&mdash;and end for all time the almost continuous squabbling in <Col N="100" /> regard to teachers' salaries and conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>No real improvement can be effected in primary education while those in charge of our schools are discontented and dissatisfied, while they are continually engaged in agitation&mdash;some times perhaps what is more or less unconstitutional agitation&mdash;for an improvement in their conditions. Teachers must be sufficiently secured in their positions to be able to concentrate on educating those entrusted to them, and must be sufficiently secured to be able to devote all their attention to ensuring that the youth of the country will grow up with confidence in their teachers and confidence in the State which employs their teachers.  There is nothing more to be deplored at present than the cynical outlook and lack of national pride which appears to be growing up amongst our young people.</P>
    <P>It should be the duty of the State to ensure that our teachers are reasonably paid.  It is very difficult for one who is not engaged in the profession, who is not engaged in State employment, fully or accurately to calculate what constitutes reasonable remuneration, but we have it on the authority of the Irish Hierarehy that our teachers are not being fairly treated, and we ought not to go beyond that authority.  Having secured that our teachers have no reasonable ground for complaint, having secured that adequate machinery is set up to settle any dispute in regard to conditions of employment or remuneration, whether arbitration or other machinery, we should then see that teachers of the highest quality are recruited into the profession.</P>
    <P>There is always the danger that our best and brainiest teachers may be lured outside the State to find employment. That is most undesirable.  We require the best intellects that can be secured within the country to provide our youth with adequate education. In addition, it is necessary to ensure that amongst our teachers there is a spirit of pride in their profession.  We must ensure that teachers will take a keen interest in seeing that every member of their profession lives up to <Col N="101" /> the highest standard that can reasonably be required.  In other learned professions, we have definite organisations or societies which seek to ensure that the highest standard is maintained.  The same should apply in the teaching profession.  We should have a pride in that profession, which is the highest and noblest in the land.</P>
    <P>On a former occasion I referred to the comparative failure of vocational education.  The reason why I refer to that matter now is that in many rural areas we have rural science schools designed to cater mainly for those who intend to devote their lives to agriculture, but attended mainly by pupils who intend to get away from agriculture and seek employment elsewhere. The boys and girls who intend to remain on the land frequently do not attend those schools at all. Where you have a properly equipped vocational school in such an area I have no objection to the raising of the school-leaving age. By so doing, parents can, at least, be confident that even though they have to make a sacrifice&mdash;it may be a heavy sacrifice for some small holders to continue sending their boys to school after they have reached the age of 14 years&mdash;they can, at least, be assured that the children are receiving a good education that will fit them for work on the land&mdash;that will help them to earn a better income from their work on the land than they could otherwise obtain.  Though the extra two years' attendance at school may entail sacrifice on the parents they can be certain that the two years will not have been wasted, and that they will be amply repaid for their sacrifice.  I believe that there is a certain amount of political juggling in regard to this question of the school-leaving age.  The question of what is best for the rising generation is not considered at all. The matter is considered from the viewpoint of how many votes the raising of the school-leaving age would secure, or how many votes it would lose.  That, unfortunately, is the approach of our Government, at the moment, to many of our most important and difficult problems.</P>

      <P>I know that in some areas there would be a certain amount of opposition to the raising of the school-leaving age.  In a matter of this kind we have to consider what is best, for the future of the nation depends on the education of our young people, and we cannot allow ourselves to be influenced to any extent by political considerations.  The same considerations, I am afraid, apply to a greater extent to the question of the teaching of the Irish language in our schools.  This has been made a political issue.  The interests of future generations are not considered, the interests of our young children in the primary schools are not considered and thus we have throughout the State an attempt being made to teach young innocent children through the medium of a language which they definitely do not understand.</P>
      <P>I think that, when you consider that it takes a child a number of years to pick up the language of the home, it is an absurd thing, before that child has fully acquired a grasp of that language or when it has barely acquired a grasp of it, to introduce the child to a new language, and to have an attempt made to teach the child other subjects through the medium of that new language.  The members of the teaching profession have expressed their views very clearly on this question. They hold that it is undesirable and wrong to attempt to teach other subjects through the medium of Irish. I would be inclined to go further.  In this House I have suggested that it is wrong to attempt to teach a second language to infant children, even though that second language may be our own national language, because children in the infant classes cannot be expected to acquire a second language. It imposes on them an altogether unreasonable and unjust strain, and it is definitely a fact that such a course is lowering the standard of education and is imposing a severe strain not only on the children's intellectual powers but also on their physical and nervous energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time, I think, that some definite <Col N="103" /> decision was taken in regard to this whole question of Irish.  What really is the policy of the Government in regard to Irish?  Do they intend that the spoken language of this country ought to be changed, or do they intend that Irish should be preserved as the language of the cultured and educated classes and should be retained as a second language?  I hold, definitely, that it would be absurd to attempt to change the spoken language of this country to the extent of having only one language, and that language, Irish. That would be going beyond anything that is reasonably possible or desirable. If we were to succeed in that, at enormous cost to the standard of education, and perhaps at enormous cost otherwise, it would have the effect of isolating this country to a very great extent, and of reducing the opportunities which this nation has of exerting a good moral influence in world affairs.  If we were completely to change the spoken language we would also be aggravating the problem of Partition, one of the greatest and most serious problems we have.</P>
    <P>A further result of attempting to force the pace in regard to the teaching of Irish has been this&mdash;perhaps it is one which was never foreseen&mdash;to neglect the promotion, amongst our young people, of a sound national patriotic outlook.  We have got into the habit of assuming that we shall make our young people more patriotic by merely changing their language. Nothing could be more absurd.  If you want to make people patriotic, you must teach them to have love and respect for their own country.  You will not do that by simply changing their language.  One small country which surprised the world by its economic progress during the past century was Denmark.  The real reason why Denmark succeeded in solving her economic and social problems was that her young people were taught to love and respect their own country, to have a pride in it and to work for its progress.  It is absolutely essential that, even if boys and girls be confined to primary education and never obtain a chance of receiving higher education, they should <Col N="104" /> leave school with an enthusiastic desire to live in, and for, this country.  What do we find amongst our young people at present?  We find that their one object is to get out of this country as quickly as possible.  It is necessary to change that outlook.  It is the energy, the enterprise and the initiative of the young that will change the face of the country and make it a more prosperous, a happier and a better place.  The teachers can play a very big part in achieving that object and in raising the national and moral outlook of those entrusted to their care.  They can do that if they are relieved of the necessity for continually squabbling in regard to their means of living and if they are not overburdened with the teaching of subjects which are too difficult for them to master, or to enable their pupils to master, completely. We know that nothing lowers a man's self-confidence to a greater extent than the knowledge that he is engaged in work of which he is not a complete master.  Nothing lowers a boy's self-assurance and self-confidence more than the realisation that he is leaving school&mdash;whether it be a national school or a vocational school &mdash;without being master of the subjects taught him in that school.  No matter how limited the number of subjects that may be taught, they should be taught thoroughly and in such a way that the average pupil will be a complete master of them and will go out into the world with a sense of self-confidence and self-reliance. It is on that spirit of self-confidence and self-reliance on the part of the young that the future of our country depends.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal briefly with a rather contentious question which has been frequently raised on these Estimates. That is, the question of married women teachers continuing to teach.  I look at this question not from the point of view of the monetary advantage to the teachers concerned but from the point of view of the education of the young, particularly the infant classes.  I hold that women teachers are the best teachers for the infant classes, and I hold that experienced women teachers are better than inexperienced women teachers. <Col N="105" /> As far as possible, women who have proved themselves to be good teachers should be allowed to continue to teach even though they may be married.  I speak on this question also from personal experience.  I know married women teachers who have had excellent results in their schools&mdash;better results in some cases than men teachers have had.  It will be readily appreciated that, so far as the infant classes are concerned, the woman teacher is best qualified to secure the confidence of the children and their ready cooperation in acquiring knowledge. For that reason, I think that it is highly undesirable that a ban should be placed on married women teachers. If they are efficient, as they should be, they should be allowed to continue to teach.</P>
    <P>There is just one other matter, very frequently dealt with in debates on these Estimates, to which I should like to refer.  That is, the size of classes in the schools.  In the cities, we know that there is frequent complaint regarding the size of the classes in the primary schools.  In the country, the reverse is the case.  We find classes in the country schools dwindling away to such an extent that, in many cases, the schools have to be closed down completely.  That is a highly undesirable condition of affairs.  It can be remedied only by inspiring our young people with confidence in their country and, particularly, in the agricultural industry, so that we shall have a larger population living and working in rural Ireland.  That will, I think, relieve the problem of congestion in our city schools and depopulation in the rural areas.</P>

      <P>I have before me a copy of the Bunreacht, and Article 42 states: &ldquo;The State shall provide for free primary education.&rdquo; When the Mental Treatment Bill was passing through this House. I approached the Parliamentary Secretary and called his attention to the position of children of an age when they should ordinarily be benefiting by primary education, but who, unfortunately, are mentally unable to benefit by attending our national schools.  The Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="106" /> told me that I would have an opportunity of raising the matter when the Estimates for the Department of Education would come before the House.  I made up my mind then to ask the Minister, if he has not already given consideration to the case of these unfortunate children, to do so now.</P>
      <P>Though people marry for better or worse, it is an extraordinary fact that if a man has an intelligent child the State will cater for its education from the moment it learns the A. B. C. until that child passes through the secondary schools and the universities. State funds&mdash;and when I say State funds I include also local authority funds&mdash;will cater for the clever child, but the unfortunate whom the Lord afflicts is left as a burden to his parents.  I have a few examples before my mind of such children whose parents find it a very heavy burden to keep them in institutions.  If the parents are exceptionally poor, the local authority will cater for them, but if the parents are earning anything, my information is that they have to keep those children at home, even when they are a danger to themselves, to other members of the family, or to neighbours.  Otherwise, if they are sent to some institution, it will be at the expense of the parents, and, therefore, at the expense of the other members of the family on whose education a little money might profitably be expended.  I am sure the Minister in his reply will inform the House if he has already considered the plight of those children, those who are either mentally deficient, or those who, through some kind of affliction, epilepsy, or some such malady, are unable to avail of primary education as we know it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like in that connection to refer the Minister to Article 42 of the Constitution which sets out that the State shall provide for free primary education.  Since I came into the House&mdash;I am sorry I had not an opportunity of looking the matter up&mdash;my attention has been drawn to another section of the community who, under certain conditions, are also deprived of primary education.  Deputy O'Sullivan, Lord Mayor of Dublin, very rightly <Col N="107" /> complimented the Minister on some important changes that he has brought about in his Department.  I also can testify to the beneficial effect of some changes brought about, not only during the period of office of the Minister, but also during the term of office as Minister for Education of the Taoiseach himself.  One of these, which supplied a long-felt want and which teachers appreciated very much was the formation of panels, whereby the Department, the teachers and the managers entered into a tri-lateral agreement, and in the absence of which teachers ordinarily, owing to falling averages, would have been thrown out on the road.  Now, they are retained until such time as suitable vacancies occur for them in some other part of the diocese.  That to my mind was one of the greatest reforms the teachers could hope for.</P>
    <P>I learned this very day, however, that in a mixed school for boys and girls where there is a man principal, if the average falls below a certain figure, the woman teacher there is obliged to let her name go on the panel, and if any manager in the diocese decides that she is suitable to fill a vacancy in his school, go she has to.  The girls in such a school when she leaves will be under the care of a man for all subjects.  Now, again looking up the Constitution, I see that citizens, men and women, may, through their occupations, find the means of making reasonable provision for their domestic needs.  I could quote half a dozen Articles of the Constitution which deal with family life, but, I ask you, what greater preparation could there be for family life or for making a home happy, than being trained by a woman when it is a question of a girl's education?  She must learn sewing, and cookery, and she must get advice in a thousand and one things in which a woman only is competent to advise growing girls.  As I have said, it is only since I came into the House that I heard of a case where a lady teacher will be leaving such a school in the future.  I draw the Minister's attention to that particular point because I hold that even if there were only one girl attending a mixed school, a woman <Col N="108" /> teacher should be retained on the staff of that school regardless of the cost.</P>
    <P>So much has been said about other matters connected with national teachers that there is very little left for me to say.  Possibly I should be one of the last to tackle the Minister on that particular question.  However, it is no harm to point out to him that, in justice, I see no reason why, when men are equal mentally, physically and morally, and when they are doing work of equal importance, there should be any discrimination as far as salaries go.  I have already pointed that out to the Minister as a member of a deputation and it is scarcely necessary for me to remind him of it again.  I should like also to remind him of the claims of one section of the community who devoted their lives to teaching and without whose aid some of the older Deputies in this House probably would not be able to read or write.  These people are now expected to exist on a miserable pittance, some of them on less than 25/- a week.  I put it as a proposition to the Minister that at least those of them who are in receipt of less than £100 a year and who are trying to live up to a larger income should have their claims considered. The answer I got to a question on this subject was the answer given in this House half a dozen times before, that there should be a line drawn somewhere.  Lines have been drawn several times.  There are lines drawn so far as war bonuses are concerned, and I do not see why there should not be a line drawn in the right direction so far as the claims of these people are concerned.  I think I am justified in recommending to the Minister and to the House that those old pensioners receiving less than £100 a year should get some increase, even if it were only £1 a month, if you have to draw a line, to show them that we are not forgetting them in their old age.  After the next decade, we probably shall have none of them amongst us because they will all have gone to their reward, a reward they have well earned.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the teaching of Irish.  It was all said a thousand and one times previously. <Col N="109" /> We have been lectured on the impossibility of reviving the Irish language. I wonder if the individuals who lecture in that way ever go to the trouble of finding out if a new language was taught before in any other country?  I had an experience of that kind.  One of the first teachers engaged in a country which was in the news recently, the Philippine Islands, was a member of my family.  He was the first English speaker to be sent to Manila by the American Government. When he went into one school the children greeted him with the words: &ldquo;Good morning, Mr. O'Brien.&rdquo;  The school had only been organised for a short time.  Anyone able to speak English was employed until Government institutions to control education were set up.  The schools consisted of large wooden houses.  English speakers began by teaching the pupils to repeat words.  Six years later the children were doing third year algebra and first year geometry in the new language.  At 14 years of age I was able to do third year algebra and third year geometry. After six years' teaching the children had such command of the new language that they were able to learn other subjects through it.  The language can be revived here if, instead of criticising those whose responsibility it is to revive it, encouragement as well as conditions essential to the proper working of the educational machine were present. The Minister should see to it that teachers have no worry except that of educating the children on lines regulated by the Department.</P>
    <P>I regret that I was not present when the Minister referred to the working of the technical branch of the Department. On looking through the Estimate I find that good work is being done in these classes, including woodwork. When a doctor sets out on his career he has to spend a year doing a preliminary course, and he devotes that year to the study of herbs, so that he may have a better understanding of the course he will follow in later years. Is it not reasonable to expect that, where pupils are learning woodwork, they should do a preliminary course on the origin of wood, and be taught everything about the growing of trees from seeds?  Is it not reasonable to expect that there should also be a <Col N="110" /> short course in forestry in such schools?  Is it too much to expect that there would be co-ordination between the Department of Education and the Department of Lands, so that one would help the other: that the Department of Education through its technical branch would help the forestry section by encouraging the growing of trees in cities, small towns and country districts?  I suggest to the Minister that in smaller towns and country districts lectures should be given on the growing of trees, because the art is as simple as the growing of cabbage.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the need of encouraging schools to cater for the needs of people in their localities.  I knew a district where, up to the time of the first world war, the making of sciathóga and ciseain was carried on from sally twigs.  With that war came enamel buckets which were used instead of sciathóga baskets.  During the present war it has been almost impossible to get these buckets, and many of those who were able to make sciathóga have now passed away.  Is there any more suitable industry than the making of sciathóga and ciseain in country districts?  I have seen them made.  I think every youth should learn to make these things. There is a great opening for the revival of such crafts.  I suggest to the Minister that he should consider having them revived, not only in Kerry, but wherever they were used formerly.</P>
    <P>Some people have one aim in education; others have another.  I say that the primary aim of education is the salvation of our souls.  That must be admitted to be the primary aim of education.  I know of no better way of bringing God back into our minds, into our thoughts, into our daily lives than by the revival of the Irish language, because the salutations in Irish are full of God's blessings&mdash;&ldquo;Dia dhuit; Dia's Muire dhuit; Bail o Dhia ar an obair&rdquo;.  Ní féidir iad d'athrú nó iad d'fheabhsú ach chó beag.  But, if the language is to be revived, it must be revived as a spoken tongue. It does not matter how efficient people may be in answering questions in Irish; it does not matter how much <Col N="111" /> poetry they know; it does not matter how many old sayings they have memorised; unless they are able to speak the language, the language will, as Deputy Dillon said last week, be ranked with Latin and other dead languages. A short time ago a boy in whom I was interested joined a secondary school.  The headmaster gave him a test in oral Irish.  The headmaster said to me: &ldquo;Unless you can get the Minister for Education to alter the existing conditions, that is the last time that boy will be examined in Irish until he leaves the secondary school.&rdquo;  I am wondering if sanity will prevail even now.  If we are serious in our attempt at reviving the Irish language&mdash;and I believe the Minister is serious&mdash;then he will see to it that it is revived as a spoken language and that not only will the children be examined in oral Irish in the primary school but in every other class of school they go to.  I should much prefer that boys would be able to speak a language and speak it properly, whether it is Irish or English, than that they would be able, mechanically, to answer questions on a written paper.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that I should like to refer to, which also has reference to Articles of the Constitution. I refer again to the home.  I will tell you something that a man told me a short time ago.  He had a daughter home on holidays from a secondary school.  While her mother was out, she was charged with the duty of preparing the dinner.  She was to boil a leg of mutton.  When her father asked her, a short time afterwards, if the meat was cooked, she said: &ldquo;It cannot be because the water is not yet boiling.&rdquo;  She intended cooking it in cold water.  That goes to show that while girls may get honours in all subjects in matriculation and leaving certificate, it is quite possible that they will complete their education in the secondary school without knowing how to boil a piece of meat.  With the scramble that there is to get jobs, where are they to be placed?  Employment cannot be found for all of them.</P>
    <P>Would it not be better for the boy or girl who finishes a secondary school <Col N="112" /> course to be sent into domestic service at the age of 14, rather than that they should be, at the age of 18 or 19, thrown into the world, to beg, unable; to dig, ashamed?  This morning I received a letter from a girl who got honours in every subject in the Leaving Certificate and a scholarship to the university, saying that her father has not the means to supplement the amount of the scholarship.  She writes to me from South Kerry, asking if there is any possibility of getting anything that would keep her in Ireland.  She does not want to emigrate.  Her father does not want her to emigrate.  She is a brilliant girl.  It would be better for her if, at the age of 14, she had gone into service.</P>
    <P>That is what I have to say on secondary education.  My interest in it is that oral Irish should henceforth be as important as written Irish because oral Irish will revive the Irish language.  In that regard, our friend here is sceptical; he is worried.  Nobody ever suggested that we should revive the Irish language in five, ten, 15 or 25 years. What we have set about doing&mdash;I am sure it will be agreed on all sides of the House&mdash;is to see to it that the Irish language is not lost.  We did not succeed in getting complete independence for our country, but we saw to it that as much of it as was possible was made independent.  We will see to it also that the Irish language will be preserved and that the next generation, or the succeeding generation, will know Irish as well as they will know English.  If we achieve in this generation the prevention of the rot, if we succeed in starting the surge forward, the next generation will be able to go still further and in some places will be able to go all the way.  In the third generation, I see no reason why Irish should not be known in every parish in the country.</P>
    <P>I shall refer now to university education.</P>

Unless we insist on having Irish <Col N="113" /> the spoken language, not only in the primary school, but in the secondary school, we can never hope to have it the spoken language of the university, the spoken language of the educated people, the spoken language of all those who aim at higher education, nor can it be used as a medium of instruction. I impress upon the Minister the absolute necessity of having it a spoken language.</P>

In referring to that matter he was dealing with the economic problems which will confront this country in the immediate post-war period.  I say definitely that, in my opinion, before we can hope substantially to expand production by the application of modern scientific methods, we must provide our adult people and, for the future our rising generation, with a proper education.

      <P>The Minister will get particulars.  In that connection, I think it is inadvisable to teach what appears to me to be dogma so far as rural science is concerned; there ought to be provision made for demonstration and experimental work.  All over the country we are experiencing the difficulty that the mere laying down of certain principles in dogmatic fashion is not sufficient to convince the youth. There ought to be clear and ample demonstration of those principles; pupils should be given ocular proof of the teaching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Vocational Commission, on the evidence which was tendered to them, complained of the defective general education of children going from the primary school to the secondary school, to the vocational school, and to the agricultural school.  That is a very serious matter, and I hope the Minister will have it very carefully examined. We all recognise the fact that, in the primary school, the foundation of a child's education is laid.  This Vote is probably the most important one that comes before the House, because the whole future of the nation is shaped in the schools, and if our system of education is not a proper and efficient one we cannot hope to increase our prosperity or improve the general social conditions of our people.  I feel that the contention that there should not be any vocational subjects introduced into the primary schools is a sound one <Col N="115" />&mdash;that the basis of education, what is known as the three R's, is laid there; that pupils ought to be taught how to observe and contemplate, how to think, how to acquire knowledge and use it in their particular avocations in after life.  If, in a report like that of the Vocational Commission, we find it definitely stated that, from the evidence tendered before that commission, the children leaving the primary schools are seriously defective in general education, there must be some definite reason for that.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Dillon who stated here last week that this whole matter of compulsory Irish and teaching through the medium of Irish is really the hall-mark of mediocrity; that you cannot possibly hope or expect that young children will learn two subjects at the same time&mdash;the language and the subject which you are teaching through the medium of it. That is beyond the ability of the average child.  I cannot understand why the Minister and the Government are so persistent and dogmatic in their attitude in that regard, or why the findings and representations of people who have gone to the trouble of examining the matter have been ignored. However, I do not want to dwell on that.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins referred to the sanitary conditions and facilities in a number of schools in the country, and I agree with him in the complaints that he made.  The facilities generally in rural schools are appalling and disgraceful. I do not know whether that is the responsibility of the Board of Works or of the Minister, or of the managers, but surely the Minister must be in a position to have those conditions rectified, and to ensure better facilities for cleanliness in the schools.  Recently, a woman who has come to live in this country&mdash;she is married to an Irish medical man who went abroad for some years&mdash;complained to me very bitterly that she has to send her children to a school where the conditions are not fit and proper in her opinion.  She was severely critical in her comparison between the conditions here and those <Col N="116" /> obtaining in her own country, and it was very hard for me to put up a defence against her complaints.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be unreasonable so far as the provision of new schools and proper accommodation in the schools is concerned; but, so far as sanitary facilities are concerned, at all events, it is not a very costly proposition. Surely, some effort should be made to get rid of the disgraceful conditions that exist in many of the rural schools. If proper standards are not insisted upon in the schools, and if cleanliness is not insisted upon by teachers in the schools, we can hardly look forward to improved conditions in the homes. Unfortunately, a lot of our people are inclined to be careless about their person and about cleanliness in the home, and we can only improve that standard in my opinion by education.</P>
    <P>I agree with the references made by other speakers to the vocational system, and to the extension of the school-leaving age.  Deputy Cogan thought that that was not necessary, but in certain cases that children should continue up to the age of 16 for vocational purposes.  I think it has been made fairly clear by those people who have examined the matter, and who are capable of expressing a constructive opinion, that before we start on any vocational subject the standard of general education will have to be improved; that there is a definite defect there.</P>
    <P>So far as domestic economy for girls is concerned, that is a matter that requires urgent attention.  I know that in the vocational schools we have made provision even for a course of training for girls in hotel management and that sort of thing.  In my opinion, the first and most urgent provision that ought to be made for the vast majority of the girls is a training for their ordinary calling in life, namely, to be good housewives.  Far too few Irish girls are qualified in that respect.  Some of them are very mediocre and there is room for tremendous improvement.  I should like to call the Minister's attention to that aspect of the problem.  I agree that more facilities ought to be provided.  Our people ought to be encouraged <Col N="117" /> to avail of the facilities that are there, and those facilities should be extended so as to ensure that girls will get an opportunity of learning the all-important subject of domestic economy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like very much to be able to say my few words on this very important Vote in the Irish language, but I find that I am not able to do so, because I do not know sufficient Irish. If I do not know sufficient Irish, it is not my fault, because it was not taught to me clearly.  I think that everybody who knows a word of Irish should speak it whether it makes nonsense or not, because as I said a few moments ago, &ldquo;Is fearr Gaeilge bhriste ná Béarla maith&rdquo;&mdash;broken Irish is much better than good English, as Irish is the national language of the country. Deputies from this side of the House criticise the Minister for Education.  I think that during the present Minister's term of office a great deal has been done to further the Irish language and that Deputies from this side of the House should not criticise the Minister for Education so bitterly.  I seldom get up to speak in this House without having to criticise a Minister, but I would not criticise the Minister for Education very much.  The Minister for Education in this country has a very difficult task because, if the Irish language is not flourishing, every politician opposed to the Fianna Fáil Government will throw the responsibility on to the shoulders of the Minister responsible <Col N="118" /> for the Department of Education. In my opinion, he has done quite a lot in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I might ask, what is the use of the majority of our young people being very fluent Irish speakers when they have to go to England to look for work?  I know several young fellows with whom I went to school who are fluent Irish speakers and who always exhibit the Fáinne and they could get no work here.  I know young fellows with all sorts of educational certificates and diplomas who are placed in the same position.  I know young fellows in Birr and Tullamore whose education is second to none and they are very glad to go and wheel turf on the bogs at present for 36/- and 38/- a week or to go to work in stone quarries.  Their education does not seem to have advanced them very far.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ua Donnchadha made a reference to older Deputies.  I think he said that they were no more than able to write their names.  I do not profess to be very well educated, as I only went as far as the fifth class in the national school.  I look upon the national school as the poor man's university, and I have always looked upon the national teacher as the poor man's professor.</P>
    <P>Remember, the vast majority of labouring men's children never get an opportunity of going a step further than the national school.  Very few small farmers can afford to allow their children to go as much as one year over the school-leaving age to a national school because they want them to work on the land.  The result is that the children do not get an opportunity of completing their education.</P>
    <P>I would like to say something with reference to the national teachers.  I have not a very great love for the national teachers in my constituency because very few of them vote for me. At almost all the election meetings throughout the country&mdash;and I am sure the Minister knows it very well because it happens in his constituency as well as in other constituencies&mdash; teachers are to be found on the platforms. In my own constituency I have heard teachers singing the praises of <Col N="119" /> the Government.  But when it comes to looking for increases in their salaries, you will find them expecting Deputy Flanagan and Deputies of the Labour Party and the Fine Gael and other Parties to put up a fight for them.  In one sense, although I have a certain amount of sympathy for the teachers, I think that what they have got is good enough for them, because when they are presented with an opportunity of supporting the men who will support them, they do not do it. They support the very section that is anxious to keep them, as Deputy Mulcahy pointed out, in the hands of the moneylenders.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the salary scale is scandalously low.  It is.  It has been pointed out that many teachers receive a salary of less than £4 10s. a week. It has been pointed out that 3,000 teachers are paid at a rate under £3 10s. a week, and that 2,000 teachers get less than £2 10s. a week.  I should like to know from the Minister if it is a fact that a man working for the Dublin Corporation, cleaning out the lavatory in O'Connell Street, gets more in wages than a national teacher after working five years in a school.  I believe it is a fact.  What is the responsibility of the national teacher, and what is the responsibility of the man working for the Dublin Corporation cleaning out the lavatory in O'Connell Street?</P>
    <P>The national teacher has a very great responsibility.  He is responsible for training youths to be good citizens.  He is responsible for giving to the children in their tender years their first lessons in Christian doctrine so that they may be good Christians. I am ashamed of the low esteem in which the Government and the Minister hold the national teachers.</P>
    <P>Take the case of a national teacher who receives 50/- a week.  He is a single man, living away from home. He will not get &ldquo;digs&rdquo; in any town at less than £2 a week.  How is he expected to live on the remaining 10/-? If his parents are advanced in years, surely they are looking forward to some return out of the £2,000 that they must have laid out on his rearing <Col N="120" /> and education in order to make him a school teacher.  What can he afford out of 10/- a week if he has to keep himself properly dressed, dressed just as the Minister would like to see all school teachers when he visits the schools.  What has he to enable him to live decently?  There is one thing certain, and that is that the national teacher cannot comply with the teachings laid down in the Christian doctrine. Take the words of Pope Leo&mdash; every worker is entitled to a living wage in order that he may bring up his family in Christian decency.</P>
    <P>How can a teacher bring up his family in Christian decency on such a low salary?  He is expected to live up to a certain standard, in keeping with his profession.  If he does, it is on the strength of somebody else, because I can say without fear of contradiction that the majority of national teachers are up to their eyes in debt.  The Minister must know that from the cases that the I.N.T.O. have put to him.</P>
    <P>I trust the Minister will make some statement with regard to the future remuneration of school teachers.  The Irish bishops made a strong request for sympathetic consideration.  I believe it was following the recommendation of the Irish bishops that the Government saw fit to give the teachers an increase of 1/-.  I blame the teachers for taking that 1/-.  I look upon that as an insult to the teachers. If the teachers wish to get a fair crack of the whip, which I believe they are not getting, the only way they will force the Minister's hand is by strike action.  The labouring man can strike and you will have an odd labouring man to fill his place.  But when the school teachers strike you will not get other school teachers so easily.  I would be the last man to advocate a strike, but in this instance I would like to point out that the teachers are not looking for mercy; they are merely demanding the justice to which I believe they are entitled.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister fully realises the position of the teachers.  I have always looked upon the present Minister as one of the most reasonable and commonsense members of the Government. <Col N="121" /> I am sure his sympathies must be with these people.  I will ask him to demonstrate his sympathies towards the teachers by meeting their demands.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a reference to national schools.  As I have already pointed out, the national school is the poor man's university.  I am the product of a national school, and I am sure the majority of Fianna Fáil Deputies are the products of national schools, because they look it, anyway. I am afraid that the national schools in rural districts are not what they should be.  Deputy O'Higgins referred to the sanitary conditions of national schools.  He is a doctor who happens also to be a county medical officer of health, and he is aware of the lack of proper sanitary accommodation in national schools.</P>
    <P>I had a very unpleasant task in my constituency.  I got into serious difficulty because I tampered with the affairs of a national school where the pupils were compelled by the manager of the school and the school teachers to see that each morning and evening the sanitary accommodation of the school was attended to.  I held that my constituents were not sending their children to the school to look after the sanitary accommodation.  I think the Minister should see to it that the manager of a national school should be made pay somebody to look after the sanitary accommodation, and not have the pupils doing it.  The Minister cannot say that I am telling a falsehood. I know of several cases, and I could cite them.  I wrote to a certain parish priest, who is the manager of a national school.  I asked him to be good enough to pay somebody to look after the sanitary conditions in the school, and not have the pupils doing it.  He said that Deputy Flanagan was no gentleman to write him that letter. However, the strong words bore fruit, and he is now paying a man.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister should consult his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, and arrange for the proper cleaning and heating of the national schools, and the provision of proper sanitary accommodation.  In <Col N="122" /> my opinion that is a matter that should be sponsored by the local authority.  We should have each local authority responsible for repairing and maintaining the national schools in its area.  I went into national schools in Leix, and I was ashamed, because the walls were damp, and in some instances the roofs were leaking.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the pupils sat in the benches, nor how the school teacher remained half the day there. There should be a building survey of national schools throughout the whole country, and some effort should be made to put them into a proper state of repair.  The Minister knows very well that it is most important, in the interests of the health of the children, to have proper sanitary conditions in every national school.  I hope that some steps will be taken to improve the disgraceful conditions that exist in, I may say, the majority of national schools in rural districts.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress the necessity for the provision of substitute school teachers by the Government in cases where teachers become ill.  I understand that they can remain out of school for a period of a month or two. In England, if a school teacher becomes ill, he can stop out, as the Minister knows, for six, eight, or ten months, and it will not cost him a penny.  I understand it is the same in Northern Ireland; but here, if a teacher becomes ill for three or four months, he has to pay out of his own pocket a substitute, who will have to be responsible for his pupils.  At the same time, he has the worry of his class, and is wondering whether it is progressing as favourably as he would like, whether it will be backward when he returns, and whether the substitute is giving satisfaction.  He has to pay the doctor's bill, keep his wife and family, and keep a roof over his head, all out of his own pocket, including the payment for the substitute.  Surely to goodness, no teacher could do that.</P>
    <P>I know cases where school teachers became ill, and remained out for two or three months, and were compelled to go back to national schools in a state of ill-health, and remain there <Col N="123" /> with the young children, doing the best they could to carry on the work in that dangerous state.  I know of a teacher, who after trying to keep on his legs for three or four months, and who had to pay a substitute, went back and later broke down, went to a sanatorium, and died leaving a widow and a family behind.</P>
    <P>I know of another teacher who acted in the same way, and who is now suffering from tuberculosis.  The reason for these two cases is, that they were not able to pay the substitute, and went back to work.  It is most unfair that these conditions should exist, and there is nothing unreasonable in the request that the matter should be remedied.  I am sure the Minister will be prepared, when he is concluding on this Vote, to make some provision for substitute teachers.</P>
    <P>I would like to raise the question of teachers in politics.  We have quite a number of teachers in politics.  That may be good or it may be bad, but my experience of it is that it has a bad effect on their pupils.  You see teachers taking part on different political platforms, one for one Party, and another for another, and going for each other's bones during election time, with the weak-minded pupils standing around listening to the speeches.  I think that no teacher should have any hand, act or part in politics.</P>

      <P>I think there is no harm in asking the Minister to try it, without legislation, by making a request to school teachers to keep out of politics.  I have seen two school teachers at each other's throats for the past six months in County Offaly.  The parents are discussing it, the children are talking about it, and I am telling <Col N="124" /> the Minister, through you, Sir, that it has a very bad reflection in the minds of the pupils of those teachers. I do not intend to refer further to it, as probably it would mean introducing legislation to keep them out of politics, but I would ask that no teacher would take any hand, act or part in politics.</P>
      <P>I wish to make reference to a statement by Deputy Dillon.  Sometimes I agree with him, and sometimes I do not.  As far as Deputy Dillon is concerned, there is not an iota of a national outlook in him.</P>

      <P>I quite agree, but I would refer to a statement made by him.  Deputy Dillon is under the impression that everybody he hears speaking Irish is looking for a job. I do not think so.  He has made a statement that the Minister should not allow to pass.  I know very well myself that there are Fianna Fáil Deputies at the present time making speeches here in Irish in the presence of the Minister and the Taoiseach, and I must admit that the reason they speak in Irish is so that the Minister and the Taoiseach will put in a good word for them to have them appointed Parliamentary Secretaries.  That is quite true.  At the same time, you have people throughout the country who are very much in earnest.</P>

      <P>These people are interested in the Irish language and are doing all they can to further it in every possible way.  I am not an Irish speaker, though I know a little, and I am able to do what half the Deputies cannot do, that is, open a speech in Irish.  At the same time, there is no thanks due to me for doing that.  It is right that I should be able to address this House in the same way as any Deputy from the Fíor-Ghaeltacht. Other Deputies should be able to do the same.  There are people who have <Col N="125" /> a keen interest in the language from the national viewpoint, and not from the jobbing point of view of which Deputy Dillon speaks.  I know cases where certain appointments were being made, and even though some of the applicants could no more than write their names in English, they were fluent Irish speakers with a thorough knowledge of the language and were appointed.  I think it should be more to their credit that they were good Irish speakers.</P>
      <P>My opinion of the whole Irish language is that it is going to take about a thousand years to revive.  Deputy Ua Donnchadha has stated that in three generations the country might be Irish speaking, but it will not worry me, or the Deputy either, what they speak or do not speak.  I would like to see something done in this generation; but by the way we are going on it cannot be done.  One of the reasons is that the national teachers and the Department's inspectors are too exact about Irish.  The children should be given lessons in the language, and let use it as they wish, whether there is bad grammar or not, as they will be able to get correction as they go along.</P>
      <P>Irish needs to be standardised.  The Minister knows more Irish than half the House put together, and he knows very well that the child going to school who hears a woman called &ldquo;bean&rdquo; one moment and called &ldquo;mná&rdquo; a few minutes later, gets mixed up.  A commission should be set up to standardise the language, which it is not impossible to do.  It would be worth while for the Minister to establish such a commission to go into the whole question. Of course, when the report of that commission is made, I would not like to hear the Minister refer to it as a slovenly document.  Whatever report is made, it should be acted on by the Minister and the Government.  If the language is to be a success in our time, or in the time of our children, it must be standardised, and a commission will be necessary for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I am concerned, when I go home on the week-ends I meet a <Col N="126" /> lot of my former school friends, and I must say that when I meet my old school teacher, the man responsible, I suppose, for teaching me to write my name&mdash;maybe he is sorry for that now &mdash;I always have a few words in Irish with him, and the same thing applies to the various people I meet.  I see the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance smiling, but I think that he is the only Minister of the Government who can speak Irish to me so that we can understand one another.  As a matter of fact, I met him recently and he told me that he likes to be speaking in Irish to a man who speaks Irish as badly as I do. The important thing is, as somebody has pointed out, that it is better to speak bad Irish than no Irish at all, and we can try to improve on our acquaintance with the language as we go along.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, however, to give more consideration to this question of the teachers' salaries because, if more consideration is not given to that question, there will be very serious results.  The teachers take a very keen interest in their work, and the people who will really suffer as a result of this will be the pupils and their parents.  Before I sit down, I should also like to say that I think there should be compulsory classes in cooking and domestic science for all girls in this country.  It is a disgraceful state of affairs that a large number of our girls, the great majority of them&mdash;and Deputies know this well, and I could clap Deputy Dómhnall Ua Donnchadha on the back for the reference he made to this matter to-day&mdash; could not turn an egg.</P>
    <P>I realise that that would be a most unpopular statement for me to make in my own constituency, but I have to say it.  I do not know how the vast majority of the young men in this country will get on with these young women, because I think that the first quality of a good wife is to be able to housekeep properly.  There must be a nut loose somewhere in the Department of Education when no provision is made, seemingly, to deal with that matter.  I would compel these girls to attend lessons in cookery, because it is most important.  If their mothers <Col N="127" /> became ill, and especially if they had a &ldquo;contrairy&rdquo; husband, it would be very bad if they were not able to cook, and I think the Minister for Education should take some steps to compel the girls of this country to attend these classes so that they should be able to cook a decent meal.  According to my experience, the vast majority of them cannot do that.  A lot of good work has been done in connection with those classes in the cities, and they have been responsible for a good deal of improvement, but at the same time, down the country, a good deal more work could be done in that respect.  I think that every night, or every second night, in the week those classes should be held in the country towns.  The Minister could make it an obligation on the urban councils, or on the parish councils, where they exist, to compel these girls to attend cookery classes.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say, but I would ask the Minister for Education to consider those points sympathetically, and I am sure that he will do so.  He is one man who has a most difficult task, but I will pay a respectful tribute to that Minister and his Department for the manner in which they answer correspondence.  He evidently has a very good staff.  It is very seldom that I pay a tribute to any Government Department, but I must say that so far as the Department of Education is concerned, I always get very sympathetic consideration for anything that I put forward.  There is no political stuff about that Department, apparently, because otherwise I would not get such consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>He told us the reason why, and I hope he keeps to that.  My contribution to the debate on this Estimate is, firstly, in regard to the national schools.  It seems to me that the children living in the rural areas are given no knowledge whatever of <Col N="128" /> agriculture, so far as the schools are concerned, and that no attempt is made to teach them anything about agriculture while they are attending school.  In regard to technical instruction, which I am most interested in here at the moment, we are spending close on £500,000 on that matter, most of which comes from the ratepayers.  I should like to see specialised training in these technical schools on the industries which are close to the particular town in which the technical school is situated.  Take Mallow, Carlow, Tuam, and Thurles: I should like to see specialised education or training in these towns on the production of sugar from beet, so that we need not be altogether dependent on the foreigner at all times.</P>
      <P>Take the case of our own town of Cobh.  We have a steel mill there, which we are assured will give employment to about 800 people.  Are we going to have to import these 800 people, or will some part of this money be devoted to training the young people in Cobh to enable them to take their part in that industry, as well as in ship-building?  There is a wide range there on which such training could be given.  I know that within the next six months there will be a demand for a huge number of apprentices in Irish Steel, Ltd., in Cobh, and I cannot see any reason why experts could not be brought in to train these youngsters in the technical schools there.  Goodness knows, the ratepayers are paying enough for this service, but yet we see the young people of Cobh flying away to other countries&mdash;to England, and so on&mdash;to get work, while men from England and other countries are brought over here to do the work.</P>
      <P>The same applies to Cork City, where you have woollen mills, and so on.  Where a technical school is situated in a town, the Minister should give special consideration to the particular industry or industries in that town or adjacent to it, so that these young lads could go in as trained people to do the work.  That is the main question that I was anxious to raise on this Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see no reason and no justification whatever for the employment, after three or four years, of any <Col N="129" /> foreigner in our industries.  If our youth get specialised training in our technical schools and then go in to these industries as apprentices, there is no, reason for our having to chase all over the world for experts in this or that.</P>
    <P>It was to make that point that I mainly rose to speak.  There is opportunity for training as draughtsmen and in all branches of the melting and turning out of metals.  There is opportunity in the shipbuilding trade in Rushbrooke for training in practically everything. It is appalling to see our youth having to clear out of the country, half-educated, to look for a livelihood, while every other day we get ten experts over from England, ten men who are used to handling this, that and the other.  The steel industry has been carried on there since 1939, but I have not as yet seen one expert from that industry brought into the technical school in Cobh for the purpose of educating the young lads there and giving them what might be called preparatory training to enable them to earn their living in the industry afterwards. I know from conversations I have had with these experts that they are only too willing to go there, if asked, and it is far better to teach them these things than what they are being taught.  It is a matter about which I feel keenly&mdash;that the ratepayers' money and the taxpayers' money should be wasted on vocational schools which should be training our youth to earn their livelihood at home.</P>

Ní hiongnadh go ngním mórtas de seo mar chím ón chuntas oifigiúil go bhfuil a thrí oiread againn i dTír Chonaill agus tá i gCúige Mumhan go léir.  Tharla an scéal mar seo, tá mé ag iarraidh ar an Roinn cothrom na féinne thabhairt do phaistí Chúige Ulladh i dtaca le téacs-leabhraí, páipéir scrúduchain, i líonadh postanna san Stát-Sheirbhís agus mar sin.  Is minic iad i geanúint nach bhfuil siad cleachtaithe léi.</P>

    <P>Cia againn nach gcualaidh fan chaoi atá ar mhúinteoirí ogá atá i bhfiacha mar nach bhfuil tuarastal acu a dtiocfadh leo bheith beo air?  Níl iongantas go mbeadh an t-aos óg atá faoi n-a gcúram gan múnadh gan stiúradh nuair atá na múinteoirí iad féin mí-shuaimhneach agus mí-shásta leis an tsaol.  Chualaimid uilig an torman a bhí acu ar na mallaibh san Dáil.  Ní rabh sin gan abhar, mar ní bhíonn toit gan teine.  Molaim don Rialtas cás na múinteoirí athbhreithniú. Molaim fosta go ndéanfaí <Col N="131" /> réiteach breis pinsin a thabhairt don bhaicle beag múinteoirí a chuaidh amach faoin'n sean-scéim agus atá air ghannchuid anois.</P>

      <P>Tá a fhios ag gach éinne go bhfuil a lán rudaí maithe déanta ag an Aire, agus ag an Roinn Oideachais ina theannta san féna stiúrú le linn a réime.  Deineadh tagairt do chuid acu agus ní gá dul <Col N="132" /> thar n-ais orthu mar ni chun iad san do chloisint atá an tAire annso, ach chun tuairimí na dTeachtaí Dála ar scéimeanna oideachais na tíre d'fháil mar chomhairle leasa.</P>
      <P>I move to report progress.</P>
