      <P>On the Order of Business, Sir, I want to ask An Tánaiste whether he will give the House an opportunity of discussing the Government's proposal to assassinate the St. John Ambulance Brigade before that deed is consummated under protection of the censorship.  At present the public are prohibited from hearing a word about that transaction.  Will we be given an opportunity of discussing it in the Dáil before it is carried to its diabolical conclusion?</P>

      <P>Yesterday, during the discussion of the Tuberculosis Sanatoria Bill, the Deputy made an allegation against the Taoiseach, attaching it to the debate by a slender thread of relevancy.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the conclusion was reached or the allegation had been towed into port, the tow-line had snapped.  The Deputy desires, I presume, to discuss an alleged charge against the Taoiseach, the Taoiseach not being present, and without any notice having been given to the Taoiseach that it would arise.  That is the exact position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg leave to correct that, Sir.  The Taoiseach is head of the Government.  He acts as head of the Government and he is represented <Col N="2117" /> here by the Tánaiste, in his regretted absence due to indisposition.  I have no doubt that anything the Taoiseach did he did with the full concurrence of his colleagues and that they accept joint responsibility with him.  If the Taoiseach is regrettably unable to attend, the Tánaiste is well able to defend the Government in any action they take, and, I am sure, will be the last man to protest that he cannot defend the Government while the Taoiseach is laid up with a cold.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill is an amendment to an Act that was passed in 1941, under which the dependents of Gárdaí who were murdered in the course of their duty were awarded compensation. The court felt bound, under that Act, to give a very rigid interpretation and to award compensation on a strictly financial basis.  They took into consideration any assets that the deceased Gárda might have had in assessing compensation.  We are providing here that they shall not take these assets into consideration, and that they will also have regard to losses other than financial ones.  That is all this Bill sets out to provide for, and that is all that was required. I, myself, was dissatisfied with the former Act, and I think that the judge himself was dissatisfied with its provisions, but he felt constrained, in making awards, to take these matters into consideration.  I promised to bring in a Bill to amend that Act, so far as that matter was concerned, and I think this Bill fulfils that object.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I have anything more to say on this.  I understand that there are only about six cases involved, and I did promise, on the other Bill, that we would go into old cases.  We did examine those cases and, so far as I know, we got no claim.  Practically all of those Gárdaí who were killed before 1940 were unmarried, and very few of them had dependents, as far as I know.  Some <Col N="2120" /> compensation was given, but I understand that it was very small, except in the case of one officer's widow in which, I understand, the compensation given was quite satisfactory.  So far as the other cases were concerned, it would appear that the compensation given was unsatisfactory.  Since 1941, none of those claims came up, so far as I know.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to say that we, on this side of the House, will give our wholehearted support to this Bill. I say that, however, subject to the reservation that there are certain aspects of the Bill which we think should be considered now.  Whilst we appreciate that the Minister is moved, in introducing this Bill, by a spirit of generosity towards the dependents of the murdered members of the Gárda Síochána, yet we have certain doubts that, under this Bill, the troubles which have arisen in the court in regard to these cases will be cured entirely.  Now, the 1941 Act was made retrospective as far as the 1st January, 1940.  It did not extend back to those cases which had occurred before the 1st January, 1940.  I understood the Minister to say that no claims were received on behalf of the dependents of those people, and that it was difficult to prove dependency, but I want to put this to the Minister: that here were ten members of the Gárda Síochána murdered before the passing of the 1941 Act, and that in only one of those cases was it possible for the court to make an award.  That was the case of Sergeant Griffin, who was murdered at Carrick-on-Suir in 1934. The dependents of his colleague on that occasion, Gárda Murrin, were, for some unknown reason, not given any award.  I cannot say if there was an application to the court under the old Act for compensation, but no <i>ex gratia</i> grant by the State was made to the relatives of Gárda Murrin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other cases, which I shall briefly recite, cover the period from 1922 to 1932.  You have the case of Gárda Phelan, who was murdered at Mullina-hone, in the execution of his duty on 14th November, 1922.  There was no award given by the court in his case, <Col N="2121" /> nor was there an <i>ex gratia</i> grant from the State.  In 1923, Sergeant Woods was murdered at Scartaglen, County Kerry, in which case there was an <i>ex gratia</i> payment of £80.  There is also the case of Gárda O'Halloran, who was murdered at Baltinglass, County Wick-low, in whose case there was no court award nor any <i>ex gratia</i> payment made by the State.  Then there was the case of Gárda Dowling, who was killed on 28th December, 1925, in whose case there was an <i>ex gratia</i> grant of £100. There is also the case of Sergeant Fitzsimons, who was murdered in Cork on 14th November, 1926, and his dependents got an <i>ex gratia</i> grant of £50. Gárda Ward was murdered on the same date, and his dependents got an <i>ex gratia</i> grant of £80.  Detective Gárda T. O'Sullivan was murdered in Clare on 17th June, 1929, and, as a result of long correspondence in his case, his dependents were awarded an <i>ex gratia</i> grant of £500.  That was the case where this unfortunate man was blown up by a trap-mine.  Detective Gárda P. McGeehan was murdered on 14th July, 1932.  That was in connection with the murder of the late Mr. Reynolds, a Deputy of this House, and no award was made in this case either by the courts or by the State.</P>
    <P>When you review those awards, the amount appears to be very niggardly. The total sum amounts to £1,410, and I would ask the Minister seriously to consider, even now, making this Bill retrospective so as to include the dependents of those former members of the Gárda Síochána.  May I put it to the Minister, and to the House, that those were the men who, largely, were the pioneers of the Gárda Síochána?  They were the men who established the heroic tradition of the Gárda Síochána, a tradition which has received the praise both of the Taoiseach and of the Minister in this House on a recent occasion.  I do not want to labour the point.  The Latin poet, Horace, told us that it is sweet and honourable to die for Fatherland, and the nations of the world, through the centuries from his time, have advocated that fine principle to their peoples.  None of the heroes who have died, either in the Gárda Síochána or <Col N="2122" /> elsewhere, to establish a noble or heroic tradition, has ever come back to tell us whether it was sweet or bitter to die for Fatherland.  We do know from these cases, and from the cases which came to the courts under the 1941 Act, that the burden left to the dependents of these men is anything but sweet.</P>
    <P>I think it is the duty of this House to repair the injustice done to the dependents of these men who were murdered before the passing of the Act, and who did not come within the provisions of it.  It would be some consolation to these dependents to know that, even now, the State at this belated hour had recognised their services and granted some recognition of their valour.  It would be some easement to the dependents of some of these men to know that even now they would be required for the loss of members of their families.  I do not think the amount involved would be very large.  I believe that a number of the parents, and probably other members of their families, have departed, and that there may not be any occasion to make an award at all, but I feel that the House, at least, should accept the principle and recognise the valour of these men.  I may be told that this is a legacy from a former Administration, which should not be handed on now, and that the matter was not raised before. I put it to the Minister that it might not have been politic in the early-days of the Gárdaí to bring such a measure as this before the House, but in the changed atmosphere in which we find ourselves now, I think we should repair this injustice; certainly we should not perpetuate it.</P>
    <P>I remind the House that if this matter was overlooked in the early days of the State, it was, probably, due to the fact that the State was then in its formative period; groping its way towards established conditions, and that there was not time to deal with it.  I am sure it was never intended to overlook these people. Now that we have the opportunity under this Bill, I ask the House seriously to consider the position, and I ask the Minister to consider putting down Ministerial amendments to bring <Col N="2123" /> these cases within the scope of this Bill.  It would be a matter of a few paltry thousand pounds at the very outside, and it will not only alleviate the pain and suffering of these people's relatives who are still alive, but it will give them some consolation. It will also give a certain degree of consolation to the older members of the Gárda Síochána who feel very keenly on these matters.  I cannot say why this question has not been noticed before.  The Minister will, probably, be able to explain that at a later stage. whatever the reason may be, I ask him, in all seriousness, to include these cases now.  It may seem extraordinary to the Housé that the dependents of these men were not provided for earlier, but at that time we were working under Section 106 of the old Grand Jury Act of 1836.  That Act enabled awards to be made only in cases where men were actually killed or murdered because of their past exertions to bring criminals to justice. In other words, if the act of murder were not committed because of &ldquo;past exertions&rdquo; then they would not come within the scope of the Act at all. For example, if a Gárda met a man and suddenly decided to arrest him, if that man there and then pulled a gun on him, the Gárda would be outside the terms of the Act.  That was the position.  There was also the difficulty of proving dependency.</P>
    <P>In 1919 the British Parliament passed an Act amending the Act of 1836, and extended the scope of compensation so widely that almost unlimited discretion was given to the courts to award compensation according to the circumstances of the case.  There was the case of O'Connell v. Tipperary County Council which ultimately settled the law.  Such compensation meant a full compensation, which would include general damages to cover not only financial loss but also pain and suffering, loss of consortium and solatium for injured feelings.  As a result of that Act, and the fight against the British Government here, several applications were made by the dependents of the Royal Irish Constabulary who were &ldquo;murdered&rdquo; or killed during that <Col N="2124" /> period, and most extraordinary awards were made, being as high as £17,000 and £18,000 in an individual case.  I merely mention that to contrast the treatment meted out to those men and to the dependents of the Gárda Síochána.  Of course, the awards at that time were not contested by the county councils and, as a result, they were probably far more excessive than would have been the case.  Nevertheless, it was laid down as settled law that the courts were entitled to give full compensation to cover pain and suffering and to take into account the loss of a husband or father.</P>
    <P>The 1919 Act was repealed in due course.  We reverted to the old Grand Jury Act until the Act of 1941 was passed and the intention undoubtedly under that Act was that something in the nature of full compensation would be awarded.  But, because of the provisions of the Act, the courts found themselves unable to grant a full and adequate compensation.  They interpreted the Act on the basis of the precedent established under Lord Camp-bell's Act&mdash;the Fatal Accident Act&mdash; which deals with ordinary cases of accidents in the course of every-day life.  The result was that dependents of the Gárda found themselves in this position, that their claims were calculated on a purely actuarial basis, on a plus or minus basis, cold arithmetic, which did not take into consideration any of these other matters which I suggest to the House should be considered in cases of this kind.  The culmination was reached in the case of the late Detective-Sergeant O'Brien, who was murdered recently.  He was a very distinguished, efficient and able member of the Special Branch of the Gárda Síochána, a man who had very high prospects in the service.  Yet, when his case came before the courts, the judges found themselves, much as they would like to do so, unable to go outside the actuarial basis.  In that case, the result was that a sum of £1,330 was awarded to the widow, £144 to a daughter of 15 years, and £180 to a daughter of 14 years, a total of £1,654. If Sergeant O'Brien had been injured in a road accident, his widow and children would have been awarded, at <Col N="2125" /> least, three times that amount.  The O'Brien case was brought to the Supreme Court and that court held with the High Court.</P>
    <P>Three questions were put in that case and I should like to bring them to the notice of the House.  One was: &ldquo;Whether the court should take into consideration the value of the financial benefits, other than those specified in Section 10 (3) of the Act, actually received by the applicants or to which the applicants became entitled under the will of the deceased or as next-of-kin or otherwise by reason of his death; if so, whether the court should deduct the full amount of such benefits from the amount which would be otherwise awarded to the applicants&rdquo;. The answer to that question was &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  The second question was: &ldquo;Whether compensation under the Act should be measured by relation to the pecuniary loss suffered by the applicants or should represent full compensation to the applicants, in the case of the widow for the loss of her husband; in the case of the children, for the loss of their father and, in the case of both, for the break-up of the home and the loss of parental guidance, help and other advantages.&rdquo; The answer to that question was: &ldquo;The court should make such deductions from the amount as it considers just and reasonable.&rdquo;  In other words, it should take advantage of any financial advantages accruing and deduct them from the amount of the award made.  The third question was: &ldquo;Whether a sum can be allowed for general damages.&rdquo;  The answer to that was an emphatic &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In this Bill, there is a provision which relates to Section 2 (2) (a) (iii). Again, in awarding damages, the court may take into consideration &ldquo;the financial advantages which the applicant might reasonably have expected to receive in the future from the deceased if deceased had not died at the time at which he did die.&rdquo;  That provision has been interpreted by the court on this actuarial basis on precedents established under Lord Camp-bell's Act and not in the light which was intended.  I believe that it was intended that the court should take <Col N="2126" /> into consideration the financial prospects of the deceased by way of promotion and otherwise.  It is not at all clear, to my mind, that the courts are doing that.  I am afraid that an ungenerous interpretation is being given to those provisions.  While the Minister is opening the door to a wider interpretation, I am not at all sure that, coupling Section 2 (2) (a) (iii) with Section 2 (1), we shall not find ourselves again in some plus and minus arrangement by which dependents will be deprived of that generous award which it is, I am sure, the wish of the House they should receive.</P>
    <P>We can raise questions as to the form of the drafting on Committee Stage, but I suggest that the phrase in Section 2 (2) (a) (i) that the court &ldquo;shall not take into account any property (including assets of the deceased) to which the applicant has become entitled by reason of the death of the deceased&rdquo;, may require a certain amount of elucidation.  I propose to raise that on the Committee Stage.  On this question of loss, under Section 2 (2) (a) (iv), the court is entitled to take into consideration &ldquo;any loss (other than financial loss) sustained by the applicant&rdquo;.  I am not so sure that we are quite safe in that provision.  I am not satisfied that, if that provision stands, the Minister will not have to come to this House again and ask for a further amendment of the law to ensure that these men are treated generously.  I suggest that, after &ldquo;loss&rdquo;, you should add &ldquo;or damage&rdquo;.  Then the court will be in a position to award generous compensation based on general damages.  No financial award will compensate for the loss of a father or husband, but it is the duty of the State to ensure that, so far as possible, the courts will be in a position to treat generously, and more than generously, men who give their lives for its safety and security. Accordingly, I ask the Minister to broaden those provisions, so that the courts will be able to make their awards on the basis of general damages.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention a case that is <i>sub judice.</i>  I do not want to go into the facts.  I thought that the Minister <Col N="2127" /> would have mentioned it.  The applicant in that case is Mrs. Harrington, widow of a Guard who was murdered recently at Nenagh.  This case was at hearing and the judge found himself in a difficulty as to making any award and in interpreting the Act of 1941.  He adjourned the case for the purpose of enabling this House to consider the matter.  On this point I want to direct that Minister's attention to Section 2 (1), paragraph (a) (i) of the 1941 Act.  It reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1) This Act applies&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) to the death of a member of the Gárda Síochana who dies at the date of the passing of this Act from injuries maliciously inflicted (whether before or after such passing on him)&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) in the performance of his duties as such member while actually on duty, or...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The difficulty there is that you have to prove that the death occurred &ldquo;in the performance of his duties... while actually on duty.&rdquo;  That puts the onus on the dependent of the deceased member to prove that at the actual time of death the man was on duty. Now I put it this way: A man may be engaged on office duty and he may have occasion to leave his office.  Is it seriously suggested that because he leaves his office for a moment during the day he ceases to be on duty?  That is what you are getting at in that provision. Now, in this case two members of the Gárda met and unfortunately had an argument which resulted in the deaths of both men.  The widow of one of them is an applicant before the courts.  Her husband actually came on duty.  He went to his office and performed a few minutes duty; he came downstairs for a reason that nobody can now say, and was confronted by another member who had an altercation with him and shot him dead and then committed suicide himself. In that extraordinary case the question arises: was the man on duty? I say he was.  He reported for duty. He had taken up the duties of his office and for a moment came downstairs when this unfortunate occurrence <Col N="2128" /> arose.  Such a thing may arise in many other circumstances apart from this case.  I say it is unfair to place the onus on the dependent applicant of proving that at the time the deceased member was actually on duty. I seriously suggest to the Minister that he should remove from that provision the words: &ldquo;in the performance of his duty,&rdquo; so that the provision would then cover a man while actually on duty.</P>
    <P>In the award of special pensions, where men are injured or die as a result of accidental injuries received while on duty, the policy of the Department of Finance, I understand, is to award a pension to a man while he was actually on duty, proceeding from his duty or to his duty.  I seriously suggest to the Minister that he should make that provision now, so as to relieve the dependents in these cases from the obligation of proving that a man was actually on duty at the time.  I do not think it is fair to the dependents of deceased to ask them to prove that.  I am putting it to the Minister that he has an opportunity of mending his hand in these cases and of making it easier for applicants to get compensation.  I think it is only right that this House also should make it easier for them.  There should be no obstacles put in the way. We should approach this matter in a generous, open-hearted spirit.  The words are tautological in any event: &ldquo;in the performance of his duty&rdquo;, &ldquo;while actually on duty&rdquo;.  It is very difficult to assign a meaning to them. A pointsman may have to leave his point, or a man on beat duty may have to leave his beat.  If he is momentarily off his point or beat, and is killed during that moment, the dependents cannot claim compensation.  I suggest that a narrow interpretation like that should not be imposed on the unfortunate applicants who have to seek compensation. They have enough worries and troubles without adding to them. As I have said, if the Minister takes this opportunity of mending his hand in the matter of extending compensation to those who died between the years 1922 and 1942, he will probably have to consider some consequential amendments, such as whether the compensation <Col N="2129" /> should be paid to the personal representative or the next-of-kin. I appreciate that it would be difficult in their cases to adhere to the provisions of the 1941 Act.  I think that in their cases, if you do agree to extend the principle of compensation to them, you will have to bring in some form to provide for the payment of the money to the next-of-kin or the personal representative of the deceased.</P>
    <P>I must say that I was personally disappointed that this Bill did not make some provision for men injured in the course of their duties.  The provisions of the 1941 Act on this point are briefly these: that a member injured on duty is entitled to apply to the Minister for compensation.  If the Minister is satisfied that the compensation can be met within a sum of £100 he may award a sum not exceeding £100.  If he is satisfied that no compensation is payable there is no appeal.  In other words, the courts are shut out in the matter of injuries. The Minister has also the power to decide whether the duty upon which the member injured was engaged was duty involving a special risk.  It is very difficult to lay down a hard and fast rule on this question of risk.  A man may be put on the protection of land in one county and be perfectly safe.  There is no risk whatever in that; it is a perfectly easy job.  A man may be put on the same duty in another county and it is highly dangerous. A man may go out on ordinary beat duty and meet some ruffian who will beat him up and maim him for life.  There is no special risk involved in that duty, but, nevertheless, the man is maimed for life.  I suggest to the Minister that he will have to widen the provisions in that respect.</P>
    <P>I seriously suggest to the Minister that this business of an official decision within his own Department is contrary to the rules of law.  We have in every Act that comes before this House the tendency to hand over judicial functions to the Minister of the particular Department piloting the Bill. When we hand over judicial functions to the Minister, in practice we are handing them over to some anonymous <Col N="2130" /> civil servant who has not to answer to this House for his acts.  We are also handing over the functions of a judge and of a jury, perhaps, to these civil servants.  I seriously suggest, without casting any disparagement whatever on civil servants, that they are not fitted to adjudicate in matters where questions of law are involved. I will go further and suggest that in the deciding of these matters only a Departmental, official, one-sided view may be taken.  Further, when a particular Department, say the Department of Justice, gives a decision on these matters and is prepared to act decently and generously, it may find itself overruled by the Department of Finance. The watchdogs of the Treasury are there to see that the Minister does not err in the way of excessive generosity. I do not want to go into this question of the administration of law on this Bill, but I will say this, that if a citizen is injured in the course of his employment he is entitled to go to the courts for redress if he feels aggrieved by any award granted to him by his firm.  The same principle should be extended to members of the Gárda under this Bill.  It is not fair, just or reasonable that they should be restricted from appealing to the courts if they feel that they have a grievance in the amount awarded to them under the head of injuries.  A man who is seriously injured may be told by the Department official: &ldquo;We will give you £50&rdquo;.  It may be a serious wound and he has no idea what the result of it may be, in years to come.  I do not know whether the Department official has a medical examination made of the applicant, to satisfy himself by expert advice that this man will not, in years to come, be maimed and unfit for duty. I put it to the Minister that the fairest way to deal with this matter is to allow the applicant to thrash his case out in court, produce his expert evidence and give both the State and the applicant the opportunity of cross-examination.</P>
    <P>When you deal with this matter behind closed doors in Government Buildings the applicant hears no more about it until a decision is reached; he has no opportunity of fighting his case, of being heard in <Col N="2131" /> person and cross-examining the official on his view of the matter or on any evidence the official, in the exercise of his duty, may have collected on the particular application.  I have personal experience of one case in which a member of the force was seriously wounded, receiving a bullet in the thigh.  The Minister decided to dispose of that case departmentally and awarded the sum of £50.  On that occasion a colleague of that man was shot dead.  I do not know whether this man's wound was serious or trivial, but I do know he had a bullet wound in the thigh, and I know from men who have received wounds that there is a tendency, in middle and later life, for the muscles to contract and for certain disturbances to occur in the system.  It is quite on the cards that, while this man may be young and fresh now, he may suffer from this injury later.  In a case of that kind the applicant should have had the right to go to court, as the award of £50 was altogether inadequate.  A civilian in similar circumstances, applying to the courts in an ordinary action of negligence, would get something more like £500 than £50.</P>
    <P>I know that the present Minister is generously disposed towards members of the Gárda, and I know the officials of the Department are, too, but I am arguing this case impersonally in regard to the future.  We do not know who the future Minister may be or what Departmental officials may be in charge, so there should be a right of appeal from the Departmental decision in these matters.  I agree to let the Minister decide departmentally, as nine cases out of ten will come within that category, but I would let the doubtful case have the right of appeal to the court.  The case I mentioned is well known to the Minister, and I need not stress it further.</P>
    <P>As I am personally aware, there is a certain amount of uneasiness in the Force on this point.  In all fairness to the Force and to the Minister, the right of appeal should be given in the case of injuries.  It would relieve the applicant from any suggestion that he did not get a fair hearing and it would <Col N="2132" /> relieve the Force and the Minister from any suggestion that undue influence was exercised in favour of one applicant, or against another.  Considerations of that type may arise, and it would be only fair that the present Bill should be extended to include these particular items.</P>
    <P>I wish to stress the point I have made already, that loss should be placed upon the widest possible basis, to include general damages, to include not only pecuniary losses but something as a solatium for the injured and outraged feelings, something for the loss of a consort, of a husband or a father, something that, as was laid down in the O'Connell versus Tipperary County Council-case, will be full and adequate compensation for the dependents.  This Bill does not touch injury in the case of Gárda injuries. I think that it should.  We have cases on record of men who were very seriously injured on ordinary duty.  Under the old law, these men were not entitled to any compensation; under the new law as it stands, under the 1941 Act, the Minister has the final decision in the matter.  I am putting it to him that it is impossible to decide what duty of a policeman involves a special risk.  I do not believe anybody can determine it.  We had a case in Dublin not very long ago of a man who was seriously maimed and got no compensation; we had a case of a man whose right jaw was broken and whose left jaw was fractured and he was, in the legal sense of the term, maimed, but he got no compensation.</P>
    <P>There may be a thousand and one cases in future where men are injured on ordinary beat duty.  Therefore, the Minister should divest himself of this power to decide what is and what is not a special risk.  There is no way of determining that.  A man may be on ordinary beat duty at a street corner and a bank robbery may take place; he may find himself suddenly confronted by gunmen and, although he is not on special duty, he may find himself in extraordinary circumstances, in the flash of an eye; he may be injured and if so, is the Minister to decide that he was not on duty of a special nature?  These matters should <Col N="2133" /> be left to the courts and, consequently, I appeal to the Minister to consider seriously the amending of Section 6 of the 1941 Act, so that aggrieved applicants who are not satisfied with the amount of their compensation or whose claims for compensation have been rejected by the Minister, may have the right of appeal to a court. That is not asking very much.  It is the ordinary right which the ordinary citizen has and I appeal to him and to the House to provide these facilities.</P>
    <P>These men are members of a silent service; they have no trade union and are not allowed to affiliate with any trade union body; they cannot exercise the rights which an ordinary man can exercise.  They have a Representative Body, it is true, but that body is merely a safety valve which the Minister permits to enable the members to blow off steam occasionally.  My experience of it is that very little notice is taken of the Representative Body resolutions.  The same old hardy annuals crop up year after year&mdash;&ldquo;they are under consideration&rdquo; or &ldquo;they will be considered&rdquo; or there is no answer given.  These men cannot approach this House, they cannot send a deputation to any of the Parties in this House or to individual Deputies, as may any other body of citizens. They must ventilate their grievances through the Representative Body, the Commissioner and the Minister, and all other channels of appeal are <i>taboo.</i> They are prohibited by regulations from doing any of these things.  Further more, these men have no votes; they have no way of influencing political opinion in the country.  They are in that sense in a helpless position.  I think it is only fair, therefore, having regard to the handicaps under which they operate, having regard to the difficulties in which they find themselves in putting forth their grievances, wrongs and troubles, that we should give wide powers in this measure.</P>
    <P>These men are prepared to give their lives for their country.  Few, if any, in my experience have shirked their duties.  They have stood up to the criminal, whether armed or unarmed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2134" /> They have set as high a tradition in police work as obtains in any country in the world.  They went out as an unarmed force into an armed countryside. They went out in a time of chaos and disorder to restore law and order. They succeeded in doing that.  The older members, of whom I spoke, established an honourable tradition which I am pleased to say is being followed to-day.  These men have shown that they are prepared to serve their country irrespective of Party, creed or class; that they are prepared to serve any Government set up by the majority will of the people.  They have shown themselves loyal to the State and to the institutions and the Government of the State.  Having regard to all these facts, I ask the Minister to give these men the rights which they claim under this Bill.  I ask the Minister to take this opportunity of, once and for all, disposing of this matter of Gárda compensation.  We have a chance now; let us use it; otherwise we shall find ourselves coming back with an amending Bill in a few years' time.</P>
    <P>I do not think that these matters should come too often before the House.  It looks ungenerous on the part of the State if they have to come before the House frequently for legislation. Now is the time to do it, and I ask the Minister to take his courage in his hands and go the whole hog and give these men what they are entitled to.  I believe that he will have no reason to be dissatisfied if he takes his courage in his hands now and amends the Bill on the lines I have suggested. It would save me the trouble if the Minister would put all these things down as Ministerial amendments, but I certainly intend to put them down for the Committee Stage if there is no sign from the other side.</P>

      <P>I should like to compliment Deputy Coogan on his presentation of his case and to state for the information of the Minister and everybody else that we are prepared to support the Minister in every possible way in making it clear to the Gárda that the State will stand over <Col N="2135" /> them in the complete discharge of their duties.  I think it would be a great weakness in the prestige of this Parliament, looking at the responsible position of the Gárda, looking at the many difficulties they have been faced with and may be called upon to face in a rather difficult and perhaps uncertain future, if the Gárda did not know that in every possible way they would be supported in the discharge of their duties and that they need have no anxiety on their minds in discharging their duties even when it entails danger to life or limb.  If the Minister thinks, after the discussion of this measure, that he would like to have a closer examination of the financial problem involved or the social problem involved, I suggest to him that he could secure a deeper and further consideration of this matter by referring the Bill in the Committee Stage to a special committee of the House.  By doing that, he could in a more detailed way go into some of the figures he has in mind and into some of the more detailed financial and social aspects of the question than if the Committee Stage were taken in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to endorse the suggestion made by Deputy Mulcahy.  If the Minister feels that it is not possible to meet all the points raised by Deputy Coogan immediately, he should defer consideration of the Bill for some time, and have the matter more fully investigated.  It is undesirable that legislation of this kind should have to be brought before the House frequently; that Acts passed with the best intention should be found to be faulty and have to be amended. Deputy Coogan raised a considerable number of very important points which deserve consideration from all Parties in the House.  I should like to support his view that, in considering the question of compensation, we should go right back to the foundation of the force and consider the cases of men who lost their lives in the early days of this State in defending the maintenance of order and thus establishing the high tradition which has been set for the Gárda.  Nothing that we do should lead the Gárda to feel that this <Col N="2136" /> House does not appreciate their services to the State.  Every member of the Gárda who is carrying out his duty should feel that he has the full protection and the full support of this Dáil behind him, and that, whatever may happen to him, the interests of his dependents will be amply safeguarded.</P>
      <P>I think it is unnecessary to say that the freedom of the people of this country and the liberty of this nation depend to a very large extent upon the integrity and courage of the members of the Gárda Síochána.  It is only their vigilance and their unfailing services to the State that will ensure that the plain, simple, defenceless citizen shall have the freedom and the protection he is entitled to, shall be free to go about his work, free to cast his vote for whatever Party he thinks fit, and free to exercise all the duties of citizenship. Having regard to the importance of a police force in any State and to the great services which the Gárda Síochána have rendered in this country, the points which have been put forward by Deputy Coogan should receive the careful attention of the Minister, and any co-operation which the House can give him in implementing those proposals I think will be freely given.</P>

      <P>If the Government had been satisfied with the way the Act was working out, we would not have brought in this amendment.  It is because we appreciate that adequate compensation was not given that we brought in this Bill.  Deputy Coogan raised certain points in regard to the Bill, but I do not think there is very much in some of them.  For instance, as to the phrase &ldquo;losses other than financial&rdquo;, I do not think we could have a wider phrase.  Our advice is that that would take in any loss in addition to financial loss that the court wishes to take notice of.  I do not see how it could be any wider.  It would cover loss of companionship and that sort of thing.</P>

      <P>I said on the occasion when the other Bill was before the House that we would deal with all these cases that were brought up and, as far as I can find, none has been brought to our notice.  I have a full list here&mdash;the list that was read out by Deputy Coogan&mdash;and the difficulty is in regard to dependency.  I think in the one case in which dependency was proved the court gave what was considered to be adequate compensation. In other cases the Guards concerned were unmarried and in one case that Deputy Coogan mentioned no claim was made.  I do not know why that is so, but we have no record of any claim having been made.  In the other case certain compensation was given for expenses and other items but no clear dependency was proved.  In these circumstances, I do not see any necessity whatever for amending the Act or bringing in any special section, but if it can be shown that there are any dependents of any of these pre-1941 men we can deal with them by an <i>ex gratia</i> gratuity.</P>

Where is the necessity to go to the trouble of setting up a tribunal, if we have not any applicants?  I can assure everybody here that we are all most anxious to meet these cases.  There <Col N="2138" /> was no objection whatever to treating then generously, but they have not come forward.  Of course, people who cannot prove dependency&mdash;perhaps brothers and sisters&mdash;may come forward. There is always the question of dependency.  They must prove dependency and if that can be proved we are in a position, without any amendment of the Act, to meet them <i>ex gratia.</i> If there were any necessity for a tribunal, I would consider it, but I can assure Deputies that there is not. It is not that I am resisting it.</P>

      <P>Yes.  It is because of that that we introduced the 1941 Act. It had to be proved that the Guard was killed or injured in the discharge of his duties, or that it was done through malice.  In addition, the cost was levied on the county instead of being paid by the central Government. That was the reason the 1941 Act was brought in.  So far as the pre-1941 cases are concerned, that is the position. I said so at the time, and I thought, having made that statement at the time, that we would have got some genuine claims which would have established dependency and hardship as a result of the murder of those Guards, but that did not happen.</P>

All I am doing is to give the court more discretion, stating that they must not take into consideration any assets of the deceased that the applicant may become entitled to as a result of his death.  That was a big trouble in what happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to compensation for injuries, I think the 1941 Act is quite all <Col N="2140" /> right because all that is provided there is that the Minister must be satisfied that it is not a minor injury.  This point was debated at considerable length during the passage of the 1941 Act.  If I were to agree that all cases could go to court, it would amount to this, that a man who got a black eye or got his finger bruised could bring a case.</P>

      <P>That could happen with every injury; I do not see how we could prevent that, whereas, when a case comes now, the Minister gets a certain amount of evidence as to the injury and if it is only a minor injury £5 or £10 might be good enough.  I do not know about the particular case of the man who got a bullet wound.  If he got only £50 it must have been a very slight wound.  We all know that men can get bullet wounds that are not very serious.  If he got only £50, it must have been a very slight wound.  We would never dream of palming off a man with £50 if he received a serious injury.  In any case other than that of a minor injury the Minister must allow the case to go to court.  That is laid down in Section 6, as Deputy Coogan knows.  As I explained, the Minister has permission, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to award up to £100 damages, even for a minor injury. The reason for that is that, although it might be only a minor injury, the nature of his work might be of such a serious character that it was well worth giving him more compensation than the injury warranted.  That is really all that was intended there.  If the injury was serious, he has the right to go to the courts.</P>

I do not think there is any reason to fear that any injustice will be done. No Minister for Justice is going to behave in a niggardly manner in those cases.  I think everyone in the House realises that the Guards must be supported, <Col N="2141" /> must be assured that they have the whole support of the House, and that, if they are injured, they will be compensated.  I appreciate what Deputy Mulcahy says; I know that is the general feeling, but I feel that there is no necessity to set up any special committee to deal with this matter.  I shall be very much surprised indeed if things are not much more satisfactory when this Bill becomes an Act.  If there are any of those pre-1941 cases, I should like to hear about them, and I will have them examined. I have power to meet them by an <i>ex gratia</i> payment.</P>

      <P>In connection with sub-paragraph (4) of sub-section (2) of Section 2, would the Minister consider that that sub-section might give rise to the kind of claim for anticipation of life that set the common law courts in England by the ears some years ago? The Minister may remember that, about seven years ago, there was a whole series of cases, when some judges awarded a man £15,000 for anticipation of life, and other judges awarded a man 15/6 for anticipation of life, until eventually it became necessary to pass special legislation to deal with it.  I do not expect the Minister to be in a position to answer that inquiry off-hand, but perhaps he would look into that question of possible claims for anticipation of life under sub-paragraph (4), and if the paragraph requires clarification he might undertake such clarification on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The necessity for it arises very largely if not entirely out of the emergency. The powers that are sought will be of considerable value to us during the emergency, and perhaps afterwards; it is most likely that some of the conditions with which we are acquainted now will continue after the emergency. I think members of the House generally are aware that we have what may be regarded as pretty ample powers to deal with people who try to import into this country, without payment of duty, goods which are subject to duty &mdash;to smuggle them, in other words. Our revenue authorities, and our customs authorities in particular, have ample power to deal with illegal activities in regard to the import of prohibited goods.  Under present conditions&mdash;conditions which, as I say, will probably last even after the end of the emergency&mdash;we want similar power to deal with the export of prohibited goods.  We cannot say that we have ample powers to deal with the export of prohibited goods at present.  That has been our experience during the last few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill are, in the main, intended to form a complete code relating to procedure, penalties and seizures in the case of the illegal exportation or attempted exportation of goods subject to any export prohibition. In the case of goods imported irregularly, whether so imported with intent to evade payment of duty or with intent to evade some import prohibition or restriction, the Customs Consolidated Act, 1876, as later amended, provides a comprehensive and detailed code.  That Act, however, makes no corresponding provision for goods subject to export prohibitions or restrictions, as at the time that the Act was passed prohibitions on exportation were practically <Col N="2143" /> non-existent.  From time to time, however, such prohibitions came into force and an attempt to provide the legal machinery necessary for control was made by the adaptation to export conditions of certain import provisions. These adaptations were, however, very limited in scope and it was not until the passing of the Scrap Iron (Control of Export) Act, 1938, that more extended powers, based on adaptation of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, were taken.  Cases of irregular exportation then began to occur with a certain regularity.  They were, however, few in number and no practical difficulty arose until the wide range of export prohibitions which it has been found necessary to impose as the result of emergency conditions made the question one of major importance.</P>
    <P>Prohibitions and restrictions imposed on goods as the result of emergency conditions are, as a rule, based on Emergency Powers Orders made under the powers conferred by Article 31 of the Emergency Powers Order, 1939, which enable a Minister to provide by Order, for regulating, restricting or prohibiting the importation or exportation of any articles.  Section 5 of the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, makes any contravention of such an Order an offence punishable with specific penalties, and further provides for forfeiture, by order of the court, of any goods involved.  This procedure, however, was not sufficient to invest the Revenue Commissioners with such powers as revenue practice requires for adequate control and to remedy this defect the penal procedure provided by the Scrap Iron (Control of Export) Act, 1938, viz., adaptation to export conditions of existing customs law in relation to prohibited imports, was, by Emergency Powers (No. 52) Order, 1940, made applicable in the case of goods being or attempted to be exported in contravention of an Order made under Article 31 of the Emergency Powers Order, 1939.  Accordingly, in such cases, proceedings, whether for penalties or for seizure of the goods, are grounded on the Act of 1938, as applied by Emergency Powers (No. 52) Order, 1940.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2144" /> This adaptation of customs law was the best device that could at the time be found to meet the needs of a pressing situation.  As far as it goes it has proved a satisfactory device, but it remains merely an adaptation and it is clearly anomalous that the wide range of goods subject to export prohibitions should continue to be dealt with under import procedure devised by an Act of 1876 and converted so as to control exports by an Act which imposes a prohibition on the exportation of scrap iron.  Again, as it is only since the beginning of the emergency that detections, seizures and prosecutions have to any extent taken place in the case of the irregular exportation or attempted exportation of prohibited goods, it follows that the Revenue Commissioners have, for the first time, encountered the various difficulties which beset the administration of the law in this direction.  Many of these difficulties are of a special nature&mdash; they arise from problems which of necessity manifested themselves only in actual experience.  It is desirable, therefore, that a permanent legal basis of a general nature should be found to meet the whole situation.  The provisions of the Bill are designed to remove the anomaly and the difficulty referred to and thus to provide the Revenue Commissioners with such powers as are deemed essential for them to carry out their duty to suppress this traffic in the export of goods vital to the community.  The general nature of the Bill will make its provisions applicable to any goods which are at present or which may be hereafter prohibited, and the powers sought, including those which shift the onus of proof to the defendant, and those which require certain persons to give all relevant information which is in their possession or knowledge, are, in the main, the counterpart of the powers conferred on the Revenue Commissioners in the case of import smuggling by the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, and by Section 20 of the Finance Act, 1936.</P>
    <P>Opportunity has been taken to effect some improvements and to rectify some deficiencies in existing law.  Thus a general provision has been made which will bring any goods prohibited to be <Col N="2145" /> imported within the terms of Section 42 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, the effect being that the mere fact of prohibition will automatically apply the existing provisions dealing with irregular imports to any goods at present prohibited or which may hereafter be prohibited to be imported. This will make for simplicity of drafting in future legislation.  Again, in the case of certain goods weight per given superficial area is a determining factor in deciding liability to duty or the application of the Control of Imports Acts.  Ordinarily no difficulty arises, but the Revenue Commissioners feel it to be necessary that to avoid the possibility of dispute they should have the power to make regulations prescribing the method by which weight is to be ascertained in any particular case.  I ask the House to give the Bill a Second Reading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, what I heard the Minister say was that they arose out of the present emergency. He added that the provisions of this measure if passed into law would be of considerable value during the emergency and perhaps afterwards.  While opening on that note, at the end of the statement he said that he requires, in connection with the matters he wants to deal with, a permanent legal basis of a general nature.  When the emergency began, the House gave the Government every possible power it could require and gave it the right to assume these powers by Order without any reference to the House at all.  The only matters on which the House withheld power from the Government to legislate by Order were the imposition of taxation and the imposition of conscription <Col N="2146" /> either for military or industrial purposes.  Outside of that, over the whole gamut of Governmental activity we swept aside the Constitution and all popular rights in order to give the Government every single power they could want.  On the question of difficulties arising out of the importation and exportation of certain commodities many cases occurred during the past two or three years and attention was drawn to abuses in connection with the Border&mdash;in connection with the export of sugar and the import of flour, and exchanges of one kind or another&mdash;pretty voluminously in the House without very much being done at that particular time.  There is no power the Minister is asking for under this Bill that he could not get under an emergency Order for emergency purposes, but we are completely opposed to the proposal that such powers as are now being sought should be placed on the Statute Book as a piece of permanent legislation.</P>
      <P>Whatever the Act of 1876 may have implied with regard to the inhabitants of this country, we think it is too early for an Irish Parliament to pass legislation which would suggest that the people of this country are tricksters, racketeers and smugglers of a very highly developed type.  I suggest to the Minister that if a case had to be made at any time either during the emergency or afterwards for passing some of the provisions of this measure, very substantial details would have to be put before the Dáil as to some of the abuses that were alleged to be occurring.  Section 3, sub-section (3) of this measure says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) a person is charged with the offence of exporting on or about a particular date any goods in contravention of any enactment or statutory instrument and,</P>
      <P>(b) it is proved in the proceedings&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) that the goods are goods the exportation of which is prohibited or restricted by such enactment or statutory instrament, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2147" /> (ii) that the goods were on or about the said date exported, and</P>
    <P>(iii) that such person prior to such exportation, owned, possessed or had the control of the goods,</P>
    <P>such person shall until the contrary is proved be presumed to have exported the goods on or about the said date in contravention of such enactment or statutory instrument&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Then the section goes on to deal with the offence of attempting to export, and the section says that if a person is charged with the offence of attempting to export something, and if it is proved that the goods are of the kind that should not be exported, then such person, until the contrary is proved, shall be presumed to have attempted to have exported them.  I think that, just as in the spirit in which the House met the Government at the beginning of the emergency, no Party is going to take exception to anything that the Government may do in order to preserve essential supplies either of food or other commodities for the people here, and I do not think the Government can complain that they have been criticised unfairly in any way in regard to anything they have done in that particular matter.  I think that in consideration of that attitude towards the Government and the spirit in which the Government has been met by the House, the Government should not ask the House to pass this measure as a permanent piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>As I understand the Minister, either by the Act of 1876 or some additional emergency Orders that have been issued and that have been bolstered up by that Act in some way, the import situation has been held in control.  If that is possible on the import side, I suggest that the export side should be dealt with in the same manner and that we should not enshrine in permanent legislation the principle that people are presumed to be guilty until the contrary is proved without knowing very well what we are at and without getting out of the emergency atmosphere.  It is most undesirable <Col N="2148" /> that in an emergency atmosphere we should undermine the general outlook on personal rights and liberties and on democratic feelings.  The Government have ample powers to deal with all these matters by emergency Order, and, if they do not think these sufficient by temporary legislation, but we should hesitate very much to deal with these matters by permanent legislation in the present atmosphere. We are completely against passing the present Bill.  It introduces a principle that is absolutely new in the first place.  Secondly, it is unnecessary, because the Government has ample powers to deal with the matter other than by permanent legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Deputy from a Border constituency, I find myself very much in sympathy with the Leader of the Opposition in his reluctance to see legislation of this kind incorporated in the Statute Book of this country.  He appears to think that this Bill introduces an entirely new principle.  I do not think it does.  I think the Revenue Commissioners already have the power, in regard to imported merchandise, to go to the person in whose possession they find it, and, unless he can prove that duty has been paid upon it, they can make him responsible if, in fact, those goods passed across our national Border without the duty having been paid.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will elaborate that matter.  The Revenue Commissioners have very strange powers of shifting the burden of proof from themselves on to the person charged with revenue offences, particularly with regard to customs duties on incoming goods.  I wish I agreed with the Leader of the Opposition that when the emergency is over the grave evils that have arisen on the <Col N="2149" /> Border will come to an end.  I do not think they will.  The Leader of the Opposition will, naturally, say of himself and his colleagues: &ldquo;We were responsible for the Government for ten years and we had to deal with the Border, and, with the law at our disposal at that time, we were able to carry on and enforce the regulations; nobody ever got very excited, and 50 per cent. of our total imports were then subject to tariff.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He can say that truly, but what he forgets is that the tariff policy of the Government of which he was a member was a moderate one.  The tariffs at that time were modest tariffs, very carefully chosen to control only certain kinds of goods.  There were no quotas and there was no question of racketeering being established here behind tariff barriers of 75 per cent. and quotas&mdash;racketeers licensed to rob our people night and day in the prices they are charging for the commodities they are producing behind those tariff barriers.</P>
      <P>The acute scarcity of certain commodities is making it well worth certain people's while to bring stuff in, to smuggle stuff in from Northern Ireland, and the acute scarcity of certain commodities in Northern Ireland is making it well worth certain persons' while to smuggle prohibited goods out of this country into Northern Ireland. Fundamentally the urge in both cases is profit.  The reason these people take the risk is because they make a portentous profit.  It is hard for Deputies without experience of the Border to realise that one lorry load of goods travelling across the Border in either direction may be worth from £2,000 to £3,000 at the black market prices which these gentlemen can secure for the merchandise in which they are dealing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition may, owing to the position he occupies, having contact with Deputies from all parts of the country, appreciate that fully.  He says this is purely an emergency situation and, therefore, we should deal with it by means of an Emergency Powers Order, but do not allow the Statute Book to be blotted with a piece of emergency legislation <Col N="2150" /> which has to deal with a purely temporary situation.  Let us remember what these fellows want is not to relieve human necessity in Northern Ireland, or suffering and want in Eire. These gentlemen want profit and, when the emergency is over, it will not be in sugar transferred to Northern Ireland that they will be dealing; it will not be in white flour or white bread transferred to Northern Ireland that they will be dealing.  When the tariff racketeers get their quota put on Indian meal, it will be a load of Indian meal that will be brought in, purchased in Northern Ireland for 5/-per cwt.  The tariff racketeers here, under the tariffs and quotas imposed and fixed by Deputy Seán Lemass, will be charging the farmers here 8/-a bag.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>May be more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Very likely.  At any rate, it will pay the smuggler to buy his Indian meal in Northern Ireland for £4 15/- a ton and sell it in Cavan or some other parts of Eire for 7/6 a cwt., thus making 2/9 a bag on his load.  If he has four tons on the lorry he is making £2 15/- profit on each ton&mdash;that will be £2 15/- multiplied by four.  Take flour as another example. In pre-war days a bag cost about 12/-in Northern Ireland and the price here was 21/-.  That works out at £9 a ton, and four tons of flour across the Border in one night would mean £36. They do not worry; the gentlemen in this trade do not give a damn, but the poor devils earning 24/- a week have to make up the extra profit made here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The gentlemen engaged in this business say that if the native racketeers are allowed to get away with it, why should not they take a hand.  Think of the commodities the importation of which is prohibited in order to give the native racketeer full licence to rob our people behind quotas.  The gentlemen operating across the Border are going to get in on the racket.  They will not be respectable racketeers. They will not have conventions in the Gresham Hotel to which the Taoiseach goes to speak.  They are the fellows who travel by night and they will be charging the people less for the commodities <Col N="2151" /> they bring across the Border than our own native racketeers.  If they did not charge less they could not find a market for the commodities.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the Leader of the Opposition must make up his mind to the fact that so long as we have a Fianna Fáil policy of 75 per cent. tariffs, and quotas, and tariff racketeers eating seven-course luncheons and ten-course dinners in the Gresham Hotel, we will have humble, simple, plain little racketeers running to and fro across the Border in lorries.  They will not get the dinners; they will not get as big profits as our native products, but these simple little racketeers will get a profit which they think quite adequate to justify taking the risks that they do take every night of their lives.  Let us make up our minds that if you are going to have a continuation of the Fianna Fáil policy of greasing the fat pigs of tariff racketeering, you are going to have smuggling racketeers on the Border.  If you are going to have a system in this country in which tariff racketeering is to be esteemed an honourable profession, then you had better make up your mind that you will have to pass penal legislation to prevent traffic across the Border, of a character which would disgrace any democratic country in the world.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that this country would come to its senses and make up its mind that the ordinary people are no longer to be exploited by the tariff racketeers.  If you eliminate the tariff racketeer there is no necessity for this legislation, because it will not be profitable to carry stuff to and fro across the Border.  No man will risk that business if he is seeking to avoid only a 15 per cent. or a 20 per cent. tariff.  It is not worth his while.  No man will engage in illicit traffic across the Border, except for the prize of being permitted to join the ranks of the tariff racketeers through the back door.  All that these men aspire to do is to get in under the tablecloth of the tariff racketeers' banquet table and eat the crumbs that fall therefrom; but so long as the tariff racketeers' banquets are served with Government approval in this country, you will have <Col N="2152" /> the gentlemen under the table plying to and fro across the Monaghan border collecting their share of the crumbs.</P>
    <P>Now, make up your minds.  Adhere to the customs system which begets tariff racketeers and you will require this legislation and the hell of a sight more.  You will want a 15-feet barbed wire fence, with an electric charge in it, all along the Border to stop smuggling if the tariff racketeers are to be maintained in this country. Eliminate the tariff racketeers and you no more require precautions of this kind on our Border than they do on the Canadian-American Border.  It sometimes makes me laugh when I hear the Minister for Finance explaining the awful burden he has to carry in enforcing the revenue regulations, bearing in mind the terrible length of a border stretching all the way from Donegal to the Irish Sea.  There are 3,200 miles of border between Canada and the United States of America, and there is not a guard every hundred miles along it and they are able to get along; but when they instituted a system in America which gave rise to a native product, the beer-barrel racketeer, the liquor racketeer, the father and progenitor of all racketeers, no amount of legislation or protection could prevent smuggling across that Border.  Is that not so?</P>
    <P>Is it not true that the Border presented no revenue problem on the Continent of America until the racketeers were established by legislation in the United States of America? Is it not true that, up to 1932, no revenue problem of a serious character &mdash;I say &ldquo;revenue&rdquo;; I am not speaking of political problems&mdash;was created by that Border; but the moment the prototype of the beer&mdash;barrel racketeer of America was created in this country by the tariff policy of Fianna Fáil, the moment the tariff racketeer was created here, then and then only did we begin to experience on our Border the same problems as the United States of America and Canada experienced on theirs during the prohibition period.</P>
    <P>They sensibly said: &ldquo;Let us not try to erect a 40-feet barbed wire fence along the Canadian-American Border, but let us eliminate the legislation <Col N="2153" /> which gives rise to the racketeers.&rdquo; Let us abolish the condition of affairs in our own country which made it profitable for men to cross and recross our Border with contraband goods. The Minister for Finance has a peculiarly intimate knowledge of the revolution which was required in the whole of American thought to get the reform of the repeal of prohibition carried in the United States, but it was done, and when it was done, the revenue problem of the Canadian-American Border vanished overnight.</P>
    <P>There is one means, only one effecttive means, of surmounting the revenue problem on the Border between Northern Ireland and this country, that is, to strike at the root of the evil.  The root of the evil is the tariff racketeer in Eire.  Eliminate him and you do not require this Bill. An emergency powers Order, to endure for the period of the emergency and artificial scarcity, will suffice.  Leave the tariff racketeer in possession of his right to suck the blood of our people and you will want this Bill and ten other Bills, as well as a 14 feet barbed wire fence connected with a high-power line of the Electricity Supply Board in order to prevent illicit crossing of the Border.  It is up to the House to make its choice.  I know what I would do: I would make an emergency powers Order for the duration of the emergency and I would wipe out the tariff racketeers the following morning.</P>

      <P>I wish to God I could. I wonder if the Deputy and I tried to wipe out the Border and secured the assistance of Deputy Rice beside him, which I know would be easy to do, would the tariff racketeers join us. What subscriptions would we get for our movement for the abolition of the Border from the tariff racketeers?  I suggest that the Deputy should put on his considering cap and think that over.  Maybe when he has finished thinking, he will come round to my point of view and join me.  I will draft the necessary Bill, if he will undertake to second it, to abolish the tariff <Col N="2154" /> racketeers and take the first essential step to abolishing the Border as well. Its stoutest prop are the tariff racketeers in Eire.  Let us knock that prop away, and if he and I collaborate to that end, our names will go down in letters of gold in the history of this country.</P>

      <P>I rise to object to the Bill largely on the legal principle involved. I appreciate that to prevent smuggling inwards or outwards the Revenue Commissioners require extraordinary powers.  The smuggler's art is one practised in the dark and you have to outwit him by stealth and sometimes by enterprise of doubtful character, but whether or not the principle has been enshrined in the Customs Consolidation Acts of 1876 and upwards is beside the point.  These Acts were passed by an alien Parliament imposed upon this country, but we here who have some respect and reverence for the common law consider it improper that, in any piece of legislation passing through the House, the principle should be established that a person's guilt is presumed and the old common law principle of presuming innocence reversed.  That is what we are doing in this Bill.  You are presuming guilt and putting the onus on the person charged of proving his innocence.  Throughout the centuries, the common law of this country has been that a charged person's innocence is presumed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that the onus is on the State of discharging the duty of proving that an accused is guilty of an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I say that I disagree with the principle of this Bill.  I also think that the Bill is too wide in scope.  There is no defined or prescribed area within the Bill, and whilst I appreciate that very drastic powers have to be taken so long as the present emergency conditions continue, and, perhaps, for a period after the emergency, nevertheless, I feel that if you give those <Col N="2155" /> powers everywhere throughout the State, you are making them too wide. I do not think they are necessary, and I should prefer to see the operation of this Bill restricted to a given area adjoining the boundary between Éire and Northern Ireland.  For instance, a man may bring goods to an emporium near the Border; he may shift them only 100 yards, and yet it is possible, under this Bill, to charge that man with bringing goods to that emporium for the purpose of export.  This charge of &ldquo;attempting to export&rdquo; is such that I cannot see how any court in the land could decide upon it.  An attempt to commit an offence is an inchoate act, and it certainly would be very hard to define.  It really depends on the mental condition of the person in charge of the goods for the time being, and are you, under this Bill, to ask your courts of competent jurisdiction to determine what was in a potential smuggler's mind at a given place and in a given time?  That seems to me to be the only inference that can be drawn from the section in the Bill which deals with attempting to commit an offence, and I do not see how any court could pass judgment on such a matter.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, I think that this Bill, if it is to be passed by this House, should have a limited period of duration. If, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, the emergency conditions on the Border are so bad that they do need those powers, I would seriously suggest to them and to the Minister that they should consider seeking those powers only for the period of the emergency and, perhaps, for a short time after the emergency. I do not think it is right or proper that we should give those powers for all time to the Revenue Commissioners; largely because, as I say, I disagree with the principle enshrined in the Bill.  There is a danger that if we accept the principle enshrined in this Bill, we may find ourselves in the position of having to fight the same principle in other Bills which may come before this House.  That is the danger that I see here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, who has just spoken, <Col N="2156" /> referred to the high tariff policy as being responsible for the intensive smuggling which, apparently, exists at the moment; and his remedy for that, apparently, is an all-round reduction of tariffs to such an extent that the prices of goods on both sides of the Border, at all times, will be level.  I cannot see how, in existing conditions, you can bring about a condition of that kind in this country, or, rather, in this State.  If there is anything in the remarks made by Deputy Dillon, the logical conclusion to be reached is that we should attempt some form of customs union between North and South.  If, in existing circumstances, there is no hope, either immediate or remote, of shifting that Border, then let us face up to that fact and do the next best thing.  In other words, let us attempt to bring about some sort of understanding with the Government in Belfast, and to bring about some form of union on the question of customs.  I do not think that that is a matter we should shirk.</P>
    <P>So far as I understand the question, this matter of customs is under the control of the British Imperial Parliament, and, if a proper approach were made in that direction, I have no doubt that we could achieve some result and that, in that way, we could get rid of the smuggling racket.  I do not know if that racket has reached the proportions that we have been told about, and that we have become a nation of racketeers.  I do not know that, and I have no evidence of it.  Of course, certain cases go through the courts from time to time in connection with smuggling, but that would not suggest that the whole population, or, certainly, all the people in the Border counties, or in districts adjoining the Border, are engaging in smuggling activities.  I do not think that that is the case, and, for that reason, I do not think that those powers should be taken for any prolonged period.  I would ask the Minister seriously to consider restricting those powers to the end of the emergency or until such time, after the emergency, as the Revenue Commissioners feel that they need them.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I oppose the principle <Col N="2157" /> of the Bill, largely because we fear that once an Irish Parliament embarks on a policy of presuming the guilt of a person until he is proved innocent&mdash;putting the onus on an accused person of proving his innocence&mdash;we may find ourselves in a very sorry plight in the future.  That is a responsibility that we should not place on any Department or Minister of State without serious consideration. The principle that a person must be presumed to be innocent until he is proved guilty is one that has been fought for throughout the centuries. That is the principle that was fought for when the common law of England was established, and it is a principle that has been and will be fought for in every country in the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister was rather unfortunate in presenting this Bill, because, as I read the Bill, it seems to me that its introduction is due to matters that have arisen during the last couple of years in regard to the question of supplies.  The Minister quoted a whole series of Emergency Orders and, of course, nobody in the House knew the first thing about them.  I would even venture to say that the Minister himself did not know one solitary iota about them, because, so far as I can make out, all those Orders are issued by the Minister for Agriculture or by the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Supplies&mdash;who is one and the same person&mdash;and nobody had an opportunity of understanding them.  If circulars had been issued, pointing out the meaning of these various Orders, I think we may presume that there would not have been so much criticism. Now, the Minister has spoken about powers in regard to exports and imports, but there are powers taken here in regard to exports which are not necessary so far as imports are concerned; just as there are powers taken in regard to imports which are not necessary for exports.  I refer, particularly, to the Scrap Iron Act, and references to exports under that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, owing to the increased tillage policy, an Order was made by the Minister for Agriculture, prohibiting <Col N="2158" /> the export of horses.  The strange thing about the Order was that prosecutions under it had to be taken under the Scrap-Iron Act, as I understand, because the horses have iron shoes. There was no other machinery for bringing such prosecutions.  If the Minister had circulated a White Paper with this Bill it would have simplified matters.  In my opinion the Bill does not refer to any outstanding question of racketeering, but to prosecutions that take place in court affecting imports and exports.  These prosecutions arise because in the Six Counties they want certain things that we have, such as clothing, sugar or butter, while our people may want tea or articles in supply there.  All this arises because of the scarcity of supplies.  What I really object to is the machinery in this Bill.  That can be dealt with in Committee. When prosecuted under the Scrap Iron Act a man may be involved not only if he brings horses to his own land but by somebody else bringing them to an adjoining farm which may be let in conacre.  In such a case a customs officer could bring a charge against a man of having the intention to export horses.  He could call upon him to explain why they were on the land, and to produce information to show that they were not going to be exported.  Why should he be called upon to do that?  It recalls provisions in the Distillation Act of 1851.  In my opinion a proviso of that kind is going too far.  It should be sufficient if a man gave an explanation as to the animals found on his land or premises.</P>
    <P>It is monstrous to ask a citizen to account for property found on adjoining land.  That is going too far.  If somebody bought an animal from me and said that he would take delivery a week hence, how could I know the purchaser's intentions?  It might be for export purposes.  Am I to cross-examine the purchaser to ascertain what he intends to do with the animal? Would any purchaser submit to such cross-examination?  So long as there is a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser and vendor that is all that should be required.  I suggest that the wording of the Bill should be modified to &ldquo;knowingly sells goods&rdquo;.  The remainder of the <Col N="2159" /> Bill is not too drastic.  As far as I know this Bill arose out of prosecutions during the emergency period, owing to the limited supplies available and not because of tariff policy. If the Minister had explained that in a White Paper, instead of giving references to emergency Orders, it would have simplified matters.  In my opinion, the machinery of the Bill is too drastic.  I also direct attention to the definition section.  The expression &ldquo;statutory instrument&rdquo; means an order, but it does not say by whom it is to be made, whether by the Minister or the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the Revenue Commissioners and their officials must have means at their disposal to carry out their duties efficiently.  Living close to the Border as I do, I know that there is smuggling going on.  I come in touch with the smugglers occasionally.  Some of them are decent people and the others are the other type.  Of course they are all innocent!  Nobody will admit he is engaged in smuggling, but there is a type of smuggler that I would not be a bit sorry for if the Revenue Commissioners could get after him.  He is the fellow who takes advantage of high tariffs on this side of the Border, but when he wants to buy anything goes to the Six Counties, if he can get it there cheaper by the 32nd part of a farthing. That is a peculiar characteristic of a large number of people, 99 per cent. of whom, I regret to say&mdash;although it may not be pleasant for Fianna Fáil Deputies to hear&mdash;are ardent supporters of the Taoiseach.  In fact they would knock you down in the street during the last election if you uttered a disparaging word about the Taoiseach or his Party, and yet, they are the first people to pop across the Border to get stuff there and, incidentally, to bring it back to this State. Some of the greatest racketeers along the Border are men who, when prosecuted, got off on some technical point because of defects in the existing law. If this Bill does anything to get a hold of that type of people it will be a good job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2160" /> Of course the principle of condemning a man before he gets a chance of providing his innocence is something that I would be against.  Everybody is innocent until proved guilty.  There is the danger, if the Bill goes through as it stands, that honest people will be sufferers, due to ignorance or want of knowledge of the customs laws.  I refer particularly to fellow-Irishmen returning from England occasionally to visit their families, who, having a few pounds to spare, may buy some articles in Éire.  I know of cases where certain articles have been taken from these people, for instance, overcoats.  I do not wish anything I say to be taken as a reflection on the customs officers, who perform their duties conscientiously and with consideration for the general public.  But a few cases of hardship were brought to my notice where overcoats were seized from poor working men and confiscated, or where they had to pay £5.  I should say that when appeals are made to the Revenue Commissioners they receive sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <P>In most of those cases the officials have, so far as their powers allowed, done their best to mitigate the hardship on people placed in such a position.  But that is one of the hardships which may be increased if this Bill becomes law.  I suggest that the Minister and his officials might pay some little attention to the type of case to which I refer, which may occur very often in the near future, because, so long as the present war continues and so long as a big volume of traffic exists, which will be for some time, so far as one can see, cases of hardship are bound to arise amongst the many thousands of our people coming from across channel here.  If something could be done which would enable the officials to carry out their duties, while imposing no unnecessary hardships on people of this type, I should not be absolutely opposed to this Bill save in regard to the principle of presuming a man's guilt in advance.</P>
    <P>This smuggling business is not confined to the immediate neighbourhood of the Border.  It is fairly prevalent all over the country.  Deputy Coogan might be surprised to learn that, in <Col N="2161" /> regard to this matter, there are parts of Kerry as near the Border as Dundalk. There are no limits to it.  The people engaged in it are from all &ldquo;arts and parts&rdquo; and it has become a sort of profession.  As Deputy Dillon says, there is no doubt that, so long as there is such a difference between the prices of commodities here and across the Border, smuggling will continue. As I said at an urban council meeting, it would take Hitler, at the zenith of his power, and all his army to prevent smuggling.  I do not know whether he could do it now or not.  The Irish people have a happy knack of getting round the law and the present state of affairs will continue so long as the present difference in prices between the two parts of the country continues.  That may be as long as the people in the North are so foolish as to have a Border.  I hope that soon the Border will disappear and that the government of the country will be carried on by a single body.  We do not want the spectacle of two Governments legislating for a small country like this.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the responsibility placed on the Revenue Commissioners to safeguard the interests of the State, but it is no harm to remark that it is questionable whether, over a given period, we have not received more than we gave.  Possibly, the less said about that the better.  What we got across from the Six Counties was very useful to us at certain times, particularly in the spring.  If we take drastic measures, there will be competition from the other side.  They will introduce drastic legislation, too, so as to ensure that nothing will leave the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>There is one other point to which I should like to refer.  I raised this point with the Minister for Agriculture some time ago.  I asked him would it be possible for unscrupulous creamery managers to export large quantities of butter across the Border. At that time, the Minister was not too sure.  I am afraid that that has been the case and that unscrupulous types of persons have devised ways and means by which large quantities of butter can be surreptitiously sent <Col N="2162" /> across the Border.  Then, they sent notice to retailers in Dundalk and elsewhere along the Border that the milk supplies to the creamery were short for a couple of weeks.  That has happened. There was a case in Dundalk some time ago in which a creamery manager, or assistant manager, was caught carrying cases of butter through the town.  He got off scot free on some technical point.  I do not think that any Deputy would have sympathy with any Irishman on this side of the Border who would do such a thing.  I should not have the least hesitation in giving all the powers necessary to the Revenue Commissioners to impose the most severe punishment on people of that type who would send such an important article of food across the Border in such a manner.  However, the principle enshrined in the Bill is one to which we could not offhand subscribe. On the other hand, the Revenue Commissioners must have certain powers. I am afraid that, so long as the Border exists, there will be recurring trouble of this nature.  I do not like the principle to which I have referred in the Bill and, perhaps, the Minister, when replying, would explain more fully what the intentions behind this section are.</P>

      <P>I have not a great deal to say in reply to the debate that has taken place on this Bill.  I must say that I was surprised to find that Deputy Mulcahy, speaking for his Party, felt so strongly on this matter and made such strenuous objection to the introduction of this piece of legislation. He said it was introducing new principles, principles, he said, that were unnecessary and that were undemocratic. Some members of his Party who have a more intimate acquaintance with law than either the Deputy or myself did not exactly agree that these were new principles.  The principles in this Bill are inscribed in our present legislation and have been acted upon by the Governments in power since this State was set up.</P>

      <P>This has been the <Col N="2163" /> law since this State was set up, and has been operated by every Government in power since then.  I have never heard anyone in this House protest against it.  I have never heard anyone say that it was not a principle in law that it was proper to operate against breakers of the law.  Therefore the statement made by Deputy Mulcahy, that this was introducing a new principle, is not correct.  The principle is there, and it has been operated by all the Governments in this State during the time that we have had the power to operate our own laws. Deputy Mulcahy said it was unnecessary, but if it were not proved to me by the Revenue Commissioners to be necessary, I would not ask the House to pass this legislation.  I am satisfied that it is not only necessary but urgently necessary.  The only complaint I have to make is that we did not bring it before the House long ago.</P>

      <P>We have had thousands and thousands of cases of the attempted smuggling&mdash;some of them successful&mdash;of goods out of this country, goods that were urgently required here.  As Deputy Coburn told the House, in quite a number of these cases&mdash;far too big a number&mdash;persons attempting to smuggle goods out actually succeeded in getting goods out of this country illegally.  And when they were caught, they got away on technical grounds because the law was not as satisfactory as this House would like it to be.  I have to deal with the matter, and that is the truth.

      <P>But Deputy Coburn, and Deputies generally from the Border areas, do know more than I would know, and more than Deputy Mulcahy would know.  They come from and represent Border areas.  I know, because I am Minister for Finance.  I hear a great deal from the Revenue Commissioners about their difficulties in dealing with this very serious problem.  There is not a day in the year in which attempts are not made to smuggle goods out of this country, goods that are urgently required by our people, such as clothes, boots, shoes, soap, butter, sugar and every kind of commodity that is scarce.  Deputy Dillon said quite truthfully that it is a very profitable business.  We want to make it unprofitable, but we are not provided with all the machinery that we think the Dáil would be quite willing to give us to stop that traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy said that all the powers were there already.  It is difficult to set out all the powers which are required under an Emergency Powers Order.  We have had difficulty in bringing Emergency Powers Orders into the court as our authority for imposing certain restrictions. There are difficulties in the case of these Emergency Powers Orders which our very able draftsmen find it hard to get over.  They are met by able lawyers on the other side, and these able lawyers are able to find holes in our Emergency Powers Orders.  They got over them because our legislation was not complete.  Yet, Deputy Mulcahy says that all the powers are there.  They are not.  We need these powers now, we need them badly and we have needed them for a long time. In fact, we should have had such powers long before the emergency, because there were certain prohibition Orders in existence long before 1932&mdash; such as Deputy Dillon talked about&mdash; prohibition Orders in regard to goods that it was illegal to export from this country.  We had not the legislation on our Statute Book that would enable us to deal with people who were breaking these laws.  I agree with Deputy <Col N="2165" /> Mulcahy when he said that the Oireachtas gave us very full powers when we asked for them at the beginning of the emergency.  I quite accept what he said about the spirit in which they were given.  I would say that they were accepted in the same spirit, and that the spirit of the House was recognised as being a generous one at that time.</P>

      <P>Another point made by Deputy Mulcahy was that this Bill was undemocratic.  I cannot see that at all.  Surely to God it is the most democratic thing possible to ask the Dáil to give additional powers to see that the laws passed by this House are observed, and that those who break the law, or attempt to break it, are brought to book.  There is nothing undemocratic in that.  We are asking for additional powers that, as I have told the House, are urgently necessary to enable us to deal with law breakers. We have not the powers at present, and we want them in the form set out in this Bill.  I have had long discussions with the Revenue Commissioners who have to administer these laws. They have told me that they find it impossible at present to deal adequately with the smuggling traffic under the law as it stands, and that they need this legislation.  When the House is told that by the Minister for Finance, after he has consulted with the officials responsible, it is reasonable to expect the House to accept it. I deny the statement that there is any new principle involved, any principle that has not existed in the law of this country for the last 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon had not much to say against the Bill itself.  He talked a lot about the tariff policy of the Government and we are well used to the type of speech he made on that subject.  His remarks, however, were not relevant to the Bill we were discussing.  It is the policy of this State to impose tariffs&mdash; it is the policy of the last Government and the policy of this Government. There is a considerable difference in the extent of the tariffs, some people might say a difference of principle in the tariff policy adopted by this Government and that adopted by the last Government.  At any rate, there were tariffs in existence before this Government came in.  That policy&mdash;extended, <Col N="2167" /> widened and amplified in a variety of ways since 1932-33&mdash;has been for the benefit and welfare of this country industrially, economically and financially.</P>
    <P>It is most unfair for Deputy Dillon to make the charges he has made against the industrialists, who have so splendidly aided the country to come through the difficult times of the emergency and to label each and every one of them as racketeers, to say they are robbing the poor and to talk about their big banquets and big luncheons. I believe these men are working honestly and that any profits they have gained have been as a result of their intelligence, their ability, their industry and their enterprise.  Without giving some evidence of racketeering, if it does exist, of undue profits being made or of undue prices being charged for goods, it is not proper to make the charges in the reckless way Deputy Dillon made them here to-day.  There may have been smuggling&mdash;there was smuggling before ever there were tariffs here&mdash; and it is possible that the introduction of tariff laws in 1923, 1926, 1928, 1933 or 1936 did tend to make that smuggling trade grow and make it more profitable. However, it is our job, as the administrators of the law, to make it as dangerous and as difficult as possible for people to smuggle or attempt to smuggle prohibited goods in or out of this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan asked that there should be an area prescribed for the operation of this law.  I do not think that would be possible.  Indeed, the evidence of Deputy Coburn was that smuggling was as rife in Kerry as it is in Dundalk.  That is saying a good deal, since we know fairly well what happens in Dundalk.  Perhaps the Deputy has some evidence that I have not got.  Smuggling, and attempts at smuggling, go on in different parts of the country apart from the Border and, therefore, it would not be possible to prescribe merely areas along the Border, as Deputy Coogan suggests. There is also the possibility&mdash; not a remote one, either, I think&mdash;that aeroplanes may be used in import and export smuggling.  I do not know <Col N="2168" /> whether that happens or not, but we have to take precautions, even now, at our airports.</P>

      <P>If people attempt to smuggle, I hope they will be caught and pay the penalty.  Deputy Coogan also suggested that these powers be used for the emergency only or for such period as the Revenue Commissioners may think they are necessary. The law to which I ask the House to give a Second Reading now will be necessary after the emergency, for a long period, I imagine.  I believe that, as long as our present economic policy continues, this law will be necessary&mdash; probably permanently necessary.  After consultation with the Revenue Commissioners, I feel I must ask the House to make this law permanent.</P>
      <P>Deputy McMenamin thinks that we are being too drastic.  If there are no smugglers, they will not be hit or hurt, but in these times, the laws to prevent smuggling could not be too drastic.  I asked the revenue authorities about the story to which Deputy McMenamin referred, of the horse which was exported, where the owner was prosecuted in regard to the scrap iron in the horseshoes.  That was a joke which some fertile imagination invented at the expense of the Revenue Commissioners and there is no foundation for it in fact, as far as I know.</P>
      <P>There were 13,355 export seizures during the year ended 31st March, 1944.  That shows the extent to which smuggling is being attempted.</P>

I believe I am doing the work of the Dáil much more efficiently by getting the law in this form, as it is not for the emergency only but is to form part of the permanent legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a very simple measure.  Deputies will already have seen that the object of it is to alter the date for the coming into force of the Electors' Register and to alter the date upon which citizens of the State who exercise the franchise are deemed to be qualified to take part in either Dáil Éireann or local government elections.  Practically all Deputies in the House are aware of the present regulations in regard to the maintenance and revision of the register, but I would remind those Deputies who have come here more recently that the present regulations have their legislative origin in the Electoral Act, 1923, and the Local Government (Electors Registration) Act, 1924, which provided for the keeping of a register and which delimited the period during which that register was to be revised and stated the period at which the new register each year came into force.</P>
      <P>It has become customary for some time past to hold general elections in the month of June, or thereabouts, and apart from unforeseen conditions of a political character, it is likely that this custom will continue in the future. The reasons for this practice are not far to seek.  June is a month when the weather is propitious, or likely to be propitious; the days are long and, from the standpoint of the agricultural community, it is the period between the sowing season and harvest.  Apart from the question of general elections, under the Local Government Elections Act, 1927, provision was made for holding local government elections at the end of June every three years and, therefore, the Bill is based on the general conception that it is likely that a number of elections will be held in the future in the month of June, or thereabouts.</P>
      <P>The Government has received a number of representations during past years that if the register comes into force on June 1st the time is insufficient for returning officers to make the necessary preparations for an election if it comes shortly after that period.  Many of the preparations made by returning officers can only be commenced when the register has been printed and is legally in force.  Representations have also been made that candidates have had insufficient time and that organisations which these candidates represent have had insufficient time to make due and efficient election arrangements, again when the election is held some time shortly after June 1st.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has given heed to these representations; the Government considers them reasonable and, accordingly, they have proposed, in this Bill, that in future the date upon which the new register comes into force shall be April 15th, instead of June 1st.  They <Col N="2173" /> have consequentially advanced the date upon which persons are qualified to vote.  That date has been altered from November 15th to September 15th.</P>
    <P>There are only two important sections in the Bill, the remainder being consequential amendments of a drafting character.  Sections 2 and 4 amend the Acts now in operation and make provision for the alterations in the dates which I have already indicated. Section 5 alters the statutory periods for the different stages in the preparation of the register.  Obviously, if the date for the coming into force of the register is advanced, the dates for carrying out the various stages in preparing and revising the register must also be amended.  These dates cover the publishing of the first list known as the long list of provisional electors; the date for receiving objections; the date for receiving claims; the date for publishing claims; the date for receiving objections to claims, and the date for the final revision of the register.  There are no changes of importance in the incidence of those dates, with two exceptions.  A period of two weeks extra has been provided in between the hearing of the claims and the final revision of the register.  This will be convenient in making a final check of the register and in arranging for printing. There has also been a slight alteration in one of the dates in order to allow for the change in the incidence of the Christmas vacation.  Deputies who represent rural constituencies will appreciate that if this Bill comes into force those whose duty it is to prepare the electors' list will be able to do their work at the end of September and during the month of October, again when the weather is more propitious and when the days are longer. Deputies who represent city areas will, I feel quite sure, appreciate the value of this Bill, which will give returning officers and candidates alike very much needed facilities for making sure that their work is well done and well prepared.</P>
    <P>It is not intended to apply this measure to the register which comes into force this year and, if this Bill becomes law, the first register affected <Col N="2174" /> will be that which will come into force in 1946.  In that year the register will come into force on April 15th, instead of June 1st.  I hope I have made the position clear to the House and I trust the Bill will have a sympathetic hearing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The only point I wish to make is that while the date at which the register comes into effect is to be advanced from June 1st to April 15th, the qualifying date for voters is advanced by two months.  Is it necessary that there should be that difference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

That was done quite deliberately, again with a view to facilitating the preparation of the register.</P>

      <P>I have indicated the reasons in the course of the Second Reading discussion.  The operations of the Minerals Development Company have been more extensive than was originally contemplated, and the limit fixed by the Act to the advances that could have been made to that company was amended on more than one occasion in the past couple of years by Emergency Powers Orders.  It is now desired to regularise that position, and furthermore to provide for the new company the possibility of procuring the capital that will be required for the purpose of organising the workings of Slievardagh, and procuring the plant which is essential to the effective commercial operation of the Avoca deposits.  Furthermore, the working of the phosphate rock in County Clare by mining will involve additional expenditure on equipment. It appears that it is only by mining that any substantial quantity of rock can now be acquired from Clare; the quarriable deposits have become almost exhausted.  It will be necessary for the company to undertake in the immediate future certain additional capital expenditure, but the post-war activities of the company will involve substantial additional capital expenditure, because the equipment which will be required, and which cannot now be procured, will, we trust, then be available, and will be necessary for the proper working of the deposits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The people who hold these shares are the most obvious type of dummy shareholders.  They hold no interest in the company, as the whole money was put up by the State.  This is the most obvious type of company against which the Vocational Commission reported unfavourably. I also understand that this company falls under the criticism of that particular commission in that it is one of the companies in which there is no public accounting.  The accounts of these companies do not come before the Comptroller and Auditor-General and, consequently, do not come before the Public Accounts Committee.  The only occasion upon which anybody gets an opportunity of raising questions in regard to these companies is when some piece of amending legislation such as this comes before the House. It is proposed notwithstanding that, after that not very favourable development from the business angle, to provide this company with still further advances of public money.  The Minister's peculiar excuse for the loss is that this company was operating under Government orders.  I do not know whether we are to take that as suggesting that any company operating under Government orders should lose money, but this is spectacularly a case of losing money.  We are now asked that the amounts advanced from public funds should be raised to the difference between £400,000 and the amount of the advances made to the dissolved company.  What is the amount of the advances made to the dissolved company?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That will depend entirely on the circumstances.  The Slievardagh Coal Mining Company Board reported to me that if commercial considerations were to predominate, the proper course was to close down the mine until the machinery they required for working it was obtainable.  I asked them not to close down the mine, to work the deposit with whatever equipment they could procure, with whatever secondhand plant they could construct out of materials available in the country, to utilise semi-skilled or unskilled labour where skilled labour was not available, and to make the production of the maximum quantity of coal their main objective, irrespective of the financial results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, the Minerals Development Company reported that the proper method of working the Avoca ore was to establish a flotation plant.  A flotation plant could not be procured, but the need for making available sufficient quantities of pyrites for superphosphate manufacture induced the company <Col N="2183" /> to work the deposit there, even to the extent of hand-picking the suitable ore from the ore mined, and they effected delivery of quantities so picked to the fertiliser manufacturer.  If commercial considerations were in operation, this course would not have to be adopted.  The mining company is different to any other type of producer in so far as it is working a wasting asset.  Every ton of ore produced and sold at a loss is a ton less that might be produced at a later stage and sold at a profit.  Therefore, while it might be correct, from the point of view of an ordinary commercial undertaking, to suggest that this working should be suspended until proper equipment has been procured, that would be undesirable because of the need for what is now being produced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>My chief point is that it would be more desirable to have this matter developed before the Committee of Public Accounts rather than have it examined in this casual way here.  Is there any reason why it should not be developed before the committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be impossible to carry on a commercial enterprise in that atmosphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If it was a commercial enterprise, one could understand, but it is not.  There is no secret to be hidden except the secret of how they can lose so much.  I suggest that is one of the things that should be inquired into.  If the Minister has a case for the expenditure of public money, surely it ought to be made to some body examining this matter quietly on behalf of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a commercial company of the ordinary type.  The Minister says that this was done on account of the emergency.  He says he is not looking for profits in the ordinary way, and the prices quoted are fixed without any regard to the economic development. The Minister should look at the other side of it.  What has been got out? The Minister will understand that the working of these two companies has <Col N="2184" /> caused complete dissatisfaction all over the country.  We get our pyrites from Wicklow and our phosphates from Clare.  Neither of them is regarded as very good; both are regarded as very dear, and when they make a fertiliser, or palm something off on the farmer as a fertiliser, it is regarded as very lowgrade stuff, but they have to put up with it in the circumstances.  Nobody can be happy with what is produced, with where it is being brought out, or the price at which it is being sold.</P>
    <P>The taxpayer has a right to grumble that so much of his money is being scattered and there is no real accounting for it.  I think it is considerations like that that brought the commission, which was set up with so much pomp and ceremony, to the conclusions in which they very seriously criticised this type of organisation.  It is not too late in the day to pay heed to the people who reported in that way. It does not seem to hold out much encouragement for people to sit on commissions if the recommendations they make are to be thrown to the wind and no argument given as to why their conclusions were not soundly based.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to pyrites, it is a completely wrong assumption that the pyrites produced in Wicklow are excessively costly in comparison with what is procurable elsewhere. Even with the loss in production, and even with the small subsidy which is given to encourage the production of pyrites, to be used as a fertiliser, the cost is very much less than the pyrites we import and on which a very heavy subsidy has to be paid in order to enable it to be sold reasonably to the farmer.</P>

The Minister might put that point of view very strongly to his colleague in the Department of Finance.  In the consideration of the Finance Bill last year it was urged, in regard to certain commercial exploitations in the country, that some heed should be given to that <Col N="2185" /> aspect and to the procedure adopted here and in other countries.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That, having regard to the continuous increase in the cost of food, clothing and footwear, especially in relation to children, and the consequent hardship on many of our citizens, Dáil Eireann requests the Government to undertake an early survey of poverty prevailing amongst the unemployed, especially those who are unemployable as a result of age or disability, and also amongst the employed in receipt of low wages; that Dáil Eireann further requests the Government, following upon such survey, to promote a <Col N="2186" /> higher standard of living amongst such citizens by making adequate provision of the necessaries of life through increased unemployment benefits and unemployment assisance, and also through relief administered by the various boards of assistance.</P>
    <P>This motion has been on the agenda for about ten months and its value has been lessened to a certain extent by reason of the adoption of many reforms since it was first put down. We have the Tuberculosis Bill and the Mental Hospitals Bill and we have had the provision of free footwear for children, as well as a discussion on the conditions of the blind and of widows under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Scheme.  All these have done a certain amount of good, and the resolution now is designed only to back up what was said on previous occasions.</P>
    <P>This morning's post brought to each Deputy from Dublin a copy of the report of the City of Dublin School Attendance Committee, in which it is stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The school year reveals a slightly lower percentage in the daily attendance at our city schools and the many difficulties experienced for some years past continue to hamper the operation of the School Attendance Act in the county borough. These difficulties will not disappear nor the desired efficiency be obtained until the social system is adjusted to fill full social needs.  What will be seen as our main problems are referred to under three heads: social conditions, organisation and health. Lack of clothing and footwear for children resulting from unemployment and low wages prevailing among a section of the community are responsible for much of the absence from school especially in the winter months&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A further extract will show the necessity for such a survey as I suggest:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Thanks are tendered to the various Conferences of the St. Vincent de Paul Society, the Children's Clothing Society, the <Col N="2187" /> Herald Boot Fund, the Roomkeepers Society and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children for assistance given in cases brought under their notice, and also to the teachers for their co-operation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In view of that report, setting out that for lack of clothing children in Dublin cannot attend school, I am sorry that the Government made two bites of a cherry, that when they so graciously&mdash; and I thank them for their graciousness&mdash;gave boots to the children at Christmas, it was a terrible pity they did not give clothing also, because these were all necessitous cases which deserved clothing, either free or at half or quarter price.</P>
    <P>This morning's Press also publishes something that deeply concerns the members of the House&mdash;the unemployment figures.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The numbers on the registers of employment exchanges and branch offices at the end of last week totalled 78,085 compared with 73,150 for the corresponding week last year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That means that, in one year, the unemployment figures have increased by 5,000 and it is possible that as time goes on many of the men who, according to a reply given here yesterday, sent £20,000,000 to this country in the last four or five years, will be coming home.  I am sure the Government and everybody else will realise the importance of the problem with which we are faced in future in regard to providing employment when all these people who secured employment outside the country come home.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested at the moment in getting a social survey&mdash;I would rather call it a social survey than a poverty survey&mdash;made because there are a number of families living on the borderline of a miserable existence. They receive small sums in the shape of unemployment benefits, but, when these benefits are exhausted, they have only to apply to the relief authorities from whom they get the minimum possible to keep body and soul together.  I am satisfied that that is not the desire of the Government <Col N="2188" /> and that if they could remedy these evils, they would gladly do so without delay.  Quite recently in England there was a body called the Pilgrim Trust which published a book on social survey which has provided very valuable information for the Government, the political Parties and all those interested in the welfare of the people.</P>
    <P>I consider that the fundamental questions to be asked, if we could get reliable answers, would be on these lines: Why are there large numbers of able-bodied unemployed men at present in Dublin, and most important of all, what is the minimum amount of money or goods necessary to enable families of different sizes to live properly under different conditions, assuming that the family income is used to best advantage; by how much do the incomes of unemployed and casual workers fall short of this standard; how much money do they live on; how do they obtain it; how do they spend it; what proportion of the unemployed use their leisure time to advantage; and what means could be adopted to enable them to do so?  One of the big problems facing everybody dealing with child welfare and boys' clubs&mdash;and I notice that many members of the House are interested in boys' clubs&mdash;is what are the prospects for the children of unemployed families who leave school at the ages of 14 to 16?  If the father cannot get employment, what is to become of the boy of 16 years of age who leaves the ordinary national school?  I believe there are some thousands of boys in Dublin from 16 to 20 years of age who never did a day's work, but who are anxious to get the opportunity.  Most of these boys go into a <i>cul-de-sac</i> type of employment.  Those of them who, on leaving school are fortunate enough to get into some workshop, are dismissed from their employment at the age of 18 or 21, and others are taken in.</P>
    <P>These are all matters which, I am sure, the Government will examine with a view to finding a remedy.  We meet every day fathers who ask: &ldquo;Can you get my son a job?  How small the wages are does not matter, so long as we can get him off the streets.&rdquo; New Zealand dealt with this problem and <Col N="2189" /> much has been written on the success of that scheme.  If there is anything in the New Zealand scheme which could be applied to this country, now is the time to get ready for it, before those employed in England come back and before demobilisation in both armies commences.  I hope it will be a long time before there is demobilisation from our own Army and I hope also that nobody will be demobilised except at his own request.  I hope that demobilised men will not be thrown on the labour market in a field of competition where there is little or no employment for those who are already seeking it.</P>
    <P>Our first charge is the care of the old and infirm.  The first charge of any Government is the care of the old people, the children, and the ailing. Now, our Government has made great efforts during the past few years to deal with those problems, but I think that they could go a little bit further, and any time that they bring in a measure to relieve the hardships under which the less fortunate amongst us are suffering, they will get the wholehearted support of this House.</P>
    <P>I earnestly hope that the Government will accept this motion.  I am sorry that my friend, Deputy Anthony, is not here to move it, as he was keenly interested in it and was anxious to speak on it.  Deputy Anthony knows that in his own city there are many hundreds of men employed at low wages, and also many hundreds of unemployed men trying to exist on inadequate allowances, whether from the unemployment assistance fund or other sources.  Sometimes, it gets on one's nerves when one sees people trying to exist on the inadequate amount of unemployment assistance, particularly in view of the rise in prices in the last few years of various commodities, such as clothing, and so on.  Clothing has gone up in price to almost four times what it was before the war, and it is pitiable to see the children of the lower-paid workers going around in little washed-out threadbare garments. Accordingly, I hope that the Government will take steps to see that these children will be properly protected, because I hold that if the bread-winner <Col N="2190" /> has not sufficient wages to keep his children in comfort, it is the duty of somebody to see that these children will not suffer hardships.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to detain the House much longer.  I am quite satisfied that every member of the House is anxious that something along those lines should be done.  I am not trying to act in any way as a carping critic of the Government or of Government policy.  I appreciate what has been done by the Government in connection with the provision of widows' and orphans' pensions, blind pensions, children's allowances, treatment of tuberculosis and mental patients, and the provision of free milk, and so on, for school children, but I would ask them to try to go a little step further.  If any member of this House, from any constituency in the country, wants to see a sample of the hardships to which I am referring, he need not come with me at all; all he needs to do is to go to the vicinity of the Gresham Hotel and, as he leaves the Gresham Hotel, take the first turn to the right and walk 100 yards, and he will see something there that will astonish him and arouse his sympathy to such an extent as would impel him to agitate and try to create an atmosphere in which those grievances could be remedied and those hardships relieved.  In making this appeal, I am quite sure that I am really knocking at an open door, but my immediate concern is with those who, at the moment, are trying to exist on inadequate allowances&mdash;those who are trying to exist on a sum of £1 for a father, mother and four children, with 4/- from the relieving officer.  In my opinion, 24/- should be given out, where they give 4/-.  I have seen those people raising the curtain a little bit to see if the landlord is coming, because they are not able to pay the rent out of the miserable allowances they get.</P>
    <P>I expect that I shall be told that these benefits are not intended to take the place of full employment.  The remedy, of course, for all this is full employment at good wages.  I realise that, and I shall content myself by saying that while I appreciate all that has been done by the Government to <Col N="2191" /> relieve distress, I hope for a little more.  Somebody might say to me that I am asking for a social survey of the country, and may ask me who will carry it out.  Well, in England they carried out a social survey with the aid of all the various organisations there, such as the school teachers&mdash;who, indeed, have enough to do already&mdash; and various charitable organisations, such as the Pilgrim Trust, and so on. All these organisations brought in reports on the conditions under which the people live in England.  So far as this country is concerned, thank God, we have his Grace the Archbishop of Dublin taking a most active interest in the social conditions of our people not alone in the City of Dublin but in the country in general, and he is presiding over a committee of inquiry which is dealing with most of those problems.  I think, therefore, that it is only right that somebody in this House should tender their appreciation to him and his splendid committee, representing all classes of the community, who are working in that direction, and that it is up to us to give him and his committee our support. I sincerely hope that when the report of that committee becomes available to us we shall be able to do something to relieve the hardships which, undoubtedly, will be reported upon.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that the Pilgrim Trust is the name of the authority which did such good work in England, and I would appeal to the House to give support to this motion and to keep knocking a little harder at that door which, we are told, is open, with a view to seeing that something more is done for those who are suffering from those hardships.  Let us inquire into the conditions of these people.  Let us find out what they are eating, what they are drinking, how they are living.  What is their diet?  At the moment, it is mostly tea and bread, if they can get tea; but mostly it is cocoa and bread&mdash;sometimes without sugar for the cocoa, and sometimes without butter for the bread, because the allowance they get is not sufficient to buy these things, since the various <Col N="2192" /> allowances, whether from unemployment assistance, home assistance, or other sources, are not sufficient to meet the increased cost of foodstuffs.  Therefore, I say that somebody must step in to make up the difference between these allowances and the increased cost of commodities, in order to relieve those hardships.  I thank the members of the House for the very kind hearing they have given to me, and I certainly hope that something will be done to relieve this situation.</P>

      <P>I wish to second the motion proposed by Deputy Byrne. Deputy Byrne has had a long experience of the affairs of this city.  He was Lord Mayor of the city for many years and, during all that time, he has been noted for his charity to the poor of this city.  That is known, not alone at home, but abroad.  I, myself, coming from an ordinary working-class family in a poor quarter of the town of Enniscorthy, as chairman of the local council and of various local committees, am faced there, day after day, with complaints from the poor as to the inadequate means provided.  I would ask the Minister to tell this House that the social services in this country are not all bread and honey for the poor at the moment.  It should be easy for the Government and the responsible Minister to ascertain the amount of poverty that exists throughout rural Ireland at the moment.  All the Minister has to do is to get a list from the home assistance officers of those who apply on Fridays and Saturdays for help.  As Deputy Byrne has pointed out, they are handed out 4/-, and I know of cases where they were handed out 2/6 and a 1/3 voucher.  Take the case of poor people in the country. Let us take the case, for instance, of a farm labourer whose wage is only £1 19s. 6d.  We have been informed by the Minister for Agriculture, through the daily Press, that there will be no increase this year for the men who toil on the land.  I tell the Minister that the majority of workers in town and country got no benefit from the Children's Allowances Act because of the ages set out in it.  How could widows be expected to live on pensions of 5/- a <Col N="2193" /> week, with a voucher value for 1/3 for turf?  Old age pensioners when they were able to work served the State well and reared their families.  Some of these children became members of this House.  Some pensioners also get 2/6 a week as home assistance.  Is not that making paupers of people?  Did it ever dawn on those in authority that such fathers and mothers would have to queue up weekly to draw an allowance of 2/6?  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government stated on the previous night that no one had died of hunger in this country. I know people who died from the hardships they endured.  They really died of hunger.  In my constituency a man died from hardship last week caused by the bad weather and his wife and children had to be taken to the county home.  There were no provisions in the house.  These facts cannot be denied. I am prepared to bring anyone in authority to that house.  We have heard about the housing schemes. When the tenants went to new houses they left comfortable homes for ones with big kitchens and big windows in which they found that the grates intended for coal were not suitable for turf.  Nobody in my constituency is allowed to sell timber without a licence.  If merchants do so they are prosecuted.  They were told that the turf that was being supplied was good. How could it be good turf when exposed to the snow and the weather?  I often see turf in my own house put to dry on the range before it can be used. The Minister states that the merchants need not take bad turf.  If they do not what will they get?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer now to the allowances paid under the National Health Insurance Scheme.  I say that it is a scandal to expect men who are sick to live on 15/- a week.  The amount should be increased, no matter where the money is to come from.  Only for charitable institutions like the Society of St. Vincent de Paul the position of many families would be much worse. Praise must be given to members of charitable societies who are doing such great work in visiting the poor and assisting them.  I am regularly asked by parents why their children do not <Col N="2194" /> get buns at school.  Some children get buns, but other children, who are hungry, get none.  Every child of school-going age should be provided with a meal.  That should be the case not only in the cities and towns but in the rural districts, where the children very often have to walk from three to six miles along muddy roads.  Nothing appears to be done for people in the rural districts.  They are the people who till the land.  It seems as if the Government looked after the cities and towns, where there are votes, and that the people in the rural areas are forgotten.  I think that is part of the game.  Having regard to all the money that is at the disposal of those in power, and all that is being voted for the different services, I suggest that some of it might be spent for the benefit of people in rural areas.  There is talk about building sanatoria. Where will the patients be by the time they are built?</P>

      <P>I suggest that what we want is employment with good wages and conditions.  Thousands of men could be put to work cleaning up the roads and ditches.  There is work waiting to be done now.  There is no use in talking about post-war planning. Farmers and those who are paying rates are suffering because of the condition of the roads.  There are tarred and concrete roads in the cities, but away from the main roads people would require to have top boots.  When there is work to be done some of the idle money should be spent.  Deputy Byrne gave figures about unemployment, but the position would be worse only that many of those who emigrated sent home money to their families.  I do not come here just to talk for the Press.  I come here to talk for the people, because I myself am one of them.  I have gone through the mill.  I have worked in flour mills in England and Scotland and elsewhere.  I am a married man and I know that £1 is now worth only 5/-.  Let the Minister go out and change £1 and see what he will get.</P>

      <P>The best judge of the value of the £ is the housewife, who has to buy groceries.  She does not want a basket for all she will get.  I do not think the Minister should get away with that talk about 20/- for the £.  He knows that the value of the £ has gone down.  You would not get your dinner in the restaurant here for 5/&mdash;that is, if you wanted a dinner&mdash; and I understand that the restaurant is subsidised by the Government. You will pay 2/10 for your tea.  The Minister has been here for years and he knows what he got previously and how much it cost.  Speaking on behalf of the working classes, whom I represent, I say that the Government should get going and provide work. There is work to be done.  Some small housing schemes could be set going.  I know that big housing schemes cannot be tackled, but there is cement to be got and something should be done in connection with small housing schemes, even if it be difficult to get timber.  I am merely telling the Minister the facts as I am confronted by them day by day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this resolution with a definite reservation in respect of the second part of it.  The first part asks the Government, if I may put it in a summarised way, to undertake a survey of poverty.  The second part requests the Government to promote a higher standard of living amongst certain citizens.  I recognise that Deputy Byrne's intention was confined to those who were unemployed or unemployable as a result of disability or in receipt of low wages but, certainly, in regard to the third group, I do not agree with him that the ideal solution would be to have their standard of living raised by making the provision set out here.  I am quite certain that Deputy Byrne's view was <Col N="2196" /> that that was the sort of thing which would have to go on until a completely new policy was substituted for the type of policy in operation at present.  I do not know what objection there can be to the first part of the resolution&mdash; a request that a survey of poverty should be made.  I do not think that Deputy Byrne is insisting too much on that word &ldquo;poverty&rdquo;.  I take it that the sort of survey he has in mind is that which has been done in some of the big English towns by social reformers, such as the Rowntree Survey.  If that survey were carried out by an outside body, the people who think they answer everything when they say that the £ is worth 20 shillings would be enlightened and we would have an approach to realism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that anybody will deny the premise on which the Deputy's motion is founded &mdash; that there has been an increase in the cost of food, clothing and footwear.  The <i>Trade Journal</i> sets out the amazing increase which has taken place in the cost of foodstuffs and the less, but still substantial, changes that have taken place in the cost of those ordinary, industrial goods which are regarded as amongst the necessaries of life.  The <i>Trade Journal</i> does indicate that, the cost of living having gone up by a certain amount and the wages of those engaged in transportable industries&mdash;I take it that that means industrial occupations in the main&mdash;having gone up much less, the cost of living is definitely having a serious impact on those who are amongst the lowly paid members of the community and others who would not be reckoned in that class&mdash;the persons in receipt of fixed salaries or emoluments of any type. When this war came we set out with gay hopes.  We were told that the face of the Government would be sternly set against profiteering, that the aim would be that people would not obtain incomes in excess of those they were enjoying in certain standard years prior to the war.  It was not merely that there was to be no profiteering, but, so far as it could be achieved, incomes were to be standardised and people were not to be allowed to get ahead of their old-time income by reason of the fact that they <Col N="2197" /> were in a position to make money out of the exigencies of the situation. Those were the phrases used.  Along with that, we were told that we were to have wages stabilised.  That was the balance: there was to be no increase in profits and wages were to be kept at the same point. We were warned that, if wages began to rise, we would get this terrible spiral which is used as a sort of bogey when any question of wages arises.  All spirals in wages are not bad.  There is a virtue in a rising spiral of wages on certain occasions.  But the spiral is always regarded as if it were going to rise and rise until we reach the old bogey of inflation.  That bogey is paraded before the people, who are told that those in receipt of small wages will be the first to suffer.  To avoid inflation, we were told that wages were to be kept stable and that incomes were to be stabilised likewise.  The assumption was that, so far as the Government could manage it, prices would be kept steady.  That was a well-dove-tailed plan.  If prices were kept steady during the war, then there would be no reason why people should seek an increase in wages or an increase in profits.  If prices were not kept stable, there was immediately a reason why those on the borderline of insufficiency, or below that borderline, should, at least, be saved the new hardship of having to make further sacrifices out of their inadequate resources.</P>
    <P>The Government entered on this policy, we assume, with the hope of achieving success.  One thing they did achieve was the Standstill Order in regard to wages.  Some advantage was given by Bonus Orders, but the last version of that I saw in the <i>Trade Journal</i> showed that the gap between the increased cost of living and the increased wages was somewhere in the region of from 62 to 64 points from the pre-war period.  That means that the purchasing power of the £ has gone down to about half what it was. It is only facile nonsense to say that you will get 20 shillings for £1. Nobody is bothering about the number of shillings put into a person's hand.  It is what those coins buy that counts.  One might as well say that <Col N="2198" /> one would be so much better off, if instead of getting 20 shillings, one got 40 sixpences.  The fact is that, though the purchasing power of the £ has been reduced, the person concerned is getting merely 20 old-time shillings put into his hand.  That is the situation at the moment.</P>
    <P>As regards the upper end of this problem, I suppose the meanest campaign ever waged with regard to increases in salaries to people above the low level of wage-earners was that waged by the banks against their staffs.  We were told at one time, when a certain demand was made, that it could not be granted, that the banks would go bankrupt if it were.  The banks demanded that, if they were to give the increase demanded in the early stages, they would have to be allowed to increase the charges to their customers.  The Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Finance, looked into the matter and told us that the new charges the banks were to impose were necessary.  After introducing those increased charges, bits of advances were made.  The staff decided that they would go further and made application to one of these tribunals.  A long and involved inquiry and arbitration followed, at the end of which, with the greatest reluctance, the banks yielded that particular point.</P>
    <P>Those are the people who, a year before that small increase was granted, got leave to increase their charges. Within the last three weeks there is not one of the banks that has not reported increased profits in the last year, while setting off the increased wages they have to pay to their staffs. They are all bemoaning the high bill they have to meet for their staffs. Notwithstanding the fact that they have added that in on one side of the account this year, there is not one of them that has not shown a net profit increase of several thousand pounds. They are all still able to pay their old 7½ per cent., 8 per cent., 10 per cent., 11 per cent. and up to 12 per cent. dividend.  I am not saying that it is too much.  They were able to do it before the war.  But they waged a mean campaign against their staffs, <Col N="2199" /> and it was all based on the fact that business could not stand it.  But here we find that business has stood it.</P>
    <P>Take one other example.  I have not the exact figures with me, but they can be found in the <i>Trade Journal.</i> The statistical system that we have indicates the wealth produced by industry. First, you get what is called the gross output of industry, and then certain overheads and other expenses of the business are taken off.  When that is done, you get what is called the net output.  The <i>Trade Journal</i> gives the division of net output.  That is the clear profit of the business over and beyond all ordinary overhead charges.  The division of net output pre-war, as between the proprietors of a business and the staffs, used to be about half and half.  The last of these divisions in the March number of the <i>Trade Journal</i> for the year 1944 shows a nominal increase in net output of something between £5,000,000 and £6,000,000.  That is the nominal increase because it is not graded down to pre-war prices.  How is that new £5,000,000 divided?  Not as the old net output used to be&mdash;half and half between employers and staff.  The position now is that only 5 or 7 per cent. of it goes to the employees.  The rest goes to the employers.  The result is that the employers get away with something in the region of £4,500,000. That is the position although we were told at one time that the Minister was setting his face against profits going up.</P>
    <P>What is the position of the lower end of the scale?  We decided here on a rationing system and, as a necessary accompaniment to that, to have coupons. Take the case of the unfortunate married woman with six children who does the charring in a business.  For her husband, herself and six children she gets the same number of coupons as the employer in a business if he is married and has a wife and six children.  That is grand democracy, since both get the same number of coupons.  Of course, in the shops the coupons are no good by themselves. There has to be another currency&mdash; ordinary money.  The gentleman in the <Col N="2200" /> employing class is getting well away. He has the extra moneys to meet the rising cost of living, but the unfortunate person with a whole lot of valuable coupons, entitling her to get garments and foodstuffs, etc., for her children, has not the money, and, of course, cannot buy.  The Minister has seen to that by his Standstill Order. Her husband's wages have been kept to the old standards, if we except some small increases that have been granted.  In that situation there is an immediate occasion for dishonest operations.  You have one person with plenty of coupons and no money to back them, and the other person with plenty of money able to buy more than the legitimate amount that his coupons entitle him to.  The result is that the person with the low-grade income is tempted to sell her coupons.  All these things have their impact on Deputy Byrne's motion which speaks of the hardship on many of our citizens.  Of course, there is going to be hardship as long as that situation lasts.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that money has not really changed in its value, and that the £ is still worth 20/-.  When speaking in the House recently he complained that Deputies had construed the electricity measure as if it were a demand for £40,000,000 while, he said, the scheme that he was contemplating, if taken at pre-1939 prices, only amounted to something in the neighbourhood of £27,000,000.  Then he said hurriedly that, of course, prices after the war are going to settle down at between 45 and 50 per cent. of pre-1939 prices.  That is a stepping up from £27,000,000 to £40,000,000.  In regard to electrical development in the future we are to reckon as regards the cost of materials and of wages, in so far as wages are put into the material that we import or the labour that we employ on the schemes themselves, that there is going to be an advance in costs of from 45 to 50 per cent. above pre-war.  Up to date the Minister has been praised in such of the cold economic journals as advert to his policy at all for this: that he is quite right to keep wages down because once you let wages up it is hard to reduce them: that if you let wages up and if costs <Col N="2201" /> generally came down to the 1939 figure you would have a terrible time getting those who enjoyed some slight increase in wages brought back to the previous level.  The other day we got from the Government an acceptance of the idea that, in the post-war world, we are going to have to live on prices that will be from 45 to 50 per cent. above the pre-1939 figure.  When are we going to get wages stepped up by that amount?  If there is a realisation now that we are moving towards a stabilised period post-war in which wages will be 50 per cent. above the 1939 point, are we going to jump them up all of a sudden?  Surely, there is no reason behind the inhuman policy that if you raise wages now it will be difficult afterwards to get people to yield something of what they had gained during the war period.  The Minister knows that prices are not being stabilised at 50 per cent. above pre-war, but at a much higher figure. Are we going to carry on until some bright day dawns when, I suppose, by the removal of the Standstill Order free rein will be given to labour organisations to pass the word to the employing associations to get a recognition of the fact that the new world has dawned with much heavier costs and prices, and only then will it be regarded as fair and desirable to step up wages?  But, meantime, hardship is being worked and great injustice and wrong are being done.</P>
    <P>Despite all that has been said about calcium, this new found miracle, the vast majority of people in this country believe that the onset of tuberculosis here is due to malnutrition and the fact that people are not able to buy as much of the protective foods as they used to.  I have even heard judges comment that the new increase in crime, a very serious increase, is due to some extent and, possibly, a large extent, to the same cause.  We know that there are people who have had to go through this war by depriving their children of small educational advantages that at one time they had decided to give them.  One knows that amongst the lower-paid classes in the community any number of people have come through the war in this situation <Col N="2202" /> that they have seen all their economies of previous years scattered.  Any little money they had, that they were able to invest in insurance policies or anything else, has been wasted.  The Minister will have fought this war, or maintained our neutrality position during this war, by disease to some degree, by the onset of crime, by the dissipation of small men's small resources and by the deprivation that some people have had to put upon their children in the matter of education and other social conditions.  Of the new nominal £5,000,000 of net output that industry in this country gives us, those at the top of the tree get all but 7 per cent. of it.  Many families in this country can get a reward because of being monied, but work cannot get a reward equal to the old reward, by simply being work or service.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne's motion simply glances at this hardship which has been caused, and which he bases on the increase in the cost of food, clothing and footwear.  If that is what is meant by &ldquo;consequent hardship&rdquo; and includes all the things people have to buy here, the motion is factually correct.  All a survey could do, while it would be worth while, would be to take a certain amount and adjust it to fit a new family budget; because the cost-of-living figure is based upon very old figures.  We had passed that and, as between our cost-of-living figure and the very one which has to be compared with it, we had been making some small increase in the standard of living in the world and measuring up people on the old 1914 standards but without the 1914 costs.  The British, of course, have outpassed us since.  They have had the inquiry of which Deputy Byrne's motion speaks, and have had an inquiry into the present day budget, or rather the pre-war budget, of the working family.  They have there very definitely measured up the increased standard of life and are equating the new cost to it.</P>
    <P>The British situation, which is in sharp contrast to ours, is such that, in the last Budget which the Chancellor of the Exchequer introduced in England he was forced to threaten that, by <Col N="2203" /> subsidies and in a variety of other ways, the cost of living would be kept in check, as wage rates increases were in advance of the advance in the cost of living.  Having said that, he added that, of course, a very small fraction of the working community at the time were tied by the wage rates, because there was overtime pay, which most of the workers got, and there were piece rates, which most of them worked on also.  He said the situation which they had promised to keep equal with&mdash;as our Government had promised to keep equal with&mdash;had now become so lopsided in favour of the working-class that he proposed deliberately to increase the cost of living by several points in order to have the balance preserved again.  On the other side, where they have rationing and coupons and all the rest of it, the one thing they are certainly not short of is money.  It is the coupon, the amount that they are entitled to get out of the store of goods preserved for the community, that is their difficulty. Any person over there who has sufficient coupons certainly does not lack one thing, that is, sufficient money to lay beside the coupons he is entitled to.  We have the situation I have described, and we have, on the other side, this decision to have this new budget for the working classes. It is surely about time that we had the old figure, on which we are basing so many matters, stepped up here in order that it may reflect an increased standard of living, whether that had been achieved or not.</P>
    <P>I know that there is quite an amount of literature written at the moment that holds out, if people advance along the lines on which it is written, a hope of a much better life for a certain section of national communities all over the world.  However, most people remain a little suspicious of the strong insistence there is amongst these new pamphleteers on the nutrition standard. People are asking if it means that the new society is going to be based just on what will keep life and nothing else, or what even will keep a person in health and nothing else.  In any event, can we get a budget which <Col N="2204" /> will be based, from the point of view of realism, upon what people in working-class families were spending their money on, whatever money they had? Secondly, we could try to get for ourselves&mdash;and we have many eminent men who can give us the figures, who can give us the materials that have to be bought and the price relating to them&mdash;the figure which the family of different sizes here ought to have, if it is to be kept in good health and nothing else.  If we get that, without at all intending that that should be taken as anything but a standard&mdash;and a low standard&mdash;on which to base ourselves, then I could possibly say that Deputy Byrne's motion, when it speaks of hardship, uses a very mild word for the conditions that prevail.</P>
    <P>I alluded in a recent debate to one other statistic that has come out recently, a most horrifying statistic, which has been produced in the Report of the Inquiry into the Housing of the Working Classes in the City of Dublin, Appendix 17&mdash;the relevant appendix in this matter.  The references given in the body of the report, paragraph 133, which says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Appendix 17 gives a summary, prepared by the City Manager, showing the sizes and incomes of 10,500 families taken at random from the 33,411 working class families included in the 1938/39 survey.  An earlier summary of 4,000 families was also presented, but the percentage differences were comparatively slight, and it is sufficient to confine attention to the larger sample which, being one-third of the whole, may confidently be taken as representing the whole.  This indicates that 20.06 per cent. of the families had incomes&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>that is, family incomes&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;from 5/- to 20/- per week; 25.49 per cent. had family incomes between 20/- and 40/- per week...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If I stop there, it means that 45 per cent. of these 10,500 families had in 1938 something up to and lower than £2 per week.  If I take the next figure, 9.48 per cent. had between 40/- and <Col N="2205" /> 50/- a week, and if I take these three together it means that 54 per cent. of the 10,500 families examined, being one-third of the whole who had ever been under observation, had under 50/-a week, and that is 50/- a week in the year 1938.  The Minister has seen that in the main these families have got little if any increase in that 50/- since the war started; and that 50/- now is, of course, worth only something between 25/- and 30/- on what can be bought for it.  The paragraph goes on to say, after giving the rest of the figures:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A general average over all the families based on the mean of the foregoing ranges would be 48/6 per week, but it will be more enlightening to note that 20 per cent. receive less than 20/- per week and can presumably pay no rent if they feed and clothe themselves in even the most meagre fashion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I apply that phrase not to those getting under 20/- but to those nowadays getting under 40/-, because the present 40/- is worth about the 20/- of the 1938 period.  Therefore, you can take it that 45 per cent. of our people can presumably pay no rent if they have to feed and clothe themselves in even the most meagre fashion.</P>
    <P>Of course, that again indicates the definite hardship there is in this city. It is a hardship which the Minister has done very little to mitigate.  He has certainly during the war done nothing to mitigate it by the ordinary means.  I am sure I will be told about all the social services.  I said &ldquo;little mitigation by ordinary means&rdquo;.  A very eminent Bishop in this country recently addressed the people of his diocese when opening a new sanatorium and he said he hoped they would not be misled into any false pride; that they would not think this country's economic status was to be measured by the number of hospitals, sanatoria, or homes for various people that were being erected; that these, in fact, were signs of bad conditions; that they were something better than not having these places there if the conditions warranted them; but that nobody would really think, if he had <Col N="2206" /> any national pride, of bringing foreigners into this country and showing them as the mark of our civilisation a whole lot of tuberculosis sanatoria, houses for the aged and destitute, and all that type of equipment.  That is the type of equipment or appliance which is the Minister's response to the conditions prevailing and which in effect Deputy Byrne calls for at the end of his motion.</P>
    <P>I have seen a phrase recently used in some journal that nobody would ever have thought in the days when the world was going out against the slave traffic of going out to these men, on the emancipation of the slaves, and telling them that, after all, the slave had a fairly comfortable life, that he got sustained, that he was, kept at least in such bodily health as enabled him to be a good tool, something the equivalent of the machine tool at the present day.  Every development considered at the moment is giving the security of the plantation to people who will submit to the discipline of the plantation.  That, of course, is what the enlargement of the things at the end of Deputy Byrne's motion might mean.  If we are to have increased unemployment benefit, increased unemployment assistance and further relief administered by boards of assistance, and if that is the best we can do&mdash;it may be the best we can do in the period of emergency&mdash;but if that is the best we can do in ordinary times, then that motion would almost damn itself by pessimism.  Nobody regards the proposals at the end of the motion as being anything but a temporary sort of expedient.  If that is the best this country has to offer to certain classes of its citizens, more unemployment benefit, more unemployment assistance and more relief administered by boards of assistance, then we should almost call back the British.  It was to end all that sort of thing that many people had their hopes fired in connection with certain political movements.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister's attitude in all this matter is.  I think the Minister will accept it that wages are now at half point level, that he has by his Orders put the working community <Col N="2207" /> and those who are in receipt of salaries and wages on half pay.  That is more or less what he has done.  He has not lowered the costs of living to the point that half pay would be able to meet the charges put on the old full pay.  He has let that get out of hand to the point that the motion speaks of and has simply and brutally held wages fast.  The Minister may say that that is the best we can do, that any other policy would mean an enormous amount of money in subsidies and that they must simply be tossed aside as impossible.  If they are impossible, it means that, whatever the costs are that would be necessitated by subsidies, they are being borne in some shape or another by somebody.  Certainly they are not borne by those people who run away with all but 7 per cent. of the increase in the net output of industry.</P>
    <P>What does the Minister propose to do with regard to the future?  I think, if the motion were passed, and we could get a new survey of conditions amongst working class people, we would have some starting point on which to base at least the aim of a new policy, whether effective or not. I often wondered when the Minister, in these interruptions of his says a £ is still worth 20/-, what idea has he with regard to the future.  At least one or two points of enlightenment have come to him within the last four or five months.  Recently there has been an appreciation of the fact that costs are not going to come back to pre-war level, that prices are not going to come back to pre-war level.  It is impossible to think that people who live on salaries and wages are to be asked to pay the costs of the post-war period with the pre-war moneys.  What, then, is the Minister going to do?  The Minister also has apparently in recent months appreciated that this matter of sending a lot of produce out of the country in order to get credits abroad may not be just as good as a possible policy as it at one time was regarded.  He seems to have got an appreciation of the fact that our sterling assets abroad may not be at our disposal when we want and as we <Col N="2208" /> want them.  Having got that new view, does he propose to make any change in the type of distribution that is going on of whatever goods we produce at the moment, or does he think that the best thing to do is to let the drift continue, that it is too hard to stop it, that for good or evil all this money has piled up and that the little bit we might stop between this and the post-war period would not be worth talking about?</P>
    <P>Apart from that, has the Minister any proposal dealing with employment, dealing with the occupation of people, for the future?  I heard talk in this country, even from the Minister himself, of how we had even over-produced certain articles.  If you think in terms of human appetite, this country has never over-produced.  There was a statement in a paper at one time that the production of certain agricultural goods in County Dublin was so much; then some calculation was made of the goods that were in fact consumed in the city and, a simple subtraction having been made, it was stated that County Dublin over-produced by so much.  If that had any reality, the people who used it must feel that everybody in County Dublin and in the city had got as much of their human needs satisfied as would satiate these people.  That was never the position. We have never had over-production in this country if you are to think only in terms of appetite and what human wants are; what the economists call the needs of the community.  Of course, we have over and over again over-produced if you are thinking, not in terms of appetite, but of appetite plus purse.  If you are thinking, not of what people are able to consume, but of what they have to spend on the goods, then, of course, both in the County of Dublin and elsewhere in the Twenty-Six Counties we have had from time to time great over-production. Does the Minister intend to do anything about that?</P>
    <P>As I understand the new policy, they founded themselves entirely upon spending and outlay, giving people enough to enable the industrialists in the town to buy whatever is produced in the way of agricultural goods in the <Col N="2209" /> country.  It will be said that the agriculturist will not produce for the townsman who wants food; that he will only produce for the townsman who is able to buy food.  Is the Minister able to tell us that the farming community is so well satisfied with the goods it gets from the towns that it could not do with a little more of them?  Until he can say either one of these things, there is need for more production in the country even amongst ourselves of the things that we want here.  I can see no appreciation by the Minister of that particular new line of thought, basing itself on spending, and spending, of course, of money which must be earned.  Therefore, the background to that is work so that goods can be exchanged as between the people of the country.  The opposite policy is the one the Minister is following.</P>
    <P>You could see that a community has plenty of money, and see that they work for it, but that they would have plenty of money by which the townsman could buy the countryman's products and the countryman could buy the townsman's products.  Or, you could put everybody on the low level of the unemployment assistance and unemployment insurance and the relief given by the guardians.  In that event, there will be very small moneys in the hands of a certain fraction, but a steadily increasing fraction of the community, and they will not make very much demand on the community for the goods that are being produced. You can either step up or step down. You can do that consciously and deliberately, with purpose.  The only purpose the Minister has shown, the only efficiency the Minister has shown, the only really big result he has achieved since this war started has been on the closing down of the moneys that go into the hands of certain people.  He has not prevented money coming into this country in abundance. He has not prevented the effect of that, of an inflationary type, on the goods to be sold here.  He has simply seen that that is channelled into a small number of hands and, once you do channel these sums of money into the hands of a limited number of <Col N="2210" /> people, you get an inflation; you do not get such a demand for goods as you would get for purchasing power distributed through the mass of your community.</P>
    <P>There are two policies.  You can step down and go on a meagre life and let people live inadequate lives.  And when you step down one section of the community, you inevitably step down another.  Or, you can go on, in a purposeful, deliberate way, to increase spending or outlay.  The whole tendency, as I see it, at the moment, from the Minister, is towards restriction. The one thing that was easy for him to do was just the harsh, ruthless, rather brutal business of saying: &ldquo;You will not get any more money of a certain type than you are getting.&rdquo;  He can be praised&mdash;if he takes it for praise&mdash; for his efficiency in that matter but that, pursued into the post-war world, will bring about that condition of things that other nations are trying to put behind them.  I see no change of mind in this respect.</P>
    <P>When I welcome, as I do, Deputy Byrne's motion, it is simply for trying to get this survey of poverty made.  If I accept the second part, I do it with this reservation, that it is only because in the particular emergency in which we find ourselves it may be the only way we can get over another three to six months.  I would not like anybody to take the second part of that motion as meaning that we want it as a policy for the future in the post-war period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion which Deputy Byrne moved is based on the assumption that the cost of living has been continuously increasing.  Deputy McGilligan stated that nobody could deny that premise.  I deny it.  It is true that the cost of living here rose in the earlier years of the war&mdash;for reasons which I shall mention shortly. It is not true that the cost of living has been continuously rising for the past 18 months.  From the middle of 1943, prices have become stabilised. Neither the cost-of-living index number nor the index numbers for food, clothing or fuel, have shown an increase.  No doubt, Deputies who have studied the <i>Trade Journal</i> know that fact.  The <Col N="2211" /> fact that they know it does not mean that they are going to refer to it or alter the arguments which they base upon the incorrect assumption in the opening words of this motion.  There has been an increase in prices since the war started.  The cost-of-living index number for the last quarter of 1944 showed an increase of 70 per cent. on the number for the corresponding period of 1939.  Between 1939 and this date the cost of living, as shown by the cost-of-living index number, has increased by 70 per cent.  The cost of foodstuffs increased by a smaller percentage but, taking the main index as revealing the situation, we have to recognise that there has been an increase in retail prices of 70 per cent. Remember, the cost-of-living index is a price index; it is not a consumption index; and there have been changes in the consumption of commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that our statistics appear to show that there has been no diminution in the consumption of food since 1939.  The quantity of food consumed in 1944 was no less than the quantity consumed in 1939.  The decline in the quantum of consumption of household commodities, excluding farm produce consumed on the farm without process of sale, but including consumers' capital like furniture, between 1939 and 1943, was estimated at 15 per cent.  It is difficult to find a comparison with Great Britain, even though a considerable amount of statistical information concerning the British position has been recently published.  Deputy McGilligan, I know, likes comparisons with Great Britain and I am trying to meet him in that matter.  The British White Paper to which I have referred showed, as against that 15 per cent. decline in the quantum of consumption of household commodities here, that, in the same period, the decline in the quantity of goods and services consumed in Great Britain was 21 per cent.  These statistics, in so far as they are comparable, would appear to show that the consumption of household commodities in Great Britain has fallen more than it has fallen in this country, but the fall in this country has been mainly in non-food commodities. <Col N="2212" /> Although there was in Great Britain a decline in the total consumption of food, there was no such decline here, and, as against the assertion made by Deputy McGilligan that tuberculosis or other illnesses are due to a decline in the quantity of protective foods which our people are using, I make this assertion &mdash;that, so far as the poorer classes of the population residing in our towns are concerned, they are getting more protective foods now than ever they got as a result of the arrangements made by the Government to that end.</P>
    <P>The cost-of-living index is, as I reminded the Dáil, a price index.  It indicates a movement of prices.  On more than one occasion, I brought up in this Dáil for discussion the question of price policy and asked from the Parties opposite an indication of their attitude in relation to price policy.  I have never got that indication. Deputy McGilligan stated here that the Government had declared at the beginning of the war that its policy was to stabilise prices at all costs. That is the reverse of the policy on which the Government decided.  There were two possible lines of policy in relation to prices that the Government could have followed.  We could have decided&mdash;as Deputy McGilligan stated we did decide&mdash;to keep prices down at all costs, even though it meant unemployment, even though it meant the disorganisation of industry or of trade, or, in the alternative, we could have decided that the maintenance of employment and the preservation of our industrial and trade structure from substantial dislocation were more important than the stabilisation of prices.  I told the Dáil that the Government had decided in favour of maintaining employment, up to the middle of last year.  I asked the Dáil whether they approved of that policy or not.</P>
    <P>I told them that the maintenance of employment meant that we would have to let prices rise in order to ensure that the maximum number would be retained in their jobs.  That policy was pursued by the Government up to the middle of last year.  We appealed to employers to hold workers in their <Col N="2213" /> employment, even though economic considerations would justify their release.  We distributed the available supplies of industrial materials around all the existing industrial concerns even though none of them could work to full time.  We recognised that the measures we were adopting were going to make a rise in prices inevitable, but we decided that a rise in prices was less objectionable than a rise in unemployment.</P>
    <P>Last year we decided to stabilise prices even though it meant an increase in unemployment.  Both on the first occasion upon which I announced to the Dáil the Government's decision in relation to prices, and again last year when the policy of price stabilisation was questioned here, I asked each of the organised Parties in this Dáil to give us an indication of their policy.  I have not got it yet.  We can bring down the prices of clothing and foodstuffs to-morrow. We have at the present time a supply of woollen and worsted cloth which represents roughly 75 per cent. of the total output of the Irish mills alone in 1939.  We have no imported cloth. We can take that total supply of worsted cloth and concentrate it in a few clothing factories, enabling those factories to work full time, and to carry their overhead costs upon maximum output.  We can eanalise the distribution of the clothes produced to a few wholesale firms and a few retail firms.  By eliminating unnecessary producing and distributing costs, we can make a substantial reduction in price.  We will put thousands of people out of work.  Is it worth it?  I must confess that I have an open mind on that question.  I can conceive circumstances in which it might be worth while creating that unemployment in order to get the lower prices which could be secured by concentrating production and distribution.  But what is the attitude of the Parties opposite? Will they answer that question?  They will condemn the Government if unemployment rises.  They will condemn the Government if prices rise.  But they can have one course or the other. Which course do they think is best? What advice will they give the Government, <Col N="2214" /> the Government which is responsible for taking decisions and putting those decisions into practice? In so far as all manufacturing commodities are concerned, a somewhat similar situation exists.  There are some commodities which are still being produced in full supply, and in relation to which costs are affected only by the price of fuel, or the cost of machinery, or wages.</P>
    <P>In preparing the cost-of-living index of prices, certain foodstuffs are reckoned and taken into account.  I presume Deputies know the basis of that index number.  The consumption of commodities by a certain number of families with incomes averaging somewhat over £5 per week was ascertained in the year 1922, and on the basis of the actual consumption of those families an index number was prepared which reflected changes in the prices of the commodities taken into account in its preparation.  All the foodstuffs taken into account in the preparation of the cost-of-living index number, except tea and rice, are produced in this country, produced entirely in this country from the raw material up to the article consumed by individuals.  The price of every one of those foodstuffs is under our control. The price of those foodstuffs is fixed by Order.  Since 1939 we have increased by 85 per cent. the price guaranteed to farmers for wheat.  We have increased by 72 per cent. the price they receive for beet.  We have increased from 33 per cent. to 60 per cent. according to area the price they receive for consumers' milk, and by 126 per cent. the price paid for milk delivered to creameries for manufacture into butter.  We need not have increased those prices.  The decision to increase those prices was not merely taken by the Government and approved by the Dáil, but followed demands in the Dáil for their increase.  The increase in those prices was, of course, dictated by considerations of supply.  It was represented that, in order to get production of those foodstuffs in the quantity we needed, we had to give the farmers the inducement of higher prices. We gave them the inducement of higher prices, but did any Deputy who spoke <Col N="2215" /> here in favour of those higher prices to farmers for foodstuffs not appreciate that the retail cost of the foods sold in the town and to consumers throughout the country was going to be increased also?</P>
    <P>The suggestion is made, of course, that the increase in retail prices is due not to the higher cost of the raw materials produced on the farms or purchased abroad, but to increased profits taken in manufacture or distribution here.  Again, the facts are available to Deputies.  Deputies make those assertions without referring to the statistical information made available to them by the Department of Industry and Commerce in the <i>Irish Trade Journal.</i>  If it were true that the increase in the price of commodities was to be attributed mainly to increased profits taken in either manufacture or distribution, one would expect to find that the rise in retail prices had been greater than the rise in wholesale prices; that the rise in wholesale prices had been greater than the rise in agricultural prices or the prices of imported goods.  If Deputies study the tables that are published for their information they will find that the reverse is the case.  Between 1939 and 1944, retail prices, as shown in the cost-of-living index number, increased by 70 per cent.; wholesale prices increased by 88 per cent.; agricultural prices increased by 98 per cent.; import prices increased by 127 per cent.  Those tables reveal clearly that not merely have there been no increased profits taken in distribution but that the margins allowed to wholesalers and retailers have been pared so that the increase in retail prices is less than the increase in wholesale prices, and the increase in wholesale prices is less than the increase in producers' prices or the prices of imported goods.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan said here that the census of industrial production shows that, of the increase in the value of net output, the amount taken by the proprietors of the industries was substantially more than the amount secured by the persons employed in those industries.</P>
    <Col N="2216" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That it was nine times what the employees in the industries got.  Does Deputy McGilligan understand the statistics of those industries at all?  What was the net output?  If he turns to the tables he will find that the net output is ascertained by deducting from the gross output&mdash; what?  The cost of materials, the cost of fuel and the cost of packing.  Does any Deputy here believe that the cost of producing any article consists solely of the cost of wages, of materials, of fuel and packing?  First of all, you want a factory and in the factory you want machinery.  The balance of the net output to which Deputy McGilligan referred is not going in profits to the proprietors.  It is going to meet costs of production, essential costs of production. When a pair of boots is turned out on a machine the cost of that pair of boots is not represented merely by the wages of the worker who is operating the machine and the material used.  There are other factors which must be taken into account in determining the ex-factory price of that pair of boots or any other article manufactured in a factory.  It is a complete distortion of the facts to represent the increase in net output of industry as being absorbed entirely in additional profits earned by the proprietors of industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan told us further that the rise in the cost of living is having a definite impact on the worst-off sections of the people.  I endeavoured to find out precisely what was the impact on the worst-off sections of the people which the rise in the cost of living has produced.  It is possible to ascertain that.  We do not have to rely on the assertions of Deputy McGilligan to ascertain the facts.  It is possible to make a calculation as to the effect of the rise in the cost of living and the rise in wages on the real incomes of various classes of the community.  Let it be quite clearly stated that during the war it is not possible to make the whole community better off.  Inevitably this community is worse off because of the war and will continue to be worse off, as <Col N="2217" /> long as the war lasts.  There is no way out of it.  It may be that if we had decided to abandon neutrality and participate in the war, we would have a share of the war industries here and procure for our people the ephemeral type of prosperity which exists at the present time in Great Britain.  We decided on a policy of neutrality and under neutrality there was no possibility of our securing an extension of production which is the only possible basis of increased prosperity.</P>
    <P>One section of our community is undoubtedly better off as a result of the war&mdash;the farmers.  The real income of the farmers, that is the actual amount of cash they receive related to the rise in prices, has increased since 1939.  It has increased by approximately 50 per cent.  I am not objecting to that.  I think it could be urged that there was a maladjustment in the position before the war, a wrong distribution of the national income as between the agriculturists and the other sections of the people.  In so far as there was such maldistribution before the war, it has been rectified during the war because the only section of the community which is better off in a real sense&mdash;in the sense that they can buy more than they could buy previously&mdash;are the agriculturists.</P>
    <P>Let us take the various classes of the people and see how they stand.  I assume that a comparison between an unemployed man in Dublin receiving unemployment assistance and an employed man in Dublin or an agricultural worker with a person in receipt of unemployment insurance benefit will enable us to examine whether it is correct to say that the worst-off sections of the people have suffered unduly because of the rise in the cost of living.  I am going to assume for the purposes of this argument that the 1939 position was satisfactory.  It was not satisfactory, because in 1939 everybody knows that we had economic and social problems which were receiving our attention, which were causing not merely concern but anxiety here.  But we must proceed on some assumption and my purpose in making these calculations was to endeavour to ascertain to what extent the position of any class of our people <Col N="2218" /> became worse because of the rise in prices since 1939.  Take a married man with three children in receipt of unemployment assistance.  He is as well off now as in 1939.  The amount of food or other commodities which he can purchase has not diminished.  The employed man is not as well off.  The employed industrial worker is receiving only 72 per cent. of the real income which he received in 1939.  He is receiving more money in wages but the rise in prices has been greater than the increase in wages and his real income, as I say, has fallen to 72 per cent.  May I say that these calculations I am giving here do not take into account any income derived from the children's allowances scheme.</P>
    <P>The agricultural worker has been affected very much less than the industrial worker.  His real income is 90 per cent. of his real income in 1939. The income-tax payer, the class of person with whom Deputy McGilligan is concerned&mdash;in so far as it is possible to segregate the income-tax payer and pick out one individual from the number whose position represents the average position of income-tax payers &mdash;is receiving 80 per cent. of his 1939 real income.  That position indicates what I have stated, that the community with the exception of agriculturists is worse off but it indicates also that the person in the community who might have been hardest hit by the rise in prices, the unemployed man receiving unemployment assistance, has been less affected by the rise in the cost of living than the agricultural worker and the agricultural worker less affected than the other employee, the industrial worker.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan said he presumed, when he stated that little had been done to mitigate the hardships resulting from the rise in prices, he was going to be told about social services.  He is going to be told about social services.  I think it is as well to remind the Dáil of what has been done in that respect for two reasons.  One is that Deputies tend to forget, and the second is that certain conclusions inevitably arise from the facts which I am going to give the Dáil.  The motion before the House requests the Government to promote a higher standard of <Col N="2219" /> living by, amongst other means, relief administered by the various boards of assistance.  The public assistance authorities are not bound by any rigid rules but they are compelled by the Public Assistance Act of 1939 to afford such public assistance as shall appear to them to be necessary and proper in any particular case.  If the intention of the motion is to suggest that action which the public assistance authorities take for the relief of destitution is in any way restricted by the Government, then that suggestion is unfounded.  A public assistance authority is under an obligation to afford such public assistance as shall appear to them to be necessary and proper in each particular case.  The amount expended in cash for the relief of destitution by the local assistance authorities has increased by 10 per cent. but the amount of additional relief given by home assistance authorities in the war years has not been in cash alone.</P>
    <P>In the year 1941 the principle of distributing to beneficiaries under the various social services vouchers exchangeable for specific quantities of food was approved and brought into operation.  In so far as that food voucher scheme is administered by the Department of Industry and Commerce it affects 37,000 people who are in receipt of unemployment assistance, 27,000 people who are in receipt of old age or blind pensions, 4,000 in receipt of national health benefit and 24,000 people who are beneficiaries under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act. That scheme, which costs £580,000 a year, secures for every single beneficiary under it, free of charge, a quarter of a pound of butter, three and a half pints of milk and three pounds of bread per week.  Public assistance authorities throughout the country were directed to operate the schemes in rural as well as urban areas by which vouchers for specific quantities of food would be made available to recipients of home assistance.</P>
    <P>In the beginning a sum of £100,000 was made available to these authorities from public funds to finance that scheme.  Later that sum was increased to £200,000.  Last year the public <Col N="2220" /> assistance authorities were recommended to extend the provision of assistance in kind to include eggs and durable footwear for children.  In addition to that £200,000 made available from public funds to home assistance authorities, another £230,000 was made available by the Government to these authorities to pay supplemental benefits in cash to old age pensioners, blind pensioners and their dependent children, and to certain recipients of national health disablement benefit. The public assistance authorities were required to defray 25 per cent. of the cost of that scheme, the total amount of which was £300,000.  To ensure that a proportion of the available supplies of children's footwear would be reserved for children of the poorer classes, a cheap footwear distribution scheme was inaugurated recently; the administration of it is a responsibility of the public assistance authorities.  I may say that 50 per cent. of the cost of it is met by the local funds provided for home assistance, and the balance from the grant made to the home assistance authorities for assistance in kind.</P>
    <P>In addition to that scheme, there has been in operation for some time past a cheap fuel scheme.  The Government provide £100,000 per year, supplemented by another £80,000 supplied by the home assistance authorities to provide a regular supply of cheap fuel to necessitous householders.  Under that scheme one cwt. of fuel is allowed free every week to persons on home assistance; it is sold at 6d. per cwt. to old age and other pensioners; at 1/-per cwt. to unemployment benefit recipients, and at 2/- per cwt. to persons in employment at low incomes. The quantity of fuel distributed under that scheme last year was 70,000 tons.</P>
    <P>In 1941 the weekly rates of benefit payable to persons in receipt of unemployment insurance were increased by 2/6 per week in respect of each adult dependent and 1/6 per week in respect of each child dependent.  Last year there came into operation the children's allowances scheme.  Under that scheme 130,000 families are benefiting by amounts ranging from 2/6 to £1 <Col N="2221" /> weekly.  There are no less than 26,000 families receiving allowances of 7/6 per week or over.  The annual payments made under that scheme will average about £2,200,000.</P>
    <P>These expansions in our social services and in the measures taken for the relief of distress arising from any cause involve an increased expenditure of £3,500,000 per year.  At the present time this community is paying, in respect of services designed to prevent distress arising from any cause, over £13,000,000 per year.  Home assistance payments in cash average £650,000; home assistance in kind, £160,000; old age pension supplementary allowances £300,000; the footwear scheme £100,000; the fuel scheme £100,000. Under unemployment insurance a sum of £266,000 is paid; in unemployment assistance, £1,344,000. Under the Department of Industry and Commerce food voucher scheme the expenditure totals £580,000.  We spend £3,790,000 on old age pensions, £450,000 in widows' and orphans' pensions, £2,200,000 in children's allowances, £1,960,000 in food and turf subsidies, £1,250,000 on employment and other emergency schemes.</P>
    <P>£13,150,000 may seem a small sum to those accustomed to read the Budget Statements of British Chancellors of the Exchequer, but in order to get Deputies to understand precisely what the expenditure of that sum on these non-productive purposes involves for this State, it is necessary to establish certain comparisons.  The estimated total net value of our agricultural output last year was £84,000,000.  The amount which we are expending on relief services is, therefore, nearly one-sixth of the total value of our agricultural output available for sale.</P>
    <P>The estimated total net output of our industrial production of transportable goods last year was about £30,000,000. The provision for relief expenditure is almost half the total value of our industrial production of transportable goods.  The estimated total amount expended by this community on food, drink and tobacco last year was £35,000,000.  Our total relief expenditure is, therefore, 40 per cent. of the total expenditure of all our people on <Col N="2222" /> foodstuffs and similar commodities. There are roughly, 600,000 workers employed in this country for wages.  Our relief expenditure, therefore, is equivalent to a tax of over £20 per year on every employed worker or, if you like to put it on a weekly basis, nearly 8/-per week.</P>
    <P>I give these comparisons in order to demonstrate that the provision made by this community, impoverished though it has been by war-time conditions, on the relief of distress arising from any cause, is very substantial, far more substantial, I submit, than any other country in Europe is making at the present time although it would be difficult to institute reliable comparisons.</P>
    <P>I am not going to follow Deputy McGilligan into a discussion of post-war plans.  We can consider measures for post-war employment, or the reorganisation and expansion of productive activities in the post-war period, at another time.  This motion does not deal with post-war employment projects and I am not prepared to make any announcement of Government policy in that respect.  If the solution of unemployment can be secured by a mere expansion of expenditure, it is a simple matter; but any person who thinks there is such a simple solution for unemployment has failed to appreciate the nature of the difficulties which have arisen in this and in other countries in relation to the promotion of employment, difficulties which are doubly accentuated here where we have neither productive capacity adequately organised nor productive capacity on the basis of efficiency upon which we must put it if we are to improve the social conditions of our people.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly useless for Deputy McGilligan to talk about the accumulation of sterling assets during the war.  The accumulation of these sterling assets was not effected as a result of any Government decision.  It was the inevitable result of the situation that arose during the war, and we could have stopped the accumulation of these sterling assets by one simple device: by prohibiting the export of live stock.  But surely Deputy <Col N="2223" /> McGilligan or, at any rate, some members of his Party, will appreciate that the disorganisation in the whole of our agricultural industry which would have resulted from the prohibition of live-stock exports would have been so considerable that the effect on our people would have been far more serious than any loss that has accrued to us by reason of the expansion of these sterling assets because of our inability to effect imports of the goods we need.</P>
    <P>Whether these assets will be liquid assets immediately after the war, whether they will be exchangeable into other currencies, whether we will be able to use them to purchase in Great Britain the equipment and materials we will need, nobody can attempt to forecast; but it would be foolish to regard them as liabilities instead of assets.  Whatever the future may hold, they will have some value for us, they will at some time be capable of being translated into goods imported.  We would use them to import goods now but for physical barriers, and their accumulation has certainly not been due to any decision that it was desirable to accumulate them.  It was due only to the inevitable expansion of these reserves, following on our inability to use the proceeds of our sales abroad to procure the goods we needed.</P>
    <P>The idea of a social survey has been considered.  I think Deputies who have spoken about it, however, do not appreciate that any such survey, to be of value, would necessarily be protracted. It is not desirable merely to get information concerning the position in any one week or any one month in different parts of the country.  To get a survey upon which we could afford to take the chance of basing future policy, there would have to be an examination of conditions over a period, and, inevitably, if that examination was to be thorough and conducted in all parts of the country, it might be years before the results could be tabulated and made available to the Dáil.  This is the wrong time to undertake such a survey, because by the time the results would be available conditions generally would have changed.  We hope they will have <Col N="2224" /> changed for the better with the termination of hostilities, but they will certainly have changed, and therefore a survey undertaken now would be very largely a waste of labour.</P>
    <P>We can, I think, contemplate the undertaking of such a survey at some time, but if the results are to be used as a basis for policy, then clearly a time of reasonable stability must be chosen, because otherwise the results would only lead to further speculation and possibly wrong decisions upon policy.  The Government considered the practicability of such a social survey some time ago, but decided deliberately that it was undesirable to undertake it now.</P>

      <P>It was Deputy Byrne suggested it, and perhaps the Deputy might discuss it with him.  I submit that it is undesirable to ask the Government to undertake such a social survey now.  I think it is undesirable to suggest&mdash;it is true that Deputy Byrne did not suggest it, but Deputy McGilligan did&mdash;that the Government has not taken considerable measures for the relief of distress arising during the war.  It is, I think, necessary for the House to appreciate that any further expansion of these transfer payments, these unproductive services, even though they may be necessary to prevent undeserved hardship and avoidable want, nevertheless represents a problem for this community which will not be the least we shall have to tackle when the war is over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have intervened in the debate were it not for the fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce went out of his way to misrepresent the position of the farmer and agricultural worker.  He said that the farmers and agricultural workers were the only people who had benefited by the present emergency.  I do not know on what figures he based that statement, and I do not believe there are any figures available to him on which he could base such a statement. The Minister may have been comparing the increased price of agricultural produce with the increase in the cost of living.  That would be no basis upon which to assert that the farmers' condition had improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The condition of the farmer and the agricultural worker could improve only if there was a substantial increase in prices over the cost of production. The Minister has no figures, nor has the Department of Agriculture ever produced any figures, showing the cost of production in agriculture, and everybody who has any knowledge of agricultural conditions knows that there is no comparison between the cost of living and the cost of production, because the cost of production in agriculture is governed by a number of very important factors, apart from the cost of living. There is, first, the impact upon agriculture of a complete change in our agricultural economy, of a complete <Col N="2226" /> disorganisation of our agricultural system&mdash;a change-over from the production of such commodities as pigs and dairy produce, to a certain extent, to cereals and tillage produce, a change-over involving expense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The net value of agricultural production as estimated by the Statistics Department is in fact published in the Statistical Abstract, that is, the value allowing for the materials purchased and used in production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, by his interruption, shows his complete lack of knowledge of agricultural conditions. Surely he realises that production can be affected by a serious disorganisation, a serious change in systems of production?  Surely he realises that costs of production can be increased by the almost complete absence of fertilisers required in order to produce crops efficiently and to get proper results? Surely agricultural costs are affected by the lack of and difficulty of securing many of the essentials of agricultural production, and, because of that, a comparison between the net value of agricultural produce and the cost of living, or even a comparison between the net value of agricultural production at present and agricultural production in 1938 is of no significance? Enormous difficulties, difficulties which at times appeared to the Department of Agriculture to be insurmountable, faced the farmer, and all these involved costs which are not recorded in the statistics at the disposal of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that this motion serves a useful purpose in calling for a survey of social conditions, a survey that is urgently necessary, even though it riles the Minister to have it suggested at the present time, and I believe that there is no reason why a survey of social conditions should be a prolonged affair, as the Minister suggests, running into many years.  There is no reason why a new approach should not be made to questions affecting the conditions under which our people live.  There is no reason why disinterested people, such as social workers, charitable organisations, <Col N="2227" /> parish councils, the clergy, and such people, should not be approached with a questionnaire by the State and asked to give their estimate or their idea of social conditions in their own parishes or areas.  I think that there is too much of a tendency to rely upon the information or data collected by bureaucrats or officials of the State, and that there ought to be a wider and, if I might suggest it, a more disinterested approach to the matter and a more disinterested survey.</P>
    <P>I agree that social services are costly at the moment, but I think we ought to be able to look forward to a condition of affairs in the post-war period when, first of all, many of the people who are now dependent upon social services may be able to contribute their share to the sum total of national wealth, through some system of training or social organisation, which will enable them to work for themselves and the country.  I think we should envisage a period after the war when our national income, our national wealth, will be increased to such an extent that the comparison between what is being expended on social services and our total national income or national wealth will not be so great.  I feel that the Minister is too much inclined to look upon this question from a narrow, Party point of view, and to compare what he has done with what, perhaps, his predecessors in office did.  That is a view that, I do not think, should be taken at the present time.  Conditions in the world have changed entirely since 1932, and I think that it is our duty to see that by active thought and work it will be a better world in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister rather threw some doubt on the reasonability of putting the early part of Deputy Byrne's motion in the form in which it is, but, in fact, his speech here to-night gave an explanation of what was done to try to prevent the position, about which Deputy Byrne complains, coming about, and although the Minister quotes very large figures and makes a very remarkable comparison with the amount spent on social services and relief at the present <Col N="2228" /> moment in relation to the general productivity of the country, the very fact that the comparison is so striking is all the more reason why the suggestion made in the motion and in the speeches that were delivered should be immediately carried out.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that some consideration has already been given to the carrying out of a social survey but the Government, apparently, have decided that this is the wrong time to carry it out and want to wait until more stable conditions exist.  Why should we have to wait until more stable conditions exist?  The Minister was quite clear in regard to a large number of things affecting the life of the country, such as the increasing of trade, the utilisation of our moneys abroad for the importation of necessaries both for life here and the increase in our production here, but he does not know when we will arrive at a situation when we can have those things.  We have time now to review the situation as it is, as a base line, at any rate, to whatever future conditions we will have, and every day more and more striking facts requiring immediate attention are brought to our notice.  Only this evening, in spite of what the Minister has said here, there is published in the evening papers a report of the City of Dublin School Attendance Committee&mdash;the committee dealing with all the school attendance committees in the city.  The report says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Lack of clothing and footwear for children, resulting from unemployment and low wages prevailing among a section of the community, was responsible for much of the absences from school, especially in the winter months.  The school year revealed a slightly lower percentage in the daily attendance at city schools.  The many difficulties experienced for some years past continued to hamper the operation of the School Attendance Act in the county borough.  These difficulties would not disappear, nor would the desired efficiency be attained until the social system was adjusted to fulfil social needs.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that is, as it were, a throwing <Col N="2229" /> up of hands by the members of the school attendance committee and evidently means that they cannot see any way of dealing with the difficult situation that exists.  When a body, drawn as they are from people in close touch with the economic and social conditions in the country, point out these things to-day and, as it were, throw up their hands about the position, it is a very strong argument why the Government should review whatever decision they have come to with regard to the general situation.  The report goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The school attendance committees had made representations to the Ministers for Local Government and Public Health and Supplies to have clothing and footwear made available to necessitous schoolchildren at prices within reach of the family income.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>According to the statement the Minister made here to-night, that situation has practically been dealt with, but while the situation may be dealt with from the Government point of view, taking a decision to distribute food, clothing and boots, nevertheless that is the situation which the School Attendance Committee finds here, and I think that, in itself, would be sufficient to justify the Minister in reviewing whatever decision the Government have taken with regard to a social survey.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan pointed out certain figures and quotations given here in the appendices and report of the committee inquiring into the housing of the working classes in the City of Dublin.  It really shows the social condition that a very large number of people in the City of Dublin had to face at the start of the emergency situation, and the difficulties that have come on them during the emergency.  The Minister has indicated that, from a review of the situation he has carried out, the unemployed people in the City of Dublin may be regarded under present circumstances as being in no worse condition than they were at the beginning of the emergency; that those who are employed in the City of Dublin can be regarded as being on a standard of 72 per cent., that is, that their economic condition has suffered a reduction <Col N="2230" /> of, say, 25 per cent., in real well-being since the emergency started. If that is the position, I would ask the Minister to refer to the figures that Deputy McGilligan quoted from Appendix No. 17 to paragraph 133, but let him also refer to Appendix No. 23. Appendix No. 23 gives the result of a random examination of 920 families, of two persons or more, taken from this survey, by the Corporation in 1938, and they made an assumption that the essentials of subsistence in food and, I take it, clothing, would require 20/-a week for the first two members of any family and 5/- each for subsequent members of the family.</P>
    <P>I do not know what professional guidance or experience dictated the finding that 20/- could be taken as the cost of essential subsistence for two members of a family, and 5/- for each of the others.  On that assumption they calculated how much would be left amongst the various families, over the amount necessary for essential subsistence, after paying rent and other things required to maintain a home and carry on family life.  They found that in 1938, in the case of 2,754 families, or 30 per cent. of the whole, not one penny would be left over after allowing for essential subsistence to pay the rent, and that in the case of 675 families, or 7.4 per cent. of those examined, the only amount that would be left over with which to pay rent or anything else would be 5/-; that in the case of 788 families, or 8.6 per cent. of the total number, 10/- would be left. That was the 1938 position.  I do not know whether they could be regarded as people working but, according to the Minister's statement, they were almost as well off or, if not working, no worse off.  Paragraph 133 of the report, to which Deputy McGilligan referred, says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...it may be here observed that if we take the usual rent charge for a corporation four-room cottage, about 10/- per week, and if we assume an arbitrary proportion of one-fifth of income for rent, all those receiving under 50/- per week, 55 per cent. of the whole, are unable to pay the rent of a corporation cottage. Even if we allow for those who could be accommodated in a three-roomed <Col N="2231" /> cottage at 7/6 per week, and whose income should be 37/6 on the same basis, we face the fact that 45½ per cent. receive under 40/- per week.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of the total number of families examined at that time, the 10,500 families that Deputy McGilligan spoke of, 55 per cent. would be unable to pay the rent of a corporation cottage.  That is the starting point, and shows that a considerable section of families in Dublin are suffering owing to the emergency. Having suffered as a result of the emergency for five war years, the attitude of the Government is that this is not the right time for a social survey.</P>
    <P>They want to wait until there are stable conditions.  The Minister stated, and we all agree, that we cannot include many ordinary people, or people for whom they have not been able to get employment, without increasing production.  That is quite true.  I do not see how we can sympathetically have increased production in agriculture or in industry without a thorough review of the circumstances. The cost of government has swollen enormously.  Surely some part of the machinery assembled to deal with the present situation, now that it is stabilised by the kind of treatment the Government has given to it, and as war necessities recede, could be diverted to some review of social conditions, where the position is most serious.  The points discussed drive us to do something, whether the arguments are for or against the Minister. Everything that has been stated here, both from the Opposition and the Government benches, should impress upon the House the view that the situation has to be examined thoroughly.  We have it brought home to us in various ways that demands are going to be made by our people as a whole for decent subsistence; that large numbers unable to find employment or security for themselves and their families will be stirred to express <Col N="2232" /> their views and to demand decent subsistence and employment.  Unless we discuss these matters thoroughly in Parliament, have all the necessary facts made available, and face up to our responsibilities by helping to plan for increased production, we are not assisting in government at all, and, so far from being a Government, we are really architects of anarchy because we are the link in this situation.</P>
    <P>When the warring Powers sit down in council to consider the future of peace, and the future production of the world, the heads of the biggest nations must realise that one of the things that have broken down, and that brought about international conditions resulting in war, was the gap between production and consumption.  They are determined, in planning for the future peace, that that gap should be filled one way or another.  To-day, when various countries in Europe are being restored to their people, the question of the reorganisation and reconstruction of Europe is being considered, and nations untouched by war, whose productive capacity is unimpaired, are wondering how they can help.  They are repeating the phrase or formula that the gap between productive power of the world and the consumption necessities of Europe must be bridged.  Whether that formula is a shibboleth, or the background of planning, it has a powerful influence on the minds of people who are in distress either through lack of commodities or of opportunities.  That feeling exists and it will have a powerful influence on those sections who want the necessaries of life and who in particular want hope for the future.  We are the only ones who can come to their assistance, but we cannot do so without full discussion, and planning.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
