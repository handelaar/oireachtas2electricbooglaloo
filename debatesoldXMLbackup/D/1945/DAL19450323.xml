      <P>I expressed my opinion on this amendment last night. I asked the Minister to introduce some clause whereby bookmakers would have an opportunity of appealing from a decision to somebody, and that at least one month's notice should be given to a bookmaker if it was proposed to revoke a course licence.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 22 to 25 deal with the same matter and might be discussed together. Except for No. 24, which falls with No. 22, separate decisions can be taken on each but the one discussion should suffice, seeing that they deal with the same subject matter, namely, the granting of permits to bookmakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The House should appreciate that if we are going to set up a board to take charge of racing, to see that it is properly conducted, and that amenities generally are improved, so that everything will be satisfactory from the public point of view, is it not right that that board should look after bookies to see that they were honourable men, men who would honour their commitments and conduct themselves properly on racecourses?  The body best capable of judging in that respect is the board.  If discretion were to be withdrawn from the board, and if it was to be stated that they should grant permits regardless of the type the applicants might be, then all power of control would be removed from the board, and any type of person could set himself up as a bookmaker provided he had a licence, regardless of his conduct, his honour or his commitments. I think it wise to leave that discretion which I have mentioned in amendment No. 25, with the board.  The amendment provides that the board, in the exercise of its powers under the preceding sub-section, shall not refuse to grant a course betting permit to any licensed bookmaker or suspend a permit except there is grave reason for doing so.  I merely put down that as a result of the debate here and of the <Col N="1698" /> doubt that was expressed that the board might discriminate as between one individual and another.  I am not inclined to argue that to any great extent at all, and I merely wish to insert the safeguard to ensure that, unless an individual commits a grave indiscretion of some sort, the board cannot refuse to issue a permit.  I am certainly opposed to withdrawing from the board any discretionary power in the matter.  I think a discretionary power would be wisely vested in the board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 23 in the name of Deputy Breen and myself was put down for the reason that we felt that there should be some right of appeal from a board of this kind.  In every walk of life there is appeal from such decisions to somebody.  If the Minister would indicate that, on the Report Stage of the Bill he would be prepared to introduce an amendment providing even for a right of appeal to himself, I would be prepared, with the concurrence of my colleague, Deputy Breen, to withdraw the amendment. He might evolve some form of appeal which might suit the case.  I have no objection to the appeal being to the Minister himself.  From the way Deputy Hughes talks on this matter it is clear that he has not attended many race meetings in his life.  One had only to listen to him to know that he was arguing something that is not being thought of at all.  If Deputy Hughes had been at the Baldoyle meeting last week he would have discovered that there were such crowds there that the Total facilities and the supply of bookmakers were quite inadequate.  A great number of people were unable to make any bets at all because they could not get near either the bookmakers or the Tote.  The board may decide at some time to limit the number of bookmakers which would be allowed to attend a race meeting. They could argue under the Bill that they had every justification for doing that by merely saying: &ldquo;We shall have only 20 although there were 40 or 50 attending here before.&rdquo;  There may be no reason at all for that.  On the other hand, if there is a reason, surely to <Col N="1699" /> goodness these men who make their living out of this particular profession, are entitled to have some means of making representations to enable them to continue to make a living?</P>
      <P>As I say, all the amendments deal with the same matter, and I hope the Minister will indicate that on the next Stage of the Bill he will be able to devise some amendment which will enable these men either as a group or as individuals, where they feel they are not being justly treated, to make representations by way of an appeal to himself.  Nobody says that he must uphold their appeal, but at least they will be put in the position that they will have this last court to resort to. If the Minister does feel that the board has been acting hastily, he will then be able to say: &ldquo;Look here, you just cannot do that.&rdquo;  I could speak at great length on this matter, but there are many members of the House who are frequent visitors to racecourses who know the difficulties of one kind or another which confront racegoers.</P>
      <P>They know that what the public want is a day's outing, a bit of sport and opportunity to have a bet now and then.  Deputy Mrs. Redmond and myself are fairly regular racegoers&mdash;at least I was up to recently&mdash;and I think she will agree with me that it is very unpleasant if one wants to have a bet on the Tote to find that before one can get near it, the shutters are pulled down and the horses are off.  Until there are sufficient facilities on the Tote to meet the requirements of the public, there should be no interference with the number of bookies attending a meeting.  We are prepared to withdraw the amendment if the Minister will indicate that he will give it consideration on the next stage and insert some provision which will give these people a right of appeal in regard to whatever grievance they may have from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with some of the remarks of Deputy Briscoe concerning the congestion at racecourses, the lack of Tote facilities, and, in certain cases, the difficulty of getting <Col N="1700" /> in touch with bookmakers.  It is sometimes not easy to approach a number of bookmakers.  Very often, owing to the positions which they occupy owing to the lay-out of the course, it is difficult to walk down to their stands, see the prices, have a bet and get back in time to have a look at the race.  If there is provision, however, for a special appeal for bookmakers and the same right of appeal is not given to horse owners, horse trainers or jockeys from other decisions under the Bill there will be a differentiation in treatment which might lead to a rather unenviable position as between bookmakers and horse owners and trainers. As far as I can gather, the main purpose of the Bill is to have a board which will deal with, amongst other things, the admission of bookmakers to racecourses, the provision of Tote facilities which in the case of big race meetings are invariably inadequate, and the improvement of racecourses so that facilities for egress and otherwise will be increased, etc.  I think that if we give bookmakers a special right of appeal over and above those enjoyed by horse owners, horse trainers and jockeys, we shall alter the main purpose of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I can gather, one of the series of complaints which have been made is that existing facilities are not sufficient.  I think it would be undesirable that bookmakers should have a special right of appeal to the Minister or to the courts which the other sections covered by the Bill will not have. While I agree that it would be undesirable that the board should operate to the disadvantage of an individual bookmaker, as Deputy Fogarty suggested, there is no probability that the board is likely to be biased against bookmakers or bookmaking, any more than against a particular horse trainer or owner.  If we go on the assumption that the board, because they happen to have a whim against a particular individual, are going to operate to the disadvantage of the class of which that individual is a member, then the whole function of the board is bound to be prejudiced. I imagine that the various sections which will be represented on the <Col N="1701" /> board will be prepared to argue the rights of the class to which they belong, and while one individual may have a dispute with another, both these individuals will have their representatives on the board.  The section which represents the bookmakers on the board will have the same facilities for arguing their position as the sections representing horse owners or trainers.  I feel that if the board is to function at all it must have the last word unless you have an interminable right of appeal.  I imagine that not many bookmakers, owners or trainers would welcome the prospect of appealing all these cases with all the cost which that would entail.  Deputy Hughes' amendment might meet the situation although there is difficulty in defining what is a &ldquo;grave reason.&rdquo; It would probably cause a certain amount of trouble to the board.  I am sure that the memebers of the board, particularly when there is amongst them a representative of bookmakers, will not be anxious to operate to the detriment of bookmakers or their assistants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielBreen" hpid="Mr. Breen Mr. Breen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Breen</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that, in the circumstances set out in the amendment which, with Deputy Briscoe, I have tabled, the bookmaker should be entitled to an appeal.  Deputy Cosgrave makes the point that there should be an appeal for jockeys and horse owners and other people, but the bookmaker is in a different category. He is a Government licensee; he holds a licence from the Government and he is in quite a different position.  The jockey holds a licence from the Turf Club or the National Hunt, as the case may be, but the bookmaker is licensed by the Government, and I feel that the last word should be with the Government. I believe if some appeal is not allowed the bookmaker, you are infringing on the citizen's rights. When the Government issue a licence no board or outside body should have the power to say that a person is not a fit and proper person.  That is the reason why I joined with Deputy Briscoe in tabling this amendment. The Minister, I suggest, should give it very careful consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the proposal that there should be an appeal from the decision of the board.  I have been on racecourses on a few occasions.  I backed a few losers.  I am aware of the congestion and I can understand the difficulties.  I feel that if a bookmaker is allotted a bad place on a course, and he resents being offered that bad place, and feeling that somebody has been given priority in the matter of position, he complains and shows bitterness towards the board, there are people who would resent that kind of thing and they might say, because he disagreed with them: &ldquo;Well, there you will stay, because we have control and you will not get out of that place to a better place.&rdquo;  If a man in that position feels aggrieved, if he considers he is not being properly treated by the board, or by any member of the board, who might have some grudge against him and wants to show his authority, that man should have the right of appeal to the Minister or somebody in the Minister's Department or to some district justice.</P>
      <P>I am aware that, in the old days of boards of control, bookmakers had difficulties with those boards and they were brushed aside and badly treated and had to put up with bad places on the rails.  A bookmaker is now more or less an unpaid tax collector.  He is doing work for the Government, collecting taxes for them and, that being so, he ought to have some right of appeal.  The bookmakers are being asked to do what the Tote managers are not asked to do.  The bookmaker has to pay for the admission of his staff.  He brings them into keep his books and to assist in collecting moneys for the Government.  I hope the Minister will carefully consider that point and, perhaps, he will agree that a bookmaker should be allowed to bring his staff in free, the same as the Tote people.  At the moment we are dealing with a proposal that a bookmaker should have an appeal to somebody over the control board.  As an ordinary outsider, who has backed a few losers in his time, I support the idea that the Minister or somebody representing the Government should listen to the man when they have a grievance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1703" />
    <Speaker pid="BridgetMRedmond" hpid="Mrs. Redmond Mrs. Redmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support this amendment.  I believe the bookmaker is entitled to appeal to some sort of court or referee who will decide whether he is being wrongly judged by the board.  It is all very fine for some of us here who may have angelic ideas about this board, but at the same time we must consider that the livelihoods of many men depend on the decision of this board and members of the board may decide against them on important matters affecting their welfare.  For that reason I think the Minister will see the Justice of the argument put up by several speakers, that these men whose livelihoods are directly connected with bookmaking should be given some consideration. Bookmaking is their business and it is as honourable a business as any other, and there are as decent men connected with it as are to be found in any other sphere.</P>
      <P>It is all right to say that there is nothing in this Bill against the bookmaker. If that be so, why is it that there are people who regard this measure as one which has enshrined in it the principle of exterminating bookmakers?  In some quarters it is believed that the intention is to wipe them off the face of the map.  There can be little doubt that bookmakers are part and parcel of racing, that they are really essential to it.  The Minister has given us an assurance that, so far as he is concerned, he will let them carry on their business in the ordinary way.  Nevertheless, there are many of us who believe it can happen that this board may have something against bookmakers, for one reason or another, and in that way it can exterminate them, put them out of business by not granting a licence or by penalising individual bookmakers in one way or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe it is not asking too much to give these men the right of appeal to the Minister.  If that is allowed, I have no fear for them then, because I believe they will get a fair run, a fair crack of the whip, irrespective of politics, creed or Party.  Such a course would be only just and fair to these people.  They are really essential to <Col N="1704" /> racing&mdash;we all agree on that.  Under this Bill the bookmaker will become a tax collector.  We must remember that he is deriving his living directly from the business.  I think any fair-minded and reasonable man will see the justice of our point and will grant those bookmakers just what we are seeking for them&mdash;somebody to appeal to if they feel themselves placed in a wrong position, and that may well occur.</P>
    <P>We have many bookmakers attending the bigger meetings.  There are not so many, perhaps, attending the small meetings in places like Powerstown&mdash;I will not say Tramore, because it is a seaside place and there is a big holiday meeting there&mdash;or Limerick Junction and other such places.  I believe it is quite within the scope of the board to reduce the number of bookmakers at these meetings; in other words, to stamp out the men who, in their opinion, are not just as good as somebody for whom they may have a particular liking, or because they know their names better, although they may have no experience of the men as individuals. We do not want that type of thing to occur and we do not want any grading or any reduction in numbers, unless some of those men of their own accord want to go out of the business. So long as they want to attend these meetings, it is only fair that they will have every right to do so.</P>
    <P>We talk a lot about liberty.  We want on this occasion to protect the rights of the ordinary citizen, whether he be a bookmaker, a punter or anything else.  We want this matter put straight in the Bill.  I support the amendment and I join in the appeal to the Minister to consider this matter carefully, because there is a lot more in it than perhaps meets the eye of the ordinary man in the street.  We can realise that there are fears for the bookmakers and it is not asking too much to give them, No. 1, the right to appeal to the Minister and No. 2, to give these people some sense of security that they will not be victimised, no matter who is on the board, and that they can appeal to someone who will see justice done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>In setting up this board we trust it or we do not trust it.  We appear to trust the board in regard to many things, but not on this particular matter.  The board has power to make grants to executives.  Are we to trust the board in that regard if they make a bigger grant to one executive rather than to another for certain reasons?</P>
      <P>That might appear to some people to be discrimination in favour of one as against the other.  The board will also help breeding, and advances may be made for the purpose of subsidising the breeding of horses, which might also appear to some people to be discrimination. Are we to have a right of appeal in all these cases?  Why should we in this particular case single out one body of people and give them a right of appeal and not give it to other, in my opinion, more important sections?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why should we not give executives a right of appeal to the Minister?  The board will be dealing directly with executives, and, if they are dissatisfied with the conduct of an executive, they can penalise them by withholding grants.  If an executive ploughs back some of its profits into a racecourse, <Col N="1706" /> the board can encourage them by increasing grants, and it could very easily be suggested that there was discrimination there, too.  Executives would have just as good a right and, in my opinion, a better right, to claim a right of appeal to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Great stress was laid on this right of appeal and the point was made that every section of the community has a right to appeal, but I suggest to the Deputies who made the point that, in the case of a man holding a tea or sugar licence from the Minister for Supplies, there is no court of appeal if his licence is revoked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any need for heat in a matter like this because it is really a question of giving an individual his civic rights. I do not quite agree with the argument put up by Deputy Hughes and earlier by Deputy Cosgrave in relation to executives because the Racing Board, as I understand it, will have no control over me as an owner or trainer.  That is a matter for stewards of the meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>They have control over executives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>They have, but it is the stewards of the particular race meeting who have control over me as an owner or trainer.  In such matters as the straight running of horses, the pulling of horses by jockeys and so on, the board have no control.  Apart from all that, this is a question of an individual right and I ask the Minister not to do what he has been asked to do, that is, to take the appeal to himself.  It is quite a simple matter to give a right of appeal either to a district justice or&mdash;this being a rather <Col N="1707" /> important board with a very considerable standing&mdash;to a Circuit Court judge.  These gentlemen on the board are all pretty crusted gentlemen.  They are men of high standing, but when men get on in years they tend to become conservative.  They have a high sense of integrity which they are sometimes inclined to push too far.  In the heat of heavy betting and a rush by racegoers at a race meeting, a bookmaker may say or do something involuntary which he normally would not do or say, and if the attention of the board were drawn to it, that single incident might react adversely on the bookmaker.</P>
      <P>I am not concerned about the bookmakers as such, but with the matter of an individual right, and when we are passing legislation here we should take care to ensure that, where individual rights may be confiscated, the protection of an appeal will be given.  The Minister should look at it in that light and apart from all the other considerations put to him.  Racecourse executives are bodies and not individuals, and it is not their individual rights which are being taken away.  We must keep these things separate and distinct. I urge the Minister not to take the responsibility on himself because it means that they will be standing in lines on the steps in Merrion Street&mdash; Fine Gael Deputies, Labour Deputies and Republican Deputies.  God help the Minister if he has to stand up at the request of bookmakers to listen to all these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a simple matter of legal machinery.  Let the Minister not take the responsibility of hearing this appeal, but let it go to a district justice or to a Circuit Court judge&mdash;I favour the Circuit Court judge because of the importance of the board and of the principle involved.  As I say, things occur at a racecourse which normally would not occur, owing to a rush being made on a bookmaker, and from what I have seen at race meetings, a bookmaker needs to be a man of infinite patience and goodwill to stand up to it all.  A man in those circumstances may do something which is reported and for which he could be <Col N="1708" /> penalised, and I ask the Minister to accept the suggestion of an appeal to a Circuit Court judge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to correct Deputy Hughes's statement with regard to racing executives. Section 39 says that the board, after consultation with the governing bodies, may make regulations governing an executive.  It further makes provision that if a racing executive does not carry out the regulations, all the board can do is to report the fact to the stewards of the governing bodies, and then the stewards will decide the matter.  If bookmakers had some person outside the board to decide grievances, they would be satisfied, as in the case of racing executives.</P>

      <P>There is no heat so far as I am concerned.  He introduced a new note into the discussion of a Bill which everybody has approached from the angle of getting the best results. I should like to know who confirmed for Deputy Hughes his own opinion of himself on anything.  Deputy Hughes said it was cheek on my part to disagree with him and then he implied something to which I strenuously object&mdash;that he has a better knowledge of national matters than I.  That is something which I throw back at the Deputy.  I never heard of Deputy Hughes being in any national affairs in the past when it was necessary to be national.</P>

      <P>The Deputy confuses everything.  Deputy Mrs. Redmond and those of us who support these amendments for the purpose of getting something from the Minister realise what <Col N="1709" /> the position is.  A person connected with the Totalisator Board and a member of the Racing Commission told me that it was his hope that this Bill would bring about the complete elimination of bookmakers as a profession. That man is a Senator, a member of the Oireachtas.  If that is the position, it is up to those of us who feel that danger exists to make some provision, as Deputy McMenamin says, to ensure that the ordinary rights of an individual will not be filched away because of any confusion or misunderstanding of the situation.</P>
      <P>All that we want is that there shall be the right of appeal to somebody, somehow or somewhere so as to guarantee that what none of us wants to see happen will not happen.  There are many ways in which that can be brought about.  Deputy Mrs. Redmond has indicated some, and I and other Deputies have given our views.  Deputy Breen has pointed out that, in this matter, we are dealing with people who are licensed by the State to carry on business.  They pay a substanial fee of £10.  Having done so, and having, as Deputy P.J. Fogarty has said, passed the personal fitness test, they are liable to be told by somebody that they cannot make their living here or anywhere else.  That is the position that we are trying to correct. I hope the Minister will indicate, if these amendments are withdrawn, that he will be able to find some way of meeting the situation.  The bookmakers are in an entirely different position from almost all others who are going to be affected by this Bill.  It is well to remind Deputy Hughes that practically all other sections such as horse breeders, horse owners, racing executives, etc., will be beneficiaries under the Bill.  Whatever profits accrue from the levy on bookmakers will be shared by all these classes.  The bookmakers and the public are the people who are going to pay, and the bookmakers are to get no consideration and no protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to certain aspects of this matter on the Second Reading of the Bill.  I believe that there will eventually arise a legal conflict <Col N="1710" /> between the position created under this measure and the position that obtains under the Totalisator Act. Under that Act, where the Tote is operated on a particular course, the racing executive is bound by law to provide standing accommodation for the bookmaker.  Under this Bill you are giving the Racing Board an absolute discretion to refuse a particular bookmaker admission to a course.  I can quite visualise a situation arising where this matter will be tested and, perhaps, taken to the Supreme Court.  I think that now is the time to solve the difficulty.  I do not suggest that this amendment solves it, but at least it gives the bookmaker a reasonable method of ventilating his grievance if he is refused admission.</P>
      <P>On the Second Reading of the Bill I put it to the Minister that he should examine the position, as I have indicated it, under the Totalisator Act and the position which will obtain under this Bill.  If, under the Totalisator Act, you say to a racecourse executive that it must set up standing accommodation for the bookmaker, and if under this Bill you say to a certain board that you are going to give it the right to refuse admission to a particular bookmaker, there is an obvious conflict of interest, and who is to decide which shall prevail?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A second point is that under this Bill we are giving racing executives the right to run the Tote on racecourses. The Totalisator, therefore, will, as it were, be operated for the benefit of race executives, and it will be to their interest to divert all possible betting to the Tote almost to the exclusion of the bookmaker.  It will, naturally, be to the interest of the race executive to do that where they set up the Tote under this Bill.  There, again, you will have a conflict of interest which, I think, should be reconciled now.  There is a third point, and it is that two different bodies, the Racing Commission and the commission which examined the question of horse breeding, both made a unanimous recommendation to the Government that bookmakers should be abolished.  They went so far as to <Col N="1711" /> say that no new licences should be issued, and that the bookmaker should, more or less, disappear automatically. The feeling is that the personnel of this new board is likely to be drawn from among the gentlemen who made these recommendations.  Therefore the fears expressed here are, I think, well founded in fact and in law.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I think, should seriously consider giving the right of appeal to the bookmaker who is refused a permit to appear on a racecourse. That right of appeal might be given to the District Court.  It would provide a ready and a cheap method of appeal.  Deputy P.J. Fogarty would seem to favour the idea of having an itinerant justice on every racecourse so that appeals could be heard on the spot and that the bookmakers would be able to carry on their work.  Somehow I do not think that would work.</P>
    <P>I think that if the right of appeal were given to the District Court it would get over the difficulty and ease the fears which so many people entertain on this matter.  The only other alternative would be for the Minister to give himself a sort of appellant power so that he could exercise a discretion or some supervisory function over the board.  He might not like to undertake a position of that sort.  At any rate, the right of appeal should be given to a man who has been refused a permit for a racecourse.  In my opinion, he should also get some notice in advance, since the refusal to grant a permit means that he is going to be deprived, to a large extent, of his means of livelihood.  Many of those men who bet on racecourses have not registered offices.  If such a man is refused a permit to a course you strike at once at his main means of livelihood. For these reasons, I hope the Minister will give serious consideration to the amendment, and that, if he is not able to accept it, he will on a later stage of the Bill introduce an amendment himself giving the right of appeal to a bookmaker who has been refused a permit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard these <Col N="1712" /> sections which give full disciplinary powers to the Racing Board as fundamental to the Bill.  That statement should help to clear the ground.  I cannot accept any amendment which would modify, or lessen in any degree, the full disciplinary powers of the board over all the matters entrusted to it.  None of these amendments proposing to give the right of appeal to a board, or to the Minister, would be workable.  Since the Second Reading of the Bill I have given a good deal of consideration to the arguments put forward from Deputies on all sides of the House as to the necessity for securing that the rights of individual bookmakers &mdash; their rights were stressed&mdash;and others should be safeguarded.  I cannot see the board revoking a permit to a bookmaker except for good and sufficient reasons. I cannot see that happening.  I hope to get a board of reasonable and sensible men.  I have no set notion now as to who are likely to be on the board.  I am not able to say that.  I do not think that, even if you had on the board the most violent and extreme opponent of bookmakers, he would press his views on the board, especially in view of the fact that the feelings of members of the House on the question of the abolition of bookmakers are now so well known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If he did and if the board were foolish enough to be influenced by one strong personality so as to act in the way described by Deputy Fogarty and other Deputies with a view to getting rid of bookmakers, then I remind the House that the Oireachtas will be still here and that this legislation will not last for all time.  We are here to safeguard the rights of every individual in the State, subject to the law.  We are all restricted in some way or other by the law.  I do not know much about racecourses, race meetings or &ldquo;bookies,&rdquo; but I have heard that the bookmaker adds considerably to the enjoyment of a day's racing.  Those who are interested in racing here do not favour the elimination of the bookmaker. Though a number of people closely connected with bodies which discussed this question in the remote <Col N="1713" /> and recent past held the view that the Tote should be the only permitted method of betting, that view has not prevailed and there is no suggestion in this Bill that bookmakers should be either eliminated or reduced in number.</P>
    <P>As regards the difficulties attending appeals, I think that there is a good deal in what Deputy McMenamin said, that a Minister's life would be made very difficult if he were to agree to act as judge in disputes between individuals and the Racing Board, whether the individuals were bookmakers or others.  If the Minister were foolish enough to accept that onerous responsibility, he might be able to give a fairly quick decision.  But consider the time that would be taken in coming to a decision in a dispute between a bookmaker or another citizen and the Racing Board if an appeal to the courts were allowed.  It might take six months.  The law's delays are proverbial. What is to happen to the bookmaker in the meantime?  Is he to be subject to mandamus, so that he is not to resort to a course until this question of law is decided?  He might be out of business for six or nine months.  I do not think that those who want an appeal board would like that to happen.</P>

      <P>I hope to get reasonable, sensible men on the board, including a representative of the bookmakers. If they are unreasonable and act unjustly, I am sure the Dáil will not stand for it.  The Dáil will not stand for injustice by that board to individual citizens any more than it will stand for injustice by any other body to any other citizen.  In my opinion, the difficulty, so far as the bookmakers and the board are concerned, will arise on the question of the levy.  I do not see any insurmountable difficulties arising on any other <Col N="1714" /> question.  On the question of the levy, the board must have power to act strictly and quickly.  I met deputations of bookmakers a few years ago when there was a question of imposing additional taxation and I met one such deputation in connection with this Bill. They were decent citizens, as respectable and law-abiding as any other class of the community.  Why are we to assume that there will be trouble between them and the Racing Board, that they will not obey the law or the regulations?  I do not accept that.  I say that they are as law-abiding as any other section.  If the Dáil passes this Bill and if the obligation of collecting the levy be placed upon the bookmakers, I am sure they will obey the law.  Of course, respectable citizens are sometimes led into evasion of the law.  The courts are chock-full of such cases at present.  That might happen here and the quickest way of settling the matter, in the interests of all parties, is to leave it to the Racing Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>They will settle the question immediately.  You are more likely to get proper recognition of the power of the law in that way.  Deputy Fogarty wants to get the matter settled in the same way as a dispute on the winning of a race is settled&mdash;by the stewards&mdash;I think that it could be settled just as quickly by leaving it to the Racing Board.  If that is accepted by everybody, I think that it will work smoothly.  If there is an appeal, and a long period between the dispute and the decision, we are in for infinite trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Coogan's point, I do not think that there will be any conflict between the Totalisator Act and the present Bill when it becomes an Act.  I am informed&mdash;the Deputy knows this better than I do&mdash;that it is an established principle in law that the later Act governs the former.  Though there may appear on the surface to be a certain conflict between the two pieces of legislation, what we are passing <Col N="1715" /> here will be the real authority until new legislation be passed.  Therefore the conflict the Deputy has in mind is not likely to arise.  I say to the House and to those who feel strongly on this matter, as some of my colleagues do, and as Deputy Mrs. Redmond does, that we should trust the board and give it a trial.  I think that we can, with confidence, depend upon those men being not only just but reasonable, because justice is sometimes harsh.  If they do not turn out to be just and reasonable, then they are appointed at short intervals and can be changed. The Dáil will be here to make recommendations and the Minister will be here to listen to them.  If he is a sensible and reasonable man&mdash;as I hope I am&mdash;he will give serious consideration to any representations made to him regarding unjust action by the board.</P>
    <P>I should be prepared to go a certain distance to meet the House.  I am not prepared to act as an appeal board. I am not prepared to take on the job of deciding every day between the board and citizens of any class who feel they have a grievance.  If anybody, whether or not he is interested in racing, felt that a serious injustice had been done by the Racing Board, I would certainly ask the chairman of the Racing Board to come to see me and to discuss the matter.  It will want to be a serious injustice and substantiated as such.  I would certainly be prepared to do that but I would refuse to be drawn into being an appeal officer or to sit in judgment on the board in respect of every tittle-tattle of gossip and suspicion that might be raised against their decisions or actions.  But, if it was a question of a serious injustice against a bookmaker or any other citizen who attends a race meeting or who is interested in horse breeding, and if he thought he was unjustly treated and was able to state in writing, in clear language, the charges and the grounds on which he believed he had a serious grievance, then I certainly would ask the chairman to come to see me.  I hope I am not suggesting that I will ever act as an appeal board <Col N="1716" /> or a peacemaker, in that sense, between all the people who might think they had grievances and the board but, certainly, if there was grave injustice proved, I would ask the chairman to see me and I would ask him to hear the other side of the question.  That is as far as I think the Dáil could ask me to go in this case.  I want to say that I do not believe that there is any solid ground under the fears that this board will act unjustly, improperly or unfairly although I do not know what the composition of the board will be.  It will be left to me to pick the board and I will try, as one human being with limited powers, to get a board that will act as this House would like it to act.</P>

      <P>If we could feel sure that the Minister was not likely to be a candidate in the forthcoming Presidential election and if we could feel sure that he was not likely to occupy the exalted position of President later in the year, I think we could take a good deal of the assurances which he has given as a guarantee that there would be no injustice so far as bookmakers are concerned, but it is an unusual type of legislation which takes the form of &ldquo;trust the Minister; do not provide an appeal where there is any injustice inflicted.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that, and they should put out of business some of the places which are masquerading as hotels.  But the bookmakers approach this Bill in an entirely different way. <Col N="1717" /> They are suspicious as to the purpose of the Bill.  They think there is some ulterior motive behind it, calculated to reduce substantially the number of bookmakers and generally to attenuate their number.  If the Minister will advert for a moment to developments in mechanical betting in recent years he will see that there are some grounds for the bookmakers' fears in the matter.  The Minister has disavowed any intention of levying war on the bookmakers.  He has told us that so far as the board is concerned he will endeavour to select reasonable people who will administer this matter in the way the ordinary citizen would desire it to be administered.  These are commendable intentions, but I think the Minister could reasonably meet the claims of the bookmakers in this matter by providing them with an appeal board of some kind.  A long process of law is of no use to the bookmaker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An appeal to the Minister has obvious disadvantages because appeals of that kind are probably not the kind of appeals that can be decided in any impartial or judicial manner because political pressure would swing the Minister in one direction or another. When the fate of a political Party in a particular area might be involved, the Minister, being a politician, naturally would say: &ldquo;I would like to keep this fellow off the course but the Cumann says it cannot be done and therefore it cannot be done&rdquo;.  That is just a natural kind of thing.  I suggest that the Minister has an easy way out of this matter.  The bookmakers want to be reasonable.  They want an appeal against the decisions of the board.  Would it not be possible to constitute an appeal tribunal consisting, say, of three members, one to be a representative of the bookmakers, another to be any member of the board and a chairman who would be agreed on by the bookmakers and the board?  If you have a representative of the bookmakers and a representative of the board that seeks to deny the bookmaker the course permit, you ensure that a case for and against is likely to be put up and if the bookmakers and the board can agree on a chairman, then you get a situation in <Col N="1718" /> which the bookmakers and the board are prepared to accept the tribunal as one which can be relied upon fairly to adjudicate between the parties.  I put it to the Minister that he ought to go a long way to relieve the fears of the bookmakers in this matter.  A simple tribunal of that kind, composed of three people, representing the bookmakers and the board, with a chairman acceptable to both sides, is an easy, convenient, expeditious and inexpensive way of deciding a dispute of this kind.  I put that suggestion to the Minister and perhaps he would examine the matter between now and Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will be adamant in adhering to the decision he has made.  While I admit that the bookmakers, like other sections of people interested in this Bill, have some fears that certain sections will operate against them, I do not see any reason why special provisions should be made governing the position of bookmakers that are not made in respect of other sections of the community.  Unless the complexion of the board is completely changed&mdash;I hope it will not be, and I have faith enough in the Minister to believe that he will select the best men possible&mdash; unless the board is completely different from the board that has governed racing as long as I remember, and longer, I cannot conceive the things happening that people are afraid of. It has been the recognised practice of sportsmen generally, whatever part they play in racing, whether they are owners, jockeys, bookmakers or anybody else, to accept the verdict of the existing board that governs racing.  As far as I know, it has been very rare to have a case taken to the courts in respect of their decisions.  It would not be good for racing that that should happen.  It would not be to the honour of the sport if these verdicts were to be frequently brought on appeal to an appeal board, whether it was a court or any other form of appeal.  The verdict <Col N="1719" /> of the governing body of racing in this country and in England has always been accepted wholeheartedly by sportsmen.  Some of the victims may not have liked it&mdash;nobody likes to have a penalty imposed upon him&mdash;but the verdicts generally have been accepted by sportsmen in a good spirit.  It is felt that the less publicity that is given to these cases between sportsmen, whether in courts or anywhere else, the better it will be.  I hope that the present conditions will continue.  Unless the constitution of the board is to be vastly different from that which operated in the past, I do not believe that any of the things feared will happen.  I have faith enough in the Minister to believe that, in addition to the members of the Turf Club and the N.H.S.C., the men he will nominate to the board will be men of at least as good integrity as the members of the Turf Club and the members of N.H.S.C. and that we will have a board whose decisions will be respected.  That is one of the two things about which I did not see eye to eye with other Deputies.</P>
      <P>The other was the constitution of the board.  I felt that if any difficulty arose it would be in connection with the constitution of the board.  That is why on the Second Reading I appealed as strongly as I could to the Minister to see that every section of the people would be represented on the board. That appeal was made generally.  If that is done, and I believe the Minister will make every effort to see that it is done, then I think we would be well advised to leave the question of disciplinary action by the board to remain as it is.  Whether it is a warning-off sentence on an offending racehorse owner or a jockey or a bookmaker I feel that it will be accepted in the same sportsmanlike spirit with which it has been accepted in this and other countries for over a century.</P>

      <P>The Minister takes power in this Bill to make it operative as from a certain date.  Then a situation will arise in which a bookmaker has not merely to get an ordinary betting licence but a course-betting permit as well.  I should like to ascertain from the Minister if it is the intention of the board, or if it is his intention to request the board, to issue automatically without any investigation permits for course betting to existing bookmakers.  The Minister ought to give the House an assurance that every existing bookmaker will automatically get from the new board a permit to operate on the course and that there will not be any preliminary investigation as to the qualifications or otherwise of the bookmaker.  Obviously the board could not have reasonable cause to complain against any bookmaker.  If the board is appointed on a Monday, there may be a race meeting on the Tuesday.  I therefore take it that the Minister will give an assurance that existing bookmakers will, at all events, be entitled to operate on the course immediately.  If the question of refusing to issue a course-betting permit arises, that will only arise subsequently and then only in a case of proven misconduct.  The Minister should, therefore, give an assurance that all existing bookmakers will get permits to operate immediately the board is set up and that there will be no preliminary &ldquo;vetting&rdquo; of the bookmakers.</P>

If I attempted to give an instruction to the board, they would probably not take it; they could tell me to mind my own business.  I would not put myself in that position.  I think what Deputy Norton and Deputy Briscoe have in mind is quite reasonable and proper. I hope the board will be reasonable men and will not look for trouble.  I hope they will not have any reason to put any of these men who go on the course off the course.  I think it was Deputy Briscoe mentioned the trouble and difficulty that arose at Baldoyle recently.  I was told by one or two people that considerable difficulty and confusion arose at Baldoyle because of the unusual crowd that attended there.

      <P>It is a matter of estimate and we are going, to some extent, on previous experience.  When the revenue duty on course betting was in operation from 1926 to 1931, the rate was 2½ per cent. and the gross proceeds were in the region of £50,000. It is likely that that would yield somewhat <Col N="1725" /> more now, but the Racing Board will be under considerable expense in the collection of levy.  In the circumstances, probably a rate of 2½ per cent. would not provide an adequate income to allow them to carry on in a satisfactory manner the functions assigned to them under the Bill.  It is possible that the Board will not fix a rate as high as 5 per cent., which is the maximum figure under the Bill.  They may not fix 5 per cent. in the first instance but, as I said on the Second Reading debate, it would probably be easier for the board to start off, under the present moderately prosperous conditions of racing, with a levy of 5 per cent. and reduce it subsequently to 2½ per cent.  They could start high and come down later, rather than have to push it up later if the prosperous conditions did not continue.</P>

Can he give any indication now, or will he insert an amendment on the Report Stage, saying whether the levy will be dropped when the sum of £100,000 has been raised?

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 32:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 35, to delete the words &ldquo;or believed by such authorised officer to relate&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I move this amendment for the protection of the bookmaker.  It is stated definitely in the Bill that any document can be taken from the bookmaker and searched and may be taken away by the inspector.  I think that is all wrong and may mean taking a man's private documents from him, perhaps including documents which have nothing whatever to do with the racing or betting transactions in regard to which the tax is collected.</P>
      <P>I think that that line, &ldquo;or believed by such authorised officer to relate,&rdquo; should be deleted.  I shall quote the sub-section in full, which is  follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  An authorised officer of the board may (subject to the production by him if so required of his authority <Col N="1727" /> in writing as such authorised officer) at any time enter any premises in which the business of bookmaking is carried on and there search for, inspect and take copies of or extracts from any documents there found relating or believed by such authorised officer to relate to course bets entered into by the person engaged in the said business and may require any person found in such premises to produce all documents in such premises relating to such course bets.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that this is just a matter of amendment.  My point is that such an officer, who might be prejudiced, can, under the section as it stands, possibly frame up something in his mind against a bookmaker and take away documents which have nothing at all to do with betting transactions.  There is no objection to the inspection of documents relating to betting transactions&mdash;documents which the official is supposed to inspect&mdash;but as the section stands now, it could happen that the official concerned might imagine that any document in the possession of the bookmaker had some relation to betting transactions, and could take such a document away. I think that the matter could be solved by taking out that line, and I am sure the Minister sees that the section, as it stands, might be the cause of an injustice to a man carrying on a legitimate business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this amendment.  It is not contended that these men should not be given extensive rights to carry out their duties, but their success depends upon their efficiency, and if an inspector cannot distinguish as to whether a document relates to betting or not, then he is incompetent, unfitted for his job, and should not be in that position. This section gives an inspector power to inspect any private documents that he desires to inspect and take them away with him.  I referred last night to certain things that have been done under the Emergency Powers Act which this House gave to the Government in connection with the matter of <Col N="1728" /> supplies in this country.  Most atrocious things have been done by certain inspectors in connection with the matter of supplies.  I do not say that they have been generally done, but they have been done.  For instance, in this country, if a private house is attached to business premises, there have been cases where the officials having searched the business part of the house, then went into the private part of the premises, tore open and searched wardrobes, and so on.  We must put an end to that kind of performance. I read in yesterday's <i>Irish Times</i> of a case down in Monaghan where certain officers of the law, named there in, took a prisoner, ill-treated him in the barracks, and endeavoured to put aside the evidence altogether.  The medical evidence in the case was outrageous, to say the least of it, and the detective named therein stated that he had power under the Emergency Powers Act to take the course he did in abusing the detained man.  This thing is getting a hold on everybody who is made an inspector or an official in connection with these various measures.  They seem to feel that they are given arbitrary and absolute powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that Deputy Mrs. Redmond's amendment is fair and reasonable.  It does not restrict the power of an officer, who knows his duty, to take away documents that are definitely relating to betting transactions.  There should be no question of suspicion in such a case.  If the inspector does not know whether the document relates to a betting transaction or not, then he is incompetent and should not be in that position, and this House should declare so.  I understand that the people referred to in this section are not office bookmakers; that is to say, that they are course bookmakers and, therefore, their offices would be in a private house.  It is not right, in such circumstances, to give permission to some inspector appointed by the board to enter a private house in this way. The board might consider the man, when he was up for appointment before them, to be a competent man, but he might have certain pecularities as an individual that would not betray <Col N="1729" /> themselves when the members of the board were examining him.  It might be possible that an inspector might have something against a particular bookmaker, would ransack his house and turn it upside down, merely because of something that he had against the bookmaker.  I think we should take very strict precautions to prevent such things happening, and to ensure that whatever inspector may be appointed will be a competent man and who will know the difference between a document relating to a betting transaction and an ordinary private document.  He should not be given power to rampage around, ransack a house, and examine private papers that he may find in the man's house.  Such papers might be the property of the man's wife or some other member of his family.  Perhaps there might be a reference to betting in a private letter by way of a joke, or something like that.  If the section is left as it stands, all those private papers could be examined and taken away as a result of the ransacking of the house.  I say that it is unfair and unjust to give these powers, seeing what has already taken place under the powers given to officials under the Emergency Powers Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment.  I think that the powers conferred here are rather drastic, having regard to the fact that they are being conferred on a private individual appointed by the Racing Board and not upon a State official in uniform.  Furthermore, you give this right of entry without the protection of a search warrant or a written authority or anything like that.  The official can enter the premises at any time.  There is no question as to whether his right of entry is within business hours or not, and I can see considerable difficulty arising if the section is allowed to go through in its present form.  The section says that any authorised officer of the board may enter any premises in which the business of bookmaking is carried on. I take that to mean that he may not only enter registered premises in which the business of bookmaking is <Col N="1730" /> carried on, but also a private dwelling-house.  Let me put it in this way.  Take the case of a course betting man who has no registered premises and who is in the habit of running credit accounts with his clients.  After a race meeting he, naturally, brings his documents and books home to his private house and keeps them there, and he will have the week-end in which to make up his accounts and send them to his clients.  In law, he will be referred to as carrying on the business of bookmaking in his private house, therefore, and it would seem that an inspector, without any search warrant or written authorisation of any kind, except his own document of identity, may, at any time of the day or night, approach and enter those premises and proceed to ransack them in search of evidence of betting.  I think that these are very drastic powers to give to the employee of a private board, which is not a State institution&mdash;an employee who is not a State official.  I could quite conceive such powers being granted if there were a suspicion that irregularities were occurring, that the levy was being evaded, or that proper entries were not being made in the books and so on.  I can quite see a position, in such a case, under which officers of the board could be given authority to search, but in this case they are given <i>carte blanche</i> to enter, at any time of the day or night, and ransack the premises of a particular individual.  These are powers that we should not give lightly to the board, and I suggest that, perhaps, the Minister would reconsider this matter on the Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the amendment.  When I was speaking on another amendment I said that I did not see why bookmakers should not get the same treatment as other people get, and I say so still, but this is a departure from the ordinary practice of racing.  I do not think it is the intention to depart very much from the powers that already existed under National Hunt Club rules, and I never heard that they had any intention or power of entering a bookmaker's office outside a racecourse.  It would be <Col N="1731" /> rather dangerous if they should have such power.  The object of this Bill is to improve and to govern racing and we ought to leave it at that.  We should not make it possible to investigate offences committed outside a racecourse.  If a bookmaker commits an offence on a racecourse, the board can penalise him.  If there was suspicion that a bookmaker was not paying the tax, his racing book could be demanded by an inspector.  The Government can ascertain whether the tax is paid or not.  The proposal here would give power not only over a bookmaker operating on the course but over all bookmakers.  There would be nothing to prevent officials walking into an office in Dublin, the owner of which never went on a racecourse, to inquire if tax had been paid, and demanding the books.  I endorse the proposal in the amendment.  I believe this section should not be in the Bill at all, as such power should not be given over people operating outside racecourses.</P>

      <P>Is not that enough?  I think the power may be necessary.  I hope it will never have to be used.  It can only be used on the business premises.  I want that to <Col N="1732" /> be clearly understood and underlined, &ldquo;the business premises,&rdquo; because questions were asked about it by people who thought otherwise.  It was mentioned to me by a deputation that under that section anybody could walk into a bookmaker's private residence and search any papers or documents. I went to great trouble to try to have that power investigated and I got the best legal advice on the matter. This section provides for the inspection of bookmakers' documents at their business premises.  Since the only premises at which betting may legally be carried on are premises licensed under the Betting Act, 1931, it follows that it will not be permissible for officers of the board to enter the private residences of bookmakers, even where the bookmakers have no registered premises and carry on course betting only.  In such a case the bookmaker is deemed to carry on his business on the racecourse and not at his private residence.</P>

      <P>This section states that an authorised officer may require a person engaged in or carrying on the business of bookmaker to produce and to permit him to inspect and to take copies of, or extracts from, any documents then in that person's possession.  I think that is going too far.  I suggest that we should delete the words &ldquo;in that person's possession.&rdquo;  Otherwise an inspector could go in and demand to see documents whether they appertained to betting or not and take them away.  Why should a bookmaker be put into the horrible position of having his private affairs inspected?  He has not committed any offence.  Why should such power be given to an inspector?  It is going too far to allow any inspector to take copies of private documents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 37 in my name reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>After Section 39 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  On receipt of a complaint from a trade union representing the employees of a racing establishment or of the employees of an executive of an authorised racecourse that the rates of wages paid to such employees or the conditions of their employment are unsatisfactory the board shall cause an inquiry to be held concerning the facts of such complaint and the board are hereby authorised to take such steps as may to them seem proper for the purpose of instituting such inquiry and securing the attendance thereat of witnesses and the production of documents.</P>
      <P>(2)  On the conclusion of the inquiry mentioned in the next preceding sub-section of this section the board shall make and transmit to the proprietor of the racing establishment concerned in such inquiry or the executive of the authorised racecourse, as the case may be, a recommendation in such form as may to them seem proper relating to the matters inquired into.</P>
      <P>(3)  If the proprietor of the racing establishment or the executive of the authorised racecourse to whom the recommendation mentioned in this section is addressed fails to give effect to such recommendation within a reasonable time it shall be competent for the board&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  in the case of the proprietor of a racing establishment to exclude from every racecourse in respect of which the board exercises <Col N="1736" /> jurisdiction until the terms of the recommendation have been complied with, any horse owned, trained or entered as a competitor by such proprietor, or</P>
    <P>(b)  in any other case, to prohibit until the terms of the recommendation are complied with the holding or promoting of a race meeting on any racecourse owned, leased or operated by the executive aforesaid.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment makes a somewhat different approach to the problem to that which is apparently made under amendment No. 36.  Amendment No. 36 seeks to give the board power, without representations from anybody, to fix certain standards and conditions. If existing standards or conditions were considered unsuitable the board would have power to vary these standards, upwards we hope, but downwards, if they so decided. Amendment 37 approaches the problem in a different way.  It sets out that on the receipt of a complaint from a trade union representing the employees of a racing establishment or of the employees of an executive of an authorised racecourse, that the rates of wages or conditions of employment are unsatisfactory, the board shall do certain things.  We are setting up a board which has very wide powers, as indicated in the Title to the Bill.  When we come to make a detailed examination of the powers of the board and the utilisation of its funds&mdash;these are set out very comprehensively in Section 15 of the Bill&mdash; we find that the board is entitled to use its funds for the purpose of increasing stake money and prizes at horse racing, to reduce entrance fees and similar charges in respect of horse races, to assist in the carriage of horses to race meetings, to reduce charges for admission to members of the public, to improve racecourses, and to do anything else which is conducive to the breeding of horses or the development of an export trade in horses.  That is a wide field of activity, but it does not exhaust the powers of the board or the spheres of activity in which they can engage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1737" /> All that industry, described under the umbrella description of horse racing, is carried on by human beings. Many of them are wealthy people. Many racegoers are wealthy people, many owners and bookmakers are very wealthy, and so are many punters, but there is another class engaged in that industry&mdash;stable boys, men who work around the racing stables, and apprentices who, in many cases, are really stable lads.  Quite a considerable number of those who enter as apprentices ultimately fall back to become ordinary stable lads and, as I said on the Second Reading of the Bill, very few ever reach noteworthy eminence as jockeys.  Some do come to the fore, but the number of persons who enter the industry as apprentices and become jockeys is not alarmingly high.  Quite a considerable number who enter as apprentices never reach the jockey stage at all.  I should like the Minister to note that the working conditions of these stable lads and apprentices are generally bad.  I quoted a case recently where a certain judge refused to convict an apprentice for having broken his indenture of apprenticeship when he heard that the boy was being paid only 3/6 per week. He was being maintained in a racing establishment, but maintenance in a racing establishment is not that which is provided in a luxurious hotel.  There is a difference between it and that of the Gresham Hotel for instance.  To pay a lad 3/6 a week and maintain him in a racing establishment is to make sure that the lad is never going to be wealthy.</P>
    <P>I think these workers have very substantial grounds of complaint.  Their conditions are a reflection on the whole racing industry.  At one time these lads were unorganised and it is to the credit of trade union organisation that they have been able to improve their conditions somewhat.  While I very gladly pay tribute to the reforms effected for them by trade union action and by sympathetic public agitation generally, not even a trade union desiring to make the best case for its own activities, would attempt to say that the conditions of stable lads and employees of racing stables generally, are anything like satisfactory.  If we <Col N="1738" /> are going to give this board wide powers and if the community is going to be taxed, so as to give the board approximately £150,000 annually, I think we ought to put on the board an obligation to clean up, as far as it can, that wretched aspect of the racing industry in this country&mdash;the exploitation of stable lads and apprentices, the payment of low wages to them and the imposition on them of conditions of employment which are anything but fair or decent.</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 37, I want to put an obligation on the board to effect as far as it can a reformation and radical improvement in the conditions under which persons are employed in the racing stables.  The amendment seeks to approach the problem in this way: that it should be possible for the board on the receipt of a complaint or a representation from a trade union representing the employees of a racing establishment or of an executive of an authorised racecourse, to institute an inquiry into the facts of the complaint, at which they will be entitled to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents.  The amendment seeks to empower the board after examining the matter to make a recommendation in such a form as may seem proper to them relating to the matters inquired into with a view to effecting the necessary remedial action.  The remaining section of the amendment provides that certain penalties may be inflicted on either the racehorse owner or the racecourse executive who refuses to comply with a recommendation of the board.  I think the amendment proposes to give the board very reasonable powers.  It says to the board: &ldquo;If you should get a complaint from a trade union, representative of the employees in the racing industry, in a matter in which you are vitally interested, you should investigate that complaint.  You should approach it in a reasonable manner and if, having examined the facts and heard the representatives of the employees on the one hand and the representatives of the training establishments and the racecourse executives on the other, you should make a reasonable recommendation, you are entitled to assume, having regard to <Col N="1739" /> the assistance which you give to the industry that that recommendation will be accepted and respected by those concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The amendment goes on to say that if, however, after you have made, as reasonable men, a recommendation to improve the matters complained of, either the racing establishment, on the one hand, or the racing executive, on the other hand, will not do as you ask them, you are entitled to impose certain penalties, which are set out in the amendment, until such time as they do what you request.  I am sure the Minister does not like to see racing conducted on the basis where you have on the one hand, a fairly wealthy section of the people and, on the other hand, a number of exploited stable lads and apprentices.  The object of the amendment is to ensure that that end of the industry will be lifted up and, if we are to have a national racing industry and blood-stock which will be the envy of many other countries, we should at least ensure at the same time that that industry is not conducted on the basis of exploiting one unfortunate section of the people who are associated with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to accept either of these amendments. We have not given power, and we do not propose anywhere in the Bill to give power, to the board to interfere with the management of racing stables. With all respect, I think it would be going outside what we had in mind in setting out the Long Title.  I am glad to learn from Deputy Norton that there have been reforms already effected, through trade union action or otherwise&mdash;reforms of the matters that he complains of in relation to racing stables.  I am glad to hear that and I hope there will be such other reforms as may be necessary to provide that in all sections of the racing industry, in particular the ones that Deputy Norton describes, where there are very bad conditions of living, they will disappear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the trainers' establishments will share in the general <Col N="1740" /> improvement that, I trust, will result from this effort to organise and put on a more prosperous basis the whole racing industry.  I hope the trainers' establishments and their staffs, the apprentices and stable lads and all concerned will share in the general prosperity.  It should be realised that without these workers, these stable lads and apprentices, there could be no racing industry, and they ought to be reasonably and properly treated by their employers.  I am sure that is so in many cases.  I am not well acquainted with the industry, but I think that numbers of these people who are interested in racing are very good citizens, that they have a proper human outlook, and I am sure in many of these racing establishments proper provision is made for stable lads and apprentices.  At any rate, I hope that is so.  Where it is not so, I hope that organised bodies, and the stable lads and apprentices and others will get every assistance in having their wages and living conditions put in the position in which they should be.</P>
    <P>I am not accepting either of the amendments, because I think they are not proper to the Bill and I would be putting upon this board, if I were to accept them, a duty and responsibility that might be perhaps a full-time job and would take away from the period of leisure that might be at their disposal to look after other important aspects of this industry to which we are directing their special attention.  I hope that the conditions referred to, where they are bad, will be rectified in some other way under the laws as they stand&mdash;under the Conditions of Employment Act and other similar legislation dealing with bad conditions &mdash;and that such bad conditions, where they still exist, will be put into a proper perspective.</P>

Neither the unions nor the Minister can prevent what are called lightning strikes and now is the time, I suggest, to make some provision, to give something better than the pious hopes expressed by the Minister.  If on some important occasion, the employees in the industry decide to take action, it will be very inconvenient for a great many people.  I think the <Col N="1742" /> Minister ought not object to the principle and should give further consideration to what has been put forward in these amendments.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann agrees with the recommendation of the Commission on Vocational Organisation that there should be established a council of education as a permanent institution <Col N="1745" /> to act as the accredited advisory body to the Minister for Education, and directs that a select committee of which the Minister for Education shall be chairman and consisting of 11 other Deputies be appointed with a view to the early formulation of the necessary legislative proposals.</P>
    <P>The recommendation of the Vocational Organisation Commission is contained in paragraph 540 of their report.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We recommend, therefore, the establishment of a council of education as a permanent institution to act as the accredited advisory body to the Minister for Education.  It should be a vocational non-political body without any executive or administrative powers.  It should strive by securing the ready co-operation of all concerned in education to make fully effective the national educational policy as determined by the Government and the Oireachtas. From the Government's side it would be an organ for eliciting from the school and people the maximum practical support for national policy. From the parents' and educationists side it would make available to the Minister and the Oireachtas the knowledge and experience of those best qualified to suggest appropriate means to ensure the success of that policy.  In more detail, its function would be to conduct a continuous, competent and constructive review of the educational system; to show where wasteful overlapping and lack of co-ordination occur; to examine proposals in the light of the ascertained needs and circumstances of the country; to submit suggestions for the development of education, and to organise public interest and co-operation in its different branches.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further, in the same paragraph, it says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The council should contain representatives of parents, whose interests in education are preponderant, and of all the bodies directly concerned in the various branches of education, religious and secular, viz., the churches, universities, headmasters <Col N="1746" /> and teachers.  We suggest that there should also be representatives of agriculture, industry and commerce, the educational needs of which are of vital concern to the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the general outline of the proposal from a commission that consisted of representatives of various religions and various branches of education, industry, administration and agriculture. My purpose in putting down the motion in its present form is that, with these recommendations in front of us, the Oireachtas would set up a committee under the chairmanship of the Minister to go systematically through them to see what is the position generally in the country from which a council of education could be drawn that, with the approval of every Party in the Oireachtas, would act as the accredited advisory body to the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>After full discussion and conference with one another under his direction, the various Parties in this House might decide that certain things should be enshrined in legislation, so that the people of the country, after full consideration by a body such as the Vocational Organisation Commission and, after review by their representatives in this House, would have a statutory organ in the form of a council to advise the Minister on every matter connected with education.  The commission draw attention to an important point in Section 513:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A last point of supreme importance in our eyes will close this introduction. On this point, we wish to leave no possible excuse for misunderstanding or misrepresentation. We have not suggested any changes in the political system or structure of this country, nor are any such changes either involved or implied in our recommendations.  We have not even remotely suggested a &lsquo;vocationally organised State&rsquo; or a &lsquo;Corporate State&rsquo; of any pattern.  We have, in actual fact, sedulously avoided any such proposal and left the political structure untouched; <i>corporatisme d'état</i> has been far from our thoughts.  We have, on the contrary, <Col N="1747" /> connned ourselves rigidly to sketching out a vocational organisation for the economic and social life of the country as distinct from its political life.  We have suggested an economic vocational structure which can exist alongside and parallel with a political structure that is not based on vocationalism.  We have steadfastly endeavoured to keep all irrelevant political influence from impinging on this vocational structure and to keep it, in turn, from becoming involved in political affairs.  In one point only is a question of political structure touched on, and then incidentally, viz., the possibility of a vocational senate forming part of the Legislature.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That being their attitude as a whole with regard to industry and our social life, it is particularly interesting to see how perfectly, from the point of view of the responsibility and authority of the State, on the one side, and the responsibility and authority of the Church, on the other side, the commission's recommendations fit in without in any way detracting from the authority of the State or from the authority of the Church in matters of education, so intimately and closely connected with both.  We are happily in the position that there is no conflict here between the Church and the State in relation to any aspect of the control or direction of education.  We have no trouble of that kind to darken our educational councils.  We have not had up to the present any great political troubles to darken our educational councils, but there is no aspect of our national life about which our people are more concerned at the moment than education.  There is no aspect of our national life in which they are prepared to give a greater response to a lead along a road that will bring them out of their difficulties in regard to education&mdash;difficulties which are not alone economic but social.</P>
    <P>If the road for the people's hope and energy in educational matters be not fully opened, then questions will arise which will drag various aspects of education into politics.  The very fact that the economic situation is likely to press so hard on the country, following <Col N="1748" /> the devastation and the reaction of six years of war, will make the people much more interested in education than they were.  There will be a suspicion that their inability to find employment will arise from the inadequate nature of their educational equipment.  In that way, and in other ways into which we need not go, there is a certain danger that education may become a matter of political controversy. That would be a disastrous thing, because it is so unnecessary in a country where the people in their social, political and religious outlook are so homogeneous.  Since a council of education has been recommended by a body so authoritative, so well-informed and so unanimous as that which dealt with vocational organisation, I was anxious that, at the earliest moment, the attention of the House should be drawn to it and the Minister should be asked to let the House know his intentions with regard to the proposal.</P>
    <P>In the past, there have been suggestions that a council of education should be set up.  The Minister's mind seemed at one time to be open on the matter.  However, in dealing with the proposal of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, on one occasion, and, in dealing with the proposal in the Seanad, on another occasion, he rather suggested that he had closed his mind against the recommendation. Now that the Vocational Organisation Commission has recommended such a council, it is very important that the Minister should let us know what his intentions are regarding it, and that, if possible, he should agree to the proposal in the motion to have the matter examined by representatives of the various Parties with a view to deciding the nature of the legislation which should be put into operation.  We have a large number of big educational problems to deal with.  They will require the co-operation of all, so as to have efficient discussion and so as to ensure the use of the simplest and best machinery we can devise.  They will require full understanding by the people who will have to bear the economic cost.  Economically and socially, they will be vitally interested in the results of the work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1749" /> If we take the financial side of things: From time to time I have made representations with regard to the impossible size of classes in the City of Dublin.  In the primary schools there have been as many as 80, 90, 100, 110 pupils on the rolls.  I have repeatedly suggested that a very great wrong was being done to young people whose education is begun under these circumstances. The Minister has indicated at times that it was lack of building that was responsible for that situation and that it involves an amount of finance.  I think there is even more than lack of building.  I think there is want of appreciation of what happens in the classes as between teacher and pupils and of the necessity of having much smaller classes.</P>
    <P>Recently new regulations that are being brought into force in Great Britain were published.  A tremendous amount of discussion on education has taken place there during the last five or six years.  Enormous plans have been made, and very important decisions have been taken.  The regulations, which will come into operation on the 1st April, provide, with regard to the size of classes, that the maximum number of pupils on the register of any class will be, for pupils mainly under the age of three years, 15; for pupils between the ages of three and five years, 30; for any other class, in a primary school, 40; but, if the class consists mainly of children over 12, 30; for any class in a secondary school, of any type, 30.  Classes can only be allowed to exceed these maxima if the Minister is satisfied that every effort is being made to comply with the regulations, and that failure to do so is due to unavoidable lack of teaching staff or school accommodation owing to war conditions, or to difficulties due to the coming into operation of the Education Act.  The regulations say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Although it is not possible to prescribe a lower maximum than 40 for a class of junior children and infants, the regulations will be amended so as to reduce this figure directly the necessary increase in the supply of teachers and school accommodation makes it reasonably possible.  In the meantime, the immediate <Col N="1750" /> task of reducing the present maximum size of classes for senior and junior pupils, from 40 and 50 to 30 and 40, respectively, will make very heavy demands upon the available supply of teachers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There we have a position in which a maximum of 30 is set down as the number that ought to be on the register of any class, in any part of the primary school or any part of the secondary school.  I mention this simply as showing a standard that is being aimed at by people who are much the same as we are, who have much the same problems to face, and who are facing them under just as great difficulties as we are likely to face here.  I am not at this particular stage mentioning it in any way as criticism of anything that exists here, because when we come to deal with the question of education, when we consider how closely that question is bound up with the question of religion and the bearing of religion on our lives here and on our capacity to use our country's resources, I feel we are treading on holy ground.  I think our people feel that, and when the dangers and difficulties of the war situation are passing away, they are turning their minds and their hearts, burning with desire, to achieve in the educational sphere work as effective and as promising of results as they tried to do in the defence sphere when there were dangers confronting them.  If we do not face the situation with a proper development of our national personality and our individual personalities, and if we are not properly trained to do the work, the difficulties that will arise to-morrow will be more dangerous to us than any impact of war might be.</P>
    <P>There is a big financial problem to be faced when we consider how inadequately our schools are staffed at the present time, and how inadequately we are furnished with buildings.  We are faced with a big problem in the provision of teachers.  We are faced with the problem of what is the basic foundation for our teachers' education. There is the question of the class from which they are to come, how they are to be got, their primary and secondary <Col N="1751" /> education, the whole question of their training.  These are matters in respect of which there have been problems and difficulties and differences of opinion. The problem must be faced with a very considerable amount of effort to-day. Our training colleges have been rather out of commission for a while back, and if the implication of what is being done in Great Britain with regard to the size of classes and the number of teachers is accepted here&mdash;and I do not see how we can escape from accepting it&mdash;then we require a large number of teachers almost immediately here, apart altogether from any drain that there may be upon our teaching capacity by the demands Great Britain will be making because of the number of teachers they will require.</P>
    <P>In regard to teachers, in addition to the question of their training, there is the question of the second language. The question of the second language with regard to teachers is a serious problem, apart from the question of the teaching of the language in the ordinary schools.  Then again there is the question of the curriculum generally. One of the facts that have been pointed out by the Commission on Vocational Organisation, in paragraph 537 of their report, is that better co-ordination is needed between the authorities dealing with education, and that there is neglect of agricultural education in primary, secondary and vocational schools.  The paragraph says: &ldquo;Secondary, vocational and agricultural schools all complain of the defective general education of pupils coming to them from primary schools,&rdquo; and there is the suggestion that in a country which is largely agricultural, where many of the children get their education entirely in primary schools, in agricultural districts, agricultural education has been neglected.  Again, if we study what is happening in Great Britain we will probably be forced to the conclusion that not very much can be done to give agricultural education in the primary school, where children attend up to 14 years of age.  So far from suggesting that instruction of any specialised kind, either in industry, agriculture or any particular trade, <Col N="1752" /> should be given in primary or secondary schools, a very important, influential and widely representative committee reporting through the Nuffield College organisation, have indicated the general outlook on that matter in Great Britain.  They issued a number of publications.  One is entitled &ldquo;Employment Policy and Organisation of Industry After the War,&rdquo; in which on page 22 they say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In post-war Britain labour will be scarce, and young and easily adaptable labour scarcest of all, and it is accordingly of the greatest possible importance to the nation that none of it shall be allowed to run to waste, or be deprived of the opportunity of rendering the highest quality of service that is within its capacity.  The educational system should be directed to fostering above all else qualities of initiative and mental adaptability in the coming generation; and upon its success in fulfilling this mission the efficiency of industry, as well as the cultural achievement of our civilisation, is bound mainly to depend.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They require qualities of initiative and mental adaptability because their labour will be scarce, and the work required to be done will be very great. Here, please God, we will not have that scarcity of labour but we will want initiative and intelligence in our people to a large degree to enable us to develop employment here and to see that our people can increase the natural wealth and the national equipment of the country so that children can find a living in the country when they grow up.  We will want the same kind of efficiency and adaptability for the peculiar problems that face us in this country.  How do they expect to get that adaptability and initiative in Great Britain?  They show us in another pamphlet, entitled &ldquo;Industry and Education&rdquo;, in which, on page 33, one of the conclusions is:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That all normal children who are expected to leave school at the statutory age should follow, up to that age, a broadly non-vocational course, and that the learning of any specific trade should be postponed until a <Col N="1753" /> satisfactory groundwork of general education has been laid.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another, in paragraph 7, is:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the school-leaving age should be raised to 15 at least, without exemptions, immediately after the war and, as soon as practicable, to 16, but that it is fully as urgent to improve the quality of education at the earlier stages and to make provision for continued part-time education beyond the school-leaving age as to raise the statutory age to 16.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The conclusion, in paragraph 14, states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That a system of compulsory part-time education between the school-leaving age and 18 should be introduced immediately after the war and should be extended as rapidly as possible to the point at which the working time of young persons will be divided with approximate equality between education and employment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then they suggest that employers in respect of their younger people should see that they are only employed for half their time and in paragraph 19 the conclusion reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That apprenticeship should rest on a foundation of all-round workshop training combined with specialised trade education, and that all employers taking apprentices should arrange for half their work-time up to 18 to be devoted to education, including vocational education, and should give every possible facility for those over 18 to attend higher courses and prepare for vocational examinations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then they face the question of whether compulsory military service is or is not likely to be brought into operation in Great Britain, and the conclusion they come to is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That, if the period of national service falls as early as 18, it will probably be better for entrants to remain at school up to the period of national service and to defer their entry to industry until after that period, without any period of industrial experience preceding their national service.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1754" /> I bring that and our own difficulties here into juxtapostion to show that people who are very experienced and very highly developed from the industrial point of view are facing a situation in which they feel that their experience and their industrial capacity up to the present will not be sufficient, without an enormous organisational and educational effort on their part, to face the work of maintaining their industry.  If a people with that capacity and experience feel like that to-day, we can hardly agree that our agricultural education can be given in primary schools up to 14.  Many minds will have to be brought to bear on the discussion of the question as to how far agriculture can be improved and developed here as a result of instruction given in the schools, whether compulsory or not, up to the age of 14, or whether it should be done in some other way.  In my opinion it must be done in some other way.  Then again you have the question that is to some extent reflected in the report of the commission here, that there is a problem to be solved in a satisfactory way in differentiating between the education that girls will receive and the education that boys will receive.</P>
    <P>I mention these to show that there is quite a large number of problems which require to be solved at a time when, arising out of the political developments in the world and out of the economic developments, particularly as a result of the experiences of the war, the State is likely to be called upon more and more to take action with regard to economic and social matters. With the State being driven by circumstances or, very often, by its own volition, to intervene more in a large number of matters affecting the people's lives, there is very grave danger that it would do so excessively in education, or, at any rate, that the people might feel that it was doing it excessively in education, particularly arising out of the fact that we have to a great extent to spread and to hold the national language.  In the peculiar condition of the national language to-day we have to save the language through our schools and there is the danger that the State, having been <Col N="1755" /> brought very much into the educational picture and because of the very great difficulties associated with that work, may have to take a more prominent part in and interfere more directly with our education.  That is another matter which may bring about difficulties outside and also induce State interference here.  We are offered in the proposals of the commission a way in which, just as the Church will be completely free to look after its responsibilities, the State will be completely free to look after its responsibilities and have the advantage of an advisory committee.  When the matter is discussed, the question will arise as to whether it is to be directly representative or, while representative, selected by the Minister.  We need a body that will inspire public confidence that every aspect of our education problem will be examined. Then we would know who were the leaders of educational thought generally in the country.</P>
    <P>Sir Richard Livingstone has been writing a considerable amount of idealistic and very valuable matter on education and figuring very prominently in the proposals that are being made in Great Britain, particularly on the idealistic side.  I wish to quote from his publication, &ldquo;Education for a World Adrift&rdquo;, page 54:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The most indispensable viaticum for the journey of life is a store of adequate ideals, and these are acquired in a very simple way, by living with the best things in the world&mdash; the best pictures, the best buildings, the best soical or political orders, the best human beings.  The way to acquire a good taste in anything, from pictures to architecture, from literature to character, from wine to cigars, is always the same&mdash;be familiar with the best specimens of each.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It would be a tremendous stimulus to our people if they could know to-day that there was being gathered from the various organisations at present dealing with education a council which would think over every aspect of our educational problem.  That council <Col N="1756" /> would need to be representative of the primary teaching side, the secondary teaching side, technical and university education, and include representatives of the head masters' associations and of organisations connected with industry and commerce.  It would deal with these problems, whether they are confined to the primary side or are those which knit the various processes in education together, so as to turn out men and women who, in their beliefs and in their religious outlook on life, can co-operate in the social and economic work necessary if this country is to live.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion, the Minister seemed to have the idea that a council of this kind might be concerned more with the trade union aspect of things and the well-being of various organisations rather than with anything else. In paragraph 158 of the commission's report, an outline is given of the objects for which professional organisations were found to exist:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(i)  to defend the social and economic claims of the profession; claims based on the ground that those who discharge a social function deserve and require a suitable standard and &lsquo;status&rsquo;, to enable them to continue discharging it efficiently;</P>
    <P>(ii)  to secure a standard of educational and technical qualifications in entrants into the profession;</P>
    <P>(iii)  to secure that only those who possess approved qualifications may use the title or enter into the practice of the profession;</P>
    <P>(iv)  to maintain a standard of professional conduct and etiquette;</P>
    <P>(v)  to advance the theory and practice of the profession by meetings and discussions;</P>
    <P>(vi)  to promote the social welfare of members by mutual benefit and benevolent funds.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest that, in these items, the aims that might be described as noble aims are rather more numerous than the purely trade union aims.  At any rate, <Col N="1757" /> an association representative of the various organisations would certainly mean that the noble ends would be developed, as the council would be dealing with the nation's educational problem as a whole and would smother completely the purely trade union ends of the various organisations.  In paragraph 505, the report says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But it is true also that the practice and use of association greatly help to develop the spirit of collaboration for noble ends and the power of subordinating selfish interests to the good of a profession or trade and of the whole community.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are anxious to encourage the Minister to approve of the idea that such an educational council should be set up.  In no realm of our national life do we require stronger sheet anchors and better charted seas than in education.  On the other hand, in no department of our national life do we require a freer say.  The Minister will find that a council of education would awaken a new national hope and would release a considerable amount of energy lying latent and dormant in our people to-day.  Other countries have educational councils and consultative councils such as we speak of here.  We are not likely to develop in that way, except in so far as we have technical education committees.  I believe the need could be filled by setting up a representative council selected from the personnel of existing organisations, and I am anxious to hear the Minister's proposals and policy in regard to the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to second the motion.  In a post-war world of keener competition, greater efficiency, greater application of scientific methods and more modernised and revolutionary methods in production, and greater social progress, adequate efficiency and a sound system of education are absolutely vital to the future prosperity and well-being of any country. In our circumstances here we must be alive to our national requirements in the new world order likely to follow this war.  Whatever progress we may hope for in the future, a sound system <Col N="1758" /> of education for our people is vital and fundamental.  A council of education to direct our educational policy, as envisaged in the commission's report and in the motion, is absolutely essential.</P>
      <P>The people themselves have no direct voice in our educational policy at present.  That direction is the responsibility of the Government and, particularly, of the Minister for Education and his officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years there has been vigorous criticism of education here by various sections of the community.  It is obvious that there is a good deal of dissatisfaction about the sytem in operation, and suggestions have been made that after approximately a quarter of a century of the operation of a particular system, we should review the policy, see how far it has been successful over that period and decide whether it is wise to continue it, or, if not, what changes are essential.  In regard to a controlling authority for education, it seems to me that there should be brought into consultation in an advisory position those who have been able to observe the effect of education on our people.  I do not think the Minister or his officials are in a position to do that.  Men engaged in business enterprises here&mdash;the ordinary, common, plain people down the country, people engaged in agriculture, and, above all, the parents of children &mdash;are in a far better position to observe and comment upon the effect and results of our educational system.  Such people are best fitted to observe and comment upon the shortcomings of the children, and, in particular, on the shortcomings of the people engaged in industry here.  We all appreciate that education is merely the foundation of knowledge; that no matter whether it is primary or secondary education, or a university course, it is never complete, and that all through life the individual ought still to continue his education, since every day he can add to the education he has received.  I suggest, however, that one thing that is lacking in our educational system is that our people are not trained to think properly; they are not trained to <Col N="1759" /> observe and contemplate.  They are not taught how to acquire knowledge.</P>
    <P>I am sure that there are very many people in this country who are anxious to acquire knowledge for their particular avocations, but they do not know how to acquire that knowledge, and it is true, as Deputy Mulcahy has observed, that, particularly in regard to our agricultural industry, the technical knowledge that is so essential to an efficient agricultural system is lacking in this country.  I am not suggesting for a moment that, scientifically, we lack that knowledge in this country, but I do say that it is not percolating down to the people in the country.</P>
    <P>We have often wondered in this House&mdash;and have differed on the question&mdash;why it is that agricultural output in this country has remained stagnant for so many years.  I always boil that down to the one fundamental thing, and that is that, under our present system of education, the average farmer in this country lacks the necessary technical knowledge.  In my opinion, that is why we have not been able to keep pace with the progress made in other countries, such as Denmark, New Zealand, and so on, which have expanded their production. The reason for that was that the farmers in these countries started off with a higher standard of agricultural education than our people were equipped with.  Surely, in connection with such matters, the people who should be consulted, and who should be in a position to advise upon a policy&mdash;and not merely to advise, but to direct&mdash;that would be best suited to our circumstances are the people who are in a position to observe the results. I suggest that, under our present system, the people who are responsible for policy and for the directing of the operations of the Department of Education are not in a position to observe the results of our educational system.</P>
    <P>Now, as Deputy Mulcahy has pointed out, at this vital period, not merely in our existence but in the whole history of the world, when the world is anticipating revolutionary changes and when we, possibly, can anticipate far greater <Col N="1760" /> efficiency, which leads to greater competition, being employed in connection with farming methods in the various countries of the world, no matter how we may try to protect ourselves from outside influences we must, if we are to maintain in this country standards comparable with those of other countries similarly placed, be alive to the new technique, the new methods, and the new ideas which will all result from the application of scientific knowledge to these problems and from the education that is necessary for that.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that what is at the root of the whole problem in this country is that before we can hope for substantial advances, not merely in our economic life, but in our social life, as well as in the provision of the necessary finances to improve our social standards of life, the beginning of all that must rest on education.  I believe that the first thing that must be done is to provide for education along those lines, so that the dissemination of the knowledge which is so essential with regard to the particular walks of life here may percolate down to the people in the country.  That must be done first, and the basis must be properly laid before we can hope for any real progress, or direction, control and authority, and that system must rest on a sound foundation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Report of the Vocational Organisation Commission, I would support the idea adumbrated by Deputy Mulcahy in his motion: that a Committee of the House should be set up to implement that, and I think that the sooner we get down to this work, the better.  I hope the Minister will agree with this.  What attracts me more than anything else in connection with it is that you can put on that committee men who can observe the results of our education, who will bring to light our shortcomings and tell us exactly what our requirements are.  I hope that the Minister will favourably consider the motion.</P>

      <P>Is dóigh liom gur ceart dom cúpla focal a rá fán cheist seo.  Undoubtedly, as Deputy Mulcahy has said, this whole question of education is of the utmost fundamental importance to the future of the country. I have often said that I believe there is no question of greater importance, and no work of more value and of more seriousness for our future progress and, even, perhaps, our survival as a small nation, than the work of education and the work of our teachers. Now this particular method of raising this question, I dare say, is for the purpose of eliciting what Government policy is.  I do not think that Deputy Mulcahy would seriously contend that the appropriate way for the Government to declare its policy, or the best way to deal with a matter such as the suggested setting up of a council of education, would be to set up a Select Committee of Deputies of the House. The Government for the time being is entrusted with responsibility for administration and for policy.  It is a matter of collective responsibility and, so long as we have that procedure, I do not think that it is necessary, or indeed that it would be useful, to refer the matter to a Select Committee.  The whole question of the Report of the Commission on Vocational Organisation, as An Taoiseach indicated recently to the House in reply to a question, is receiving the attention of the Government.  Certain references have been made to the matter here and elsewhere but, as far as the Government is concerned, the position, as was explained, is that the different Departments&mdash;many Departments as well as the Department of Education are concerned in this matter&mdash;have been asked to furnish their observations.  They <Col N="1762" /> have supplied, I think, in all cases preliminary statements but these statements have not been fully considered by the Government and, when the Government is in a position to declare its final policy, I take it, it would prefer to declare it on the recommendations of the commission as a whole rather than to deal with them piecemeal, Department by Department.</P>
      <P>So far as these councils are concerned, while the council of education may be stated to be in a special position&mdash;no doubt it is&mdash;nevertheless we see in the report that councils affecting the work of other Departments are recommended, and certain recommendations are made in their regard. Therefore, even from that narrow aspect, the question of policy regarding the council of education must be dealt with not only with regard to particular paragraphs of the report which deal with the matter, but with regard to the other recommendations for similar bodies&mdash;the whole question of vocational organisation, whether it can be set up in this country, what will be its functions, and how, if it is set up, it will work in with the existing organisations. If one is familiar with this issue&mdash;and this is not the first time it has been raised&mdash;there are certain serious difficulties which must be apprehended, I think, in dealing with the matter of the establishment of a council of education.</P>
      <P>You have first the position that the Government and the Minister to whom responsibility for education is delegated are responsible to the Dáil. Then you have the question whether their functions are to be overlapped or brought into conflict in any way with the functions of the education council, if it be set up.  It seems to me that that is a matter that will have to be very carefully examined.  Obviously, if it were not very carefully examined in advance, and if the body were set up, we might very easily have a conflict of functions.  It would be necessary, if we were going to get the best results, to have both the Minister in charge of the Department and this advisory body working in close co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is the question of representation. At the present time our <Col N="1763" /> educational system is on a denominational basis.  So far as primary education, for example, is concerned, it is almost entirely under the control of the religious denominations through the system of managership.  The secondary system, except for the preparatory colleges, is almost completely under private control.  The great majority of our secondary schools are under the care and supervision of religious bodies&mdash;either the Orders or the diocesan authorities.  I have consulted all the bodies that I considered could be fairly described as representing the different educational interests from time to time.  There is the question, of course, of how far consultations should go.  We may have different views about that, but with regard to general questions, take, for example, primary education, the setting up of the panel originated from the managers at the suggestion of the teachers.  At any rate, it evolved as an agreement between the managers and the teachers to which the Departments of Education and Finance later became parties.  That was the practical result of consultation and discussion between the interests concerned.  We have consulted different interests in primary education from time to time about such matters as the examination for the primary certificate, for example, the question of school buildings, etc.  We have discussed with the different representatives of secondary education the question of the secondary school programme and the question of the finances of the schools.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of finances, of course we frequently receive representations on financial headings.  I do my best to meet demands that are made upon me.  Anyone can see that in educational reform finance occupies a very great place indeed; it is really almost entirely a question of finance.  One of the things that strikes one in connection with the proposed educational council is whether one might not easily foresee that a council, even if it <Col N="1764" /> were working in harmony and close co-operation with the Minister, might consider it necessary to make recommendations involving large expenditure which, for one reason or another &mdash;again, even if the Minister for Education seemed to be of the same opinion and inclined to favour the view of the educational council&mdash;the Government, as a whole, might not consider practicable.  The cost might be too great.  It might be considered that the times were not propitious for the carrying out of some of these reforms, etc.  That is merely one aspect of the difficulties that might arise.  No dissatisfaction has been expressed, I think, with the present system of consultations. In fact, when the commission stresses the need for consultation with appropriate professional bodies, I think we can hold up the Department of Education as an example of consultation going on constantly with the professional bodies concerned.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I have not heard of any dissatisfaction with that system.  I know that some very important bodies and interests would prefer that system of consultation in which they would be quite free to give their views candidly and directly to me rather than giving them in a body, where in fact, the particular interest, let us say, of secondary education, might be easily outvoted. On a matter in which that particular branch or their representatives held a particular view, they might easily, if it were a question of a majority vote, be outvoted.  There may be other reasons that one can easily appreciate where, under a system like ours, in which you have managers and teachers employed by them, it might not work out so harmoniously or so satisfactorily as we think and managers and teachers would not come there to give their views in the presence of one another.</P>
    <P>I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 2 p.m. until 3 p.m., Wednesday, 11th April.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware of the serious condition of the fishing industry at Passage East and other centres in Waterford Harbour, and the great destruction of fish caused by seals in that area; and if he will state what steps he proposes to take to deal with the matter, which is one of urgency.</P>

      <P>Following reports of extensive damage by seals to salmon fisheries and salmon fishing gear in Waterford Harbour last summer, an officer of my Department was sent to the locality and made investigations on the spot. As a result I agreed to an arrangement by which the Waterford Board of Conservators should make an <i>ex gratia</i> payment if necessary towards the expenses of a local marksman who would undertake the shooting of seals. No further representations have been made to us by the board since, and so far as I am aware this arrangement still holds good.</P>
