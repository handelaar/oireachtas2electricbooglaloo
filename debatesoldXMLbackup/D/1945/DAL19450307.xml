      <P>I am aware that owing to the virtual cessation of imports of milk churns from Great Britain for the last three years there is an acute shortage of these churns.  Representations which I caused to be made last year to the British authorities for the release of a quantity for creameries in this country were unsuccessful.  No supplies of tinplate suitable for the repair of churns have been obtained for several years.  I can hold out no prospect of supplies of new churns or material for the repair of existing ones being obtained in the near future from Great Britain, but attempts are being made to locate supplies of churns elsewhere.</P>

It is anticipated that the export trade will improve during the late spring and summer.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Halliden</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that there has been very serious dissatisfaction amongst farmers generally owing to the wide margin in price between the wheat sold by them to the millers and merchants and the price they have been obliged to pay for seed wheat; and, if so, if he will state the reasons for that wide discrepancy in prices, with particular reference as to whether the high price of seed wheat was justifiable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had representations made to me regarding the difference between the grower's price for wheat and the maximum prices fixed for the sale of seed wheat.  As I have pointed out in reply to such representations, there is an appreciable loss of weight to the seed assembler in the removal of weed seeds, small and broken grains, etc., from his stocks as delivered by the growers, and in the <Col N="881" /> case of dried seed there is a further loss of weight in drying.</P>
      <P>Other expenses falling on the assembler include the cost of collecting, drying and storing the seed and of despatching it, carriage paid, to its destination, the cost of carriage being included in the price.</P>
      <P>Provision has to be made for a reasonable rate of profit, not only by the assembler but also by the local retailer, as otherwise growers would be unable to purchase seed from their local merchants on whom many growers depend for credit.

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if, in view of the magnitude and usefulness of the works being done throughout the country under the farm improvement scheme and of the large numbers of farmers whose applications have been refused in the past (over 3,000 in the January, 1945-June, 1945, period), he will consider the desirability of having the present grant for his Department, under that scheme, increased by such a sum as will meet the requirements of all those applicants who are solicitous to improve their homes, out-offices, etc.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The funds at present allocated in the Special Emergency Schemes Vote for the Farm Improvements Scheme are very considerable and are about as much as can be efficiently managed with the administrative machinery, including staffs, available.  The facilities now provided <Col N="882" /> are, I consider, reasonably sufficient for the purpose in view.  The only eligible applicants whose applications have so far been refused in the non-congested areas are those whose applications were received late and these will have an opportunity of applying again later on.  I am not prepared, therefore, to seek for any material increase at the present time in the funds provided for the scheme.</P>

The other side of the story is that I have been pressed from several quarters of the House to introduce this Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, before Section 5 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 5 of the Act of 1934 is hereby amended by the deletion of sub-section (2) and the substitution of the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) The Government shall as soon as may be necessary after the passing of this Act and thereafter as occasion requires appoint on the recommendation of the Minister a person who held high rank in the Volunteers in the period 1918 to 1922 to be the Referee, and any person so appointed shall hold office during the pleasure of the Government.</P>
      <P>I want the House to realise that the Minister when speaking in support of this Bill pointed out that the board was weighted in favour of the applicants because there were two high officers of the Old I.R.A. or Volunteers on the board.  I contended, against that, that the proportion was three to two&mdash;the Referee, a representative of the Department of Defence and a representative of the Department of Finance&mdash;and that under no circumstances could the board be regarded as being weighted in favour of the applicants. I want, by this amendment to give concrete effect to the Minister's assertion that the board was so weighted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before doing so, I want to say that I am perfectly satisfied that the existing and previous referees have discharged their duties faithfully and well.  They have been fully impartial in their administration, and this amendment is not to be taken in any way as a reflection upon them either separately or collectively.  I submit, however, that with all their legal training and knowledge they have no knowledge of the conditions under <Col N="892" /> which our people operated in the years 1918-1920, 1921 and 1922, and that, although they are judges and experts in what constitutes evidence, and although having the best intentions in the world, they have not been able to judge accurately the services which people rendered at that time.  I maintain that, by having the type of person suggested as a referee, the board would be weighted in favour of the applicant who would get a fairer or more sympathetic hearing.</P>
    <P>It is true that the applicant has been expected to fill his form of application accurately and to give in great detail the service he rendered.  He is also expected to have the gift of being able to explain his service.  That gift is very rare, and in soldiers particularly. They can say in a broad way that they did so and so, but to give the details is not an easy matter for them.  If a senior officer were the Referee he would, of his own knowledge, be able to assess himself what type of service an applicant had given, even without the applicant proving it.  If an applicant said he was a section commander, a first or a second lieutenant, a battalion O.C. or a battalion adjutant, that officer would be able to assess, with a fairly definite idea in his mind, the type of service which that applicant had rendered without forcing him to give details of the duties that he performed whilst serving in one or other of these ranks.</P>
    <P>This proposal of mine has the further advantage that it would leave the applicant with more confidence in the Referee.  He would be able to explain quite freely the service that he had given to one who, he would expect, would be sympathetic towards him. He would be able to do that in a more clear way when speaking to an officer than he would to a judicially-minded person such as a Circuit Court judge, a district justice, or a barrister of ten years' standing.  Therefore, what I am proposing is that the section in the 1934 Act which makes it obligatory on the Government to appoint to the position of Referee a High Court judge, a Circuit Court judge, a district justice or a barrister of ten years' standing, be repealed, and that this proposal of mine be substituted for it.  The Miniforme <Col N="893" /> ster may repeat the argument that be used on the last occasion, namely, that justice has been done to the I.R.A.  I contend that is not so.  Justice has been done to the number of people who have qualified, but not to the 5,000 or 6,000 who have not qualified, largely because a judicially-minded Referee first surrounded himself with a set of rules and regulations defining active service.  If I may use the expression, he tied himself up in such a knot that he could not go outside those rules and regulations.  The result, as I have asserted here before, was that the Referee had to alter his procedure.  I have here a memorandum sent out from the Referee's office, in which we have set out the number of changes that took place in the set of rules prepared by the Referee himself.</P>
    <P>The Minister played a good deal on the 28 days' notice which was given to the brigade committees.  I would remind him that, at a certain stage, the 28 days' notice was withdrawn. The justification given for the withdrawal was that the brigade committees did not co-operate.  I dealt with that before, and pointed out that the brigade committees were not even part-time bodies.  They were voluntary bodies, without any statutory authority, working in country districts, and could not, in the time at their disposal, deal with 300 or 400 cases, or even with 60 or 80 cases in a period of 28 days.  Therefore, I contend that if you had as Referee a person of the kind described in my amendment he would have such a clear appreciation of the duties performed by each applicant, that the obligation of proof for every detail of service would not rest on the applicant.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister is prepared to accept my amendment.  I have no hesitation in saying that any high ranking officer who was in the Volunteers in the period 1918 to 1923 would know what constitutes service, and what it would be reasonable to expect from an applicant.  The Minister himself knows that even the records are not accurate.  Some of the brigade records that are extant were hidden away in 1918, 1919 and in 1920.  There were alterations made in some of them <Col N="894" /> between 1920 and the 11th July, 1921. I am aware myself of a case in which a divisional O.C., in giving a certificate for 1922, described himself as a brigade O.C.  If he were before the Referee to-day one of the first things he would be asked is this: &ldquo;How did you come to describe yourself as a brigade O.C. on the 30th June, 1922, if you were a divisional O.C.&rdquo;  The answer would have to be that we were not too particular in our descriptions of ranks in those days.  The point, however, is that at this stage these records can be challenged.  I think that if the Minister were to examine the matter he probably would be able to identify the person who gave the certificate I have referred to.  Referees, of course, will not appreciate the difficulties under, which records were kept in those days or the designations that were given to men serving.  I am prepared to admit there was a good deal of carelessness in the description of ranks and appointments held by men at that time.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment as something that will tend towards doing what he himself wishes, something which he said already exists but which I hold does not exist.</P>

      <P>I was very glad to hear Deputy MacEoin's references to the former referees.  It was clear to me anyhow that the Deputy paid a tribute to those referees, a tribute which, I think, was not only deserved but was due to them.</P>

      <P>Were it not for what the Deputy said, I would be inclined to think that there was the implication in the amendment that all was not as it should be in the adjudication of the cases which came before the various referees.  However, as I have said, the Deputy has himself cleared the air on that point.  I want to say again, despite what Deputy MacEoin has said, that the board was, in fact, weighted in favour of the applicant, because acting with the board, and behind them, you had four examining officers, three of whom were men with <Col N="895" /> outstanding national records.  I would imagine that, in any consultations that took place with the board proper, the views of those men were rather balanced over to the side of the applicant rather than against him.  Because of that, I still maintain that the board was in every respect weighted in favour of the applicant.  As regards the board proper, two members of it were high ranking officers of the I.R.A., and two were civil servants of high rank, so that you had a fair balance on it.  The fair balance was that you had a Circuit Court judge, sitting in judgment on the evidence, prepared to hear the views of the representatives of the I.R.A. and of the two Departments.  I think a judge, especially one who had been actively engaged on the Bench, would be well fitted to decide on the written and oral evidence, taking the views of the representatives of the I.R.A. and the Departments together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin seemed to suggest that I had made a misstatement when I was talking about the brigade committees having been given 28 days' notice.  They were given 28 days' notice.  In the documents from which he may have been quoting are used the words: &ldquo;Broadly speaking, therefore, the position was that in every case dealt with by the Referee and the Advisory Committee the following procedure was adopted &mdash; (1) 28 days' notice of intention to reject was issued to the brigade committee....&rdquo;  It may be possible, no doubt it is probable, that when the Referee sent a list of the individuals to whom he was granting a certificate to the brigade committees and gave them 28 days in which to let him know if they were interested in any particular cases, and when the brigade committees returned the full list, intact, showing, thereby, that they were interested only in seeing that everybody on the list got a pension, and were not prepared to say that one individual was not entitled or that another individual was entitled, the Referee, naturally, would lose confidence in that manner of dealing with his request.  We know that in a very large number of cases where the <Col N="896" /> Referee was willing to deal with the particular, specific type of cases which became known as &ldquo;key-men cases&rdquo; practically the same thing happened. Brigade committees were talking about the restricted number of these men but when the Referee asked for a limited list of such individuals he was given a list of several thousands and, of course, the Referee was so appalled at the result of his effort to bring in some of the people in whom these brigade officers were interested that, for the time being, he more or less lost interest in them and went on with the ordinary cases before him.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to accept this amendment because, first of all, the Act lays down what is required.  The Referee should be a member of the Circuit Court, a district justice or a lawyer of not less than ten years' standing.  I think every Deputy will agree that it is very desirable that we should have men with at least the experience which we described as being necessary in the Act.  The suggestion contained in this amendment is that it might be possible to get a person who held high rank in the Volunteers and who was also a legal man.  It is quite possible that that is not what is in the mind of the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I do not propose to alter in any way the section of the Act which deals with the appointment of the Referee, which, to my mind, has given entire satisfaction to all concerned.  So far, anyhow, no charge has been levelled that the referees have been guilty in any respect of any injustice in respect of any application made to them.  Therefore, in my opinion, the amendment is unnecessary.</P>
      <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the proposed words be there inserted&rdquo;&mdash;put and declared negatived.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have done our best to meet the wishes of the Taoiseach and of the Minister and to <Col N="897" /> amend this particular Bill.  The Minister has been resolute in his opposition to every amendment, however reasonable. I think, therefore, that the House should not pass this Bill.  One reason for asking the House not to pass the Bill is that one of the arguments used in favour of the Bill by the Minister was that in ten years the I.R.A. had received £2,000,000.  I suggest that the Minister should have taken 20 years and said that in 20 years they would have received £4,000,000, and that if we all lived for one hundred years from 1934 the total amount we would receive would be £20,000,000.  It would look bigger.  That sort of calculation was used, in my opinion, solely to arouse the cupidity of the people of the country against us and I think that is very bad treatment from a Minister who is a member of the I.R.A. and who, like myself, came to his present position on the shoulders of those people.  It is the last thing that he should do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like again to remind the House that one of the chief arguments against a Pensions Bill was that no young person who was not wounded or suffering some disability should get a pension.  I pointed out that a very small section of the British Forces here in 1920-21, namely, the Black and Tans, are in receipt of £1,300,000 a year from the British Government.  I know the argument will be that the British Government is a wealthy Government which can afford to pay. But a Black and Tan who joined in June, 1921, 11 days before the Truce, who never left the Depot and never fired a shot, and who was demobilised in January, 1922, has a pension of £46 16s. per annum, while every member of the I.R.A. who got £5 a year pension must have had continuous service from 1st April, 1921, to 11th April, 1921.  When the State are paying a section of the Volunteers a sum like that and you multiply it by ten, it shows how well treated the I.R.A. are.  But the Black and Tans were only one section of the forces which were beaten in this country at that time.  You had the R.I.C., the Auxiliaries, the Black and Tans and the military forces, plus the civil <Col N="898" /> administration.  If you add up what the British Government are paying in pensions to all those people, it would be a respectable sum.  I know that comparisons are odious, but when you compare with that sum the few hundred thousand pounds that will be paid to our people who beat the whole lot of them, the sum is miserably low.  It would be much better if nothing was paid and that we should get a lump of bronze to wear on our breast as a certificate that we served this country in its hour of need. When the Minister multiplies by ten the sum that is paid, we have an astonishing situation.  The Minister said that brigade committees refused to accept responsibility and sent back the whole list of names.  I do not wish to say that the Minister is untruthful in that, but I will say that, while that may be true of some committees, it is certainly not true of others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not that what I said?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, I will take it that that is what you said.  Why then penalise those who tried to comply with the regulations?  Why not deal with the brigade committees who did comply and not withdraw the whole concession?  The Minister said that owing to committees sending back all the lists in their entirety in some cases the Referee withdrew the concession. That was the argument that the Minister used, that the brigade committees got the opportunity of saying whether or not the 28 days' notice should go out to applicants and that the applicants got every chance.  What are the facts? The brigade committees tried to meet all the cases.  They had to have an investigation themselves.  Sunday evening was about the only time they had to deal with the matter.  The notice was sent out on a certain day and it would be impossible to have the first meeting on the next Sunday.  Therefore, the first meeting was on the following Sunday week.  They might be able to notify or deal with 30 or 40 cases on that Sunday, but within 28 days they had the task of examining 80, 150 or 160 cases, and were supposed to do justice to all.  It would be <Col N="899" /> physically impossible to do that within the time.  It was not that the committees did not want to co-operate.  They felt that within the time at their disposal they could not reasonably deal with all the cases.  They had only one alternative, and that was to send the whole list back.  They should have stated that the reason for sending them back was the shortness of the time given to consider them.  I would be surprised if some of them did not say that.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that justice is being done.  Justice has been done so far as was possible within the rules made by the referees.  The Minister, on my amendment, said that he took a different view of it.  I suppose he meant that, by innuendo, I was attempting to cast some reflection upon the previous referees.  That was not so.  The referees at all times gave justice to everybody within the rules. But I insist that they themselves drew up the rules.  They did what the Minister is doing in this Bill.  The Minister is tying himself up by statute not to return any case for reconsideration by the Referee after the 1st January, 1946, so that where an error has been committed that error cannot be corrected.  It is very easy for the Minister to say afterwards: &ldquo;I am bound by statute&rdquo;.  That is the argument he used to-day&mdash;that he could not accept this amendment because he is bound by statute under the 1934 Act.  The moment any statute becomes embarrassing to the Government, they will amend it.  But when it is a question of any benefit to a citizen or an applicant, they have no hesitation in refusing to amend it.  I think that is unfair.  Where obvious errors have arisen and an amendment can be put up to remedy them, I think it should be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of definition of service, the Referee can declare that any report he makes is binding and any service that he wishes can constitute active service.  I only hope that the Referee will have the courage to interpret &ldquo;active service&rdquo; in the way it ought to be interpreted.  If he does, many errors can be eliminated.  But, if he is bound by regulations which the <Col N="900" /> Minister may make, then he is tied as much as ever.  If the amendment which I tabled defining active service were accepted by the Minister, it would make statutory the regulations governing active service.  One of the most important personages in any army is the cook, although he never fires a shot.  According to the Act, a cook in the I.R.A. can never get a certificate for a pension, although he may have run as much danger and gone through as much hardship as the fellow with the rifle.  In connection with any army in the world was it ever said that the cook was not serving in the army? Yet, the cook is excluded, according to this definition of service, by the present administration.  The Minister said the brigade committees were asked to send in lists of people who had key service or dangerous and essential service.  Our brigade committee sent in a list of an average of four persons from each of the six battalions, that is, 24 people out of the brigade.  In some battalions, it was two and in others it was six, but the matter was carefully considered.  That list was lost and, to my knowledge, it never came before the Referee.  Like everything else, after some time people got to know that this list was being prepared and I admit that the brigade committee, against my advice, sent in a larger list; but list No. 1, as we called it, was our key service list and should have been adhered to.  We have the strange situation then that list No. 1 was adhered to for one battalion or two and for the other four it was not adhered to.  There was then the extraordinary situation that people with the same type of service in two of the battalions got service certificates and those in the other four did not get them.  That in itself is bound to create criticism.  It does more than that: the men say the brigade committee could get the service certificates for them if they liked and they ask why Paddy So-and-So can get one and say: &ldquo;Did not I do the same thing?&rdquo;  That makes the members of a brigade committee, in any part of the country, inclined to throw their hats at it altogether and forget all about it. Even at this late stage, I suggest that <Col N="901" /> the Minister should reconsider the matter.  He should withdraw this Bill or bring in whatever amendments he himself considers necessary.</P>
    <P>On the Pensions Vote, last year, the Minister promised that the Schedule would be amended in regard to the deductions from people who are in Government service.  This Bill has not done that.  Are we not entitled to ask, since it is not in the Bill, when it will be done and under what circumstances a new Bill will be introduced to amend the Pensions Acts again?  It should be done now.  Let me warn the Government Party Deputies that, once this Bill goes through, there will be an end to legislation in regard to military service pensions by this Parliament. There will never be another Bill brought in, as no Government will run the gauntlet that the two previous Administrations have run on this question. Therefore, this is the last time there will be a chance to do what is fair and right by the people on whose shoulders this Government and the previous Government came into office.</P>

      <P>There are throughout the country some men who did not apply at all for military service pensions, but who would definitely come within the Act.

      <P>Yes, these people have not applied up to date, for one reason or another, even though the period was extended.  I would ask the Minister to consider that matter at a later stage.

The British Government took good care under the Treaty to provide for the R.I.C.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>No, no; let me make that clear.  The Deputy will find it in Command Papers.  It applied to the Black and Tans only and the agreement was that the British Government would pay the Black and Tans and that the Irish Government would pay the R.I.C.  They are two completely separate bodies.  The amount as given in Command Papers in the British House of Commons&mdash;there is a copy in the Library&mdash;is, for a Black and Tan who has under one year's service, a pension of £46 16s. 0d. per annum and it runs from that to £510.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>We know what the British Government did for their minions in this country at that time and we know what they did through all the ages, in '98 and '47 and so on&mdash; they paid the people who did the dirty work, and paid them handsomely. That should have no influence whatsoever on what an Irish Government should do and no comparison should be drawn between them.  I would not like to hear any Deputy suggest to the Minister that he should compare any body with the other, as it would be an unfair and an unnational comparison.</P>
      <P>Regarding the key men, the Minister said that the brigade committees threw at the Referee thousands of key men. I can speak on behalf of one brigade committee and can say that is not so. The number in all for the brigade was about 30 and not one of that 30 was accepted by the Referee.  The reason was that, at that time, the whole thing was being steam-rolled through to get rid of it and bring it to an end.  It is unfair to say that all the brigade committees produced thousands of key men.  Deputy MacEoin points out that his brigade did not do so and I say the same on behalf of another brigade.  In our case there was nothing like 1,000 or 100 or even 50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this measure, it has been contended from some sides of the House&mdash;and Deputy MacEoin has made reference to it again&mdash;that men who were not involved in active service were not <Col N="903" /> entitled to compensation by way of pension for the voluntary service they rendered to the country.  I wish to remind those who have raised that matter once more that the service in which they acted and risked their lives was a volunteer service.  They gave eight to ten years' voluntary service to establish the independence of their country, they lost time and opportunities in so doing and interfered with their future prospects in life in many cases.  A little recompense in this way would be, to my mind, only a small recognition of their self-sacrifices for the freedom of their native land.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made of brigade committees and I ask the Minister once more, where appeals come forward, to give special cognisance to the fact that during the period of reorganisation, of which Deputy MacEoin has made mention, whole battalions were changed from one brigade area to another and put under different divisional commanders.  That means that those men, in the course of their military activities, were transferred from one area to another and, in consequence, it will require the verification of more than one brigade committee to give a proper estimate of their services.  When these matters come up on appeal between this and the end of the year, I trust that point will be taken special note of, so as to do justice to those men.  I know that the vital officers in many of those areas were killed and they were the officers for whom Volunteers had done special confidential work and to whom they gave special services and nobody now can adequately estimate the value of the military services of any of these men.  In these circumstances, sympathetic consideration should be given to their cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point to which I wish once more to refer is that of major engagements. I will refer once again to the railway workers.  Many of these men have not got what they deserve under this military service pensions scheme. I hold that when those men refused to transfer troops and refused to raise the flag to signal out the train, sometimes <Col N="904" /> in the presence of big sections of military on the platform, that should be regarded as tantamount to a major engagement.  In very many cases those men, apart from that, gave great service by carrying information from one brigade area to another.</P>
    <P>Then there is the other question to which I referred, of full-time service from 1st April to 11th July, 1921.  I saw a local company officer who fought at Crossbarry ploughing in the fields the following day, just the same as two days before.  He had to do that, otherwise the whole local military organisation would collapse.  Men had to go back and carry on the duties they were doing days before in order to keep the organisation going in their own battalion areas.  That aspect has been too strictly interpreted.</P>
    <P>I feel that, in view of the knowledge that has come to light during the discussion on this Bill, the Minister is as sympathetic as I am sure he always has been and, further, that he will, in the months that lie ahead, when reconsideration can be given to all those cases&mdash;the cases of men who gave years of faithful service&mdash;deal with them in as favourable a way as possible.  I trust that all the cases that will be heard in the months ahead will be reconsidered sympathetically and, wherever possible, that these special circumstances will be taken into account, so as to reduce the number of grievances that exist.  Of course, no matter how an Act is applied, there will be grievances.  It is impossible in the ordinary human scheme of things to do justice to everybody, but in so far as we can we must give sympathetic consideration to the appeals that will come forward.  There will be at least this satisfaction, that they will all get before the board.  That is the No. 1 point I am stressing&mdash;that they will be examined and, as far as the circumstances and the evidence permit, these cases will be dealt with in accordance with the services the men rendered.</P>

      <P>On this stage I am concerned only with correcting what I regard as a gross misstatement by Deputy MacEoin in relation to myself. When I talked about £2,500,000 odd I never, at any stage in the discussion, suggested that that was too much or too little to pay to the Old I.R.A. What I did set out to do was to show that we had paid over £2,500,000 in pensions to Old I.R.A. men who came within the 1934 Act.  I made that <Col N="906" /> statement to refute the suggestions that were widespread that the Government had thrown the Old I.R.A. on the scrap heap.  That is a fairly valuable scrap heap on which to throw them, a scrap heap that has cost the people of the State that sum.  I never suggested it was too much or too little.  It could have been twice that amount.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not very much to say on the final stage of the Bill because I am confined to what is contained in the Bill as it stands, but I think I could describe it as the lock which is put on the door against all further applicants.  The fact that Deputy Allen asked the Minister to give a further opportunity to applicants gives one a picture of what Fianna Fáil speakers are going to say down the country in defence of this Bill, namely, that they did their best.  If Deputy Allen wanted another chance for those applicants he would vote against the Bill.  If Deputy Seán McCarthy wanted to see that justice was done, he also would vote against he Bill, but they do not.  They are both doing exactly what Deputy Allen has said&mdash;they are steam-rolling the Bill through the House with the Fianna Fáil Deputies on the engine driving for all they are worth.  In my opinion this Bill is a mistake, so far as the Government is concerned.  Notwithstanding anything the Minister may say to the contrary, I think it is unfair to his comrades and mine.  I think it would be a good thing if, instead of the rigour of the law, a fair opportunity were given to every applicant.  I have done my best against the Bill.  Every amendment that we have been allowed to move has got support in the Lobby from all the members of the Opposition Parties. The Minister has rejected every amendment.  He was adamant in his desire to do so, while at the same time saying that he wanted a solution and help.  But, when help was offered, he would not take it.  I am opposing the Bill in its final stage.  Even at this eleventh hour, I would appeal to Deputy McCarthy and to Deputy Allen to vote against it, so that the people they are interested in will have an opportunity of making the application <Col N="909" /> which, as these Deputies say, they are entitled to.  There are such people in the country and they ought to get more time.  The Minister is seeing to it that they are not to get any further time.  At any rate, in the case of those who have applied, this is the last word that the Government has to say to them.</P>

      <P>In my opinion the strongest speeches in opposition to this Bill came from the Government Benches.  One such speech was delivered during the last 15 minutes. Deputies on the Government Benches marched into the Lobby every time behind the Minister.  Deputy MacEoin says that this Bill is locking the door. In my opinion it is not because the people will see through what is happening here.  They will put people in here who will give a fair crack of the whip to those who were responsible for creating the position whereby we have a native Government in the country to-day.  The Minister may pass his Bill and may look for solutions until doomsday, but the day will come when a Government will come in here and will hold a sworn inquiry as regards the administration in this country. That inquiry will bring out many a thing.  It may refer to the debates on this Bill.  It will teach the lesson that there were many denied rights that they were entitled to.  As regards the closing of the door by the Minister and the Government, it is my opinion that the door will be reopened by the voice of the people.  They will see that the men who were responsible for giving us our freedom will be treated in a fair, decent, honest and honourable way and that it can never be said that the Black and Tans&mdash;those who were the murderers of our people&mdash;got better treatment than our own who won for us our freedom by driving the Tans from the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervened in the discussion of this measure following the speech, which was made on a particular stage of the Bill, of the Taoiseach.  He made it clear that the Government were in a serious difficulty. He spoke in such terms of that <Col N="910" /> difficulty that I, as Leader of the main Opposition Party, felt it was my duty, on behalf of the Party, to step in and offer, in a completely non-Party spirit, any help that we could possibly offer to the Government to deal with a problem which the Taoiseach said put the Government in a serious position. The offer that I made was contained in the suggestion that the Taoiseach would place his difficulty before the members of the Defence Conference which is composed of a group of men drawn from every Party in the House: that he would state to the members of the Defence Conference not only what the Government difficulty was but the details of it.  I did it because, when we have an Irish Government in a difficulty that it feels is a serious one, I think any Party in the House would be prepared to discuss the Government's difficulties with it and to see in what way they could help towards a solution.  Speaking for myself and for this Party, I was prepared to discuss the details of the Government's problem and their difficulty with them and to proceed, to the best of our ability, to a solution in which we would not as a Party claim any credit or look for any Party advantage or any Party position arising out of any of our actions.  Our attitude was that we were prepared to realise that a difficulty for the Government in this matter, which involved to a certain extent the atmosphere in which a certain amount of politics is being carried on in the country, is a problem at the present time for the whole country and we are prepared, whether the results would be agreeable or not to any particular class or classes in the country, to sit down with the Government and to discuss a solution of their problem, thereby taking our part of any responsibility that there might be for dealing with a matter which the Government said was a problem and in respect of which they had a difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is just typical, I think, of the Government's carelessness in regard to the way in which it does things and the results of its action that the offer should be spurned and turned aside in the way in which, apparently, it has been spurned and turned away in the <Col N="911" /> subsequent discussion here.  All I can say is that I regret it.  The Minister now has in the measure the proposals that he set out to get.  He has heard criticism from these benches.  He has heard suggestions and amendments put forward from these benches.  They are not put forward for any Party advantage of any kind.  We have done the best we could, either to induce the Government or to guide the Government in the matter but, apparently, it has been of no avail.  I want to say how much I regret the Government's attitude and, in the various difficulties we have to get through, politically, economically and socially, how much I distrust the Government's approach to these matters if they are going to approach them with the lack of understanding and of co-operation with other Parties which they have displayed in their approach to this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Mulcahy, I think it is a pity that opportunity was not taken by the Government when this Bill was before the House to do something to relieve the situation which exists in the country.  We all know that there is a great deal of discontent amongst members of the I.R.A. There are people, of course, who say that only those who are entitled to pensions have been awarded them by the board or the Referee or whoever is responsible for the administration of the Pensions Act.  I venture to say, and I think I will be borne out by members of the Government Party, that there are some people in this country who have not received pensions who have given service equivalent to service given by those who have been given pensions.  This Bill, as far as I can see, seals the fate of those members of the I.R.A. who feel that so far they have been treated unfairly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the Second Reading of the Bill, the Taoiseach, in a lengthy statement, asked for suggestions from the Opposition Parties.  It has been said, and we know it to be true, that it has never been known at any period since Fianna Fáil got into office that they have taken suggestions from any other <Col N="912" /> Party in the House.  They have been adamant in their rejection of amendments and suggestions by members of this House in any business they have brought before the House.  They considered that they were able to get their business through without the aid of any other Party.  I think it will be agreed that this is not, or ought not to be, a Party matter, that it should be, and is, a national matter and, in order that it should receive proper consideration, the suggestion made by Deputy Mulcahy on the Second Reading should be adopted, namely, that a committee something like the Defence Conference should be asked to deal with the applications for pensions which have been made to the Government by members of the I.R.A.</P>
    <P>Much has been said during the course of this Bill, and since legislation was first introduced to give military pensions, about the question as to what constitutes a major engagement. Deputy MacEoin submitted an amendment which was not acceptable to the Ceann Comhairle.  In my opinion, if that amendment had been accepted by the Ceann Comhairle, and, in turn, by the Government, it would go a long way to solve the difficulties with which the Minister and the tribunal are confronted in dealing with applications from members of the Old I.R.A.  I have already discussed this matter of a major engagement.  I think Deputy Seán McCarthy agrees with me to a certain extent that there are men in this country who suffered severely but who have not been in what is recognised in Government circles or in tribunal circles as a major engagement. I suggest, as I have often suggested, that a young man who left a university or who left apprenticeship to a trade, who was on the run, and fought with the I.R.A. for a number of years and who, as a result of time lost, is now unable to earn his own livelihood, has given service that is tantamount to taking part in a major engagement.  There were young men in this country who went out prepared to take part in major engagements, who ran great risks, whose lives were in danger and who were prepared to offer their lives in <Col N="913" /> the interests of their country, and who have not received pensions.  I believe very definitely that there are men in receipt of pensions to-day who did not take part in any major engagement, and if the evidence submitted on their behalf were compared with the evidence submitted on behalf of some of those who did not receive pensions, it will be found on careful examination that a number of those who have been rejected have been treated unfairly.</P>
    <P>I would like to add my voice to what has been said by Deputy Seán McCarthy in connection with railway-men. We all know the part taken by railwaymen in the trouble.  They refused to take military on their trains; they refused to move trains out of the station; they refused to give the flag to enable the engine driver to move on. There are men in this country to-day who lost their jobs in consequence of the attitude they adopted at that particular time.  They have been forgotten. They have been badly treated. No provision has been made for them. I think that, even at this stage, the Minister should take some steps in order to ensure that these men, who not only jeopardised their positions, but jeopardised their lives, should be rewarded.  We all know that on isolated stations at that period it would have been quite easy for a Black and Tan to draw his revolver and to shoot these men because they took action which, in the eyes of the military authorities at that time, would be sufficient to warrant them in shooting them.</P>

      <P>This Bill was bad enough when it was introduced, but it is infinitely worse now.  It has been amended by the Minister to such an extent that the position is worse than when the Bill was introduced.  One amendment introduced by the Minister, while not preventing an individual from going before the High Court, makes it impossible for anybody who has not money at his disposal to do so.  The Minister is having it both ways. According to the amendment, no costs can be given against the Minister in any such case.  I suggest that that is unconstitutional; that it was not alone an amendment of the Bill, but an amendment of the Constitution.  Even now I think the Minister ought to take other members of the House into his confidence.  He would be able to get Deputies from every Party in the House who are familiar with the position that prevailed in this country during the time the Black and Tans and the Auxiliaries were operating here.  Everybody here wants to be helpful.  I am perfectly certain that such a committee as I am suggesting would be unanimous in meting out justice to those people but for whose actions we would not be here to-day in the Parliament of the nation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary purpose of this Bill was to put a stop to vexatious litigation which would not benefit any Old I.R.A. men and which would lead nowhere. Out of the very long debates which we have had on the various stages of the Bill there stands forth the fact that there is a unanimous House here to do justice to the claims of the Old I.R.A.  While I do not agree with a lot of the things said by Deputy MacEoin in this debate and some of the amendments <Col N="915" /> which he moved, I think that he has laid down in these amendments a basis for future legislation for fair treatment of the I.R.A. <i>En passant</i>, let me say, as one who lives in the next brigade area to that of Deputy MacEoin and who often disagrees with him in matters political, that so far as any man could be fair in dealing with the claims of those who fought against him in the Civil War, no man or no officer could be fairer.  I said that we have a unanimous House.  But, if I were in the Government's shoes, in view of what happened in the courts I would have done nothing but what they have done.  I came across a case recently where a prisoner was illtreated by the Black and Tans and died as a result shortly after his release from jail.  He was the sole support of his father and mother.  The father, who made a claim in connection with his death, died, and the mother also died a short time afterwards. There is a married sister who is very well off and she has continued the claim.  The House will agree that, in equity, that claim should be met, irrespective of need or want on the part of the survivor.  But that claim could go on for generations.</P>

      <P>No, but I want to point out that we have a parallel in the pensions claimed after the American War of Independence and the American Civil War, where claims were handed down from generation to generation.  If we have no safeguard, and if certain things which the Opposition asked should be done were done by the Government, these claims might continue from one generation to another.  That is the difficulty that the Government are up against.  There is a case of a survivor of the American War of Independence who lived to be 104 years of age.  On the day he died he was married to a child of four years old and the pension claim was handed down to her.  She died only recently. If you can safeguard against such a position as that, and if you are agreed <Col N="916" /> to safeguard against it, certainly you can bring in new legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On all stages of this Bill we have heard a lot of dishonest expressions used; at least I think they were dishonest.  One phrase bandied around was that this Bill was taking away the constitutional rights of the citizen.  My idea about this Bill is that, firstly, it regularises the position created as a result of the decision of the Supreme Court with regard to pensions already being paid.  Secondly, it takes necessary steps with regard to certain operations set on foot by some people for the purpose, in my opinion, of using the I.R.A. as a pawn in a game to bring their names before the High Court by way of securing an order similar to the orders already secured by 80 members of the Old I.R.A.  The Minister had to introduce an amendment to this Bill to prevent 400 of these cases being brought to court which would have mulcted the taxpayer to the extent of £23,000, not one farthing of which would go into the pockets of the I.R.A. men on whose behalf the money was being expended; it would go in other directions altogether.  I think the Bill is absolutely necessary from those two points of view alone.  In my opinion, this Bill does not alter the status of any Old I.R.A. man under the 1934 <Col N="917" /> Act.  They have still the same rights. In fact, one of the sections of the Bill opens the way for all Old I.R.A. men to make a claim.  He can make his appeal up to the 31st December, provided he has the necessary evidence to show that his case had not been fairly dealt with heretofore.  The discussion on this Bill, summed up, means that we are all agreed, on all sides of the House, that there are some individuals who had not reached the standard to qualify but who were on the outer ring of the circle.  Deputy MacEoin put the number at 6,000 but, personally, I do not think it is near that amount. However, that does not say the Deputy is wrong.  He may have based his calculations for the 82 brigades on the amount of men in his own area.  In my area, I know we could not reach anything near that amount.  If I take the number whom we consider in our areas to be as fully entitled to pensions as those who got them, and multiply that by 82, I would not have near 6,000.  However, Deputy MacEoin may have more in his area than we have in ours.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish believed there are men in receipt of certificates and pensions who were not in a major engagement. He is right in that, but those men may have been brigade or battalion officers and probably the work they carried out was of such essential importance to the general work of the battalion or brigade in their area that the board considered they were fully entitled to a pension.  Active service was really never defined.  I always think of that buck, the elusive Pimpernel, when I discuss active service.  You get a general impression of being inside a certain standard before you can get a certificate, but I have not heard yet an actual definition of active service. This discussion has brought out the fact that we all agree, including those chief spokesmen against the Bill on the Opposition Benches, that there is a certain number who have not qualified and who should receive certificates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thinking over the administration of the Act by the Referee and the board, in general, it strikes me that, after ten <Col N="918" /> years of working under this Act, we find in almost every brigade area that there are some men who have not got inside the circle and have not reached the standard set up by the Referee. Those are border-line cases.  At present, we have almost an equivalent number of men in each brigade area in that way as border-line cases.  I do not rise to throw bouquets to the board in any way.  I have had my differences with them as a verifying officer and I still maintain that, unconsciously&mdash;I will not say consciously&mdash; they have done an injustice in some cases.  That is my opinion and, of course, their opinion is quite a different matter altogether.  Since we now have almost the equivalent number in each brigade area in this difficult position, that proves conclusively that the board has at least been consistent in its administration of the Act.</P>
    <P>Whatever methods are adopted to bring in under the Act those who are outside the scope I hope the Minister will succeed in having their cases reopened.  Let us hope that if they are reopened, both sides of this House will eventually be satisfied and those to whom the standard set up by the Referee applies will receive the justice to which they are entitled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colbert</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate the position the Government was confronted with following the recent court decision.  The Government could easily have taken the line of least resistance and allowed the whole pension position to be reopened.  That would mean, in my opinion, the rehearing and re-examination of all the 60,000 applicants, including those who had already been given awards.  In doing that, the Government would not be facing up to its responsibilities, nor would this House be facing its responsibility if it agreed to that proposal.  We all know that such a position would be completely impossible.  I can claim to have a certain amount of knowledge of the conditions of those times, being a company commander during the whole period of the Black and Tans and the civil war and operating in a brigade area, and I estimate that there were about 30,000 of those applicants who <Col N="919" /> would never have applied in the first instance if there had been anything like a clear definition of active service. We had not that in the 1934 Act, unfortunately.  I appreciate the difficulty of arriving at a cut and dried definition of active service by reason of the varying kinds of service that men had to perform.  It varied in the different brigade areas, as well as in the different units concerned.  Deputy MacEoin referred to that, as far as the front-line men were concerned. For that reason, I believe it would be very difficult to arrive at what would be regarded as a cut and dried definition of active service.</P>
      <P>If the applicants were as wise then as they are now, and if they had all the light that has been thrown on the position and on the 1934 Act through these debates, I would be inclined to say you would not have more than about half the applicants.  It is a good thing that all the knowledge that has come out of these debates has been brought home, because I believe there will not be so much dissatisfaction amongst those whose claims have been rejected.  They must now realise that the 1934 Act could never apply to the type of service they rendered.  As regards the application forms&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The lines on which I am going are somewhat similar to the speeches that have been made already on this stage of the Bill.  I believe it has been pointed out that these outstanding claims that could be regarded as genuine will have an opportunity now, under this measure, of an appeal to the board before 31st December.  I believe that if the board and the <Col N="920" /> Advisory Committee would adhere to the earlier interpretation put on active service &mdash; that would be during the earlier years of the administration of the 1934 Act&mdash;the majority of these men would succeed in their claims. Therefore, I appeal to the board, when they are dealing with these appeals, to adopt the most liberal interpretation of active service that they possibly can adopt and in that way I believe that full justice will be done under this Bill between now and the appointed day &mdash; full justice to the majority of the Old I.R.A. whose cases could be regarded as genuine.</P>

      <P>I wish to reiterate what I stated in my opening remarks and throughout the discussions on the Bill; that practically every case in which an application has been made for a service certificate has been dealt with.  That very vital factor has been completely, or almost completely, ignored throughout this debate.  An instance of that is the amendments which Deputy MacEoin tabled continuously on the Committee Stage. He completely ignored the fact that there were no applicants to be dealt with, or practically none, other than those who came in as a result of the Supreme Court's decision, or appeals which were listed for hearing.  If that fact had not been ignored, this debate would probably have taken about one-third of the time that it has taken.</P>
      <P>We heard a speech to-day from Deputy Donnellan and, indeed, one might regard Deputy MacEoin's own speech as a speech more worthy of the hustings or the cross-roads than as a contribution to this discussion.  Deputy Mulcahy spoke of the Government's difficulty. He seemed to suggest that the Government was in a tangle, that it was in a mess of some kind or other. There was never any suggestion of the Government being in the slightest difficulty in respect of this particular question.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach says nothing of the kind.  The Taoiseach asked for a solution of a specific difficulty <Col N="921" /> which still confronts us, but there was no question whatever of the Government being in any tangle.  Our own Party discussed this question at length without finding a solution.  We have gone through three weeks of discussion here and we are still as far away from a solution of the difficulty of which we were seeking a solution as we were at the beginning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not accept something that is not a solution, and the difficulty for which we have not found a solution is simply this, that we were told during the course of the debate that there were varying figures from 3,000 to 5,000 people who were just as much entitled to pensions as people who had already received pensions. If that were so, then there would appear to be some machinery wanting, and what that machinery is it was difficult to find out.  We have in the Act a clause which provides for an appeal, provided that additional evidence can be supplied.  That seems to me to be the way to meet many of these difficulties, because we must remember that the case has already been heard, that it has already received the full consideration that cases of successful applicants have received, and if some form of evidence has been omitted, that the error can be rectified by appeal.  That is the only solution that I can see for the difficulty, unless we do what has been suggested here in the course of the debate, to rehear the 60,000 cases.  That is what we were not prepared to do, and it was to find a solution other than the solution already available there through the medium of the appeal section, that we were seeking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see how these individuals can be brought in unless they have additional evidence.  If we did attempt to bring in these people on the mere voice of an individual who states that one man's service is as good as another's, that one man has got a pension and the other has not&mdash;if we were to accept that as a solution, we would have to admit these 60,000 cases, and I say here we have failed throughout this <Col N="922" /> debate to produce anything in the nature of a solution.  Deputy Mulcahy seemed to think he had solved all the problem when he suggested that the matter should be referred to the Defence Conference.  I should like to know what qualifications the Defence Conference has over those of any other group of individuals in the House, or what particular knowledge they possess which is not possessed by the ordinary members of the various Parties.  If the various Parties in the House have failed to produce anything in the nature of a solution, I am pretty certain that the Defence Conference will not produce it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish said that this Bill seals the fate of all I.R.A. men.  I want to reiterate what has been said by other speakers, that is, that this Bill does not in the slightest interfere with the rights of the individual I.R.A. man.  Every one of the 60,000 applicants has already either been heard by the interviewing body or has had his application forms thoroughly and sympathetically examined, and if he failed to convince either the Advisory Board or the Referee that he had a case, this Bill does not in the slightest interfere with his rights.  If he has any additional evidence to supply, if he can produce some evidence which he was unable to produce on the former occasion, this Bill does not prevent him from producing that evidence to the Referee and having his case reheard.  As I mentioned in the course of the Committee Stage discussion, more than 500 people have successfully taken that action.  More than 500 people who were originally turned down as not having sufficient evidence to secure a certificate have since, through the medium of additional evidence, convinced the Referee and the board that they were persons to whom the Act applied, and, as a result, are to-day recipients of service certificates and a pension.  Every individual who can produce the necessary evidence is in a similar position.</P>

      <P>Before the discussion on the Fifth Stage of this Bill is entered upon I wish to refer to certain statements made last week in the House, on the preceding stage. In those statements there appears to be an implication that Government amendments, as distinct from amendments by Private Members, are examined by the Chair or by the officers who advise on such matters on differing principles.  I think I do not need to assure the House, if such an implication were intended, that there is no justification for it.  Over the years there have been very many Government amendments ruled out of order&mdash;not in every case formally in the House but in preliminary conference&mdash;and I feel confident if Government was asked for its views on that aspect its grievance against the Chair on that count would appear as great, but would be just as well or ill-founded, as grievances of Private Deputies.</P>
      <P>During the week in which the Customs Bill came up for Committee several Bills, to which a very considerable number of amendments were tabled, reached that stage also that week.  Examination of the amendments to the Customs Bill was somewhat hasty and perhaps perfunctory&mdash; perfunctory because the other Bills seemed to contain in greater degree the elements making for difficulty from the point of view of the Chair's consideration &mdash; and the effect of the Customs Bill amendments was not fully appreciated in a necessarily rushed examination.</P>
      <P>I may say that had a point of order been made against admitting what I may term the &ldquo;offending&rdquo; amendments when those amendments were being moved, the decision of the Chair in the light of the submissions made last week would have been to treat the point of order as well taken and to uphold it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In anything I have said, I am not <Col N="926" /> to be taken as suggesting that the Minister acted wrongly in offering the amendments at the stage he did, since the question as to the admissibility of an amendment to an amending Bill has frequently to be decided on fine-drawn lines of distinction, and the onus of examining and deciding that question rests entirely with the Chair.  My sole purpose is to dispel the idea, if it exists, that differing standards of ruling are applied as between Government and other amendments.</P>

      <P>All I want to say on this measure is that, whatever the Minister's sin against justice or his reason for putting the offending amendment into this Bill, it is only a small matter compared with presenting the Bill to the House as a whole.  The fact that the Bill is now made a temporary measure tempers the situation a little bit, but I am still opposed to this measure.  I am gratified, at any rate, that the Minister has seen fit to make it a temporary measure so that it can be reviewed in the light of what the Government has to deal with during the next five years.</P>

      <P>I do not really see why there was such opposition to this measure as was taken to it by some sections of the House.  There is nothing novel or new in any section of the Bill.  There is no new principle of <Col N="927" /> law introduced in it.  It is a Bill that was made necessary by the changed circumstances of the last 12 years or so, but it is only in the emergency that a measure of the kind became urgent, because there are so many items on the list of goods that are prohibited to be exported from the country, much more than was the case before the emergency. Even before the emergency there was a considerable number of goods on the list of articles prohibited to be exported from the country. Some of them could be exported by licence but, without licence, exportation was prohibited.  Quite a respectable number of goods was on the list, and a law of this kind was necessary. We were obliged, as Deputy Costello pointed out on the previous stage of the Bill, to use the roundabout way of the Scrap Iron Act.  We had to use that Act to prohibit the export of eggs. It was a roundabout and an unsatisfactory way from every point of view, and it was necessary that we should have a law of the kind proposed here. There is nothing novel, nothing strange, nothing in it that is not already in existence in the customs laws of this country with regard to smuggling into the country.  We needed the same powers in regard to smuggling prohibited goods out of the country.  I met the case made by the leading members of the Opposition who spoke on the Bill to a considerable extent&mdash;a greater extent than Deputy Mulcahy admits.  I met the case by making the Bill a temporary one, to exist for five years, and I think the House is fully justified in accepting the Bill in its present form, at any rate, for that period.</P>

I propose now to deal with the Bill itself and I hope that when I have drawn the Minister's attention to certain aspects, he will be prepared, before the next Stage, to examine the position with a view to finding some means to alleviate certain hardships which will be imposed on various sections of the public.  The Title sets out the purposes of the Bill.  In the last few lines of the Title it is stated&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;to authorise the Irish Turf Club and the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee to exclude persons from racecourses, and to provide certain other matters connected with the matters aforesaid.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I draw the attention of the Minister first of all to these two bodies? <Col N="929" /> These two bodies have no statutory existence and, for the first time, they are being brought in and are being given statutory existence.  I do not know whether or not the Minister has ever looked up the Racing Calendar to see who are the persons who comprise these two bodies.  I have taken the trouble to examine this Bill in great detail and everything connected with it.  I find that these two bodies are controlled mainly by persons who, from a national point of view, are very far away from us, some of them actually living outside the State.  As members of the Turf Club we have such people as Viscount Adare, W. Barnett, Esq.; Capt. R.B. Brassey, P.E. Burrell, Esq.; Col. R.B. Charteris, A.D. Comyn, Esq.; Major E.M. Connolly, W.T.

    <P>The gentlemen with military titles are gentlemen who hold these titles from a foreign army.  Not one of them in that list holds his military title from our Army.  It is not so long since this very body&mdash;I should like the Minister to take a serious view of it&mdash; actually refused a licence to a jockey in this country who had served his apprenticeship across the water and who came over here to ride in his own country.  He was refused a licence because, in their opinion, he could be classed as a deserter.  A deserter from what?  A deserter from another army, from a country to which he did not belong.  These are the people who are going to be given statutory rights and supreme control.  I think the Minister ought to leave these gentlemen where they are and be satisfied to give the board he wishes to set up full powers and let them consult, if they like, these people who have certain experience in racing matters.  Certainly, I appeal to him to leave them out of the Bill and to let the board be the be all and end all in racing and matters pertaining thereto.</P>
    <P>I come now to Section 2 of the Bill, the definitions in which state that the expression &ldquo;course bet means a bet entered into by a licensed bookmaker during a race meeting held on an authorised racecourse and at that authorised racecourse or in the precincts thereof on a horse race forming an item at that race meeting.&rdquo;  Those of us who have any slight knowledge of racing matters know that many of the big bets are usually made away from the course with a bookmaker before the race meeting, and that the levy that it is sought to impose in this Bill will not be contributed to by the big betters, who are in the know, but will <Col N="931" /> be taken exclusively, or almost exclusively, from the smaller betting public.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that in connection with the recent meeting at Thurles very big betting transactions took place.  These betting transactions did not take place on the course.  Anybody with the slightest knowledge of racing knows that, if I were the fortunate owner of a good horse which I had tried out in secret and was satisfied on the information I had that it was likely to be a winner, a dark horse, in a forthcoming race, I certainly, like the rest of the gentlemen, would not be running it for the benefit of the public. I would try to have a bet placed for me away from the course so that there would be no bet from me on the horse at the racecourse and I would in that way get the biggest odds to my money. If these gentlemen who should pay the levy are to pay the levy, why not say that on every bet this levy shall be made?</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;precincts&rdquo; is defined again in the definitions and it is clearly set out that the bet must be made within the precincts of the racecourse itself.  There are a few Deputies who occasionally indulge in a bet.  We are told when we get a tip: &ldquo;Do not have a bet on the course, because if you bet there they will know I told you and we will not get the odds to our money. Make sure that you get somebody who is not at the races to put the money on for you in Dublin or some other place and then you can go and look at your horse winning.&rdquo;  We all know that this takes place.</P>
    <P>Section 5 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  The board shall consist of 11 members.</P>
    <P>(2)  Each person appointed a member of the board shall be a person who, in the opinion of the Minister, is representative of, or has functions in relation to, or is otherwise connected with, racing (including the management of racecourses) or the ownership or breeding of bloodstock, or bookmaking, or other like pursuits.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Other parts of the Bill provide that anybody appointed to this board is to <Col N="932" /> be a member of the board for five years, but he must have some of these qualifications. What is to prevent a person from becoming a racehorse owner for a certain period for the purpose of being put on the board and then getting rid of his horses and still remaining on the board?  I think the Minister should insert an amendment that when a person ceases to have any of the qualifications he automatically ceases to be a member of the board and somebody else will be appointed in his place.</P>
    <P>Section 6 (9) states that the Minister shall consult the Minister for Agriculture before exercising the powers conferred on him by this section.  I should like to see consultation between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture in connection with the whole of the operations of the Bill because, apart from the revenue sections of the Betting Tax Act which are taken over and embodied in this Bill, there is nothing else in connection with which the Department of Finance can help.  Everybody interested in the horse-breeding industry from the point of view of the country knows that the Department of Agriculture is vitally interested in this matter all the time.  If we are to have a national stud, it is the Department of Agriculture, I assume, that will exercise control over it.  It is the Department of Agriculture that will have to be consulted when certain sires are to be licensed and so on.  As this Bill, when it becomes an Act, will be a permanent feature of our legislation for the benefit of the horse-breeding industry, apart from horse racing, I suggest that the Minister for Agriculture should be consulted in connection with every section of the Bill, rather than this one section.</P>
    <P>Section 13 states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The board may, with the consent of the governing bodies, establish, equip and maintain racecourses, and for this purpose may acquire by agreement or lease any land (including any racecourse).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again I want to protest.  I say that the governing bodies should not be consulted at all; that if the board is <Col N="933" /> to get authority from anybody, it should be from the Minister who is responsible for this Bill.  I am satisfied that everybody connected in any way, directly or indirectly, with the matters dealt with in the Bill would be more satisfied to have the Minister for Finance deal with this matter, in conjunction with the Minister for Agriculture, rather than these governing bodies.  Sub-sections 2, 3 and 4 of Section 13 ought to be operated subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance, even if it is only formal. There is a levy to be imposed and certain expenditure to be incurred. Nobody knows what the operations of the board will be, whether the board will acquire racecourses from private owners or undertake to equip new ones.  If they are to spend large sums of money in a variety of ways, I think the sanctioning authority should not be these governing bodies to which I have a very distinct objection.  I think everybody in the House will have the same objection from the point of view that they cannot be expected to have the national approach to this matter that ordinary people in this country have.</P>
    <P>In Section 15 there are a number of paragraphs and I suggest that, in connection with these, there should be an overriding section or sub-section providing that all these things can be done subject to the protection of private racecourses and in such a way that the public will not be exploited. There should be some protection against unlimited activities which may have adverse effects on some interests or individuals.</P>
    <P>Section 18 deals with the methods to be adopted in connection with the control and the finances and books of this board.  It states that the board shall furnish to the Minister such information with regard to the exercise of its powers and duties as the Minister may from time to time require.  I wonder is the Minister satisfied, in the event of criticism or complaints in the future, that Parliament has the power or the right to raise a question concerning the operations of the board. We all know that boards have been set up from time to time with certain <Col N="934" /> powers and that these boards are subject to the Minister of the Department concerned.  When a Deputy raises a question here, however, or wants to discuss a certain matter, he is told: &ldquo;The Bill gives this power to this board.  The Minister may get the information, but Parliament has no further function in the matter, and you cannot raise it here.&rdquo; I want to get an assurance from the Minister that, in the event of genuine grievances having to be aired or genuine complaints having to be brought to the notice of the Minister, or of the House wishing to discuss certain matters, the power will not be withheld from Parliament to raise or discuss these matters.</P>
    <P>Section 21 is a very short section, and when I read it first I thought it sounded very funny.  I have, however, since been referred to another Act, which had the very same, or almost the same, section in it&mdash;the Pigs and Bacon Act.  As the House knows, I have very little experience of bacon and pigs and, consequently, I can be excused if I have not gleaned any information from looking up that Act. Section 21 reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;An offence under any section contained in this part of this Act may be prosecuted by the board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have spoken to a colleague, who is a barrister, who tells me that that is quite a usual legal phrase.  I should like to see the word &ldquo;offender&rdquo; substituted for &ldquo;offence&rdquo;, because I cannot see how you can prosecute an offence except in so far as you commit it yourself.  To that extent, I can understand it, but I am told I am wrong, and I suppose the draftsman is definitely right.</P>
    <P>Section 22 may create a very serious situation.  Sub-section 3 states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a person who is not the holder of a course-betting permit is found carrying on the business of a bookmaker at any authorised racecourse, any person acting under the direction of the board or the executive of that authorised racecourse may remove such first-mentioned person therefrom and for this purpose <Col N="935" /> may use such force as may be reasonably necessary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope I am wrong when I read into that that the board may have its own officials who may use force in ejecting people with whom they have disputes or whom they have reason to eject.  I would like to be assured that, when it comes to physical violence, the board will have the dignity to call for the assistance of the Guards and that we will not be faced with the spectacle of a racing board with its own private police force or gang at every race meeting.  I only read that into this section and would like to be assured that force, where necessary, will be used through the Guards.</P>
    <P>We all know that there are Guards on duty at race meetings who can satisfactorily deal with anything that may arise.  Surely, if a man happens to be a bookmaker or a member of the public who offends, he is at least entitled as a citizen to be removed by the forces of the law rather than by some private individual whom he never saw before and who, possibly, may not even wear a uniform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Eleven o'clock, gentlemen, please,&rdquo; says the chucker out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not convey much to me.  I thought it was 10.30. There is the danger, if I am right, that where there is the expectancy of serious disturbances, the bookmakers may arm themselves with their physical supporters and that may mean a riot. The public do not want to see that happening, and it would not be for the advancement of racing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 23 is one which the Minister should consider seriously.  It sets out how the board has power over the licences given to bookmakers.  At present a bookmaker has to apply for a certificate of personal fitness to make a book and that will not be granted to him by the district justice if he is satisfied there are complaints against <Col N="936" /> him.  Section 23, in my opinion, seeks to do something similar to what we do to foreign representatives&mdash;we give them extra territorial rights.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  The board may, if in its absolute discretion it so thinks fit, grant to any licensed bookmaker a permit authorising him to carry on the business of a bookmaker at authorised racecourses or in the precincts thereof.</P>
    <P>(2)  The board, in its absolute discretion, may, at any time, suspend for such time as it thinks fit or revoke a course-betting permit.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where a person to whom a course-betting permit is granted ceases to be a licensed bookmaker, the course-betting permit shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed, by virtue of this sub-section, to have been revoked upon such cesser.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It may seem very simple.  Although a bookmaker has a licence the board may decide whether he will make a living, whether he will be able to attend meetings or not.  I suggest that if there is to be a tightening up in the issuance of permits for them to carry on their business it is the authority of the State which should do that and not the authority of this board.  If the board wished to prevent a certain bookmaker or certain bookmakers from going to meetings the board should show cause and should serve such bookmakers with a notice as to the cause.  There should be a right of appeal against the decision and, if necessary, it should be tested in the District Court before the district justice.  This section, in my opinion, gives the board an extra constitutional position over and above what the State thinks as to the suitability of a person.  It means they can veto it.  If there is to be an alteration, I suggest they should apply first to the board for a permit to make books and if the board gives it they may then apply to the State, who may veto it or let them carry on.  Where the board seeks to be the final authority, the Minister should consider recasting the section so that he <Col N="937" /> will preserve as the final vetoing authority the Department of State itself and, if there is a dispute between the board and any individual or any association of bookmakers at any time, there should be some right of appeal.  The section as it stands gives no right of appeal whatever.</P>
    <P>At one stage of his introductory speech, the Minister seemed to think the bookmakers would welcome this Bill and would regard it as a charter of security and liberty for them.  As far as I can see, and I have read the Bill, it gives certain powers to individuals or groups over and above the board, which is to be set up in a certain way and you have the bookmakers on the defensive the whole time.</P>
    <P>Section 24, sub-section (2) says that where a disturbance takes place the board, through its agent, is the final authority.  I suggest that, if there is any likelihood of a disturbance, a Guard should be called to witness the proceedings.  Sub-section (2) of Section 24 states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whenever any person of whom the production of his course-betting permit is lawfully demanded under this section refuses or fails to produce such permit or produces such permit, but fails or refuses to permit the authorised officer of the board making the demand to read and examine such permit, such authorised officer may demand of such person his name and address and if such person refuses to give his name or fails or refuses to give his address or gives a name or address which is false or misleading, he shall be guilty of an offence under this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest a Guard should be called if such a situation arises and, if the bookmaker refuses to comply with any reasonable demands, there will then be an independent person to fall back on.</P>
    <P>Section 25 seeks to deal with the situation which will arise when the admission charges to race meetings are reduced.  Bookmakers at present pay, I think, five times the amount charged to the ordinary public, since they do business there.  Naturally, that would have to fall if the prices were reduced.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) seeks to delete the <Col N="938" /> words in the Totalisator Act which deal with the charges to such licensed bookmakers. I suggest the Minister should review that sub-section and, if the prices are being reduced, that he insert a sub-section providing that the prices charged as entrance fees for bookmakers and their assistants, over and above those charged for the ordinary public, shall have a ceiling fixed.  That ceiling may be ten times the admission charge for the public, if you like, but certainly there must be some protection. The board, as it is controlled, in my opinion, could be induced, if they wanted to get rid of certain small bookmakers, to say: &ldquo;We will charge you £50 to come here to-day, and we will charge every one of your assistants £25,&rdquo; and in that way make it impossible for those people to carry on. There should be some protection there.</P>
    <P>Now we come to Chapter III of the Bill, and that deals with the levy.  I have a distinct objection to seeking to secure the subsidy for the industry on the basis suggested in the Bill.  First of all, I am satisfied it will be impossible to carry out this arrangement in any reasonable, regular, decent form.  It will lead to all kinds of abuses, all kinds of deception, all kinds of trouble, and the amount of money acquired will not be worth all the trouble.  I ask the Minister if he is not prepared to take other suggestions? I understand the amount of money which they hope to get for the purpose of this subsidy is £150,000 a year, and that the maximum of 5 per cent. levy suggested in the Bill is to ensure that that figure will be reached; but, if an excess of that figure is reached by way of levy, the 5 per cent may be reduced to 2½ per cent or even less.</P>
    <P>That is not my objection.  My objection is to the method of getting it.  It is expected that about £50,000 will be collected from the totalisator.  Obviously, if this board does its business properly and increases the totalisator facilities elsewhere, that £50,000 will be increased.  The balance, therefore, is about £100,000, and the public is to be discommoded because of the £100,000 that it is possible to get in other ways. I suggest that the beneficiaries of this <Col N="939" /> Bill, the gentlemen in the racing business and the horse-breeding industries, should be made to contribute something. I suggest that if there was a small contribution from sire fees it would be only reasonable to have it. If you read a racing paper to-day you will find the most prominent sires booked out for 1945, at 100 guineas and over per service.  Surely, they should contribute something, and the people who have valuable animals and who get high prices at bloodstock sales should also contribute something.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister appreciates this.  The biggest racehorse owners, except for a few, are not in this country.  It is quite true that people in other countries support our racing considerably by having large numbers of horses in training and by competing in our events.  We are supposed to have the belief that this Bill is genuinely intended for the purpose of helping the breeding industry.  Let me take a small meeting in the country, where a small farmer enters a horse, the best he can have, but certainly not a £10,000 horse.  The cross-Channel owners have such large stables here that they are forced to enter their very high-bred stock in all these small races, and the small breeder has no chance at all.  I am not anxious to mention names here, but there are certain names which are almost synonymous with racing&mdash;Dorothy Paget and the Aga Khan, and people of that type. I do not know how many horses Miss Paget has which are competing at all kinds of racing.  The small man who enters a horse for a £45 stake has not an animal capable of beating the thoroughbreds which other people can buy and which are sent out more or less for exercise.</P>
    <P>These are the people who will benefit, and these are the people on whom there will be no levy&mdash;these big cross-Channel owners such as Mr. Rank, the Aga Khan and Miss Dorothy Paget. They are quite welcome to send their horses here.  If our stakes are increased, they will be more anxious to do so.  We will give them our £2,000 stake money instead of the £1,000 of past years.  We are told that all this is <Col N="940" /> for the benefit of our horse-breeding industry.  Our horses, if our stakes are made too attractive, unless they are outstanding animals, will be taking second place and you will never see an Irish-owned horse winning an Irish stake of any value.</P>
    <P>I do not know who are the advisers behind the setting up of this Bill.  I did point out that I am satisfied that the public and the bookmaking profession, who are to provide this&mdash;the public have to provide the levy and the bookmaking people will collect it&mdash; were not consulted.  Certain owners, I suppose, were, and I suppose also that certain gentlemen here were consulted. These are the people who will stand in judgment over everybody else, but nobody is to stand in judgment over them.  I happen to know that some of these gentlemen who own and run horses are subject to criticism, very severe and justifiable criticism, in connection with racing.</P>
    <P>Instead of having a nominated person representing the bookmakers on this board, I think the bookmakers as a whole should be allowed to select their own representative on that board, a man able and willing to fight for their interests under the most adverse circumstances. He will be in the minority.  The Minister ought to get one or two members of the ordinary betting public put on the board as well. We fought in this country for a long time against taxation without representation, and here we are introducing it into our own legislation.  Deputy Bennett and I will be taxed through the medium of this levy and we will have no representation on the body that decides everything about it.</P>
    <P>Section 28 and the sections that follow are adaptations of the Betting Acts and the Minister is giving to the board powers which were previously held by the Revenue Commissioners. I think he ought to agree that some of the powers, anyway, should be exercised only through an officer of his Department.  I think it is wrong to give to a board, whose members are not civil servants, who are not officers of the State in any sense, powers to examine the private affairs of individuals, where they are not sworn to <Col N="941" /> secrecy.  I suggest the Minister ought to have some protection in the shape of, where the board have reason to suspect that a bookmaker is not giving honourable returns of his betting transactions, they should report him to the Minister and the Minister should send one of the officials from his own Department or the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;preferably the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;to find out whether the allegations have or have not any foundation.</P>
    <P>I think it is going a little bit far to give this board, which produces nothing, such drastic powers.  The Electricity Supply Board at least produces electricity, and therefore it has a certain right of entrance into premises for the purpose of examination. But here you have a body which produces nothing, which is to do everything for the racing and the horse-breeding industries but contributes nothing, and that body will sit, like the Gestapo or the Ogpu or like Secret Service men, on the backs of the people.</P>
    <P>Section 38 deals with the power to exclude certain persons from racecourses. I have no objection to that, but I feel that the board should not be given power to exclude persons from racecourses without giving a reason at least to the person concerned. If that person feels that the reason is unfair or unjustified, he ought to have the opportunity of having the matter reopened.  To give the board such powers as are proposed will mean in the end that what the Bill seeks to create will, in fact, be destroyed. Racing is a pleasure for the ordinary public and, as I said on Friday, there are two types of betting public.  There are the racegoers who bet in small sums and enjoy their day's outing, and there are the racegoers who go to races hoping to win easy money, to back winners at good prices and to come home with some of the bookmaker's money.  These are the people who make racing, and if you make it inconvenient or unpleasant for them you will destroy racing.</P>
    <P>I want to make a suggestion to the Minister as to one method by which he could get this £100,000, the balance <Col N="942" /> of the £150,000 to which I have referred.  Let the bookmakers take upon themselves suggesting to him to what extent they can provide a certain amount&mdash;let it be £40,000 or £50,000&mdash; and let it be imposed upon them by way of additional entrance charges. They will find the ways and means. Remember they have not been consulted about the matter, so far as I know.  On the other hand, one of the main objects of the Bill is to increase the attendance at race meetings by reducing entrance charges.  I am sure the Minister has never been at a race meeting in his life, and I am sure he has never had a bet in his life&mdash;he has missed that thrill&mdash;but if he went to Fairyhouse, Galway or Punchestown races, he would find that the vast bulk of the people there pay no entrance fee at all.  It is only the dignified people, like Deputy McCann and myself, who do not want to mix with the ordinary public who go into the grand stand or enclosure for comfort.</P>
    <P>At these big meetings, the crowds attend in thousands, enjoying the day's outing and nothing else, so if you reduce nothing by nothing, it leaves nothing and consequently you will get no extra contribution. Entrance charges at the other race meetings are, in the main, reasonably low, and instead of reducing them for the first year or two, I suggest that the Minister should see how the board gets on with what it gets from the &ldquo;Tote&rdquo; and what it will get by way of some contribution from the gentlemen who make their living as bookmakers. Do not reduce the entrance charges for the present; go very gingerly about increasing stakes in the big races; and be very careful when you decide to increase the prizes at the smaller race meetings that you do not increase them for the benefit of people who are not intended to benefit.  In addition, let the people who will benefit make some contribution.</P>
    <P>I mentioned on Friday that persons in employment stamp cards for unemployment insurance and national health benefit.  These people make a contribution, and in the case of widows' and orphans' pensions, there is a contributory and non-contributory <Col N="943" /> basis.  There are people who can afford to be racehorse owners because they are very well off and who are in the business because they make a living out of it, and there are very many who make a living at horse breeding, and some way can be found.  I believe the Minister can find it without interfering with racing and without endangering it by this impossible levy which cannot be operated.  If the Minister wants further details about it, I suggest that one of his officials should have a private conversation with half a dozen bookmakers, collectively or separately.  He will find that there are so many tricks in the trade that the levy will not be operative at all.</P>
    <P>I can see somebody running to a bookmaker to have a pound on the favourite at evens.  When the horse wins and he asks for his two pounds, the bookmaker will say: &ldquo;You get only 38/- because when you gave me the pound, I had to take 1/- off for the levy.&rdquo;  I can see people going to race meetings and&mdash;as we all have experienced&mdash;backing winners and losers and coming home without having gained or lost; and, under this arrangement, I can see a fairly large punter who has six bets at a six-race meeting and wins three at even money, and loses three, finding on Tuesday morning a letter from the bookmaker telling him that he owes £30 levy.  The man will say: &ldquo;I neither won nor lost, and if that is the kind of racing we are to have, I am finished with it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to realise that the vast bulk of betting is done &ldquo;on the nod&rdquo;&mdash;money does not always change hands&mdash;and if people do not pay the bookmaker, is the bookmaker to have a legal power to collect the levy?  I should be the last to suggest the repeal of the Gaming Act, because we all know it would be disastrous, but, on the other hand, how is the bookmaker to collect this levy?  Is he to be given legal authority to say: &ldquo;This man had a bet with me and, though he did not pay my bet, I must collect the levy.&rdquo;  The more the Minister examines it, the more he will realise that it is not worth going on with.  He will agree, I think, if he <Col N="944" /> examines it sympathetically, that there are many other ways of getting this money.  Some of it can be got from the racing gentlemen themselves.  If my horse wins a thousand guineas at the Park, I would not mind giving a thousand shillings for the levy, and if I had a sire for whose services I could command 100 or 200 guineas, I would not mind the shillings from the proceeds of 40 services going to the levy. I am sure that most of the racing gentlemen would agree with that.</P>
    <P>As I have said, do not reduce entrance charges yet, but see how the board will get along and reconsider the levy in two or three years' time.  I am satisfied that the Minister does not want to injure racing, that he would rather drop the Bill than do so, but I ask him to hasten slowly.  Let him set up the board, giving it full powers in relation to designing racing, making it more attractive, helping breeders and so forth and get money for them, but get it in a way that will do least harm. I make that appeal to the Minister in all sincerity.  I have read the Bill in detail and I have discussed it with certain bookmakers.  I do not know what their view, as a body, is, but so far I have not had any criticism of the views expressed.  I believe that other Deputies who are concerned with the welfare of racing will agree that a levy which is designed to collect £100,000, which can be got otherwise, should be dropped.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to say that the very names and the very actions of members of the bodies should indicate that they are not the people who should be set up as the final authority.  They are not elected by anybody, and I do not know how they got to the position which they occupy.  I understand that one of the gentlemen concerned is away in another army and has nominated somebody to represent him.  If that is the kind of loose way in which that body is to operate, the Minister ought not to give it a statutory existence.  Give the board certain powers, but let it be subject to the Minister and let his Department consult the Department of Agriculture.</P>

      <P>This is a measure that <Col N="945" /> we can all discuss in a non-Party spirit.  I was convinced of that until Deputy Briscoe commenced his speech, when, rather unintentionally, I think, he drew what I may call a national and an anti-national outlook into the discussion.  He intimated that there were certain gentlemen, members of the Turf Club, for whom we, talking in a national Parliament, should not have any respect.  He went further and said that some of them resided outside this State&mdash;that two lived in the North of Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Deputy did not mention that, but wherever they live they are all &ldquo;sports.&rdquo;  Whether they live in the southern or in the northern States, if there is one thing that is going to blend the various elements in this divided country it is the sportsmen. If we are ever going to have one national organisation, as we have at present one sporting organisation, I suggest that it is going to come through the mingling of the ordinary public with such gentlemen as Deputy Briscoe has referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that, on the whole, this Bill is to be welcomed.  Anything that will improve sporting facilities, that will improve racing and the quality of our horses generally will be joyously received all over the country.  There are some things in the Bill that I should like to be convinced are going to be for the good of racing.  I believe that the Minister is going to have control over a good many members of the proposed board.  I hope that they will have regard to racing in general, and I mean by that the small race meetings in the south and west, as well as the meetings at the Curragh and those in the Dublin area.  The board, when it is set up, will have control over certain sums of money.  It will have borrowing powers.  I take it that the policy of the board, as of all boards of the kind, will be to make a financial success of the undertaking entrusted to it.  There is the fear in my mind that with such an outlook the members of the board will concentrate on the larger meetings such, for example, as those at the <Col N="946" /> Curragh, Baldoyle, Leopardstown, and the Phoenix Park where they will be assured that any expenditure of money on their part will bring in large revenue. They may not be disposed to give assistance to the small meetings down the country, some of which are now non-existent&mdash;such as those at Croom, in the County Limerick, at Sligo and other places in the west.  I would remind the House that it is the small meetings which have been the backbone of the horse-breeding industry. I hope that one effect of the Bill will be to keep here for some time some of the best horses that are bred in the country, so that our people may have the opportunity of seeing them racing.  I think the people deserve to see the best racing that it is possible to provide.  I am not at all averse from attracting to this country the people that Deputy Briscoe has referred to.  I think that we should do all we can to attract rich people from outside the country to come and race their horses here.  They spend their money in setting up racing establishments and make no money from racing their horses here.  The more attractive we make racing the better it will be for the country.</P>
    <P>To get back to the question of the small meetings, I said that these were the backbone of the horse-breeding industry. They are certainly the backbone of it as far as steeplechasers are concerned.  Anybody who knows anything about racing, or of breeding steeplechasers, will immediately recognise the great dearth there is of steeplechasers to-day.  I do not know whether the Minister knows anything about handicap races or not.  If he does not, he should make inquiries from Deputy Briscoe.  What is the position with regard to the big handicaps to-day?  In the last six months or so people will have seen one horse carrying a welter-weight, and practically all the others the minimum weight, or very near it.  You have one horse&mdash; Prince Regent&mdash;handicapped with 12 stone 7 lbs., or 13 stone, and all the others in the 9 stone 7 lbs. or 10 stone divisions.  There are one of two reasons for that: either Prince Regent is the greatest horse that was ever <Col N="947" /> bred in Ireland, and goodness knows, we have bred some very good horses here, or else the other chasers that we have are not very much good.  I, for one, am not going to say that Prince Regent is the greatest horse that was ever bred here.  He is certainly a very great racehorse, but opinions will differ as to whether he is better than some of the horses that were bred in this country in the last ten years or so.  You certainly will not get everyone to agree that he is the greatest horse that was ever bred in the country.  The fact at any rate is that no horse bred in Ireland has made such a farce of handicap races as Prince Regent has made of them.  The main reason for that is that, apart from Prince Regent and one or two other horses, there are no good chasers in the country, and they are not here because the small meetings were done away with.  It was the small meetings which produced horses like Workman, Jerry M., and a number of others, and not the big meetings at Baldoyle, Leopardstown, the Curragh and the Phoenix Park.  Those famous chasers were discovered at small meetings in the County Galway, County Limerick and other counties. They were bred by farmer sportsmen. They brought out those horses and ran them at the small meeting for a small stake.  The Jerry M's, the Cloisters and the rest of them started their careers by running for small stakes of £45 at meetings like the Croom meeting.  As they gained confidence, they ran for £100 stakes at Limerick and other meetings and, eventually, made a reputation for themselves at Punchestown and Fairyhouse.  It is because of the reputation made by those horses that some of the people Deputy Briscoe referred to&mdash;the Ranks, the Pagets, and other well-known foreigners, most of them very wealthy people&mdash;are spending a lot of their money here. They have been attracted here by the careers of those horses which came up from the small meetings to the big meetings.  The small sporting farmers who bred them sold them for fairly good prices.  They did well for themselves, while horse racing was enriched <Col N="948" /> by the achievements of those animals, which, were it not for the small meetings, would probably never have been heard of.</P>
    <P>I want to ensure that these meetings will be re-established, and that there will be men on the board who have the interests of the small breeder and the small owner at heart, who will see to it that all the money that is available to them will not be spent in the expansion of the metropolitan and big meetings, but that a good deal of it will be spent on the re-establishment of some of the country meetings that are now non-existent, even though it may mean that at the beginning they will not get the same return for the money.</P>
    <P>I am not averse to the principle of a tax on betting.  There was a tax on betting, which fell through.  It was a revenue tax, and the money went to the relief of general taxation and did not go back to racing.  There is a certain pool of money available in this country for sport.  It is not a negligible amount.  It flows between the bookmaker, the backer, the racehorse owner, breeder, and so on, and that pool should not be eliminated.  The objection we had to the old tax was that the Government took something out of it.  It never went back to racing. In this Bill the Minister proposes that there will be a certain amount taken from betting and put into the fund, which will go to the benefit of racing generally.  It will go back to the pool.</P>
    <P>I am rather confused in regard to this particular betting tax.  In the Bill &ldquo;course bet&rdquo; is defined in one way, and in the Money Resolution before the House it is defined in another way. Will the Minister say which definition we are to accept?  Section 26 (2) says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For the purposes of this section the amount of a course bet shall be taken to be the sum which, by the terms of the bet, the bookmaker by whom it is entered into, will be entitled to receive, retain or take credit for if the event the subject of the bet is determined in his favour.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>According to the Resolution, the expression &ldquo;course bet&rdquo; means a bet <Col N="949" /> entered into by a licensed bookmaker, during a race meeting held on a racecourse and at that racecourse or in the precincts thereof, on a horse race forming an item at that race meeting.</P>
    <P>When I read the Bill, I said to myself, &ldquo;Is this a tax on betting generally or is it a tax on only one part of a bet?&rdquo;  Two people are parties to a bet but only one side is to be taxed.  I think that is what the Bill means. While the member of the public making the bet is to be taxed, the other party, that is the bookmaker, is not taxed. As I interpret the definition in the Money Resolution, I think it would mean that a course bet would mean any bet that both the bookmaker and the ordinary citizen make and they would be liable to pay a tax on it.  I think the bookmaker would have to pay his tax on the bet also.  I hope the Minister will define that more clearly before the discussion ends.</P>
    <P>There is another point in regard to the levy, namely, the manner in which it will be collected.  Deputy Briscoe referred to that.  We would like some assurance that there will be a particular method of collection.  I was not here when the Minister spoke, but I think the Minister indicated that it would be left to an arrangement between the bookmakers and the public. I do not think the public will ever be consulted.  They were never consulted in the past, and in respect of the old betting tax, the bookmakers made their own rules&mdash;and, as Deputy Briscoe indicated, where a person laid a £1 bet the bookmaker paid on the basis that it was a 19/- bet.  There was no justification for that.  I can imagine that if this Bill is passed as drafted and if the bookmaker proceeded to collect tax on that basis there would be innumerable lawsuits.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to break his invariable rule and to make a bet. I would ask him to calculate the result of his bet on the basis of the bookmaker collecting the tax.  The Minister has never made a bet in his life.  He says in this Bill that we will charge a levy on bets.  For the sake of argument, take the levy as 5 per cent.  Suppose the Minister goes to the Phoenix <Col N="950" /> Park with Deputy Briscoe to see how racing is carried on, and suppose he lays a bet at five to one.  The horse wins and the Minister goes up to the bookmaker, naturally expecting to get £6 minus 1/-.  The bookmaker does not give him £5 19s.  He gives him £5 14s. Would the Minister work out the percentage? Does the bookmaker charge him a 5 per cent. tax on £1 or does he persuade the Minister that he has not laid him odds on a stake of £1 but has laid him five to one on 19/-, and the result is that the Minister wins £5 14s.?  That is a greater tax than 5 per cent.  Assuming the bookmaker was quite right in what he did, it works out at 5¼ per cent.  If this Bill is passed in its present form, the backer may say, &ldquo;the bookie has charged me more than is legal and I have a cause of action against him.&rdquo;  That might happen.  That is why I want to see some specific method of collecting the levy, whether it is going to be 5, 3 or 2 per cent.  I do not want to have any possibility of the betting public being filched.</P>
    <P>I am not either directly or by insinuation saying that bookmakers in this country would attempt to filch the public.  I am not saying any such thing.  Fortunately for us, there is not a set of greater sportsmen in this or any other country than the bookmakers in this country.  As one who has had 50 years' experience of enjoying racing in this country in various ways, I should like to pay my tribute to a long line of honourable, decent men, who have carried on the profession of bookmaker. The percentage of men in that profession who have defaulted has been much less than in the case of any profession I could name.  That is to their credit.</P>
    <P>When we are passing a Bill like this, we want to see that it is watertight. When we are imposing a legal levy there should be some method of collecting it provided for rather than leaving it to one of the parties to make their own rules.  It is a wrong method. The method adopted by the bookmakers makes it easy for themselves, although they make nothing out of it. The bookmaker when he has to collect a levy of 1/- in the pound adopts this <Col N="951" /> method: he regards a £1 bet as a 19/- bet and, whether you win or lose, it is all the same to him.  In effect, he collects the tax off the winning bets; the losing bets do not matter to him.  If you stake £1 and if the horse loses, it does not matter to the bookmaker whether it was a 19/- bet or a 20/- bet. The £1 is gone and whether 1/- of it was regarded as tax or as part of the bet does not matter.  But if you happen to win, the winner pays all the levy.  The winner may be a person who only bets once in a lifetime.  He may only go to the racecourse by chance and have one bet.  That is what I want the Minister to do, so that he can get some experience of this business. Such a person may back a horse which wins and, no matter what the odds are, he is paying a great deal more than the levy.  In the case I mentioned of the Minister's putting £1 on a horse and the horse winning at 5 to 1, he collects £5 14s. and pays 6/- tax.  In that case I think the tax the Minister would pay would be 30 per cent. instead of 5 per cent.  I want to have a system of collecting the tax which will be quite fair to the public and everybody else and so clear that nobody can make a mistake about it. As I say, the bookmakers adopted the easy method, but they made nothing out of it.  It balanced out for them on the whole, but it was unfair to the general public.</P>
    <P>So far as I know, this Bill must be fairly popular.  I have had a long experience of racing, and very many owners and breeders, and a good many bookmakers know me well.  Neither a private owner nor a bookmaker has come to me to say anything against this Bill.  Therefore, I assume that it must be a fairly popular Bill.  If any of these people have a grievance in connection with it, I do not know what it is.  Somebody mentioned to me in a second-hand kind of way that bookmakers would be squeezed by the Bill. I do not see why they should be&mdash;certainly not more than any other section. For the first time, bookmakers are getting, so far as racecourses are concerned, a semi-legal status under this Bill.  They are getting a status they never had before so far as I know with <Col N="952" /> regard to betting.  The bookmaker is excluded from any levy that is being imposed on betting.  As I said, this Bill does not impose a levy on bets; it imposes a levy really on one party to the bet.  Therefore, I cannot see that bookmakers have any grievance.</P>
    <P>I hope that for the sake of the sport generally the levy will be as small as possible.  The ordinary man who goes to a race meeting does not want to spend too much, and if he wins a few shillings he does not want that sum to be reduced by a tax.  It was pointed out to me to-day by a person who is not a bookmaker that the bookmakers had a fear that certain sections of the Bill would interfere with them.  Deputy Briscoe elaborated that, and said that certain bookmakers might be excluded from certain racecourses, and that he would like the Bill to be in such a form that every bookmaker would have the right to go into a racecourse. I do not know how many bookmakers there are in this country, but there is certainly a very great number. If every bookmaker in the country wanted to go to every race meeting there would be more bookmakers there than racegoers.  I do not think that we should give a general right of entry to a racecourse to every bookmaker who wants to go there.  There will have to be some method of selection. In any case, all bookmakers do not want to go to every meeting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a pretty large number if they all wanted to go to a small meeting.  I think it is only fair that there should be some method of selection, that the executive should have some say as to the bookmakers who are to go to their meetings.  In practice, certain bookmakers go to certain meetings and no difficulty has been experienced in the matter.  I do not think there will be any difficulty now. With regard to Deputy Briscoe's fear as to what the exclusion section of this Bill will impose on the bookmaker, there is nothing more imposed on the bookmaker than is imposed on the ordinary citizen.  Bookmakers have built up a reputation which is possibly <Col N="953" /> as good as the reputation of members of any other profession.  There is no fear that any bookmaker will be seriously handicapped by any section of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe referred to the fact that a bookmaker might be ejected from a racecourse.  The same thing applies to any private race-goer; in certain circumstances, he can be ejected.  Racing has been carried on here for generations in a sportsmanlike manner.  The bodies controlling racing at present will form portion of the new body which is to control it.  In the past, their verdicts have hardly ever been challenged.  There has been a tendency to accept the verdict of the stewards of the Turf Club and of the I.N.H.S.C. No man ever got a &ldquo;warning-off&rdquo; notice from these bodies who did not deserve it, whether he was an ordinary member of the racing public or a bookmaker.  Very few bookmakers have had that stigma attached to them. Those who did receive a &ldquo;warning-off&rdquo; notice accepted the verdict because they knew they were guilty.</P>
      <P>I cannot see that it will be ever necessary to use the force which Deputy Briscoe is afraid of to eject any such persons, because they will not be there to be ejected.  For the sake of the sport and for the sake of everybody concerned, I think that it would be better to leave the matter as it is rather than, as Deputy Briscoe suggested, to provide that the ejection should be by a member of the police force, or somebody of that kind.  The &ldquo;warning-off&rdquo; should be carried out by the racing board who are primarily concerned, just as it is carried out at present by the stewards. The less publicity attached to it the better for racing generally and the individuals themselves. I believe the matter is much better left as it is and, as this Bill is accepted, it should be left so.</P>
      <P>There are some clauses in the Bill in regard to the acquisition of land and so on which will be necessary if the board decides to set up new meetings. These are clauses which will not have any great effect on the general prosperity of racing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will do a great deal of good <Col N="954" /> for racing if it is properly worked, and I believe it will be worked properly.  It is essential, however, that the members of the board should be men in whom the owners generally have confidence and in whom the general public have confidence.  I have no antipathy to the members of the old committees, whose names Deputy Briscoe read in the House to-day.  They are all honourable gentlemen, wherever their residence, they are sportsmen to the heart, who have functioned in various capacities in racing for many years, and in whom the public have every trust.  If any person on the list read out is selected to be a member of the board, I do not see that there can be any objection.  In regard to those cases where the Minister has the power of selection, I hope he will not forget the interests of the small race meeting down the country, and by that I mean in Munster and the West of Ireland.  Those meetings were the foundation of racing&mdash;or of chasing, anyhow.  Many of our famous horses sprang from them, and will spring in the future.  There is great need of good chasing horses in this country.  Some of them will never be discovered, if we have not the small meetings which were quite common up to 10 or 12 years ago.</P>
    <P>As regards the tax, which is the backbone of this Bill, and which will probably draw more opposition than anything else, I hope the Minister will find some method of collecting the tax, and that it will be made clear definitely to everybody, without offering advantages to one side or the other. It should ensure that the man who bets will have only the legal amount of the levy taken off&mdash;no more and no less. The tax should be as small as possible. After all, the average small racegoer goes for the sport of it.  He pays his entry fee and has a little bet, and looks on that as a day's sport.  If he can win a shilling or two, he goes home with a cheerier heart.  Therefore, too much should not be taken off his little winnings, when they do occur, and goodness knows they do not occur very often.  If the experience Deputy Briscoe and I have had is general, the general public do not make anything <Col N="955" /> out of betting, but it is the other way round.  My own experience goes back longer probably than that of any other member of this House, going back for 50 years, and watching people betting and taking part myself, I can say that a good many of the people who took part have disappeared in one way or another, some through betting too much, while others have died out.  I have known only two in the 50 years who ever made any money.  If the bookmakers have any fear that this Bill is going to extinguish them, all I can say is that history is against them.  I can say to the bookmakers, in all sincerity, and paying what tribute I can, that racing without bookmakers could not be carried on.  The Tote is not attractive enough and will never come into violent opposition with the bookmakers. The bookmaker will always be essential to racing, and this Bill will not interfere one bit with his position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewFogarty" hpid="Mr. P.J. Fogarty Mr. P.J. Fogarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened very carefully to the Minister in connection with the Second Reading of this Bill, and I have a certain amount of sympathy with him in his endeavour to steer it through the Dáil.  I realise he has not a great deal of knowledge of the racing and horse-breeding industries. He was amused to learn what a &ldquo;monkey&rdquo; and a &ldquo;pony&rdquo; mean in the racing vernacular.  I am not satisfied that the statements put forward here by the Minister should convince the Dáil to pass this Bill as put before us.  I have my own opinions regarding the Bill, the Title of which is &ldquo;A Bill to provide for the improvement and development of horse breeding and horse racing and the better control of racecourses....&rdquo;  Without going any further, I want to say a few words on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Minister any argument to put forward here that the horse-breeding industry has declined?  Has he any knowledge about the high prices being paid for Irish yearlings and thoroughbred stock at Doncaster and Ballsbridge sales?  Having a small interest in racing, I have attended both Doncaster and Ballsbridge, and Irish bloodstock there has fetched the highest prices.  The Minister has given <Col N="956" /> no indication that Irish bloodstock here is in danger of a decline.  Let him say so, if he fears there is that danger. He cannot do so.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has been in consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, who is principally interested in the bloodstock industry.  He mentioned the Racing Commission in putting this Bill before the House, but he did not consult the bookmaking interests nor the interests of the punters and the public who follow racing.  Who were the Racing Commission that investigated the matter and apparently reported to the Government Department?  Lord Adare, Captain de Burgh, Major Watt, Due de Stacpoole, Captain Gargan.  They are more reminiscent of a British courtmartial than of a board interested in Irish racing.  These gentlemen report, and as a result this Bill is introduced. There is also mention in the Bill of the Irish Turf Club and the Irish Steeplechase Committee.  I have read for a considerable time about Mr. Justice Wylie's &ldquo;Dream of Goodwill&rdquo;, but so far as I can see there is no goodwill in this Bill.  When this Bill was prepared, and when the Press got some intimation of what was in it, Mr. Wylie who, it is my opinion, is the big noise behind it, said that &ldquo;the only way you are going to improve racing in this country is to get it out of betting, to get it out of the bookmakers.&rdquo;  I am not satisfied anyway, and, if this legislation is to improve all horse-breeding in this country, I would like to hear from the Minister whether there has been any decline in it.</P>
    <P>The first speaker on the Opposition side, Deputy Hughes, talked about horse breeding and about the reputation of Irish bloodstock the world over. We all realise that it is high.  He said that this Bill will do certain things, that the finances to be derived through it will be considerable, that we will have high-priced sires and the best stock possible.  I think he showed an utter ignorance of the position.  I want to tell him that the best steeplechasers, the best horses that ever went over chases in this country or in the English Grand National or the Grande Prix in Paris, were sired by a low-priced sire.  My Prince was at stud at <Col N="957" /> 25 guineas and that horse sired Prince Regent and was the sire of Reynolds-town that won the Grand National. He sired three horses that were first in the National.  My Prince, at a fee of 25 guineas, sired the best steeplechasers in the world.  To get down to flat racing, Blandford was one of the best horses we had in this country. The sire of Blandford stood at 20 guineas&mdash;Swinford.</P>
    <P>If you want to improve the horse-breeding industry and the racing industry, do you want to do it at the cost of exterminating bookmakers? This Bill means, in plain language, the pole-axing of bookmakers.  The Minister did not consult the bookmaking interests or the punters' interests when he was bringing forward this Bill.  There is no necessity for the Bill, and he cannot produce arguments to show that there is a necessity to improve the horse-breeding industry, by putting a penal tax on bookmakers of 5 per cent.  It is suggested by the Opposition, and no doubt it will be suggested by other Deputies, that this should be passed on to the public. The Minister for Finance knows that a 2½ per cent. tax was imposed on bookmakers 14 or 15 years ago and it had to be removed because it turned honest men into thieves.  This Bill will do something similar.  Bookmakers could not exist if they have to pay this 5 per cent. tax, and even if the Minister is agreeable to amend it in Committee, to arrange that it will not exceed 2½ per cent., they could not pay it.</P>
    <P>A bookmaker here, it is suggested, would live well on 1 per cent. of his turnover.  I will give one example of a bookmaker laying odds.  He takes in £1,000 for the day and maybe he considers himself lucky at the end of the day if he gets out with £50 credit.  He has to pay his expenses out of that. Maybe, having paid to get into the enclosure and having to bring a car and to meet other expenses, the total amount would come to £10 or £12.  As well as that he will be expected to pay £50 to the Racing Board.</P>
    <P>I would like the House to consider Section 25, which says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Board may make regulations <Col N="958" /> fixing the charges to be made by executives of authorised racecourses to any licensed bookmaker or his assistants accompanying him for admission to authorised racecourses and different charges may be fixed in respect of different authorised racecourses and in respect of different parts of the same authorised racecourse.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is it not quite plain to any man here that if you are on the rail you will pay more than the man not on the rail, and according as your position in the ring is more advantageous, the more you pay?  But there is a sinister motive; it may be that the Minister's draftsman did not realise it, but I think the people in his Department did when they put this in:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Sub-section (6) of Section 3 of the Totalisator Act, 1929 (No. 22 of 1929), is hereby amended by the deletion of all words from the words and the charge to any such licensed bookmaker' to the end of the said sub-section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Do you know what that means, so far as this House is concerned?  According to the Totalisator Act, the racing executive could charge the bookmaker only five times the admission fee.  They are deleting that sub-section which guarantees that the bookmaker will pay only five times the admission charge, in order to give them the power to charge what they like.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out here that to improve racing it is desirable to reduce the admission fee to the public.  Instead of the public paying 10/- to go into the enclosure, the board may decide that they will reduce the charge to 5/-. This section says that the bookmaker on the rail or in any other part of the enclosure will pay in accordance with what the board decides.  Why delete that sub-section from the Totalisator Act of 1929?  That Act went through this House with the approval of the House and it guaranteed that the bookmaker would pay only five times the admission fee charged to the public. That will be removed under this legislation in order to enable the board to reduce the admission fee to the public, but it will not give any benefit to the bookmakers.  They can charge <Col N="959" /> them what they like at racecourses such as the Phoenix Park, Leopardstown, Baldoyle or any other place.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister produced any evidence here that the executives in the metropolitan racecourses want this Bill?  Has he produced any evidence here that the ordinary racing public want the Bill?  It is stated that the funds which will accrue to this board will be used for the reduction of admission fees to the public and for the improvement of the amenities of racecourses. Do they want deck chairs put out for the people who attend race meetings?  What exactly does it mean in relation to the amenities of Baldoyle and Leopardstown?  Are they to put out deck chairs for the people and have wireless sets to announce what is going on around the racecourse?</P>
    <P>This board is to be set up and 11 persons are to be nominated by the Minister.  Section 6 of Part II says: &ldquo;In this section the word `Governor' means a person who is a member of one or other of the governing bodies.&rdquo; What are the governing bodies&mdash;the Irish Turf Club and the National Hunt Steeplechase Committee.  They are this gang of British officers&mdash;Lord Adare, The Due de Stacpoole, Major Watt, Captain Gargan, Major De Burgh and Mr. Wylie.  Mr. Wylie's attitude to bookmakers is to exterminate them.  I do not know how he is getting on with his Goodwill Restaurants and with his goodwill, but I know his goodwill towards bookmakers.  Six members are to be appointed from these governing bodies; in other words, they will control it.  The Minister could appoint five bookmakers, but the board can pole-axe the bookmakers any time they want to.  That is the only word I can find in the English language to describe it.</P>

If Labour were on the Government Benches, I would <Col N="960" /> probably make the same interjection as the Deputy.  These are the men who will control this board. I have a certain amount of sympathy with the Minister because he is not a racing man&mdash;maybe when he goes up to the Park he may become a racing man&mdash; and he has brought forward this Bill conscientiously believing that it is in the interests of the horse-breeding industry.  It is no such thing.  Does the Minister know that, in 1930, there were 122 race meetings in this country and that, in 1940, the first year of the war, the number had increased to 131? Racing in this country at present is at its peak.  It was never as prosperous as it is to-day.</P>

      <P>Bookmakers go to race meetings to make a book, and they have their ups and downs, but the Irish race meeting would lose all its glamour if the bookmakers were not there.  I do not know whether Deputy Coogan is a racing man or not, but if he or anybody else went to a race meeting and did not hear the shouts of the bookmakers, or if there was one bookmaker missing on the rails, he would say: &ldquo;What happened to Dick Power to-day or what happened to so and so?&rdquo;  In countries in which bookmakers have been done away with, mechanical betting has not been in the interests of racing.  I have here a cutting from a British paper of an article written by a racing correspondent who was over here It says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No one will question the good intentions of the new measure, but it strikes one as rather unfortunate that reforms of such a character should be mooted at a time when Irish racing was approaching the peak point of prosperity.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Bill, the public are to be admitted to racecourses at reduced charges, but the Minister stated in his introductory speech that this tax should be passed on to the public, so that the public are to be allowed in for 5/- instead of 10/-, and then asked to pay 30/- tax.  Why not do the right thing, and, if you think it necessary, <Col N="961" /> charge entertainment tax?  The punter does not want this Bill, the racing executives do not want it and the small owner does not want it, because the small owner in the ordinary course of events has to depend on successful betting to keep his stable going.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be wise to reconsider this matter before Committee Stage, and not to be led away by this gang I have referred to&mdash;Mr. Wylie, Lord Adare, Major De Burgh, Major Watt, Captain Gargan, and the Due de Stacpoole.  The names are reminiscent of a British courtmartial.  To meet their requirements, what do you propose to do?  You propose to penalise, to exterminate a lot of good Irish nationals.  The bookmakers of this country gave all they could to the national movement, and the Minister knows it well.  Even if they did not give support in the firing line, there was one thing just as important in those days&mdash;finance, and the bookmakers were always generous to the national movement.  The Minister should not penalise them or exterminate them as this Bill will exterminate them.</P>
    <P>Let the Minister go back and examine the position which obtained when the 2½ per cent. tax was placed on bets.  Let him see what happened then.  I went with other bookmakers on a deputation to the Minister at that time, and when we put our case before him the Minister realised that the 2½ per cent. tax on course bets was not justified, and it was transferred to S.P. bets.  Running a bookmaker's S.P. office is a completely different game from making a book on the course. Deputy McGilligan, on the occasion of that debate, butted in and said that I had &ldquo;ratted&rdquo; on the bookmakers. He may have more experience of rats than I have, but making a book in an office is a completely different game from making a book on the course. There is another section in this Bill which the Minister has not considered at all.  The ordinary bookmaker obtains a licence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following motion which appears on the Order Paper in the names of Deputy Beirne and myself:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That, in view of the fact that main roads throughout the country are now national highways and arteries of transport, Dáil Eireann is of opinion that their construction and maintenance should be made a national charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, the main roads are maintained by a 60 per cent. charge on rates and a 40 per cent. contribution from the national fund.  We hold that the construction and maintenance of main roads should be a national charge because they are of national importance, in peace time for ordinary transport and in war time for defence.  The quality and condition of these roads vary from county to county, getting worse towards the west.  The tourist is unaware of this.  He realises that only when he is on an inferior highway.  He does not know that he has crossed into another county.  This variation cannot be removed under the present system because counties differ in wealth.  The only way to get roads of uniform high quality is to make the Central Fund responsible for their construction and maintenance.  In view of the importance of tourist traffic, post-war, this is most urgent.  A 60 per cent. charge on the ratepayers is an unfair burden, especially when you consider that the bulk of the population is agricultural. The amount which they pay for road maintenance is disproportionate to the benefit they receive.  In Kerry, one of the greatest tourist counties in Ireland, the sum of 7/6 in the £ was allocated last year for roads from a rate of 23/- in the £, and yet the Kerry roads are the worst in Ireland, particularly those in North Kerry.  I do not know if the proposed scheme for the construction of a network of main roads will be financed out of the Central Fund.  It certainly could not be met out of the rates.  I would like to have an assurance from the Minister that the charge will be made a national one.  It is time <Col N="963" /> that it was no longer left as a local liability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBernieSnr" hpid="Mr. Beirne Mr. Beirne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. As a member of a dissolved body&mdash; the Roscommon County Council&mdash;I cannot envisage what the result of the motion will be as far as the Parliamentary Secretary is concerned.  I hope that in regard to this motion he will not display the same vindictiveness as the Minister displayed in the case of Roscommon.  Deputy Finucane and myself are sponsoring this motion in a spirit of sincerity.  I do not intend to waste the time of the House discussing the merits or demerits of the action of the Minister in dissolving the Roscommon County Council.  I know that he has been uncharitable to us here in the House by some uncomplimentary remarks which he passed during my absence.  I hope to have another opportunity of making an ample reply to those charges.</P>
      <P>The main roads must be considered as part of our national capital.  Their use is not confined to the local inhabitants.  They are the channels of transport for the whole country, and, therefore, their upkeep and maintenance should be a national charge. Under the present system of upkeep and maintenance, it is impossible to assign to each local area the benefit it derives from good main roads.  It is impossible to assess in money the advantages which a local area receives and which an outside area receives.  It is impossible to assess what part of the burden each should bear, because it must be realised that costs should have some relation to the benefit derived. Therefore, I think that the main roads and highways should be made a Central Fund charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the policy of the Government at the present time to keep the main roads in as good condition as possible. The Government have stipulated on various occasions that these roads should reach a certain standard of perfection. Orders are given to the local authority by the Government.  It is told that it must do so-and-so with certain roads.  Naturally, the people who give those orders should shoulder <Col N="964" /> the responsibility, as far as the financial side is concerned.  I do not wish to revert again to the County Roscommon, but I will give the House an instance of what happened in Roscommon in order to vindicate, as far as possible, the action of the Roscommon County Council&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not treat it specifically. I will do it in a more general way.  I propose to read a small paragraph from a circular which was issued by the Department of Local Government and Public Health in order to convey to the House how utterly impossible it is for county councils to function in respect to road estimates. That being so, the county council cannot handle these questions efficiently, owing to the action of the Minister.  They are not the deciding factor.  If they say the roads are quite good enough for the people and, if the Minister decides otherwise, the Minister's ruling must prevail.</P>
      <P>I shall deal with this in a general way.  Some considerable time ago a circular was issued by the Minister's Department in which it was stated:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The elected representatives are <Col N="965" /> given by the Act of 1945 powers in connection with the exercise by the county manager of executive functions. The manager is bound by the decisions of the elected body on the provision made by them in the annual estimates and save with their consent he cannot exceed the total amount provided by them for any particular purpose.  He must, whenever requested by the local authority, furnish all information in his possession or procurable concerning any business of the authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to point out to the House the ridiculous position that county councils find themselves in at the present moment.  If county councils decide that the roads in their county fulfil the requirements of the local ratepayers or inhabitants, and if they are not desirous of spending more money on the roads, if the Minister decides otherwise, the county council ceases automatically to function.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that the areas where roads are most in need of repair are, generally speaking, the poorer areas, mountain and bog areas.  In the latter case heavy rains and frosts have a detrimental effect on the roads.  In the case of bogs it is most difficult and expensive to make the roads suitable to the trades carried on in the area.  I do not think it is logical to put a heavier financial burden on poorer areas than is imposed in the rich, flat counties where the surface of the roads wears longer.</P>
    <P>During the emergency the Minister and several of his colleagues on the Government Benches stated, on more than one occasion, that our main roads are now considered of national strategic importance for defence purposes. Therefore, there is every reason to put these roads, as far as maintenance and upkeep is concerned, on the same basis as our Defence Forces. From that point of view, I think it is ridiculous to make the upkeep and maintenance of main roads a local charge.  It would be just as ridiculous to ask each county to raise, maintain and equip its own army, navy or air force.  That is a point which should <Col N="966" /> be stressed and which should appeal to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I maintain, and I am sure the majority of Deputies agree with me, that Córas Iompair Éireann will have a monopoly of the road services of this country.  Roads must be raised to a standard to cope with this heavy traffic, which will be greater than the normal traffic has been for the last nine or ten years.  In equity, the railways, or at least the Government, who have been responsible for the passage of the Transport Bill through the House, should finance main roads. Córas Iompair Éireann will be the largest user of roads.  The private user, the man with the ass and cart, the man with the horse and cart, will not be so destructive of the roads.  I think it is logical and reasonable to expect the Government to accept the full burden and responsibility of the maintenance and upkeep of main roads.</P>
    <P>In the year 1940 the amount collected and placed to the Road Fund from road tax, petrol tax and other duties, amounted to something over £3,000,000.  That was not an abnormal year.  It was fairly normal.  We were not then in the throes of a world-wide conflict.  As far as I can ascertain&mdash; I may not be correct in my figures&mdash; the expenditure on roads in that year was in the neighbourhood of £1,700,000.  That leaves a wide margin between income and expenditure.  The Minister may ask me where the money is to come from but where you had an income of £3,000,000 in 1940 and an expenditure of £1,700,000 there is a nice margin for the maintenance of the roads.</P>
    <P>I earnestly appeal to the Minister to give this motion his favourable consideration. All Deputies will agree that it is a reasonable motion, put forward in a spirit of sincerity.  I hope I am correct in anticipating that the Minister will accept this motion, in view of the fact that we are approaching what may be termed the post-war period, when reconstruction of roads must reach elaborate proportions, when roads must be made for the pedestrian, the cyclist and the motorist.  Now is the time to start.  I do not think the <Col N="967" /> motion is premature, and I heartily commend it to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the principle of this motion.  I cannot altogether agree with either the proposer or the seconder.  While it is quite true, unfortunately, that some of the main and trunk roads are in a very bad condition&mdash;and that is probably true of the counties where the roads should be in the best possible condition, the tourist and holiday counties &mdash;I think that, to some extent anyway, if not to a large extent, their present state is due to neglect in the past, or because the local authorities in the past were not prepared to make the necessary provision for the upkeep of the roads.</P>
      <P>The principle in the motion is one which I have favoured for a great number of years.  I think it is more essential now than ever.  I do not believe that the Minister or any member of the House believes that we can face the future, in view of the immense expansion there will be in heavy road transport, having our main and trunk roads financed in the way they have been financed in the past.  It is essential that they should be uniformly good over every county.  Undoubtedly there is a good deal in what has been said, that it is much more expensive to construct a main or trunk road in certain counties than in others.  Undoubtedly, it is much more expensive to maintain main or trunk roads in certain counties, owing to a variety of reasons, the principal one being availability of material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The emergency has created special problems so far as the maintenance of roads is concerned, and I can imagine a county like Kerry being particularly hard hit, where there is a large number of heavy lorries carrying turf out of the county to practically the whole of the south of Ireland, over roads that were never constructed to carry such heavy loads.  Similarly, in other parts of the country converging on the beet factories, there is a strain being put on roads that they were never intended to bear.  I know that the Minister can say in reply that perhaps it would pay <Col N="968" /> the people in Kerry to maintain the roads because of the immense sale of turf that is taking place down there. That is beside the point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Shall I say that it is beside the main point?  I want to hear the Minister's own idea about main and trunk roads.  The Minister told us, not here but in another place, about the very ambitious plans that he had for main and trunk roads, plans so wide and so grand that I began to wonder whether&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that there are some important proposals still mentioned in the Dáil before they are mentioned in places outside.  Does the Minister contend that we can build and maintain trunk roads to carry the traffic of the future if they are financed in the way they have been financed in the past?  The Minister knows far better than I do that trunk roads, main roads, or any county roads for that matter, have not been receiving for the past five years the attention that they normally would receive.  He knows that most of the road staffs of the various counties, instead of being employed on the roads, are employed on the bogs.  He is well aware that the most important of the road-making materials required for proper road making are not available to-day.  The Minister is aware&mdash;I will be surprised if he has not plans made already&mdash;that very large sums of money will have to be spent on the construction of main and trunk roads when the war is over.  I am sure the Minister has been advised by his experts long before this that, so far as roads running over or through bogs are concerned, as many of our main and trunk roads do, these roads will have to be put down in concrete in the future; that they are no longer able to carry heavy lorries, some of them carrying up to ten or 15 tons and some of them, with trailers attached, carrying more.  The whole point seems to <Col N="969" /> me to come to the question of whether, with all the talk we have about grandiose post-war plans, with the Minister's idea of a sort of huge roadway with three roads in one, he thinks these are to be financed by the local authorities, plus the Road Fund and plus something else.  Incidentally, I should like the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary to say whether the figures given by the proposer and the seconder of the motion are correct; whether the 60 per cent. for main roads, the £3,000,000 for 1940 and the expenditure of £1,700,000 are correct. I think the principle of the motion is a sound one.  It is one that will have to be accepted, if not now, certainly in the very near future.  I do not doubt for a moment that the Minister has probably made up his mind on that matter already, even if he is not prepared to admit it in reply to a motion such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies, I believe that local authorities will find it very difficult to carry out the construction and repair of roads when you take into consideration that many pieces of legislation have been passed and handed over to the local authorities to operate with a consequent increase in the rates generally.  As has been suggested, I believe that the main roads should be a national charge. Moneys coming from the Central Fund, which have been subscribed by tourists in many ways, would help to finance the maintenance of such roads. Even in my own county, where we have very nearly the best roads in Ireland, we find it very difficult to provide adequate funds this year to keep the roads up to the standard at which they were being kept heretofore.  During the emergency we were not able to provide sufficient funds for that purpose, and we were unable to provide sufficient material to keep the roads in good condition.  By having the roads maintained out of State funds the local authorities would have an opportunity of providing better secondary roads and of constructing boreens and so on which would be of benefit to the farmers and the ratepayers generally. Like other Deputies, I hold that as <Col N="970" /> time goes on the ratepayers will be unable to bear the burden that will be placed on them for the maintenance of the roads.</P>
      <P>Quite recently we passed a new Transport Bill through this House and no provision was made in that for the maintenance of the main roads, even though everybody will admit that after the emergency possibly 90 per cent. of the traffic in this country will be on the public highways.  The new company will utilise the roads for buses and heavy goods-carrying vehicles, and it is unfair to expect local authorities, even with the grant they get from the Central Fund, to maintain these roads in a condition suitable to carry such traffic.  As Deputy Morrissey said, there is increased traffic on the roads due to the production of turf.  The effect of the carrying of that turf on the roads places a very heavy burden on the rates.  The roads are not in a condition to stand up to that traffic. The same thing applies to sugar beet. The roads adjacent to the sugar factories are in a very bad state of repair and the local authorities responsible for the maintenance of such roads either have to increase the rates or leave some other roads unattended to in order to provide the money to keep the main roads in first- class condition.  For that reason, I think the Minister would do a very good day's work by relieving the local authorities of responsibility for the maintenance of the main roads.  Every county council has more than its share to bear in providing finances for social services and for the maintenance of the other roads without having to maintain the main roads in the manner expected of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion as it is a constructive one.  The great idea is to help the Minister, and also to help ourselves.  God helps those who help themselves.  After living here in the city for many years, when I went home I saw the main roads being reconstructed, particularly the Dublin-Cork road.  I think the cost of that road was £965 per statute mile. The reconstruction of these roads <Col N="971" /> helped the tourist traffic.  When the motorists came, the unfortunate people living on the trunk roads soon found a grievance.  We know that originally there were four main roads from Tara &mdash;north, south, east, and west, and other roads were gradually evolved from them.  I suppose Dublin had only a few thousand of population, and that the present provincial towns were mere hamlets.  The roads were built by the men on the land, and they have first claim on them.  However, the Seventh Commandment has not been rigidly observed, and the roads have been stolen.  I do not object to the motorists having proper roads.  We hear a lot about the new wide ones, and that railway traffic may become less and less.  Obviously, the roads are very important arteries of the nation.  I enjoy a run in a motor car as much as anybody else, and am not anti-motor in any sense.  When these new roads come to be constructed, I suggest that if they are three widths of a bus in the middle, a width and a half should be left at either side, with a surface to suit the quadruped traffic.  We had no right to spend huge sums in making the roads an El Dorado for the motorist.  I know the main road from Dublin to Cork, where it enters Tipperary at Longford Pass, and leaves at Mitchelstown, and there is not a quarter of a mile of it where there was not a skull broken, or horses' knees broken.  I had the experience myself when I had a flashy American trotter. I could handle the reins pretty well, and was going to the fair at Clonmel. But the next thing was that I woke up in a local hospital.  I thought I was in heaven, until I saw the gentleman with the white coat.</P>

A lot of farmers live on the main roads.  I live on a sub-main road, but have some land bordering on the main road.

      <P>I was nearly motionless as a result of the motion I am dealing with.  On the main roads there are loads of filth and dirt and a Yankee drew my attention to it.  He said it would come out 10 times over.  The mud is put in 40 times by the men and pushed out again by the cattle and motors.  That is not good business nor is it economic.  Deputy Morrissey suggested that roads cost a good deal for one reason or another.  The Curragh road has a bog foundation and concrete is the only thing for that, as the ordinary macadamised road will not take the strain.  The beet factories bring extra traffic to the roads.  We have one in Thurles and our roads are suffering as a result.  We want to give the Minister every help in regard to this matter and to deal with it in a friendly way.  We want to make Ireland the El Dorado for the tourists as every pound that comes in will be useful. The tourists are welcome, but we should make the roads passable for the ordinary men who originally built them, and from whom they were stolen. Most Deputies are quite friendly in this matter and, with the proposer and seconder of the motion, are anxious to help the Minister in any way possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is one which should be accepted generally by all Parties, as most Deputies realise that in their own counties there is a continual increase in the rates.  Some increases can be understood, but it is hard for the average farmer to agree to an increase in order to widen roads to facilitate motorists or tourists, particularly when he has to shoulder the expense out of his own pocket.  Often the local councillor has to make an unles <Col N="973" /> fair attack upon the county surveyor, who is only carrying out his duty when he widens a road or cuts off a dangerous corner.  He has to do that and the ratepayer has to pay for it.  I come from a county that is very badly treated as regards roads.  Under the first period of reconstruction after we achieved our independence in this part of Ireland, the foundation was not laid properly.  We find to-day that if these roads are to be built on the lines visualised by the Minister, we shall have to lay completely new foundations. We shall have to widen and strengthen them, have bridges rebuilt and corners cut and many other things done which were not thought of when the roads were constructed under a previous Administration.</P>
      <P>I noticed during my travels through County Mayo many examples of what I would consider wasteful expenditure. I regard them as wasteful, because I know that the ratepayers are not in a position to meet this heavy expenditure. For instance, the county surveyor may start a new road or remove a corner and he branches off in a certain direction to make another road straighter.  I have seen where some thousands of pounds have been spent and when the work is completed we find a corner is still as dangerous as ever or a road is too narrow to meet modern traffic conditions.  In some cases bridges and walls that were erected had to be knocked down in order to widen the road.  That sort of thing naturally annoys the ratepayers. We feel that the present system of road construction in our county&mdash;and I expect it is the same in other counties &mdash;will not be sufficient to meet modern traffic and the roads will have to be reconstructed&mdash;rebuilt, widened and corners cut.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To expect the ratepayers to meet two-thirds of the cost of that work is expecting too much.  Even assuming the State will meet one-third of the expenditure, the ratepayers will not be able to pay the balance because they have to contribute to many other social services.  As Deputy Beirne and other Deputies pointed out, we have a very heavy rainfall along the western seaboard and that is detrimental to <Col N="974" /> the roads in so far as it tends to wear down the road surfaces.  When a pothole occurs it may be small at first, not much bigger than the palm of one's hand, but cars and lorries help to widen it in a very short time and then the weather affects it considerably and it increases in size until it becomes quite formidable.</P>
    <P>We find in Mayo that in order to keep the roads up to an efficient standard the rates are increasing to such an extent that we will soon be paying 20/- in the £.  I wonder how the ratepayers are to face that, in addition to shouldering other heavy burdens?  We must take into consideration the poor, economic circumstances of many parts of Mayo, as well as many parts of Galway, West Roscommon, parts of Sligo and other neighbouring counties.  We must remember that in many of the Midland counties the people are wealthier; they have fertile lands and the rates are only half what they are in County Mayo.  When we realise that, we see there is every argument for more equitable treatment for people in a county like Mayo.  We realise that the people generally are not equitably shouldering the burden, and they should do so.  If we had a national scheme of road construction the burden would be equally shared.</P>
    <P>No doubt the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary have difficulties confronting them, but I believe that if they accept this motion their difficulties will become less.  When a county council, which is vested with certain authority, opposes an increase in an estimate brought forward by the county manager or the secretary, we find the Minister is the very gentleman who will order the abolition of that council.  He feels they are not entitled to oppose an estimate, as the roads must be kept in proper repair and are important so far as the defence of the country is concerned.  I quite agree that the roads are important in that connection.  I venture to say that in Germany to-day the roads are playing a more important part than the railway system.  Where the railway termini are destroyed, the roads have to carry all the transport. <Col N="975" /> Therefore, I fully appreciate the Minister's point that we must keep the roads in proper repair, irrespective of cost.  But if we consider it necessary to have great modern highways constructed along Continental lines, it is too bad to expect the poor, simple ratepayers to bear the burden.</P>
    <P>I agree that to keep the types of roads we have in this country in an efficient condition would certainly cost a very large sum.  I am convinced that if we are to present this country to the outer world as an attractive country for tourists, who may be desirous of visiting it after the war and who may not be desirous of visiting France or Germany or other countries because of the devastation and the difficulty of transport that will continue there for many years, it will mean the expenditure of vast sums of money.  Foreigners may like to visit this country to see for themselves a land which has not been touched by war to the same extent as Continental countries.  There are many outsiders who would like to travel through this country, to see the people who remained out of the war. If we are to make the country attractive and construct good roads so as to receive these people properly, then I contend the expense of that can more properly be borne by the Minister. He should accept this motion and arrange that the necessary funds will come out of the national Exchequer and that the people generally will share the responsibility for the maintenance of the roads.</P>
    <P>If the money necessary for drainage, rural electrification and other important developments is to come out of the Central Fund, I think the highways of the country should be put on the same basis.  I support the Minister and the Government when they say that we should have modern highways. I fully support any Government, irrespective of their political outlook, when they advocate up-to-date highways and generally improved conditions. I want to see in this country the best type of roads, good motor roads, good side paths and proper roads for horse vehicles.  I am not opposed to that idea of modern <Col N="976" /> development.  Where I disagree with the Minister is when he expects local authorities to foot two-thirds of the bill.</P>
    <P>In Westmeath the rates are 11/6 in the £; in Kildare they are 14/- or 15/- in the £; in Kerry they are 24/3 in the £; and, in my own county, the day is dawning when they will be £1 in the £. I do not suggest that the money is spent extravagantly, but I am suggesting that the people will not be able to continue to carry this burden, and I feel that the easier way of dealing with it is that road construction should be made a national charge in the same way as drainage, rural electrification and other important undertakings on which we expect to embark in the post-war period.</P>
    <P>This is not a political motion.  It is not put down for the purpose of getting publicity.  We are far away from an election and we do not expect an election to-morrow or in 12 months' time.  This is something put down in all sincerity, something about which I believe members on the Government Benches hold the same view as I hold, that they cannot continue going to their local authority and voting for an annual increase in the estimates, that they must cry halt, that they must draw the line and that the only way in which that line can be drawn and that halt brought about is by asking the State to shoulder the responsibility on a broader basis and to undertake the upkeep of these roads, because the State benefits from it.  It is not so much the poor local farmer as the wealthier classes who benefit.  There are wealthy classes in this country who can afford to be taxed still further.  I have heard Ministers say that the wealthier classes are taxed to the limit, but I maintain that there are wealthy people in the country who are not yet sufficiently taxed.  I can go into hotels in the city and see well-to-do old ladies going to ballroom dances, engineers' dinners and functions of the kind wearing bouquets which cost 30/-. These people can afford to pay an increased surtax, income-tax or any other tax from which we can derive the necessary finance to maintain these roads.  There are people who are <Col N="977" /> escaping and who should be forced to share with the ordinary poor people this burden which we are carrying to-day.</P>

      <P>I think we must try in connection with this resolution to relieve our minds of certain false assumptions when discussing the question of whether the ratepayers or the State should bear a certain proportion of the money for road maintenance.  The motion was proposed by a Deputy from a county whose local representatives have failed utterly to carry out their responsibilities during past years, and who, for four years, reduced their contribution towards road maintenance from £40,000 to £2,000, until the Minister had to take drastic action.  It should be noted that there are other counties in which there are administrations largely composed of farmers, counties which have been considered poor in comparison with other counties, counties in which there are not the same attractions from the tourist standpoint, which have never failed to carry out their responsibilities, which have never failed to vote a proper sum for road maintenance.  I think there is some significance in the fact that this resolution was proposed by a Deputy from that county, but as members of the Farmers' Party are putting this motion forward with rather a tentative air, not feeling very sure of themselves, asking for information and saying they would like to co-operate with the Minister in a discussion of this problem, I propose to discuss the resolution from every angle and I hope that such observations as I am able to make will be of value to the House, because we very rarely have an opportunity of discussing problems such as road maintenance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion is based on a number of what I think are false conceptions.  The first is that travel on main roads in a particular county is, to a considerable degree, non-county in character.  The <Col N="978" /> assumption is made that people in Galway, for example, are not using the main roads for their own private purposes, that they are not using them to move from one town to another. Another assumption made is that no one in County Galway leaves County Galway, goes to some other county and makes use of another county's roads. A third factor of great importance is that the assumption is made that local interests have no national significance. Is it suggested, for example, that we should stop cutting turf in Kerry because the rate payers in Kerry find it difficult to bear the cost of repairing the roads?  Is it suggested that reasonable, or even very modest, profits are not being made in cutting turf in Kerry from which can be deducted the necessary sums in the form of a local contribution, heavily supplemented by a State contribution, for the repair of the roads carrying that turf?  Is it suggested that we should have considered seriously the location of the sugar factories because of the heavy expenditure of money on repairing roads used by the lorries carrying beet?</P>
    <P>There are a great many factors which we have to consider before we can judge the truth of the issue.  The main problem involved is whether we should transfer expenditure from local funds to central funds.  I do not want to enter into the discussion which we have had frequently here with regard to the general problem of derating and so forth, but it is essential to say at this point that the transfer of that part of the rate which goes towards road maintenance to the Central Fund does not mean that the farmers will not eventually bear the cost of the roads in the same way.  In fact, I might point out with some irony that if we were to do that, we might well start to consider taxing sugar in order to pay for the repair of the roads carrying beet.  It may sound fantastic, but if money is to be found from central sources in order to maintain the main roads, where are we to find it?  It is by no means a fanciful statement to suggest that we should have complaints from the Farmers' Party that the farmer consumers of sugar were paying a tax in order to repair the roads.  We might <Col N="979" /> equally tax the farmers' tobacco which, God knows, is already expensive enough&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in order to repair the roads carrying turf.  I understand that farmers have not over-complained so far about the modest or the large sums they have been able to make out of cutting turf. It is a very dangerous principle to assume that the transfer of local taxes means eventually that farmers will escape their responsibilities.  They are the principal body of citizens in the country and if we pile additional taxation on to persons who are supposed to be non-farmers in the case of direct taxes, we will find that, in one way or another, a good deal of the taxation will go back to the farmer again.</P>
      <P>Leaving aside these general principles, let us consider the resolution in more detail.  There are roughly 50,000 miles of roads in this country.  Of these, 10,000 miles consist of main roads and the remaining 40,000 miles of roads which are not considered vital arteries of traffic.  If we reduced the 10,000 miles to the barest minimum from the standpoint of the ultimate importance to what might be described as the person travelling nationally, we will find that there are at least 1,500 miles of very important arterial roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State at the present time contributes nearly the whole of the cost of the improvement of main roads, that is to say, the cost of the major reconstruction of such roads, and gives 40 per cent. towards the maintenance of main roads.  We believe that represents an adequate contribution by the State to the local authorities.  In support of that, I would like to give the House a few figures.  On the occasion of a former debate here some Deputies complained that we were too statistical. Well, I hope that, in connection with the roads, we shall not be accused of that, because if we talk about roads and taxation we must get to grips with the actual problem.  In the period 1932 to 1942 there was a total expenditure of some £25,000,000 <Col N="980" /> on roads of which all, but a very small fraction of under £1,000,000, was current expenditure.  Road Fund grants for improvements, plus Road Fund grants towards maintenance, totalled some £8,500,000.  In addition to that, a sum of over £3,000,000 was made available for expenditure for the provision of employment.  Thus there was a total of over £11,000,000 as State contribution, compared with a total expenditure of £25,000,000.  Owing to relief grants, there was a considerable increase in the proportion of State contribution, as compared with the previous ten years.  I will not trouble the House with the details, but it may be stated that, whereas £11,000,000 out of £25,000,000 represented the State contribution in the period 1932 to 1942, in the previous period, from 1922 to 1932, out of a total expenditure of some £23,000,000, the State contributed £8,000,000.  Therefore, this Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that. I would ask Deputies to bear in mind that I am trying to deal with the matter in detail, and that I am giving all the facts within reason.  As I have said, this Government has actually increased, quite considerably, the proportion of money voted by the State towards the total cost of road maintenance and improvements.  A number of Deputies have spoken about the position in the poor counties.  They have adverted to the fact that, in the western counties, the roads have poor natural foundations and that the cost of maintenance is correspondingly heavier for the ratepayers.  I should mention in that connection that, <Col N="981" /> generally speaking, the counties where the road foundations are poor are the counties where there is congestion, where there are large numbers on the unemployment register, and where the proportion of unemployment grants is high as compared with richer counties. We could argue for a long time as to whether, in fact, the result of giving an undue proportion, or a large proportion, of the employment moneys to the poorer counties would satisfy the opinions and feelings of the Farmer-Deputies. We think that, having regard to every consideration, the leeway is made up, and that we have, in fact, to a reasonable extent in the past, helped those counties with their poorer road foundations since they have received a very large proportion of the funds available for the relief of unemployment.  I think that is the most I can say in regard to the criticism made that we have neglected those counties.  I can say that very large sums have been made available, for example, in the County Mayo, and in the County Kerry, and that in some of the western counties the proportion which is asked from the ratepayers as an offset to the amount paid by the State in the way of relief is very reasonable, especially in the case of roads, to enable those poorer areas to deal with what is admittedly a difficult situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to advert again to another aspect of this resolution.  If the State were to take over the construction and maintenance of main roads it is to be presumed that we would have to engage a staff for that work, that we would have to administer the staff and negotiate in regard to wages in order to carry out the work of maintaining and improving only 10,000 miles out of 50,000 miles of road. This raises a very serious problem of duplication in administration which would be inevitable if the State, in its own right, took over responsibility for administration.  It would not be possible to dismiss the proportion of county surveyors, assistant county surveyors and other road officials which would be represented by the amount of work they did in maintaining and improving the main roads in a particular <Col N="982" /> county.  Therefore, the proposal would result in an increase of staff and in a duplication of work.  I think myself that, so long as that proportion of mileage remains, it would be most inadvisable to do what the proposers suggest.  I think it is better for us to have co-ordination between the local authority and the State: to have co-ordination, supervision, co-operation as between the officials of the engineering section of the Department of Local Government and the Department of Finance rather than that the State should take over the entire administration of the main roads of the country. I should like to hear any Deputies suggest how this very grave difficulty is to be obviated.  Do they propose, for example, that although we are to maintain and improve the main roads entirely at the State's expense, we are to leave the staffing and the administration entirely in the hands of the local authority?  Would that be reasonable in the circumstances?</P>

      <P>Again, while dealing with the general problem of road construction in this country, mention has been made of the difficulties that we shall have to face in the post-war period in regard not only to the repair of roads that have deteriorated during the emergency because of lack of tar and of other circumstances which are well known to the House but also in carrying out the road plan which has been announced on a number of occasions by the Minister.  I want to state here and now that when the Minister made the announcement that we had now commenced scientific road planning he had no intention of imposing on the country a grandiose system of roads, the cost of which had no relation to the national income of the country or to current economic circumstances.  He had no intention of suggesting that because of some new scientific conception that there should be a double-track road from one area to another, that we would go ahead and build that road regardless of the state of the <Col N="983" /> national Budget, regardless of our export trade level, and regardless of other economic circumstances.  The purpose of the road plan is to see how far we can plan ahead having regard, first of all, to the national income, and, secondly, to the requirements on the road arising from an increase of motor traffic.  We decided, as far as possible, to formulate a plan which would avoid waste, which would avoid doing work twice on a road where work could be done once, of avoiding, for example, making curves on a road which, in a few years, would be out of date and would require remaking because of the increase in the number of vehicles on that particular road.</P>

      <P>We decided to inaugurate that road plan in order that we should have, as far as possible, standard methods of construction, that we should avoid waste by not authorising particular road schemes in which in fact the road was being made too wide for traffic that was likely to occur in the future, or that we should avoid a very large amount of money being spent on a road, widening it by a certain distance, say, a few feet, when, in fact, so far as we could tell from the increase in traffic on that road, in another ten years it would require widening again, when we might well afford out of the limits of our income from the Road Fund to do the entire widening for ten years and gradually improve the road in that way while maintaining the remainder of the road in a reasonable state of repair.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The road plan will, we hope, do as much to avoid wasteful expenditure as to ensure a good road system designed to carry the traffic which we anticipate when the war is over.  We classified our roads on the basis of what we thought the increase in vehicular traffic was likely to be, using the increase that has occurred between the years 1928 and 1939.  That again is to some degree <Col N="984" /> speculative.  When motor cars, parts of motor cars, tyres, petrol and oil are in full supply, it is quite possible that motor traffic will not increase at the same rate from that particular year for the next ten years as the recorded increase from 1928 to 1939.  We shall have to take due account of that.  We cannot be reckless in formulating our road plan but we can at least give advice to county surveyors and give them the framework of a plan which we hope to follow, as far as possible, and which we can adapt if necessary if we see that our prognostications are not in fact correct.  I have great faith that when the surveyors receive our advice and instructions in regard to the use of the plan the result will be a considerable saving of money to the ratepayers and to the taxpayers per mile of road constructed.</P>
      <P>I may add that it is not going to be an easy task.  It is very easy to formulate a road plan and very difficult to apply it in practice.  It will, for example, enable us, when allocating the Road Fund to each county, to take due account of all the circumstances of a technical character as well as the circumstances of a financial character. As Deputies know, the Road Fund is allocated to each county having regard to a number of different factors: the population in the county, the number of miles of main road, the proportion of Road Fund received from that county, and other circumstances.  Using these factors, we allocated a proportion of the Road Fund to each county. In future, when the road plan is in full operation, it shall be possible to take account of the technical factors which, again, should redound to the interest of the ratepayers and the taxpayers alike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the road plan announced by the Minister should relieve the fears of ratepayers who are under the impression that they may be saddled with some enormous, undue expenditure after the war The road plan is a controller of expenditure as well as a creator of expenditure.  There is no question that if we are to have a sound, efficient agricultural economy and a sound efficient industrial economy, we shall <Col N="985" /> have to spend money on roads and we all hope that our national income will permit that expenditure and that we shall engage in such internal and external trade as will make it possible for us to carry out the plan in full. But, as I have said, the road plan will be not only a creator but a controller of road expenditure by ratepayers and taxpayers alike.</P>
    <P>Deputies have asked for some information in regard to the receipts from the Road Fund.  The receipts have varied in different years.  They have steadily risen with the increase in motor traffic and whereas in 1923 the figure was £421,500, in 1938-39 the figure reached the very high total of £1,162,000.  As Deputies will know from a question that was asked recently, the vast proportion of the Road Fund has been spent on the roads and although there has been a contribution from the Road Fund to the Exchequer that has been more than offset by the proportion of the Employment Fund spent on road improvement.  Taking the proportion of the Employment Fund that has been expended on the roads and the Road Fund less the contribution of the Road Fund to the Exchequer, I do not think it can be said that the ratepayers have suffered in any way or have been deprived of the value of the motor licences which have been paid through the local authority.</P>
    <P>The House may be interested to know that in 1932 there were 5,137 miles of dust-free surfaces in this country and, by 1942 the figure had reached over 12,000 miles, indicating a very great progress in making modern roads.  Deputies interested in rural districts will also be aware of the fact that in future road-planning we intend to provide, as far as we are able, a special surface for the use of farm carts on steep gradients and wherever it is deemed advisable.  There again we shall have to take into account the fact that the use by the farming community of motor vehicles has enormously increased.  We shall have to adjust our views with regard to farm tracks, having regard to the needs of the farmer who brings his <Col N="986" /> horse and cart to market and the farmer who will tend to use motor vehicles in the future.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any need for me, at this point, to repeat the road standards we have adopted.  They have been given to the House and they have also been mentioned on various other occasions, but I can assure the House that our road standards are going to be reasonable and are not just grandiose in character.  We believe that they are going to be practicable in every sense, provided the national income permits us to expend the necessary moneys thereon.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made in the motion that the State should take over the maintenance of main roads.  For the maintenance of main roads the grant in 1938 was £342,000; the improvement grant was £426,000.  If that suggestion is carried out, another £513,000 will be required.  In other words, we will have to take the whole of the Improvement Fund, plus £87,000, in order to carry out the terms of the motion.  It will be hard enough to find money for road construction and repair after the war without disturbing the present proportions of local and central taxation for roads, and the Government's opinion is that it would be most undesirable to disturb that proportion and that the State contribution, having regard to all the circumstances, is fairly equitable.</P>
    <P>Another reason for rejecting this motion is the fact that, once you divide roads specifically into roads controlled entirely by the State and roads controlled entirely by the local authorities, it is quite evident that there will be bound to be conflicts.  I do not think the Minister or any member of any Party having a reasonable view on these things would enjoy the prospect which would ensue if we had continued disputes as to which roads should be transferred from the local authority to the national authority for the purpose of maintenance and improvement. Naturally, that proportion of 10,000 miles of main roads to 40,000 miles of local roads may alter; in connection with every alteration there would be a dispute <Col N="987" /> and representations would be made by county councillors and Deputies, and I do not think that that would create a desirable atmosphere in which to carry out road construction and maintenance.</P>
    <P>The House would perhaps like a few figures which would show the position in Ireland with regard to road mileage and expenditure as compared with neighbouring countries.  The mileage of roads per 1,000 of the population in this country is 16 miles; in England it is 4½ miles.  The following figures indicate the relative contributions of the State towards road expenditure in this and other countries.  In 1938, the State contribution per mile per thousand persons was 6½d.; in Northern Ireland, it was 1/11; and in Great Britain 2½d.  These three communities are very different and comparison has only a very limited value; but in this country, with about one-third or one-fourth of the British national income per head of the population, an expenditure of 6½d. per mile per 1,000 persons sounds fairly adequate in comparison with 1/11 in Northern Ireland.  Although it is true that there is a concentration of industry in Northern Ireland greater than here and that these figures are not strictly comparable, they indicate that we have made a reasonable contribution towards road construction and improvement.</P>
    <P>Again, if you examine in detail the proportion which the road rate in various counties bears to the total rate, you will find that the amount varies; that, as certain Deputies said, it is very high in certain counties.  But, taken as a whole, the figures do not reflect an excessive burden on the ratepayers. If you take the total road rate as a percentage of the total rate in various counties, you will find that it varies from 18 per cent. to 34 per cent. In a very large number of counties the figure is approximately 25 per cent. There is no need to give the counties separately because we should then be discussing purely individual examples. But, looking down the list, a great <Col N="988" /> number of the counties have a percentage of 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>In connection with the percentage of the main road rate to the full rate, the figures show again, I think, that the State is making a fair contribution. The rates vary from 9 per cent. upwards. I think the highest figure is 15 per cent.  There are a great many counties where the proportion is 9 per cent.; there are a number where it is 10 per cent. and there are a few where it is 11 and 12 per cent.  But, as I say, in the largest number of counties it is 9 and 10 per cent.  That is a clear indication that the State is doing its part and I do not think that Deputies can complain.  When a county spends out of its total rate 10 per cent. on main road maintenance, I do not think it is an unreasonable figure.  I do not think it is a figure which justifies the sponsoring of this motion.  If it were a higher figure, if it were twice or three times that, we might be put in the position of having to defend ourselves rather more urgently.  But I do not think that the Minister has any reason to accept criticism when the average percentage of the main road rate to the full rate in counties is in the nature of 9 or 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>Perhaps if members of the Farmers' Party were to read in detail the report of the Local Government Department they would find clear indications that, in so far as we can, we have adjusted the proportions equitably.  I do not believe that we should commit ourselves too far into the future. There is no reason why, if circumstances appear to warrant it, we might not slightly alter or modify, in an upward or a downward direction, our contribution towards road construction and maintenance.  And if, by any chance, in the course of the next ten years, the figure should then change no Deputy can say: &ldquo;We told you so&rdquo;. Looking back on the years before the war when conditions were normal, I think that our contribution was reasonable and I think that all the financial and technical circumstances demand that this motion be defeated.</P>

      <P>I listened with great interest to the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="989" /> attempting to give us a detailed description of the elaborate plans which are being prepared at present in the Department of Local Government for future road development.  What struck me about the details he gave was that, while he gave us a certain amount of information as to the difficulty of coordinating plans as between one county and another, he was beautifully vague about the cost of these roads and how they were to be paid for; how much has to be paid out of the Central Fund, and what contribution was expected to be made by the local authority.  The Parliamentary Secretary did say that the problem was a very complex one. It is true that it is a very complex one. The Parliamentary Secretary took the County Mayo as an example and talked about the volume of the traffic on the roads, and expressed the belief that the bulk of the traffic was local.  That may apply to a county like Mayo, but what about a corridor county like County Kildare or County Meath?  The whole traffic from the south of Ireland is carried through County Kildare. Surely he does not contend that in County Kildare the bulk of the traffic <Col N="990" /> is local.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary appreciates that immediately before the war there was a huge stream of traffic all the time on the main roads in County Kildare which was merely passing through.  A very small percentage of that traffic pertained to local individuals.  For that reason I think the Parliamentary Secretary was not fair in picking a county like Mayo as an example to illustrate his contention. He gave a lot of interesting figures.  I did not get hold of all the figures, but I hope to read his speech later on and try to adjust these figures. I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>While the aggregate holdings of British Government securities in the Legal Tender Note Fund are published weekly in <i>Iris Oifigiúil,</i> the Central Bank has no obligation to disclose details of the composition of such holdings and it would not appear to be in the public interest that it should have such an obligation.  In accordance with a long-standing arrangement the Bank in its annual report indicates the amount of the securities in question which have a maturity exceeding 12 months, this amount as at 31st March, 1944, being £9,930,000.  The figures of dividends and interest on the assets of the Legal Tender Note Fund are published in the annual accounts of the Bank, the figure under this head being £337,471 for the year ended 31st March, 1944.</P>
