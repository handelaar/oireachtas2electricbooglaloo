      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that goods heretofore carried by private carriers for country traders from Messrs.  Arthur Guinness and Son are now diverted for carriage to Córas Iompair Éireann, thereby involving further congestion on the railway, with consequent delay and inconvenience in delivery; and, if so, if he will state whether any direction or request has been made by his Department to Messrs.  Arthur Guinness to transfer such goods for transport to the railway company; and, if so, whether he has considered the wastage in transport resulting from private lorries, delivering live stock and other commodities to Dublin, having to return empty, and the inconvenience and loss to traders because of unreasonable delay; and if he will take steps to have the necessary readjustments made with a view to utilising all transport to the best advantage.</P>

      <P>It is within the discretion of individual firms to consign their goods by the method of public transport which they consider gives them the best service.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider a situation in which I meet, coming from Ballaghaderreen to Dublin, dozens of empty turf lorries returning to the West of Ireland, while at the same time consignments of goods from firms in Dublin are held up for as long as three weeks for the want of wagons?  Will he consider the possibility of co-ordinating the return of these turf wagons so as to carry at least some such bulky traffic as flour or Guinness's stout, or commodities of that character, which could be easily and expeditiously loaded?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But there is reference here in this question to the return of empty lorries.  Why should not these empty lorries, travelling 100 or 150 miles to the West of Ireland, carry down bulky merchandise, which would not take very long to load?  It obviously could not be asked to take small packets, because the process of accumulating them would take too long.  But these vehicles pass Guinness's on the way out and they could take up a load in a quarter of an hour.</P>

      <P>But Córas Iompair Éireann has objected to lorries returning empty and why should these particular lorries be prevented from taking up loads of commodities here in Dublin and carrying them to merchants in the West of Ireland?  Will the Minister say, if any individual merchant makes an arrangement with a lorry coming to Dublin to deliver turf to take, on the return journey, commodities which would not require more than 30 minutes to load, that he would insist on there being no interference with the discretion of the lorry owner to discharge that task?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether his inquiries into the circumstances under which supplementary allocations of woollen cloth were made to two clothing manufacturers have been completed; and, if so, if he will state <Col N="888" /> why this exceptional concession was made in favour of these two firms at the expense of other allottees of the available supply of woollen textiles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first point of the Deputy's question is in the affirmative.  As I have explained on another occasion, in the Dáil, I decided to grant these increased quotas in consideration of representations from the firms concerned that they were newly-established and were only getting into their stride in 1940, the datum year for the woollen and worsted distribution scheme.  They claimed that quotas based on their purchases of woollen and worsted piece goods in the datum period were so unduly low in relation to their machine capacity that it would be impracticable for them to continue in business.  The increased quotas granted to them, representing about ¾ of 1 per cent. of the total supplies available, did not involve any reduction in the quota which had already been granted to other traders.</P>
      <P>Subsequent consultation with the trade interests concerned and consideration of technical and general information regarding the trade which they placed before me, convinced me that one of the manufacturers concerned could reasonably be expected to continue in business without the grant of a special quota, and I, therefore, decided to withdraw the concession in that case.  In the case of the other manufacturer it was agreed that an additional quota was necessary if extreme hardship was to be avoided, and I accepted a recommendation from the trade interests which involved a slight reduction in the additional quota originally granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the purpose for which Mr. Walsh required a truck.  The facilities to which the Deputy refers were refused because the applicant was not qualified, under the existing practice, for the grant of such facilities.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the present price of turf imposes great hardship on poor people who have to purchase it in small lots and who, in some counties, cannot procure timber; and, if so, if he will consider having the price reduced for this winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Any reduction in the retail price of turf in the non-turf area would, in present circumstances, involve an increase in the turf subsidy which, in the current financial year, is estimated to amount to not less than £1,200,000.  I am not prepared to <Col N="890" /> recommend an increased subsidy.  As the Deputy is aware, the price of turf in the scheduled turf areas is not controlled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that traders in turf for some time past have got 5/- per ton extra in respect of turf which they put into their yards prior to the winter, and that as a result many turf workers in the dumps are unemployed?  The turf comes straight from the bogs in Kildare and Laoighis to the merchants' yards in Wexford and Enniscorthy, but instead of getting an advantage, the consumer is getting only inferior wet turf and the public view of the turf scheme is that it is daylight robbery, so far as the poor are concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, I think, misunderstands an arrangement made under which turf merchants who store turf in their own yards in the summer for release in the winter months are allowed an extra 5/- per ton on the cost of that turf.  That arrangement is obviously justifiable, as the expenses of putting the turf into ricks in the turf dumps and taking it from the dumps to the merchants' yards when required are considerably more than 5/- per ton, and furthermore the 5/- per ton allowed to the merchants is barely sufficient to cover the cost of storage and the wastage in storage of the turf in the merchants' yards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The turf available this year was saved in exceptional conditions and it probably will not be of as high a standard as last year when the weather was exceptionally good. Nevertheless, no turf is released for domestic use which is not of a suitable standard for domestic use.</P>

Proposals for such revision must be submitted to, and approved by, the Dáil.  This will be done in connection with the forthcoming proposals for the redistribution of constituencies, and full opportunity will be provided to the Dáil for public discussion of the proposals.

      <P>May I direct the attention of the Minister and of the Taoiseach to the fact that there is apparently a difference in the approach of the Minister and the Taoiseach to matters of this kind?  The House could equally discuss the method of election to the Seanad, but the Taoiseach has seen fit to set up a special committee, representative of all Parties, to examine that matter, because apparently the Taoiseach realises, if the Minister does not, that that is the most efficacious way of dealing with the matter.  Would the Minister now consult with the Taoiseach with a view to seeing whether, on consultation with that veteran politician, he can agree that the Taoiseach's method is much more preferable to the method which he has adopted and which, as everybody in the House realises, is capable of considerable abuse?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read a Press report of the case referred to.  When the Deputy asks what I propose to do in connection with the family in question and other families accommodated in dangerous dwellings he must know that the responsibility does not rest with me.  I would remind him that the provision of dwellings for the working classes in Dublin is primarily a matter for the Corporation of Dublin.  The corporation, with assistance and encouragement of the Government, provided in the past five years over 4,600 new dwellings, of which 900 were provided in the past year.  At the end of September last, there were 958 houses in course of construction, and since then the corporation have entered into a contract for the building of 204 dwellings, while tenders have been invited for the erection of 207 additional houses.  Plans have been prepared in advance, and sites developed to enable them to proceed with a programme for the erection of several thousand dwellings as soon as conditions with regard to materials are favourable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 53 houses regarded as dangerous which are at present occupied by 126 families, so that if the assumption underlying the Deputy's <Col N="894" /> question is that such families should have absolute priority for tenancies of corporation houses&mdash;a matter about which there is room for some disagreement&mdash;it would appear to have been well within the corporation's competence to deal with the problem in the past, as well as in the near future.</P>
    <P>In connection with the specific case referred to by the Deputy, I have caused inquiries to be made.  I am informed that the man in question was discharged from the Army last May with a gratuity of £59 and a pension of just £30 a year, that he has a wife and four children and that his income is £2 9s. 4d. a week, all of it derived from public funds.  It would appear that this man, his wife and children have been in the Dublin Union, where the parents and the youngest child still are.  The three children were found by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children in Lord Edward Street on the 10th October, 1945, and were taken by them before the justice with a view to having them committed to an industrial school on the grounds that they had not a home.  From the Press report, it appears that they were committed to a home in Drogheda.  Relatives of the family, some of them close relatives holding a house from the corporation, were approached by the relieving officer with the request that they take in some of the children, but they refused to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter referred to by the Deputy has received very full consideration by the various authorities concerned.  A circular was issued some time ago to all road authorities instructing them to make immediate arrangements with their engineering officers to give special attention to the maintenance of warning signs on roads and, where necessary, to the replacement of worn or defaced signs.  Attention was also directed to the use of white lines to guide traffic at bends or approaching bridges or narrow portions of the road.  The local authorities were also instructed to arrange that footpaths where provided should be in condition and that where roads in the neighbourhood of towns and villages were not provided with footpaths special consideration should be given to such works under the current employment schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="898" /> My Department has had a booklet on road safety printed and a copy of this booklet will be issued next week to each holder of a current driving licence and with each new driving licence.  A campaign of radio talks on road safety will be opened on Sunday next and will continue throughout the month and longer if necessary.  In addition, a press and poster campaign will be carried out under the direct supervision of the Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána. It is proposed under the radio, press and poster campaign to emphasise the need for the exercise of reasonable precautions by all persons concerned, the motorist, the carter, the cyclist and the pedestrian.  It is proposed to have lectures given by Gárda personnel in the schools and regular warnings will be given by the teachers but this must not be in any way regarded as relieving parents and guardians of children of the primary responsibility which rests on them in the matter.  Steps have been taken to have barriers erected at exits from schools to prevent children from rushing out on the roads but this in turn must not be regarded as relieving the motorist or the cyclist or any other person in charge of a road vehicle from exercising extreme caution in the neighbourhood of schools.  It is intended to continue for some time after normal traffic is resumed the present emergency speed limit of 30 m.p.h. in the interests of road safety and persons exceeding that limit will be liable to heavy penalties.  It is at present an offence under the Road Traffic Act, 1933, punishable by a fine not exceeding £50, for a person to drive a mechanically-propelled vehicle in a public place which is by reason of any defect a danger to other persons and vehicles using such place.  It is intended to empower the members of the Gárda Siochána to stop and examine all motor vehicles which are suspected of being in a defective condition.  Similar power will be given to the Gárda to ensure that bicycles are fitted with effective brakes.  I cannot, however, stress too strongly the importance of personal interest in this matter.  Neither the Guards nor any other authority concerned <Col N="899" /> can by any means whatever, whether by heavy penalties or other restrictions, induce road sense in the public mind and it is mainly on the good sense of the public that we rely if unnecessary deaths and accidents are to be avoided.  The responsibilities of motorists, drivers of horse-drawn vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians, in securing safety on the roads cannot, however, be over-emphasised.  The Road Traffic Act, 1933, and the regulations made thereunder will be rigidly enforced and persons contravening the law will find themselves before the Courts and liable to heavy penalties.</P>

      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary renew representations to the Gárdaí to dissuade itinerants from camping on the side of trunk roads?  They have to live somewhere and nobody objects to their camping on side roads.  But, when they camp on trunk roads, it means that little children run out under the wheels of your car, and that piebald horses get entangled in your car.  Would he also direct the attention of the agricultural community to the danger of allowing at least black cattle to ramble unattended on trunk roads in the middle of the night, because one would want to have better eyesight than I have to see black cattle at a distance of 50 yards on a dark night?</P>

At the same time, I want to ask him, does he not consider that a speed of 30 miles an hour for vehicles passing through the streets of our cities, town and villages is too high?  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should give that matter further consideration and agree that a speed of something like 15 miles an hour should be insisted upon pending the putting into operation of the precautions that he has indicated?</P>

With regard to the movement of live stock of all kinds, the Gárda Síochána have that matter under consideration with a view to preventing accidents in the case of unaccompanied animals.  With regard to the question of the speed limit, the matter has had consideration by the Gárdaí.  The question of altering the speed limit in any manner desired is under constant review.

It would be very difficult to do any planting now, because the first need in regard to planting is that you must have protective wire, which it is impossible to get.  We have been offering £10 an acre, and surely anybody who would consider planting woodlands knows that that is available.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 20.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When we adjourned last night we were discussing amendment No. 20, and the broad issue raised by the amendment is whether local authorities with houses to let should be subject to the Rent Restrictions Acts or exempt from them.  The Minister's case was that inasmuch as local authorities' houses are subsidised, there is no reason to make them subject to the Rent Restrictions Acts.  I think that is illusory.  The rent restrictions code, in addition to controlling rents, gives tenants certain statutory rights, one of which is immunity from disturbance e x c e p t on statutory grounds.  There does not seem to be any reason why local authorities should ever have the right, were it never exercised, to evict one of their tenants for no cause stated.  Some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies stated that there was no need to bring such houses under the Act, as local authorities never raised rents.  If they have never raised rents what harm is it to bring them under the Act?  I am not prepared to accept the statement that local authorities have not raised rents.  I know of a case where a local authority fixed a rent at 14/8 a month for a labourer's cottage, and then connected that cottage with the Electricity Supply Board.  They fixed on each rent a basic rate for an assumed average <Col N="920" /> amount of electricity.  Many tenants tell me that the additional rent for electricity levied upon them was far in excess of the price of the electricity actually consumed.  I do not remember the figure, but if it was, say, 1/- the tenants were prepared to maintain that the amount should be 8d., and that the remaining 4d. was either levied to relieve the rates or was levied so that one man would pay for another man's electricity.</P>
      <P>The practice is growing up in this country of short-circuiting national expenditure to the Dáil, and in local expenditure to the county councils. You can imagine an enterprising local government official, observing the expedient of subsidising the price of eggs out of the price of turkeys by direct negotiation between the Minister for Agriculture and the turkey exporter, saying to himself: &ldquo;It is going to be a very tedious business ascertaining how much electricity was used in each of 24 cottages.  Let us make a bulk arrangement and leave the charge <i>ex xquo</i> for all the cottages&rdquo;. The result is that one cottage which burns 2/- worth of electricity per week is being partially paid for by another cottage, the occupant of which is burning only 6d. worth of electricity.  To the busy local government official it is a great relief to levy a shilling a cottage on all the cottages, but the unfortunate man who is trying to make ends meet may legitimately resent the fact that, in effect, his rent is being raised by about 8d. per week, not to meet the loan charges on the money originally borrowed to build his cottage, but to pay for his neighbour's electric light.  Why should not that man have the right, under the Rent Restrictions Act, to go to court and say: &ldquo;This represents an increase of my statutory rent&rdquo;?  Let the local authority appear in court and say that it is not an increase in rent but an equitable addition to the weekly charge levied on the tenant, every penny of which goes to pay for the electric light actually consumed in his house.  That is only one instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You can well imagine that circumstances might arise in which, in effect, <Col N="921" /> the tenant's rent was being raised to finance some scheme which the local authority had never expressly authorised and which the tenant himself did not want and had not bargained for when the house was being let to him and when the rent was being originally fixed.  If the case of those who want to exclude the local authorities be sound, I suggest that instead of being an argument for excluding the local authorities, it is an argument for including them, because, if the local authorities never do anything which they would be prohibited from doing by the rent restrictions code, they cannot possibly suffer in any way by being brought under it.  If that be done, this House will have the satisfaction of knowing that if the local authority, either as a body or through their officials, attempt to do something in the way of raising rents without reasonable grounds, the provision of this code of law will come into operation and put upon that local authority and its officers the same obligations which we put upon every private houseowner in the country.</P>
    <P>May I, before I conclude upon this topic, ask the House: are we reaching the stage when the only person in the community who is suspect is the man who is supporting himself?  If you are a public authority or in receipt of a pension, or if you have a job or some kind of dole, then, unquestionably, you must be a patriot.  Accordingly, there is no use in going after you, but if you are an independent man, beholden to nobody, a situation is developing in which you immediately become suspect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, inasmuch as, in the case of a man who owns his house and is beholden to nobody, we are all, like pointer dogs, watching him, but the local authority or the fellow who got something as the result of chicanery, does not require to be watched at all. He must be a patriot of one kind or another or so pure a democrat that there is no need to watch him.  If we consider it necessary to concentrate <Col N="922" /> our attention, with never sleeping vigilance, on everybody who has dared to buy a house out of his own resources, is it not reasonable to ensure that local authorities will not do the kind of thing which we do not permit the ordinary landlord to do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am impressed by Deputy Dillon's arguments so far as the operation of the law by the local authority against the individual is concerned.  The Deputy's arguments sound logical.  However, thinking over the practical aspects of the question, we should bear in mind that these are subsidised houses, provided by the State and the local authority. So far as the operation of this measure is concerned, it would be difficult to fix the rent of such houses by reference to the rent of similar houses.  There would be no similar houses, save the houses of the local authority itself.  We must remember, too, that the citizen has been provided with a house subsidised by the State. Suppose the State, in its wisdom, decides to provide that citizen with some further perquisite&mdash;say, a parcel of 20 or 30 acres of land&mdash;it might be considered wise to adjust the rents. The occupant has left the category of worker; he is no longer classed as a worker; he is now a farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>They are workers but not labourers.  The Deputy is making a very fine distinction.  In circumstances of that sort, it would be wise to preserve the right to increase the rent.  The citizen has got a dual benefit.  He had already a house at an uneconomic rent, subsidised by the State, and, when the State provides further benefit for him, it might be wise to leave open the possibility of adjusting his rent.  Otherwise, I am impressed by Deputy Dillon's arguments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>One can have an open mind on this amendment by the Minister with regard to the exemption of local authorities from the provisions of the Bill.  It is true to say that local authorities are not inclined to raise rents&mdash;for obvious reasons.  It is also true that they are more or less barred by statute, so far as I know, from making profits from the letting of the houses which they build in their respective areas for certain classes of our citizens.  I wonder if the Minister has considered what, the position of local authorities is, now that the Managerial Act is in operation. Although the words &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; may appear in the amendment, in fact the real owner of the houses, in my opinion, is the county manager.  Since, as far as I know, it is his executive function to have control of the letting and the putting in of tenants to these houses, it is only natural to assume that he will also have power to fix rents.  I do not know whether the Minister has given that aspect of the case any consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody knows that at the moment the manager can evict tenants without even consulting the local authority, that the local authority is only a figurehead and that this question of a discretion or leaving it to the good nature of the local authority to increase rents is a dangerous precedent to create. The Minister knows the confusion, chaos and annoyance caused to many people throughout the country by the operation of the discretionary clause in the Dance Halls Act.  That clause gave district justices a certain discretion in making rules and regulations governing the granting of licences.  Many Deputies who have taken part in this discussion seem to think that they can trust to the good nature of local authorities in this matter but I should like to point out to the Minister that the words &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; should not appear here at all.  In my opinion the words &ldquo;county manager&rdquo; should appear in the section instead of the words &ldquo;local authority&rdquo;, because it is the manager who has control of these houses.  As a member of a local authority for a good many years, I am prepared to argue that the local <Col N="924" /> authorities have absolutely no power in regard to the lettings or fixing of rents of houses and it is only as a matter of form that such questions are brought before them.  I should like to have the Minister's views on that aspect of the situation before we agree to the exemption of these houses from the Act.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that most of the houses are let at an uneconomic rent. We know for a fact that a subsidy of 33? per cent. is given to cover loan charges and a contribution of 66? per cent. in regard to the rehousing of people whose houses have been condemned. In other cases, according to the means and the earnings of the people who occupy these houses, sometimes as low as 15 per cent. is collected from them so that the rents are in the main uneconomic.  They barely pay the loan charges.  In fact, some of the poorer classes have to be subsidised by contributions from the rates.  I should like the Minister to explain how the words &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; are to be interpreted in view of the fact that the Managerial Act has been in operation for a considerable time and that the question of whether rents shall be increased or not is one for the manager.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the last question is concerned, it is not a matter for me.  The local authorities own these houses and the manager as far as I know is the servant of the local authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody knows that these houses are let at uneconomic rents.  Also there is the fact, which should appeal to a certain section in this House who feel that an undue discrimination is shown against people with families, that, as far as I know, in the allocation of these houses the local authority always gives people <Col N="925" /> with families a preference and in some cases insists that those who have families should get first call when a nouse is vacant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is the local authority owns the houses.  Even when these houses are sold on the instalment system or the annuity system, those with families&mdash;this is true of Dublin, at any rate&mdash;get first choice. There is the other question: if these houses were brought within the Act, would the uneconomic rent at which these houses are now let be taken as a standard for comparison with the rent of houses which had been built by private people as an investment? Would such people be required by the courts to let their houses at the cheap rate at which local authorities' houses were let?  If that were to be the case the result naturally would be that no further houses would be built by private builders.  I am surprised at the opposition to this amendment.  I never expected it.  I thought the desirability of excluding these houses was so obvious that no one would object to what has been the law since the introduction of these Rent Restrictions Acts.  I took it for granted that there would be no objection to the exclusion of local authorities from the provisions of the Rent Restrictions Acts.  Of course, anybody who buys out one of these houses will be subject to these restrictions.  After all, the owners of other houses are subject to the restrictions and if a man who bought one of these houses were not brought within the provisions of this Act, he would be able to let it at any rent he could get. That was one of the reasons for bringing in this amendment, namely, to ensure that when a person became the owner of his house, that house would be subject to the same restrictions as any other house owned by a private individual.  That is the amendment before the House.</P>

      <P>I do not know if Deputy Martin O'Sullivan, when he prepared this amendment, was aware that tenants, from year to year, of business premises got certain rights under the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931.  I think it is because of such rights that it is sought to exclude them from this Bill.  I would suggest to the Minister that, apart from tenants from year to year, it is possible that tenants from less than year to year may acquire rights under Section 19 of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931.  I think that is a point the Minister might have investigated so as to clear up the question as to whether in such cases the tenant is to have his rights under the Act of 1931 or under the Bill we are now dealing with.  I am opposed to the amendment because of the provisions already existing in the Act of 1931.</P>

      <P>The main reason why these people were excluded was that it was considered that they did not require the protection of the Rent Acts and, as Deputy O'Connor said, there is protection given for these people in the Landlord and Tenant Act.  It was not considered that people holding yearly tenancies were in the same position as those holding weekly or monthly tenancies.  For that reason they were never included and I do not see any reason why they should be included now.  They are people who would be well able to look after their own interests and they have a better position under the 1931 Act than they formerly held.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My object in moving this amendment is to provide for certain aspects which I do not think were very fully considered when this Bill was drafted. The Minister says that the Bill will last only until 1950 and that then it will be further considered.  It is quite possible that this Bill will survive for very many years and therefore I am desirous that new inventions or new adaptations shall not be overlooked. Some people say that in a very few years, from a centre, super-heated steam will be distributed to the dwelling-houses in a certain area and to dwellings within a quarter-of-a-mile radius.  Other enthusiasts say that it is quite possible that atomic energy may be harnessed to this service.  I am not suggesting anything beyond what is already envisaged.  There is another direction in which many new services may be provided.  I note that on the other side services are being provided for a certain number of hours <Col N="929" /> of the day.  I do not think that the Minister is such an optimist as to believe that, if people are precluded from recovering the cost of special services these services will be provided. I suggest to the Minister that he should take the widest possible powers so that any service which can be placed at the disposal of the community will be available to tenants.  In a very tentative way, some people have started providing central heating within buildings, and other forms of service.  This amendment goes very much further than anything that has been attempted up to the present and suggests that possibly the whole community in future may have services rendered to them from a central station.  I put it to the Minister that the amendment is worthy of consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>One thought that strikes me in connection with this amendment is that it will be time enough to meet that situation when it arises.  I imagine that the period of five years will probably have elapsed before such services are available here I do not see why these houses should be exempt from control.  It would be quite legitimate, and I do not see how the court could object, to allow extra rent for amenities of that kind. Surely it would be a good case to say that light and heat were provided in addition to the premises, but I do not think there is any case to be made, or any necessity, to have such premises de-controlled.  These are amenities that are not at present available, but if they should be made available I am quite certain that any landlord could go to the court and say that in addition to the house he was providing heat, and that the tenant had not to buy coal or turf or electric current, as he was getting central heating, or some amenity of that kind. The fact that the house was controlled would not prevent a landlord getting a fair addition to the rent for services of that kind.  Therefore, I do not think the amendment ought to be agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 25:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2) to delete paragraph (h) and substitute therefor the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>any dwelling or business premises let together with land other than the site of the dwelling or business premises unless the rateable valuation of the land when situated in the County Borough of Dublin or the Borough of Dun Laoghaire does not exceed £15 and in any other case £10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under paragraph (h) of the sub-section as it stands, if the rateable valuation of the land attached to a building or buildings is one-quarter of the poor law valuation, the tenant is excluded from the Act.  These tenants do not come under this Act; they do not come under the Landlord and Tenant Act or any of the Land Acts.  I suggest to the Minister that there is considerable hardship in a number of these cases, particularly in the case of older houses, where the house was built on a fairly extensive area of land, comprising a large garden or a garden and small orchard, before building became more or less planned, as it is now, in which case gardens are all approximately the same size.  Long ago gardens tapered <Col N="931" /> in all directions.  The result is that this type of tenant is excluded from the benefit of the Bill.  I suggest that the Minister should accept the amendment and allow in cases where the rateable valuation of the land in the County Borough of Dublin and the County Borough of Dun Laoghaire is not more than £15 and in any other case £10.  As the section stands at present, a quarter of the valuation is very small.  The Bill does not apply to houses of, say, £50 or £60 valuation if the land is more than a quarter of the valuation of the building.</P>

I want to make sure that we will not bring them in by an amendment of this kind.  If I accepted the amendment, I am afraid that is what would happen.  If the Deputy wishes me to go into the matter further, I will do so.  There must be some relationship between the valuation of the residence and the <Col N="932" /> land.  That is what I have to be careful about.  I am certainly not going to intrude on the province of the Minister for Lands.  I have enough to do in a Bill of this kind to deal with ordinary tenants without going into the Land Acts.  That is what I want to avoid.

      <P>I move amendment No. 29:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (3) to delete paragraphs <Col N="933" /> (a) and (b) and to insert in lieu thereof the following paragraphs:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the basic rent shall be a rent of such amount as the court considers reasonable, under any given contract of tenancy not being for more than a term of five years, having regard to the basic rents of other controlled (1923 Act) premises, and</P>
    <P>(b)  for the purpose of the determination the tenant shall be deemed to be responsible for the rates.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes an alteration in the provisions governing the determination by the court of the basic rent under Section 9.  On further consideration, it was felt that the provisions contained in the existing sub-section (3) of Section 9 were unsatisfactory in certain respects.  First, since there are two kinds of basic rents provided for in the Bill, namely, Chapter 1 basic rents and Chapter 2 basic rents, doubts might arise on the existing text as to what basic rents the court should have regard to under paragraph (a) of sub-section (3).  Secondly, it was considered that the word &ldquo;comparable&rdquo; in paragraph (a) was really unnecessary and might, in practice, only make for trouble when the courts came to interpret it.  Thirdly, the provision in paragraph (b) deeming the tenant, for the purposes of the determination of the basic rent, to be responsible for repairs might not, it was felt, work well in practice and might conceivably operate unjustly to the landlord.</P>
    <P>The provisions embodied in the amendment should remedy these defects.  It is made clear that the basic rents to which the court must have regard must be the basic rents of controlled (1923 Act) premises.  This is obviously the correct thing to do since cases arising under Section 9 can only be cases of controlled (1923 Act) premises.  This change meets the point which Deputy O'Connor's amendment is intended to provide for.  The word &ldquo;comparable&rdquo; does not appear in the new provision.  The courts may be relied upon to apply the provision in a commonsense manner and do not <Col N="934" /> need to be told by statute not to compare things that are not comparable.</P>
    <P>Finally, the provisions which the amendment proposes have been modelled generally on the provisions in the Rent Act of 1923 governing the determination of the standard rent under that Act.  These provisions have, it is believed, worked well in practice and that in itself constitutes a good reason for adopting them as a model. Under the provision at (a) in the amendment, the court, taking into consideration the basic rents of other controlled (1923 Act) premises, will fix the basic rent as the amount which it considers reasonable under any given contract of tenancy not being for more than a term of five years.  This means, so far as the question of liability for repairs is concerned, that the court will have regard to the facts in the particular case before it and will fix the basic rent accordingly.  Thus, if it is clear that the landlord is liable for all repairs, the basic rent will include a provision accordingly, while if the tenant were liable for all repairs &mdash;this would be very exceptional&mdash;the amount of the basic rent would be reduced accordingly.  It is considered better that the statute should be silent on the question and that the court should be left to decide the matter on the basis of the facts in each case.</P>
    <P>Under paragraph (b) in the amendment, the tenant will be deemed to be responsible for rates.  This provision presents no difficulty, since the landlord is allowed to add the rates subsequently as a lawful addition and it is obvious that they must, therefore, be deducted in the first instance in arriving at the basic rent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to mention to the Minister the special case of the houses owned by the Artisans' Dwellings Company.  This company played a remarkable part in solving the housing problem for many years past. At the present time, they own 2,660 dwellings in the city, all of which are rented.  Its principal business is practically the same as that of Associated <Col N="936" /> Properties Limited, confined strictly to building houses and letting them, not selling them.  The situation with regard to the rents of these houses is peculiar. In March, 1922, there was some dispute with the tenants and the Department of Home Affairs of the First Dáil intervened and the late Austin Stack made an order appointing the late Mr. Justice Creed Meredith as arbitrator to fix the rents.  The arbitration was duly held and the rents were fixed and those are the rents which have prevailed up to the present.  These are not rents which come under Section 8, as they are not standard rents fixed by the court; and the Artisans' Dwellings Company will be in the position that these rents still may be fixed by the court.  The Bill says &ldquo;the basic rent shall be determined by the court.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Although the company does not seek to increase these rents, they would like to be in a secure position, in the same position as the owner of a house who had got his basic rent fixed in the Circuit Court.  I suggest to the Minister that that is worthy of special consideration for this company alone and I would ask him to reconsider making special provision to regularise the present rents prevailing with this company and to put them, if possible, on the same footing as the rents fixed by the Circuit Court under the 1923 Acts.  I would also suggest to the Minister that, in the particular circumstances of this company, he might make some effort to exclude their houses from the provisions of Part III of the Bill.  When I mention that the rents of these dwellings run from ? to £1 a week, I think that will be sufficient to show that the company does not seek to get the highest possible rent or to get an exorbitant rent. I suggest that special consideration should be given to the tenants of this company, which has played such an outstanding part in solving our housing problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but the Deputy likes them.  Supposing I came and said that Mrs. Keogh was a very respectable woman and an old friend of mine and that I knew she was very kind to her lodgers for the last 25 years and she had a grand national record and in pursuit thereof she submitted herself to the officers of the early courts of Dáil Eireann and got an appointment as a result, or got a very satisfactory award, in those stormy days, and would like to be confirmed in the enjoyment of those privileges now, I think Deputy O'Connor would say: &ldquo;It is going a bit far for Deputy Dillon to come into Oireachtas Eireann and constitute himself the advocate of Mrs. Keogh because he likes her&rdquo;.  If this admirable body submitted themselves to the jurisdiction of the late Mr. Justice Creed Meredith in 1922 and are so well satisfied with the experience they had at his hands for the last 22 years, I cannot imagine why they should now fear going before the courts as every other householder has to go, unless they think that, if they are subject to the statutory indent to which every other person who is setting a house has to subject himself, they would be in a less advantageous position than that in which they would be if the original award were confirmed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely Deputy O'Connor will not argue that, whatever the personal attributes of any individual may be, he should be excepted from the general application of the law.  If the terms of this Bill press too heavily on the Artisans' Dwellings Company, presumably they are going to press too heavily on everybody else and it would be a very hard thing if a loud and loquacious householder who owns a very large number of houses should be exempted from the provisions of the law, while an individual with one or two houses and who could not make his case to an individual Deputy who would speak for him in Dáil Eireann, would have to take the ordinary run <Col N="938" /> of the mill.  Surely Deputy O'Connor does not argue seriously that if you reach, as a company or as an individual, a position of affluence indicated by the possession of some 2,000 houses, that is a good reason for taking you out of the operation of the ordinary law.  If we once accepted that principle, all justice would vanish from the land.  Either we are all equal before the law&mdash;big fellow and little fellow&mdash; or else there are degrees, and the man with one house would get the rough end of the stick, the man with ten houses would get the middle of the stick and the man with 2,000 houses would get the soft end of the stick. Such a practice could conceivably go further.</P>
    <P>Before we go further in the discussion of this Bill, I must say I am struck by this interesting fact, that the Fianna Fáil expert on this Rent Restrictions Bill is like the Fianna Fáil experts on grow more wheat.  It is: &ldquo;Grow More Wheat on everybody's land but on that of my constituents&rdquo;. With Deputy O'Connor, it is: &ldquo;Give everybody the length and breadth of this code of law except the fellow in whom I am interested&rdquo;.  I am beginning to wonder if Deputy O'Connor is not coming over to my point of view&mdash;that the real effect of this code is going to be to destroy altogether the system of renting houses in this country.  If not, why does Deputy O'Connor want Artisans' Dwellings Company exempted from the provisions of this code?  I think we ought to tell him that he does himself less than justice in the case he has made to the Minister for special consideration for this particular company.</P>

      <P>May I explain that I did not suggest that the houses of the Artisans' Dwellings Company should be excluded from the Bill?  I suggested that the rents prevailing at present should be put on the same footing as if they were standard rents fixed by the Circuit Court.  The grounds of my application to the Minister are that this company owns such a large number of houses that it would be a very serious dislocation of its business if it had to face so many thousands of <Col N="939" /> applications to have rents fixed in the courts.  I should have mentioned also that this company intends building further houses on the outskirts of the city.  It has obtained 38 acres of freehold land which it intends to cover with houses.  I think that is another matter that should get every consideration from the Minister, and I have no doubt it will.</P>

      <P>As I understand it, what Deputy O'Connor wants is not to exclude these houses from control but to take them as Section 8 houses.  The case he makes, as I understand it, is that the court that was established before the Treaty, the Arbitration Court, did fix these rents and he wants them to be taken as already having been fixed by the court rather than have them made subject to further court proceedings.  I take it that is what the Deputy is asking.</P>

      <P>I will look into this matter.  All we have listened to about Mrs. Keogh is pure nonsense.  Deputy Dillon has a way of illustrating things so as to amuse us.  He does it very well occasionally, but there are times when he does not do it so well.  It appears, however, that the court has already adjudicated on this matter in such a way that, I am given to understand, people are paying less rent than they would be entitled to pay under the 1923 Rent Restrictions Act.  I am told that that is so.</P>

What is sought is that their houses should be treated as Section 8 houses.  They would prefer that rather than come in under Section 9 in order to have the whole matter considered again.  I think there is a case for doing that.  I will look into the matter between this and the Report Stage, notwithstanding all that Deputy Dillon has said about Mrs. Keogh.</P>

      <P>The proposal has been made that the Dublin Artisans' Dwellings <Col N="942" /> Company should receive, by way of the Minister, a concession that is not available to ordinary citizens of the State.  The Minister says that his information at this present stage is that the concession asked for by the Dublin Artisans' Dwellings Company would result in the tenants of their dwellings paying a rent not greater in any case and in some cases less than they would have to pay if the rents were fixed under the 1923 Act and subsequent Rent Restrictions Acts, and he says for that reason he is not going to listen to any representations about this being exceptional treatment.  He says it is all nonsense to make representations of that kind.  I say it is not nonsense.  There is a big principle involved and I suggest that it is not proper or becoming, in the legislation of this country, on the representations of any Deputy to declare that, by amendments submitted to the Dáil, you intend to give a particular individual, however influential, a concession that is not available to every other citizen of the State.  I say that that, in principle, is wrong and it should not be done.</P>
      <P>The Minister says, in effect, that what Deputy O'Connor is asking is that the Dublin Artisans' Dwellings Company should be entitled to treat their houses as Section 8 houses.  If their houses are Section 8 houses let them be so treated; but if they are not Section 8 houses, and if houses situated similarly to the houses of the Dublin Artisans' Dwellings Company are not Section 8 houses, there is no reason why an exception should be made.  I know nothing about that company; I do not know who is in charge of it or what its dimensions are; I know nothing about it beyond its name.  But I most emphatically reject the suggestion of the Minister that this is a matter of no consequence, that it is purely a matter of convenience.  I suggest a very grave matter of principle arises and it is no reassurance to the House for the Minister to say that he has looked into this matter and no fiduciary advantage will result to the person to whom he proposes to make a legislative concession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle is that all people <Col N="943" /> should be equal before the law and no group of persons shall have the right to seek any prospect of success which everybody else is not entitled to enjoy. It may be that there are other landlords who have a large number of houses and who will be confronted, as a result of this legislation, with a very considerable number of lawsuits to determine what is the basic rent of the houses of which they are owners.  Is there any proposal that a person having more than 12 houses is to be exempt from the ordinary provisions of the Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">

    <Speaker pid="JohnSOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking that, and I said so before.  I am asking that the award of the late Mr. Justice Creed Meredith should be treated on the same footing as a decision of the Circuit Court under the 1923 Act&mdash;and the Deputy knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But why should it?  The late Mr. Justice Creed Meredith, so far as this House is aware, had no instruction to have regard to the standard rents paid in 1914 and he had no instruction to proceed in accordance with the terms laid down in the Rent Restrictions Act, which have been consistently adhered to in every Act which followed.  Why should an <i>in vacuo</i> award, without any evidence the principles of the rent restrictions code, be given the sanctity of inviolability without any evidence being brought before the House that the same principles would apply to the ascertainment of a standard rent under the Creed Meredith award as applied to all other statutory rents fixed in this country?  It is all very well for Deputies to say that it is merely a matter of machinery.  It is a fundamental principle that all people <Col N="944" /> should be equal before the law, and I must emphatically object to any amendment designed to save any individual from discharging the same obligations under this code as the rest of the community, and if the Minister does not like that, he can lump it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not like it and he does not propose to lump it, either.  I can quite understand Deputy Dillon's reluctance to recognise anything done under the Republican Government before the Treaty, but there is a very big difference between doing something for an influential individual and recognising the award of an arbitration court set up under the First Dáil.  What I resent is the continued attempt by Deputy Dillon to imply&mdash;indeed he openly makes the charge&mdash;that members of the Government are open to receive representations, with the hint of its being done for a consideration, when the fact of the matter is that there is no such proposal before the House at all.  I am simply asked by Deputy O'Connor to regard an award by a Dáil Eireann court set up before the Treaty by one of my predecessors&mdash;I think as Minister for Home Affairs&mdash;as a Section 8 case, a case already settled by the courts. What I said in that connection was that I would look into it and I do intend to look into it.  If I am satisfied that there are grounds for doing so, I will bring in an amendment on Report Stage to give effect to it, whether Deputy Dillon likes it or not. If he does not like it, he can do what he wants me to do.</P>

If they have not asked, and have not made representations to Dáil members, it is very unfair that it should be made to appear that they have asked for something which is not being given to others.  That company has done valuable work in the past and I should like to see the company encouraged to do it again.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When he was requested to make a rent award by the late Mr. Stack, in whatever office of State he was then occupying, between this company's tenants and itself, there is no evidence before the House, and I do not think any evidence exists, that he was directed to have regard to the basic rent payable in 1914.  Once the rent restrictions code came into existence, whereunder standard rents were thereafter determined, every standard rents was determined with reference to the ascertained rents payable in 1914.  If the case is made that, when the late Mr. Stack made his reference to the judge, he said: &ldquo;In determining this, have regard to certain principles&rdquo; and we find these principles subsequently enshrined in the Rent Restrictions Act, 1923&mdash;that is, putting the Creed Meredith award on an equal footing with all subsequent rent restrictions awards&mdash;a case can be made for this proposal, because it is merely avoiding going over exactly the same ground; but surely, in all fairness, equity and commonsense, Deputy O'Connor, on reflection, will not ask the House, if the Creed Meredith award were made on a basis entirely different from that upon which the whole rent restrictions code for the rest of the community was subsequently erected, to clothe an award made on an entirely different basis with the character of an award made under the rent restrictions code. Surely he must see that, were that to be allowed, every citizen who had not had that advantage would have a very genuine grievance.  That is the point I am making, and I believe that after people's tempers have cooled down, <Col N="946" /> they will realise that there is very material substance in the point.</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 33:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of the section, line 33, to add the following words: &ldquo;for a period not exceeding 12 months from the date on which the increase in the rateable valuation took place.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment can be commended in very few words.  If it is the accepted view of the House that a house over a certain valuation is not properly one which should be brought within the terms of this restrictive legislation, it seems utterly unreasonable to say that, simply because for some administrative reason, or because the nature of the House was different when this legislation was passed from what it is now, it was caught by this legislation and therefore must be for ever caught.  The whole reason why we have chosen the arbitrary figure of a £60 valuation is that it is felt that a person living in a house over £60 valuation is in an income group where it is unlikely that he will require protection of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, presumably, we are dealing with a house which, by an increase of the rateable valuation, has moved up over £60&mdash;it was very close to £60 before any alteration in the rateable valuation took place&mdash;or, else, the nature of the house was completely changed.  In the first case, if a minor operation of the rateable valuation was sufficient to bring it above £60, then it is one of those borderline houses which should not have come within the Bill, and it is wrong to retain it there once a rectification of the valuation has raised it above £60.  Suppose a house had a valuation of £40 to-day, that someone reconstructed the whole <Col N="948" /> place, that he altered its nature without actually altering the house by building two wings to it or a conservatory, and that it was subsequently valued at £80 and was re-set, am I correct in saying that, as a result of fundamental alterations which did not amount to a complete substitution of a new house, the rateable valuation has been preserved?  It seems fantastic to suggest that such a house as that should be retained within the ambit of this Bill if it was not originally intended to be put there. For these reasons, I suggest that once a house has exceeded the maximum valuation referred to in the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

My case is that, after a reasonable period and in the event of such change in the valuation, if the house passes the statutory maximum it should drop out of the rent restrictions code and become an uncontrolled house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>What this section proposes is that if, as a result of some alterations, a house goes above the £30 valuation it will then not be liable to be treated as a chapter 2 house. The position is that if a house is in the chapter I category it remains there, and if it is in the other category it remains in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Those that were built after 1919 were not controlled. The other houses, built before 1919, were subject to control.  The valuation in the case of Dublin houses was £30.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Emergency Powers Order was made, if one had a house valued at £30, subject to rent restriction, and if the valuation lifted it up to £50, would that house not have dropped out of the rent restrictions code altogether and have become <Col N="949" /> an uncontrolled house?  Surely, it is reasonable to suggest that any advantages that may accrue to a landlord as a result of having his house constituted a chapter 2 house should be afforded to him because, presumably, the nature of the property has changed in the eyes of the valuer.  Are we not going to have an extraordinary situation if, supposing a case goes to court in which someone will say that the valuation of a house is £37, and the court says &ldquo;this is a chapter 1 house&rdquo;&mdash;that it was revalued in 1946, and that £7 or £8 was put on to it, therefore, it will remain in chapter 1, although another house in the City of Dublin under £37 valuation is a chapter 2 house? Why will not the Minister allow the ordinary changes in valuation to operate as they might ordinarily be expected to do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Because in one case there might be a very big increase in rent and in the other there might be a very big reduction.  If the house fell from chapter 2 into chapter 1 it would be treated on a different basis, and the rent would be considerably reduced.  If it went from chapter 1 into chapter 2, there could be an additional rent put on.  What we are trying to do, as far as we can, is to prevent an undue increase in rent in the one case, and undue decrease in the converse case.  I think it is very important to have that established.  As regards the legal point, I am not quite certain what the position is.  If a house is increased in valuation to the extent mentioned, I do not know how it would be regarded.</P>

      <P>There is just one point that occurs to me and it is that the effect of this may be to prevent landlords from improving their houses. It might be desirable to consider whether, if a landlord does <i>bona fide</i> increase the amenities of his house, he should not be entitled to get the benefit of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a small percentage, one that would not make any landlord feel justified in improving his house.  As a matter of principle, I do <Col N="950" /> not know whether it would not be wiser perhaps to consider not putting houses from one category into another. The Minister should consider whether or not the effect of this may not be to prevent landlords from doing up their houses, adding rooms and increasing the amenities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

      <P>I appreciate that, but still there is the fact that in present conditions he will not get the increased rent.  That may discourage him from making improvements.  In present circumstances, it might be reasonable to consider this a matter of public policy. As regards the question as to what the effect would be under the old Acts, my recollection is: once a controlled house always a controlled house, until it came out under the provisions of the Act.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister give us his view about what Deputy Costello has said?  &ldquo;Once a controlled house always a controlled house&rdquo; under the old Acts leads me to believe that no serious confusion did arise.  Now, we have the question of a chapter I house and a chapter 2 house.  Is there a danger of considerable confusion arising in ten or 15 years when there is found in chapter 1 a considerable number of houses with a valuation of £37, £33 or £40, and in chapter 2 a not inconsiderable number of houses the actual valuation of which is £24 or £26, the fact being that all those houses had begun their careers as controlled houses in the appropriate chapter, but changes of valuation moved <Col N="951" /> them over, and while moving them apparently into a new status, in fact that apparent status was not appropriate to them at all inasmuch as it was not the status they occupied when the code first operated?  Does the Minister think that will create confusion?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there will be less confusion this way, by keeping them in the category they are in.  With regard to the point as to what return the landlord should get, I consider 8 per cent reasonable.  I think there are amendments down to reduce that, but I think it is reasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, amendment No. 34 is diametrically opposed to the point of view just expressed by Deputy Costello in connection with Section 10. The House will appreciate that the usual relations between landlord and tenant are not of such a character that the landlord is to be found tumbling <Col N="952" /> over himself to do certain repairs in the house.  In this particular case, having regard to the terms of Section 11, where you are dealing with the question of lawful additions, the question of the repairs to be executed carries a significance because of the consideration which has to be granted under the latter portion of paragraph (b), that is that he is to be allowed an amount up to 8 per cent. for the repairs.  Therefore, I am suggesting that before the word &ldquo;expended&rdquo; the tenant's interest should be safeguarded by inserting the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;. Here again may I submit to the House that 8 per cent. is entirely too high, and I should like to have pointed out how it is that, under current conditions, the Minister introduces a consideration of that particular character.</P>

      <P>I am amused to observe the reaction of the professional lawyer to the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;.  I have always regarded the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; as the citadel of the judiciary. If you could persuade the Minister to put the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; into a Bill, you had opening before you endless vistas of <i>habeas corpus, quo warranto,</i> and 101 other applications to the court, all founded on the thesis that what the Minister had done was unreasonable.  Most of them woke up to the awkwardness of that word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; as the little man's key to the law courts.  Once you take it out of the statutes, my apprehension is that you put the little man out of reach of the judge who could stand between him and the other fellow, no matter how powerful the other fellow might be.</P>

      <P>I am not so sure.  I should like the opinion of lawyers who have had experience of this kind of procedure as to whether the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; here will benefit the tenant; whether it will be the tenant's access to the courts to determine whether improvements or works done by the landlord are not placing on the tenant a heavy burden.  It may be that the word here would not so operate. If it would, then I think we ought to be careful about excluding it.  If it would not, then I agree it is a word which is pregnant with litigation, but none the worse for that in certain circumstances. Litigation is the safeguard of the little man.  It is the only means he has of fighting the big fellow, whether the administrative State or a powerful corporation.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Dillon has, so to speak, thrown down a challenge to the legal profession on the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;, I suppose I must explain my point of view on it.  I confess that I like the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;. I make a lot of money out of the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;, but it is mostly in connection with juries who are supposed to be the test by means of which you ascertain what is and what is not &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;.  I think <Col N="954" /> there is something to be said for the idea at the back of this amendment by Deputy Martin O'Sullivan.  I think, if the paragraph of the sub-section were drafted as he proposes to draft it, it would be perhaps extremely difficult of construction and of application, but, as I understand what he is at, it is this: that the landlord cannot come in and put a few dabs of paint on the gate or a few pieces of wallpaper on the front room, and then say: &ldquo;I have spent £4 on this.  I want 8 per cent. of my £4&rdquo;. What he wants is that there should be some sort of standard by reference to which the improvements or structural alterations should be ascertained, and that it should not be merely trivial repairs that would qualify for the percentage here.  I do not know whether I have misunderstood the meaning of the Deputy's amendment, but from that point of view there is something to be said for the use of the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;, that is to say that before the landlord becomes entitled to this increase he must have done some substantial or reasonably substantial repairs, or some repairs which, having regard to the nature and condition of the premises, are reasonable in the circumstances.  I think that is what is at the back of the Deputy's amendment, and there is something to be said for it.  With regard to his 4 per cent., I do not think it is fair to the landlord nor do I think it would be proper to reduce the amount, for the reason I have stated, that I think is desirable that the landlord should be required to improve either structurally or decoratively the premises which are controlled by these Acts. I am afraid that the effect of this legislation will be to stereotype the position not merely as regards possession but as regards the care which a landlord will take of his premises.  He will expend only the minimum on the premises unless there is an inducement to him to put the premises into a reasonable decorative and structural repair.  From my own point of view, putting that view in favour of the landlord's right to get 8 per cent., I think it might be possible to require that before he got that percentage he should show that the <Col N="955" /> amount of the repairs or the nature of the decorative or structural alterations that had been effected were reasonably or fairly substantial.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the point which Deputy O'Sullivan has tried to cover is already covered in Section 20, sub-section (5).  The sub-section states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) At any time after the expiry of a notice under paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) of this section increasing the rent of any controlled premises by an amount consisting of or including any sum in respect of the matters mentioned in paragraph (b), (c) or (d) of sub-section (2) of Section 11, or paragraph (b), (c) or (d) of sub-section (2) of Section 17, of this Act, the court may, on the application of the tenant, if satisfied that the expenditure (in so far as it is applicable to any of the said matters) in respect of which the notice was served was not incurred or was unnecessary in whole or in part, disallow or reduce the increase accordingly, as from such date (whether before the date of the application or otherwise) as the court thinks fit.&rdquo;'</P>
      <P>I think the point is covered there and we have not found it necessary to use the litigious word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not this point arise?  If the Minister is putting a new mantelpiece into his house, he will seek the keenest quotation he can to get the work efficiently done, but supposing I am going to get 8 per cent. out of the money spent on repairs, and that I am a man in business owning 20 or 30 houses in the town, would it not be worth my while to set up my brother as a contractor so that, whereas a mantelpiece might cost £7 if put in by an ordinary contractor, I would arrange to get my brother to put one in each house for £10?  In that way, over a whole range of houses, I could add 12 or 15 per cent. to the ordinary cost.  It might run into a total of £200 and I could thus secure for myself an annual income of £16 in excess of the sum to <Col N="956" /> which I am entitled.  Has such a tendency ever manifested itself in the past and, if it has, has there been any need of checking up to see that the charges made for necessary repairs were fair and equitable and were not the result of collusion between the landlord and a nominal contractor whose principal function was to inflate the cost for the purpose of misleading the court?</P>

You are preventing <Col N="957" /> a man by this Bill from using his property in the way he might wish to use it.  I am sure Deputies have read the Minority Report of the late Mr. Herlihy, a member of the last Town Tenants' Tribunal, in which he stated that if a man owns a wheelbarrow he can do what he likes with it&mdash;sell it, break it up or burn it&mdash;but if he owns a house within certain limits of valuation he cannot do what he likes with it.  That is an element that has to be taken into account in justice to the man whose property is being interfered with for the public good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that it is wrong to regard current interest rates as the standard when fixing this allowance because there is a capital element to be considered?  Property is constantly depreciating and unless there is some fund built up during the period of depreciation to allow for that you will simply bankrupt the landlord. This is not 8 per cent. interest.  It is a sum of 8 per cent. consisting partly of interest and partly of capital repayment.</P>

      <P>I am proposing <Col N="958" /> an increased allowance, and I consider it is a very modest increase.  We may as well be honest with ourselves.  I think nobody can contend that the landlord is getting a fair deal considering what has happened since 1920.  He is now assessed on five-fourths of his valuation under Schedule A, and his income-tax has also been increased. When you consider that at the same time the cost of living has gone up or that the purchasing power of the £ has gone down&mdash;I do not mind which way you look at it&mdash;I think we are fast approaching the time when houses to rent will be a disappearing commodity in this State, except when built by a local authority, or by philanthropic societies.

The same argument has coerced the Minister into the belief that reconstruction of premises, apart from building, cannot be done except in such a way as will enable the owners to get an adequate return.

      <P>I move amendment No. 44:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>For the purpose of this section if controlled (non-1923 Act) premises to which this section applies were at a date subsequent to the relevant date let at a lower rent than that payable by the tenant at the relevant date such lower rent shall be deemed to be the rent at which the premises were held on the relevant date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down this amendment because of representations made to me by a tenant who went into premises in 1942 at £84 per annum.  Recently, the landlord informed him that he proposed to raise the rent to £96, which was the amount receivable on 10th May, 1941. <Col N="961" /> Assuming that the landlord thought it advisable to let the premises in 1942, I think it is unfair that he should be now entitled to raise the rent on a tenant who is only able to pay the amount agreed on then.  Because the premises were let at a higher rent in 1941, the present tenant is bound to suffer ill effects as the section stands, and for that reason I suggest that the Minister might accept this amendment.  It applies only in cases in which the premises were let at a lower rent than the 1941 rent.  If the landlords were prepared to let their premises at a lower rent since 1941, that is their responsibility and the tenant should be given the benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be hardly fair.  I do not think that we have many cases like that.  The position is generally the other way round.  But, if there is a case such as that, it would be unfair to deprive the landlord of the right he has, so far, enjoyed.  If this amendment were accepted, it would mean that, in a few cases, the landlord would be prevented from getting the benefit of the Emergency Order, whereas, in cases of overcharge, the landlord would be mulcted.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 45:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of the section to add the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In any case where the tenant of premises to which this section applies considers that the basic rent of such premises, as determined in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (3) of this section, is unreasonable, it shall be competent for such tenant to make application to the court under this sub-section for a review of such basic rent and upon the hearing of such application the following provision shall apply, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a) the basic rent of the premises to which this sub-section applies shall be determined by the court and shall be the rent which, in the opinion of the court, is fair and <Col N="963" /> reasonable having regard to the basic rents of comparable premises to which this section applies;</P>
    <P>(b) for the purpose of the determination by the court of the basic rent under this sub-section, the tenant shall be deemed to be responsible for the rates and the landlord shall be deemed responsible for all repairs.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to deal with cases in which houses were let at an exorbitant rent on the relevant date. The Minister will appreciate that, in 1941, there was a definite shortage of houses and that a tenant was prepared to go into an uncontrolled house at a high rent.  The circumstances of the tenancy were oftentimes conditioned by economic pressure.  In such cases, I am asking in the amendment that the Minister permit a review and allow the court to determine what should be the lawful rent.</P>

The only complaints we get have reference to attempts by landlords to increase the rent.  It would be undesirable to reopen the question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the House adjourned last night I was referring to the system of circumlocution prevailing in the Civil Service.  In any references I make, I am not casting aspersions on individual members of the Civil Service, but I do say that the system, as at present designed, is calculated to destroy all initiative and enterprise, and to render the quick despatch of public business impossible. I do not want to go into any great detail.  I did instance the case of two Departments where a committee of the kind envisaged by this motion could do very useful work, and if I did single out those two Departments, I had a particular reason for doing so.  In the case of the Gárda&mdash;the old Force, as we may call them&mdash;the men who joined in the early years of the State will be going out in the next two or three years, and the opportunity is there for a committee of this kind to examine the whole problem of the policing of this country.  In the same way a great number of the officers, non-commissioned officers and men of the Army will be going out in the next 12 months or so, and you will have virtually a new army, and some hundreds of officers will be brought in to control that army in the next few years.  There, again, is an opportunity for a committee of this kind to take the initiative and examine whatever proposals are made in the matter of Army establishment and Army policy, generally.  When I speak in this way, I am not actuated by any vindictive motives, I need hardly say, regarding either the Gárda or the Army.  Far from it.  I realise that these two Departments are chiefly responsible for the safety and security of the State that we have to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could make the same case for the <Col N="965" /> pruning knife being used in the case of the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  Quite recently, I took the trouble to examine the figures in regard to personnel for that establishment in the year 1932 and the present year, and I found that the Department has grown by almost 100 per cent., in personnel.  Twelve years ago we had some 250, odd, civil servants in that Department; this year we have almost 500.  Now, in addition to that increase at the top, you have under the managerial system of control, the creation of a local bureaucracy throughout the country&mdash;and I use the word &ldquo;local&rdquo; in inverted commas, because that local bureaucracy is now virtually being centralised and dovetailed into the Civil Service, and to call these bodies a local bureaucracy is a misnomer, as they are controlled from the Custom House.  Every local official, from the manager down, has to look for such things as promotion, transfer, and so forth, to the Custom House, and if the cannot meet with the approval of the Custom House he is sunk.  That is a bad position, definitely.</P>
    <P>I notice in to-day's paper that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health has expressed the view that he will accept amendments to the Managerial Act.  I hope he has every intention of doing so, because I am sure that almost every Deputy in this House can flood him with amendments at a moment's notice.  The entire executive responsibility of local government is taken from the hands of local representatives and handed over to a bureaucracy, and the increase, as a result, is reflected in the local rates. The Department of Local Government, I know, has embarked on many social services, and the Minister, perhaps, in reply, will be able to tell us that because of these increased social services extra personnel will have to be brought in.  That is the very thing, as I pointed out last night, that we want to stop in this country.  We want to stop the policy by which the State has become the fairy godmother, the universal provider or panacea, the cure-all for all these ills.  We want to devise some new policy that will put backbone into the people of this <Col N="966" /> country and that will encourage private enterprise and business capacity and, generally speaking, encourage our people to look after themselves rather than be looking to the State for the satisfaction of their every little daily need.</P>
    <P>The Department of Industry and Commerce, which now controls the Department of Supplies, is another Department where this committee can do very useful work.  As every Deputy in this House knows, and as everybody in the country knows, the Department of Supplies goes right into the homes of the people.  Controls of all kinds exist. The private lives of the people are regulated, and controlled by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  There are licences for practically every commodity you can name; there are quotas for them, and so on.  Now, I say seriously to the Minister that we are passing away slowly but surely from the emergency period, and this committee could be very usefully employed in devising and considering ways and means for reorganising the Department of Industry and Commerce to suit the needs of the country.  In doing that, I would seriously suggest to the Minister that the first object of Government policy should be to decontrol all supplies at the earliest possible moment: to do away with this system of licensing, permits, and control, generally, and let business get back to its normal functions, based on private enterprise.</P>
    <P>The Minister may very well say in reply that the machinery of the Comptroller and Auditor-General and the Public Accounts Committee is devised specifically for the functions which we have in mind.  I do not think so, because, when the Public Accounts Committee get going, it is like closing the stable door when the steed has been stolen.  It is 12 months after the event, if not more, when they can consider the accounts put before them, and the Auditor-General's only function in the matter of public accounts is to ensure to this House that the moneys which this House voted are allocated properly and efficiently to the purposes for which they were voted.  He cannot interfere in matters of policy, and I think, therefore, that a committee of the kind envisaged in the motion would <Col N="967" /> be a very important committee.  It would have very useful functions.  It could anticipate certain wastages and try to prevent them.  It could, perhaps, compel Ministers or other officials to come before it and justify expenditure, and at least it would have the opportunity of examining in advance proposals for new expenditure.  I know that the Minister and his officials exercise great vigilance over public expenditure, but, again, only within the limits of the moneys voted by this House.  There, again, the Minister and his officials will not interfere with policy, and once policy is settled by the House and the moneys voted in accordance with the policy, the officials have only to ensure that the moneys are properly expended under the various heads allotted.</P>
    <P>I can see, therefore, that the committee would have a very useful purpose and function, and I commend the motion to the consideration of the Deputies of the House.  But I do say, and I want to reiterate, that I think we have too many civil servants in the country.  Thirty thousand civil servants permanently established, not including the Army and the police, and not including temporary civil servants, is a phenomenal army to carry in a country of less than 3,000,000 people. It means that one in every 98 persons of our population is a civil servant of some kind or another. Bobbie Burns once said: &ldquo;Oh would some power the giftie gi'e us to see oursel's as ithers see us&rdquo;.  He expressed profound wisdom in that couplet.  We in this country are endeavouring to carry on as if we were a small power; we are endeavouring to imitate the big fellow.  Our establishments are based on what was left of the Imperial machine by the British. The whole fabric of the State should be remodelled and some effort should be made to base it on, say, the model of a small State like Denmark, Norway or Sweden.  If we were imitating the example of these people, we would be doing far better work for the country than can be done by endeavouring to follow the lead set by big States such as the United States of America, Great Britain or even the U.S.S.R.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="968" /> I seriously commend the motion.  I think it is deserving of support and I personally endorse it wholeheartedly.</P>

      <P>Last night I was interested in finding out what the mover of this motion had to say about it.  Deputy Blowick and Deputy Cogan, who seconded the motion, came in here as farmers' representatives.  They both went around the country telling the farmers what they would do to cut down the expenses of government and improve the lot of the farmers if they were elected.  After complaining about the general level of taxation, the only suggestion they made last night was that we should cut down the expenses of the Department of Agriculture. Deputy Blowick complained bitterly about the increased expenditure on the Department of Agriculture between the years 1930-31 and 1943-44.  I should be interested to know what Deputy Blowick wants us to save on in the Department of Agriculture.  It is true that the Department of Agriculture is costing a lot of money and, seeing that I may have to introduce a Budget in another few months, to ask the people to subscribe the money, I should be very glad to hear from Deputy Blowick exactly how we can save on the Department of Agriculture.  Particularly, I should like him to show how we can save on the Department of Agriculture without its reacting on the general welfare of the agricultural community and, because agriculture is our major industry, on the welfare of the community as a whole.  I am very anxious to cut down expenditure and I should like that information from Deputy Blowick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that we spent in 1943-44 £757,000 on agricultural education and development.  Does Deputy Blowick want that stopped or cut down?  We <Col N="969" /> spent another £850,000, or thereabouts, on agricultural subsidies.  Does Deputy Blowick want that cut down?  We spent, in 1943-44, £15,000 on agricultural research work.  Much as I should like to save money and little as I like the prospect of having to ask the people for taxation in the next Budget, I think that instead of cutting down research, if there are legitimate subjects for research, it should be increased.  We also spent in 1943-44, on the fertiliser scheme, £259,000.  Does Deputy Blowick want that cut down?  Between 1930-31 and 1943-44 we increased the grants to county committees of agriculture by about £81,000 and, instead of spending nothing on allotments, as we did in 1930-31, we spent in 1943-44 £53,000.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that if we want the State to carry out work on behalf of the community as a whole or particular sections of the community, we have got to pay for it and, while I am anxious to keep down the bill which we have to ask the people to pay, I would not be anxious to cut down on expenditure which is going to improve the general standard of happiness and welfare of the people. Particularly, I would not stand for cutting down expenditure which might have the result of improving the standard of output of agriculture and, in order to get that standard of output, improving the standard of agricultural education.</P>
    <P>But, when Deputy Blowick came down to brass tacks as to where we could put his resolution into effect, if passed by the Dáil, and cut down the cost of administration, the Department of Agriculture was the Department that was singled out for special reference.</P>
    <P>It was Deputy Blowick also who made a reference to the decline in agricultural output during the war and he gave some quotations from my predecessor's last Budget speech, which he completely misinterpreted.  The fact of the matter is, that since 1938, the net output of agriculture has gone up steadily, and net output is the important output.  It is what leaves the land to go into consumption among non-farmers or for export to be exchanged <Col N="970" /> for goods that the community requires.  The net output of agriculture went up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The volume went down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The net volume of agricultural output went up.  I want Deputy Cogan and Deputy Blowick, who are supposed to represent the farmers, not to go on with the slander of the farming community, that the net volume of agriculture went down during the war. The farmers of this country, in spite of their difficulties, did a most magnificent job in increasing the net volume of agricultural output right from 1938. I will give the Deputies detailed figures so that they cannot repeat that slander. In terms of current prices, the net output of agriculture in 1938 was £41.1 million worth.  The net output in terms of current prices went up steadily every year, until in 1944 it reached the value of £90,000,000.  That is, in 1938 the volume of net output at 1938 prices was £41.1 million, and in 1944 the £90,000,000 represents the value of agricultural net output at the prices obtaining in 1944.</P>
      <P>Taking 1938 as a standard year and valuing every article or commodity of output at 1938 prices, so as to get the increase in the volume of net output, in 1938 the net output was £41.1 million, in 1939 it was £43.1 million and in 1943 it was 44.3 million.  That was an increase in the volume of net agricultural output over those five years of 8 per cent.  Lest Deputy Blowick or Deputy Coogan might sneer at that effort of the farmers, with all their difficulties in those years, let me say that that represents an increase of 1? per cent. per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember in the booming 1920's in America great shouts of joy going up because, with all their facilities, industrial output increased in a number of years by 3 per cent. per annum.  They threw their hats in the air and clapped their industrialists and farmers on the back, because in America in those years, when everything was easy to get, output went up by 3 per cent. per annum.  But here, in these difficult years from 1938 to 1943&mdash;I have not the figures for 1944 and 1945&mdash;net agricultural output went up by 1? per cent. <Col N="971" /> per annum.  I think that was a magnificent effort, and I am surprised and not a little disgusted that the people who are supposed to come here to represent the farmers should carry on the slander that the volume of net agricultural output went down instead of going up.  I hope we will heár no more of that.</P>
    <P>The idea that most Deputies who spoke on this motion seemed to propound was that if we appointed a committee of the Dáil to examine the Estimates before they were introduced into this House, and to bring before them for examination in that regard various civil servants, somehow they would get a reduction in the general costs of government.  The Dáil has already appointed a committee to do that work, and that is the Government. After all, the Government is elected by this House and given charge of the Executive work of Parliament. In one sense, it is a committee to examine expenditure in detail and the Estimates in detail, to cross-examine civil servants and to cross-examine anyone else who wants to get expenditure increased or in any way altered.</P>
    <P>I think it would be a very bad day's work if this Dáil were so foolish as to appoint two sets of masters over the Civil Service.  It is said that one man cannot serve two masters and another aspect of that is that two masters giving orders to the one servant are bound to make a mess of it.  The Dáil has clearly put the responsibility on the Government of controlling administration, and the Government, on its part, on taking up office accepts the responsibility of controlling administration. If the Dáil is not satisfied with the way the Government is doing its work, the proper thing for it to do is not to appoint another Government alongside it, but to get rid of the Government which it thinks is inefficient and not doing its work.</P>
    <P>Each member of the Government considers in detail the Estimate of his Department before it is submitted to the Department of Finance every autumn, and the Department of Finance and the Minister for Finance consider carefully the Estimates put <Col N="972" /> forward by the various Departments. There is discussion about the Estimates, and alteration in many cases both by the Minister in charge of the Department and by the Minister for Finance in consultation with the Minister in charge.</P>
    <P>There are alterations in the amounts asked for and they are then printed in the Book of Estimates.  There is no one here in this Dáil or elsewhere who can say that, from this Book of Estimates giving every detail as to how it is proposed to spend the money, they cannot give reasoned criticism of the proposals.  Under the Department of Agriculture, there are a hundred and one various headings, and in every other Department the same thing occurs.</P>
    <P>The committee proposed in this resolution is already in operation when the Dáil goes into Committee on Finance to discuss the Estimates, the only difference being that the Dáil cannot send for various civil servants to cross-examine them in the House. However, the Dáil cán cross-examine the Minister and can ask him for any further details or for any further subdevision of the various sub-divisions into which the Estimates are splayed. If Deputies are doing their work during the consideration of the Estimates, they can make effective criticism of expenditure on administration, if the cost of administration, in their opinion, is too high in any particular regard.</P>
    <P>It is a very wise precaution that the Dáil Committee on Finance cannot examine a civil servant in regard to the details of the Estimates put forward by his Department.  To do so would be directly to interfere as a master of the Civil Service&mdash;and the Dáil, when it appoints the Government, appoints the masters of the various Departments. If democracy is to succeed, the only way is to make sure that the Ministers put in charge of Departments are given clear authority to control the Departments and given no excuse whatever for getting out of their responsibility for exercising that authority in a fair, equitable, reasonable and economic fashion.</P>
    <P>Having said that much, I wish to say <Col N="973" /> again that I am much more anxious than Deputy Blowick to see that every penny collected in taxation is put to the best possible use for the furtherance of the national welfare.  It is the Minister for Finance who has to bring forward proposals for putting the burden of taxation on the people. Deputy Blowick, Deputy Cogan and others can demand throughout the year further expenditure; but, when the Minister for Finance comes forward with proposals to raise the wind to meet the expenditure, they can object&mdash;and they do so most strenuously.  To hear Deputies Blowick and Cogan the other night, one would think they never asked or voted for a single penny of expenditure; but if only they had read the paper from which they read the resolution under discussion, they would see that they had asked for expenditure running, I am sure, into hundreds of millions of pounds.  Deputy Blowick was objecting to the £1,500,000 we are spending on the Department of Agriculture, but he gaily walked into the Lobby in support of the motion to put water into every house in the country.  That would cost a slight bit in administration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It was that a certain number of part-time State servants, who work a couple of hours a day, should be put on the established list and given not only reasonable remuneration but decent pensions.  That would be a nice little bill.  It is a pity Deputy Blowick did not suggest that that be done for the farmers as a whole&mdash;to put them all on the established list, give them all reasonable remuneration and give them all pensions.  Deputy Blowick himself is on the list as one of the proposers of that resolution to single out those who work a couple of hours a day, put them on the established list, with reasonable pay and pensions as well.  That would cost a lot and would cost something in administration as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not Deputy Blowick this time, but Deputy Donnellan, who sits beside him on the Farmers' Bench, and Deputy John Beirne also have a little suggestion here on the Order Paper that the local authorities should be empowered to do <Col N="975" /> certain things, which would cost money. Deputy Cogan and Deputy Halliden have another pretty idea here, which would cost another £1,000,000 or so&mdash; complete derating of the first £20 of the poor law valuation of each farm, further total derating of each additional £15 of the poor law valuation in respect of each adult worker employed on the holding, and that the deficit be made good from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick wants me to lighten the burden of taxation.  Where does he think I am to get the money from to enable the Government to carry on ordinary administration?  Where does he think we could get the money from if we were to carry out Deputy O'Donnell's suggestion about a water supply? If Deputy Blowick and Deputy Cogan are in earnest about reducing the burden of taxation, I think they should bring forward suggestions here as to how expenditure could be cut down rather than bring forward proposals which would mean increasing expenditure. I suggest Deputies should not bring forward suggestions to decrease the expenditure of one Department only, and that is the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan referred to 30,000 civil servants.  He said that they were all established, and he calculated the number per thousand of the population. In the 30,000 there are, of course, part-time postmen, gangers and other people of that description, and it is a wrong thing to make a calculation and say there are so many civil servants per thousand of the population without taking into account that there are large numbers of Post Office workers of the type I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry suggested that during the war there were inevitable increases in various Departments to cope with the emergency situation. That is true.  The number of civil servants taken in to deal with various emergency problems was very great.  A new Department was created to deal with the procuring and distribution of supplies on a fair and equitable basis. That was an expenditure that could <Col N="976" /> not have been avoided in the circumstances. There was, in the Department of Agriculture, increased expenditure in connection with compulsory tillage. A new branch had to be created in order to administer that particular scheme which was necessary if the nation was to survive.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry made a good suggestion, one of which I thoroughly approve, when he said that now that the war is over an examination should be made in order to see in what way our expenditure can be cut down.  That is the Government's job; it is the responsibility of the Government; it is the responsibility of each Minister and I hope, now that the emergency is nearly over, that each Minister, assisted by his secretary and by the establishment officers, will pay particular attention to reducing the cost of administration and see that any costs that were inflated because of emergency conditions will, when the conditions allow, be deflated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan said that any ordinary businessman would have appointed somebody to ensure that no waste occurred.  So has the Government.  In every Department there are establishment officers whose duty it is to see that the staff is kept to a minimum and that it does its work.  In the Department of Finance there is a central establishment branch whose duty it is to make sure that every proposal for an increase of staff is justified.  The establishment branch in the Department of Finance can send its representatives to the other Departments concerned and they can inquire on the sport into the justification for a proposal to increase staff, or to keep staff if the staff is deemed to be redundant by the central establishment branch and a demand is made for the shifting of particular officers to another Department.</P>
    <P>The establishment branch in the Department of Finance is in quite a different position from a committee which might be set up and which might call before it an odd civil servant and ask him to justify the cost of administration in his branch.  There is a much more effective check on the work of the Departmental establishment officers <Col N="977" /> when an inspection group can be sent directly from the central establishment office to a Department to sit with the various officers there and inspect them for a day or a week or a couple of weeks, or whatever length of time is necessary, in order to see whether the staff they ask for is justified or whether they can do without the staff demanded back from them.</P>
    <P>I trust, now that the emergency is nearly over, that great care will be taken not only by the establishment branch in my Department, but by the establishment officers in all other Departments, to have a close observation of the staffs in the various Departments in order to see that there is no waste and no over-staffing. I can quite understand that during the emergency no establishment officer, either Departmental or in the central office, would hold up too long a demand for additional staff when the Department or the branch concerned could plead that additional staff was necessary to deal with a difficult and urgent emergency situation. Quite possibly in the new situation numbers of staff distributed in that way might be reduced or made available for other work.</P>
    <P>Now that the war is over, I am sure there will be an increase&mdash; indeed, I hope there will be an increase&mdash;in other activities of the Government.  There is the Land Commission to be got going again at the speed at which it was working when it had to slow down in 1939 on the outbreak of the war, or when the staff was taken from it for various emergency services, such as tillage inspection and other emergency activities. That Department was gutted of officers and left in the position that it could not carry on its work at a normal rate. Emergency branches of various kinds got these officers, and, now that the war is over, some have been returned.  I hope every effort will be made by establishment officers to send back to that Department any officers still withheld from it.  But the immediate and detailed inspection necessary to get back officers of that type is work which can be done only by men who go in and live in the Department concerned for the length of time necessary <Col N="978" /> to enable them to discover what is going on.</P>
    <P>I hope that the establishment branch of the Department of Finance will be able to pay more attention to that work and will be able to give assistance to the establishment officers in the various branches to do whatever reorganisation is necessary.  I am quite prepared to make such officers available, and, if they want outside technical assistance of any kind to advise them on modern methods, I am prepared to ask the Government to approve the expenditure required.  I know that we cannot look for any great reduction in expenditure by displacing clerical officers of various kinds by machines, but in some cases, as in the Departments of Lands, for instance, the introduction of machines, though it does not replace staff, has had the effect of getting the work done much more accurately and efficiently, and, in the long run, making savings for the State and the community. Similarly, the Post Office in some cases has introduced modern machinery and their methods were so efficient in dealing with some branches of their work that we have had visitors from other countries to see how they did their work.</P>
    <P>I do not know that we can, as I said, reduce very much the cost of administration by that particular type of approach, but whatever could be done in that way will be done to the extent to which it is desirable.  I am quite prepared to get for the various Departmental officers any outside advice they require in that regard.  If we are to take a given bill for services, the bill presented in the Estimates, and if we are to take for granted, as unalterable, as I think it should be, the procedure we have of the Government being responsible for every penny of money spent and answerable to the Dáil in detail by way of debate and Parliamentary Question, I doubt whether we can cut down very much our costs of administration.  If the Dáil were to say to me: &ldquo;Here is a sum of £50,000,000 to do something for agriculture or to look after the Post Office, the Department of Industry and Commerce and the other Departments.  Do what <Col N="979" /> you like with it.  Do not account for it to us,&rdquo; I am perfectly certain that I could cut down the administrative expenses by half and still give the people the same service.  But would the Dáil be satisfied with that, or should the Dáil be satisfied with it?  I do not think it should.</P>
    <P>If we are to continue the system of each Minister being answerable for every detail of the deeds of his Department, then that system inevitably entails administrative expenditure in the neighbourhood of the magnitude of the amount we have in the Book of Estimates.  Take any Parliamentary Order Paper on any day on which there are 40 or 50 questions. You could not ask a business man questions of that detail about his business. The businessman makes his decision. He pays his money, and it is a mistake or it is not a mistake.  He has to account only to himself.  If he were subject to questions in regard to every act of his in his business in the same fashion as a Minister is answerable to this Dáil, his administrative expenses would be bound to go up.</P>
    <P>We have the system established as a tradition that not one penny of State money can be misspent or misappropriated without the Minister in charge of the Department being called to account.  I think it is a good system, but it has to be paid for.  We could run another from of Government&mdash;not the democratic responsible Government we have&mdash;at perhaps less administrative cost, but, in the long run, I think it would be dear buying for our people.  Our present system, though costly, is, in the long run, cheaper and more conducive to the general welfare of the community than alternatives which could be suggested and which would work at a cheaper over-all expense.</P>
    <P>In the last analysis, no matter what system of control the Dáil exercises and no matter what system of control the Minister for Finance and other Ministers exercise, over their Departments, we have to rely very largely for the economical expenditure of public money on the honesty of the average civil servant.  I hope they realise that, <Col N="980" /> if they waste time, they are doing something more than wasting their own time, that they are wasting time paid for by a lot of people through the country who can ill afford to pay the seven-eight of a penny on sugar and the other taxation which has to be imposed in order to pay them their salaries.  I hope that every civil servant realises that, and will, by his own volition, do an honest day's work for the pay he gets from the community.</P>
    <P>We are all accustomed&mdash;I am afraid the Dáil gives no good lead very often in this regard&mdash;to regard the State as something apart, from the community, and State funds as something apart from the purses of the people; but it is from the purses of the people that the State gets its funds, so that whenever Deputy Blowick or Deputy Halliden has a bright idea about expending money it is not some cold, unearthly being he is asking it from, but from the State, that is, from the various individuals in this community. Similarly, when a State servant wastes time, or in any way misspends public money, it is not from some cold, unearthly being that he is taking the money, but from Mrs. Murphy, Mrs. McGrath and all the rest of them throughout the country.  I rely upon civil servants to co-operate and see that no money is misspent, and that no time is wasted: that when they enter the Civil Service, they do so in the spirit that they are going to do a decent job of work for this people.</P>
    <P>We here have the job ahead of us of endeavouring to promote the welfare of our people, and of increasing their standard of life.  To do that job of work, we want not only the co-operation of the Civil Service but of the Dáil as well.  Now that the war is over, and that various emergency branches are coming to an end, I hope that the Government and the Civil Service, every member of it, will pull together to see what can be done towards cutting out, first of all, any waste in the Departments and, secondly, towards improving the standard of life of our people.  Again, I want to repeat that I am not against <Col N="981" /> expenditure of a kind which would promote the happiness and welfare of our people, but I do not agree with Deputy Blowick in picking out the Department of Agriculture for cutting. We want wise saving, but we also want wise spending.  If we are going to be content merely with cutting down&mdash; we should cut down expenditure wherever it is possible&mdash;this country could not improve.  It could not develop. We want not only saving on the part of the State and of the community, but we also want spending, wherever spending is necessary, in order to develop the national economy.</P>
    <P>There was one particular point that I mentioned, though as Minister for Finance possibly I should not do it, and that was that I think that we are not spending enough on agricultural research. I say it again that, now that the war is over, I hope that every Department, every secretary, every administrative officer, and every other officer down the line, will do his utmost to cut down any expenditure that he can, and, at the same time, put up ideas for wise expenditure that will add to the national income of goods and services.  I grant you that, in the days to come, with the way the world is wagging, not only will we require more and more decisions from the various Government Departments, but if we are to do our job well we will want to get them more quickly.  I would appeal to civil servants to see that, as far as possible, decisions are taken as low down the line as possible.</P>
    <P>Inevitably, of course, there are a number of decisions that will have to be pushed right up to the Minister who has parliamentary responsibility, but, as far as possible, executive officers should live up to their name and be executive officers and take decisions themselves, even though an odd time they may make a mistake. As Minister for Finance, I would rather be hauled before the Dáil for an odd mistake by an individual than have inordinate delay on the part of civil servants.  However, one could easily go too far with that, too, because in the last analysis it is the Minister who is responsible to the Dáil.  If the Dáil insists on the Minister knowing every <Col N="982" /> fiddle-faddle as regards the administration of his Department, it will be necessary for files of various kinds to come up to the Minister for his decision, seeing that he has to take final responsibility in the Dáil for it.</P>
    <P>One other branch that Parliament has set up is the Public Accounts Committee, which in itself is an excellent institution.  That system is a safeguard of Government responsibility to the Dáil.  The Public Accounts Committee, while in itself a good thing, has the effect of putting up the cost of administration of the State, Judged as a business, when compared with any other type of business.  The Public Accounts Committee rightly insists that the accounting officers come before it, prepared to answer in the smallest detail for the acts of their Departments. The system, however, has grown up&mdash;I do not know how long it has obtained, but I think myself it is not a good thing for getting work done: this is my own personal opinion&mdash;that the Secretary of each Department is the accounting officer.  Now, the Secretary of a Department is the man upon whom the Minister has to rely, not only for knowing the general running of his Department but for advising him. If we could free the Secretary to a Department in some measures from the duties of accounting officer it would have the effect, I think, of speeding up work generally, with the Minister having a more satisfactory adviser, an adviser with more free time on his hands.  I should like to see a system operated in some one or two Departments of State whereby the Secretary would not be the accounting officer but some officer equivalent to an Assistant Secretary, who would consult the Secretary only on matters of grave importance.</P>
    <P>I think I have taken up enough of the time of the House, and I am sure Deputy Blowick wants to reply, but again I want to repeat that I think the only committee which the Dáil should set up to go into the preparation of Estimates is the committee it has already appointed. It has appointed the Government as the executive authority.  The Dáil would be foolish to allow the Government <Col N="983" /> to set up another authority and to throw the blame on to that authority if the administration were not efficient.  At the present time the Government has accepted the responsibility of controlling the Departments of State.  Each individual Minister is responsible to this House.  If a question of maladministration or wasteful administration comes up, the Minister has to answer here, and give a reply that is not only satisfactory to the House&mdash;sometimes he cannot do that&mdash;but is satisfactory to the people.  That is a big safeguard.  It would be utterly foolish for the Dáil to put itself in the position that, if I came in here and somebody said: &ldquo;There is a waste in your Department; such and such a thing should not have happened&rdquo;, I could say: &ldquo;Oh well, has not the Dáil a committee for that work?&rdquo; That would be very foolish, and would lead I should say to very much greater waste than could possibly occur under the system of having each Minister responsible and giving him authority to control the activities of his Department.</P>

      <P>What I have to say will be said in ten minutes.  The Minister for Finance cannot give a personal opinion on the desirability of the procedure before the Committee of Public Accounts.  If the Minister gives an opinion in this House, it is not Deputy Frank Aiken who is speaking: it is the Minister for Finance.  Now, I urge strongly on the Minister at least to hear the views of the Comptroller and Auditor-General before he commits himself to the view that it would be desirable to substitute for the chief executive officer of the Department some other officer as accounting officer before the Committee of Public Accounts, because I think if he looks into that question with all the information that the Comptroller and Auditor-General will be in a position to put before him he may change his <Col N="986" /> mind.  I think he may find that the actual work which it is requisite for the secretary of a Department to do in order to be ready for the Committee of Public Accounts will not occupy more than perhaps one working day of an industrious officer who calls his advisers around him and picks up the detailed information which relates to the specific matters referred to in the Comptroller and Auditor-General's report.  I do not know if the Minister has ever worked on the committee, but if he did he would have discovered that the accounting officer is rarely pressed for detail except in respect of matters referred to in the Comptroller and Auditor-General's report.  I have no doubt that Deputy Cosgrave is to-day doing what I did for seven years, and that was that if some unanticipated detail were brought forward I reminded the Deputy who raised it that it was impossible for the accounting officer to come forward with detailed information about everything, and that if the matter was one of substance it should be left on one side, and the accounting officer requested to prepare a memorandum at his convenience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House may have proceeded on the assumption that, in considering the magnitude of public expenditure, we are considering only the figure which appears on the Book of Estimates, plus the Central Fund Bill.  No greater illusion could deceive Deputies, because in addition to those two sums amounting in all to over £50,000,000 sterling there is in existence a very considerable number of concealed taxes which are at present being levied and paid without this House being consulted at all.  Deputies will not forget the very large subsidy on bread which is being collected <i>via</i> the price of flour. Deputies will not forget that there is a subsidy of approximately £2,000,000 a year on beet, which is collected off sugar without any reference to this House at all.  Deputies will not forget that Irish Shipping Ltd. is receiving gigantic subsidies which have been collected by way of freight rates charged on merchandise coming into this country, and paid by the consumers of this country, over which this House has no control at all.  I could <Col N="987" /> go down a very long list of instances where heavy liabilities have been laid upon the taxpayers and consumers of this country, in regard to which this House was never consulted and never will be consulted, so that the total volume of expenses which the ordinary citizen of this State has to meet is far in excess of £50,000,000 per annum. Deputies should bear that in mind when they are dwelling on the representations made to them by the Minister for Finance to-day that such administrative economies as he can effect will not achieve very much.  If that is true&mdash;that he cannot effect a very considerable economy&mdash;it means that our people are going to be called upon to bear in perpetuity, not a burden of £50,000,000, but a burden of probably nearer £65,000,000, if only on visible taxes, and, added on, all the invisible taxes which our people are equally certain to pay.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate at this stage to recall to the memory of the House this fact, because it is becoming more patent and menacing with the passage of every year.  We are, comparatively speaking, a poor country, and we are living in the lee of one of the richest countries in the world, Great Britain, which stands at the head of an immense colonial empire; and, gradually, the chasm is widening between what we are able to afford and what they are able to afford. In Great Britain, I believe, the old age pension is £1 a week, whereas here it is 10/- a week.  In Great Britain, the children's allowance which is going to be provided is 5/- a week for every child after the first child.  Here it is 2/6 a week for every child after the second child.</P>
    <P>I think that if we examine the figures for unemployment assistance rates, unemployment benefit, widows' and orphans' pensions, and all the other social services, we will find the gap steadily widening until it will become manifest that the social services available to the people of Great Britain and, in a large measure, to the people of Northern Ireland, are from 50 to 100 per cent. more generous than this State is in a position to afford. <Col N="988" /> Now, I do not hold with the views held by some economists, that by some kind of financial jugglery or wizardry, we here can match every undertaking that Great Britain goes in for.  I do not believe that you can get out of a pint pot what is habitually being drawn from a 50-gallon hogshead.  Everybody knows that our sole resources are in the 12,000,000 acres of arable land out of which we have to get practically everything that we need, whereas Britain's resources consist of all kinds of minerals, ships, and so many other things that it would take hours fully to reckon.</P>
    <P>Mind you, in the days of our fathers and of our grandfathers, and in our own young days, we were all fired with only one thought, and that was to get freedom for our country; and the enthusiasm engendered by that concept blinded us to every other consideration. There was no doubt in the minds of every one of us that we would rather be poor and free than rich and enslaved, and in the first rush of freedom we so enjoyed the sensation of being, for the first time in 700 years, our own lords and masters, that we were prepared to ignore every other consideration. But in the disillusioning generations that seem to be arising in this country, I often wonder if our very liberty is not going to be put in jeopardy by the ever-widening gap between the standard of living that the resources of this country can provide as compared with the standards that will be enjoyed by those who choose to go either to England or America; or whether, no matter who is in power here, the people will remain faithful to this country.  That is made doubly acute by the position under which thousands of our people have gone to England and are there seeing with their own eyes the standard of material prosperity that obtains there as compared with the standards that are likely to obtain here.</P>
    <P>There will be, of course, many who choose deliberately and by calm preference the kind of life we have in Ireland, albeit it is not gilded with such wealth and material prosperity as it could be in an industrially organised <Col N="989" /> country like Great Britain or the United States of America.  I would be happy to think that the vast majority of our people felt that way, but I am not sure that they do.  I think that the great bulk of our people are coming to long for material comforts, almost before anything else, and that brings me to the last point I want to make.  Of course, I do not want to take up a superior position and say that the people long for material comforts whereas I am an ascetic to whom material things make no difference.  I am very conscious of my own personal dependence on material comforts.  If I had less of them, perhaps I would have more sympathy with those who have had to forgo them all their lives, but I know that they do constitute a menace to Irish independence, because the fact is that an independent Ireland cannot afford them on the same scale as an independent Great Britain or an independent United States of America. Unless our people can make up their minds on that, and accept the advantages which Ireland has to officer, along with the material disadvantages which she cannot protect them from, terrible decisions will fall to be made at a reasonably early date.</P>
    <P>I come now to my last point.  I think that one of the greatest and most corrupting forces operating in this country at present is something that has slowly grown&mdash;grown in my day&mdash; and it is this: that a man who is proud of the fact that he is beholden to nobody for his means of living is literally become suspect in this country. Unless you have a pension; unless you have a job; unless you are in some way a charge on the public funds, the general view is that you are a sort of public enemy.  If you have a pension or a job, or something of that kind, the general presumption is that you are a patriot, and you do not have to be watched; but if you are standing on your own feet, and if you resent interference in your personal affairs&mdash;if you want to go your own way within the law and to owe nothing to any man except your own personal duty to the community&mdash;it will be thought: &ldquo;This fellow is getting uppish.  It is time to pass an Act to restrain him.  He must have too much money or he would not <Col N="990" /> be able to get along without a pension.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Unless our people realise that independence is a precious thing, that every surrender of it to the Executive authority is something to be regretted, and that anything an individual can do for himself, or that a group of individuals can do for themselves by combining together, is better than anything that can be done for them by the State, I believe that our people are on a slippery slope which will end in utter demoralisation.</P>
    <P>I often hear with dismay applications being made by farmers, by manufacturers, and by various other interests in the country, for the Government to do something when, in fact, they should combine and do it for themselves.  I view often with dismay the readiness of Deputies in this House to clamour for the Government to do something for someone&mdash;to protect some one's little vested interest&mdash; because I realise that if their representations succeed, it is so much more of the independence of our people destroyed, it is so much more of the strength of our people sapped, it is so much more making our people dependent, helpless, and unfree.</P>
    <P>I want to say this, after seven years' experience on the Public Accounts Committee, that I think effective savings could be made, but that most of them would not be made on the Minister's Department.  My experience of civil servants in this country is that it is astonishing to me how scrupulous they are in protecting the public purse to the best of their ability.  One of the great sources of demands on the public funds is the unlimited number of schemes&mdash;a scheme for everything&mdash; operated by the State.  It is there you will find that work done under State operated schemes requires, and must have, expenditure on the administrative end, which would be wholly unnecessary if the people who would benefit would simply combine and run them themselves.  In such cases if the schemes were run by themselves they would be much better run, much more effectively run, and much more rapidly adapted to the changing circumstances <Col N="991" /> in which schemes must operate if they are long to endure.</P>

      <P>Deputies should not, I think, get up and make high falutin' speeches without making some cogent proposals as to what they want done or what they would do.  If Deputy Blowick were Minister for Finance, what would he do?  Would he bring forward proposals for the effective reduction of administrative expenditure and, if so, what would they be?  Would he insist that there would be no indirect taxation or would he insist that every section of the community should do something for itself&mdash;would be made to do something for itself, rather than asking the Government to do it?  Perhaps the Deputy will bear with these few observations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like this motion.  I do not feel that anybody on these benches is inclined to support it.  It is too wide and it has too many implications.  It is quite clear that, if we are going to have economies in things run by the State, it will be only on two lines, on administration and on the Supply Services.  There has been a trend in contributions running through the debate which seems to come very close to suggesting that we are getting to a dangerously close margin in dealing with payments for social services.  There, I feel, that the courage of several speakers failed them.  I particularly felt that when I heard the contributions from the Fine Gael Benches.  After all, unlike the farmers who have not exercised power, Fine Gael under various noms-deplume have exercised power and we still remember their record in regard to local services.  I would be very reluctant to see a committee with powers of this kind let loose upon the field of public administration and expenditure at the moment.  Similarly, while I have every respect for members of the Farmers' Party, they are farmers, and before them there were <Col N="992" /> other Parties of farmers in this House and in the political life of this country, and they did not build up any liberal attitude towards the ordinary needs of most of the people.</P>
      <P>I believe also that the method they suggest, granting them all honesty and sincerity, is inefficient.  I do not believe any committee could bring about any radical reduction in expenditure. I think the point made by the Minister for Finance was quite correct, that it is a full-time job requiring expert men and men with ability.  I think one of the most practical suggestions made was the offer of the Minister to bring in experts in modern methods to advise the permanent officials of the Departments.  I do not believe there is any of the waste or inefficiency that has been the subject of comment.  My own experience is that there is an almost rigid attempt to save every possible farthing, even to the extent of bewildering an unfortunate man who has, through some mistake on the part of an official, received more than he was entitled to. It is the system in the Civil Service, the passing of responsibility, the checking at every point, of trying to preserve records, as far as possible, and to take every possible safeguard.  If we do not want that system, then the system has to be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Deputy Dillon said about the growing gap between the social services here and those across-Channel is correct.  I do not think that a man who has grown up in recent years, with the improved social services, is solely influenced by the comparison between our economy and that across the water. I think it is quite true to say that the bulk of our people would rather be independent and, if necessary, have a lower standard of living, than to be dependent and have a higher standard. But the majority of our people, in the days that they were striving for that independence, believed that that independence was going to be based, at least, on circumstances of equity and fair dealing as between one member of the community and another.  They found in the bitter past that that was not the case.  They found, during the period immediately before the war, <Col N="993" /> when a certain number were going into employment, with a certain improvement in social services, that the gap between most of the people and a small group was either maintained or was growing.  I feel that, if the mass of our people were satisfied that all the children of the nation were being treated equally, they would be prepared to share an equal portion of the burden even if it meant, with freedom, a lower standard than previously.</P>
    <P>Why should any working man be willing or be prepared to live very often like an animal when he knows that at the other end of the social scale there is so much luxury and waste, waste that would be sufficient to keep himself and his family for all the days of the year?  That is not the basis on which we got independence, and is not the basis on which we will get men or women, of their own initiative, to face up to this problem.  I do not believe the State is called upon to meet the claims of all sections of the people.  I think it is called upon as the main artery of the community, to try to give to the community as a whole, and not a section, a basis of living and a standard of life.  That is my complaint and that is where, I think, the failure has been.  During the years when there was this great increase in the cost of administration, as shown by the figures read by Deputy Coogan, there was an increase and extension of social services. These had to be conceded by Fianna Fáil because, in the first instance, they were committed to them and, in the second instance, because of the growing feeling that some attention should be given to the mass of the people who had been neglected by Cumann na nGaedheal when they were the Government.  We do not feel at all apologetic because £55,000,000 or £65,000,000 has been spent on the needs of the general community.  We pay £50,000,000 in taxation&mdash;I agree with Deputy Dillon that, possibly, the methods of taxation require revision&mdash; for services for 3,000,000 people and we give £9,000,000 to a small number who give no service to the community.</P>
    <P>We are not going to support this motion.  It is a naïve and innocent motion.  I am quite honest in stating that I do not believe it is a vote-catching <Col N="994" /> motion, but it is the class of motion which comes rapidly to mind when one is looking for something to debate.  It would be more beneficial to the community if we were to consider ways and means whereby the expenditure we are forced to make on social services would be utilised along the lines which every decent man and woman want&mdash;work and a decent wage to enable them to support a home and a family.  That would be better than filling gaps by palliatives, as in recent years.  The problem is a basic one. Neither Fianna Fáil nor Cumann na nGaedheal have approached it as a basic problem and the problems that arise from their failure have to be met.</P>
    <P>We have been warned in this House several times recently regarding the exceptional commitments we are undertaking in the field of social services. If this committee were appointed, it would, I think, be difficult to keep it from advocating a cheese paring policy in respect of those sections of our people who are most in need of consideration. When speaking of the cost of administration, we should remember that all our civil servants are not highly paid.  In virtually all the Departments there are civil servants whose rates of pay might well be the subject of debate in this House.  When one looks at the rates set out in the Estimates, one feels that, instead of cutting them down, we should increase them.  That would be justifiable even in the case of some of those who work in this House.  Some of the rates are a disgrace to the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say at the outset that the committee envisaged in this motion was never intended by either Deputy Cogan or myself to usurp any part of the authority of this House. That is a thing which I would oppose tooth and nail.  I regret that so much of our authority has been filched from our hands.  I want to set the mind of Deputy Dillon, Deputy Davin and the Minister at rest on that subject.  It is intended that this committee should do no more than go into and minutely examine the whole question of expenditure and make recommendations to the Government in the same way as several commissions and committees <Col N="995" /> have done in the past.  Unfortunately, some of those recommendations received no attention from the Government. The Minister referred to the figures I quoted regarding the volume of agricultural output.  I was quoting from the official report of the debate of the 2nd May of this year.  I shall read exactly what the Minister for Finance said on that occasion.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Between 1938-9 and 1943-4&mdash;the latest period for which statistics are available&mdash;the gross output of agriculture rose in value by 79 per cent., while the value of the net output of agriculture&mdash;or the value added to the materials by the agricultural process&mdash;increased considerably more&mdash; by 103 per cent.&mdash;because of the decline in the volume and value of materials.  This increase in the net value of output of agriculture was due principally to a marked increase in agricultural prices, which have nearly doubled since the outbreak of the war.  On the other hand, the gross volume of agricultural output declined by. 11 per cent. in the same period.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Here we have two contradictory statements. To-night, the Minister emphasised that the volume of agricultural output had increased.  His predecessor last May definitely stated, as recorded in the debates, that it had declined by 11 per cent.  The Government is the channel through which all statistics must pass.  The Minister will have to explain at some future time where exactly the difference lies.  I quoted his predecessor's statement. Yet, five or six months later, the present Minister can bring to his aid a completely different set of figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will read my predecessor's statement again, he will find that he differentiated between two forms of output&mdash;gross output and net output.  He said that, while the value of the gross output went up by 79 per cent, the value of the net output went up by 103 per cent.  I have given the Deputy further figures showing that that 103 per cent. increase in <Col N="996" /> value of net output represented an increase in the volume of net output of 8 per cent. from 1938 to 1943.</P>

      <P>Yesterday, I quoted figures relating to Departments picked at random from various sources.  Some of those figures I obtained in the Statistical Abstract, others in the 21st annual report of the Revenue Commissioners and others from other sources. Those figures had reference to the Department of Finance, Office of Public Works, the Civil Service Commission, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Industry and Commerce, Secret Service, and other services.  The Minister, in replying to-night, adopted a particularly vicious attitude to this appeal to the House to establish a committee. Deputy Larkin accurately described the motive behind this motion when he said that it was open and honest and not vote-catching.  It definitely was not a vote-catching motion.  Several times during his speech&mdash;I presume that this was intended for to-morrow's issue of the <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash; the Minister emphasised that I singled out the Department of Agriculture for criticism.  I being the Leader of the Farmers' Party, I suppose he thought that he was playing a fair game.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister asked if I wanted to cut down certain services in the Department of Agriculture&mdash;grants in respect of fertilisers, relief of rates and so forth.  The Minister did that because he was just speaking for the newspapers.  I accuse the Minister <Col N="997" /> openly of that.  If this motion were for vote-catching purposes and if I had made a speech in accord with that object, I would say that I was being paid back by the Minister in my own coin.  He deliberately avoided reference to his own office.  He says that members of this Party have tabled motions advocating increase of expenditure.</P>
    <P>He did not mention the 1944 Arterial Drainage Bill, the greatest &ldquo;dud&rdquo; that ever went through this House. When that Bill was passing through, every member of this Party gave it his wholehearted support because we thought the problem would be tackled in a businesslike way.  What do we find?  We gave the Minister authority to spend £7,000,000 over a period of 28 years or £250,000 a year, but the Minister took good care not to refer once to the Government failure to attempt to tackle that problem since, although the Bill went through this House at lightning speed.  I notice too that although I commented on the fact that whereas secret service cost £1,409 in 1930-31 as against £20,000 estimated for 1943-44, the Minister never mentioned that item once.  His whole speech was directed to agricultural services.  I think if we examine the first 50 per cent of the Minister's speech when it is eventually printed in the official report, we shall find that if the references to Deputy Blowick and Deputy Cogan were cut out of it, there would be nothing left.  He did not even attempt to make a defence against this motion.  His attitude was that we wanted the Government to delegate some of their authority to the committee which we propose should be set up.  I challenge any of the cleverest legal men in this House to discover one word or sentence in the motion which would indicate that we suggested such a step.  We did not suggest any such thing.  We simply suggested that the committee should be set up to advise the Government and the Government would be free to accept or reject that advice.  I do not see anything wrong in that suggestion. Even at this hour in view of that explanation I would ask the Minister to <Col N="998" /> reconsider his attitude and to support the motion.</P>
    <P>There are many other questions which I should like to discuss if I had the time.  We have, for instance, the question of social services.  Deputy Larkin is afraid that we are out to cut down the expenditure on social services but that is not the aim of this motion.  Our contention is that not enough of the money which is voted for social services reaches the recipients. It is unfortunate that we have to vote moneys for certain relief services. I regret it, as I should like to see the country more independent than it is, but our whole complaint is that enough of the expenditure does not reach the recipients.  Too much of it is lost by the wayside before it can reach the people whom it is intended to benefit.</P>
    <P>There are many other items to which I should like to refer.  I should like to have heard the Minister, for instance, on the question of emigrants' remittances from the United Kingdom which rose from £700,000 in 1940 to £11,650,000 for the last year for which we have returns.  Such a committee as is envisaged in this motion would take time by the forelock.  If there is a danger of these remittances ceasing, if our emigrants are forcibly sent home after the Army in England has been demobilised, it means that we shall have the problem of providing employment for emigrants whose remittances, as I have said, amounted to £11,650,000.  I should like to hear if the Minister has considered what is likely to happen in such an eventuality.  I thought years ago that we had reached a stage when we would be able to employ all our own people at home, but now we are back to the pre-1914 level and many homes are still dependent on the remittances which are sent from abroad.  I did not intend, as I say, to go into these matters, but the Minister having adopted the line he did in his speech I feel bound to reply to him.</P>
    <P>Taking taxation generally, it works about £17 per head of the population, men, women and children, and Deputy Dillon informs us that there is <Col N="999" /> secret taxation amounting to about £11,000,000 or £12,000,000 more.  Be that as it may, we find that every man, woman and child is taxed to the tune of £17 per head openly.  What do they get in return?  That is the question that is agitating the minds of ordinary men.  I want to tell the Minister that the Government has definitely got away from the plight of the ordinary individual.  The Minister started off at the beginning of his speech with the wild statement that we were out to blacken the farmers, and he said that the farmers were great fellows. The farmers in my opinion were a lot of fools because they did not get half the support they deserved from the Government.  At the beginning of the emergency and throughout the emergency they saved the population of the towns and cities who could not fend for themselves by virtue of where they were placed.  They saved them from cold and hunger and supplied them with clothing.  I should like the Minister to explain how the Government came to the rescue of the farmers during that period.</P>
    <P>The war, which a blind person could have foreseen, found us without an ounce of artificial fertilisers except what was manufactured at home.  Notwithstanding that, the farmers went cheerfully to work and broke up fields that had not been tilled for 20 years.  They robbed their land of its fertility in order to provide food for the remainder of the population.  The young people went out to the bogs to produce fuel and they were wretchedly treated in a good many cases.  Then when the turf reached the cities it was so badly handled that it was left in a scandalous condition.  I shall only repeat what I said on a former occasion, that I believe the people of the cities will never feel inclined to buy turf in future.  They will look for coal if they were to go to the other side of the world, to places like Japan or Australia, to get it.  I definitely say that the turf was a splendid fuel if it was handled properly.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to have got it <Col N="1000" /> into his head that this motion is aimed at robbing the Government of some of its powers but I can disabuse his mind of that idea.  I would ask him again to support the motion as we simply want to see what exactly can be done to bring about a reduction in taxation. We are voting £51,000,000 or £52,000,000 for the running of a country with less than 3,000,000 inhabitants. That certainly seems exorbitant, and the ordinary man in the street cannot see where the money is going.  As to this talk about cutting down social services, I have no doubt that if this committee went to work it would effect economies and see where over-lapping and waste could be eliminated. The money thus saved could go to increase the expenditure on social services.  There are many other matters about which I do not wish to speak because they might savour of bitterness.  The Minister deliberately slurred over many matters about which we should have been glad to hear from him.  I referred last night to the desirability of publishing a balance sheet showing the State's indebtedness. We have a dead weight debt of some £53,000,000, the servicing of which costs £4,000,000.  The Minister no doubt would say the country is good value for it.  It is, but take the case of the ordinary person in business or with a holding of land.  If he allows his debts to increase, until they come level with or exceed the value of his assets, he becomes insolvent.  I am not an economist, but I presume the same happens in the case of the State.  That is all I have got to say.  I would recommend this motion to the House and I hope it will be passed unanimously.  I would ask the Minister to give it his full consideration because it is a motion the sole aim of which is to see where waste can be eliminated.  As for saying that the Department of Finance are the sole custodians of brains and the cleverest authorities in the country, that is a claim to which I am sure very few will subscribe.  Two heads are wiser than one in the consideration of any single matter.  I therefore commend the motion to the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 47:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert a new sub-section (1) a follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>This section applies to every controlled (non-1923 Act) premises the rateable value whereof is fifteen pounds or under and to no other premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is somewhat similar to the point raised by Deputy O'Connor yesterday and also mentioned by myself, that builders erected houses either immediately pre-war or in the earlier years during the war at very heavy building costs.  The rates on <Col N="1003" /> these houses, which were at that time about £6, have now risen to as much as £18.  When the tenancy falls vacant the builders are not in a position to renew it.  They have not sufficient capital to continue letting houses of that type and, unless they are exempted from control they will have to sell them.  I think the Minister is familiar with the argument in favour of this amendment.  Certain companies, such as the one mentioned yesterday, may be in a position to continue because they are operating on a larger scale, but smaller builders who erected a number of houses since 1940 or 1941, the rates on which have probably trebled, are not in a position to continue to let them, and they will automatically sell them.  In that way, these houses will be outside the scope of this Bill.  Whether it is enacted as it stands or not, the landlord will sell in any case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see any case for limiting the valuation.  If the principle of Section 15 is sound, as I think it is, there is no reason that I know of why its application should be arbitrarily limited to houses of £15 valuation and under as the amendment proposes. I do not think the Deputy has given any good reason for his suggestion, and I certainly could not agree to it.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 48:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert at the end of the section the following sub-section:</P>
      <P>(2) If, on an application to the court under this sub-section by the landlord of premises to which Section 14 of this Act applies the court is satisfied&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a) that, in the local financial year immediately preceding the local financial year which includes the relevant date, there was in force, by virtue of any statute, a remission of two-thirds of the rates <Col N="1004" /> in respect of the premises or a reduction of the valuation of the premises for the purpose of the assessment and levying of rates, and</P>
    <P>(b) that, at the relevant date, such remission or reduction was no longer in force, and</P>
    <P>(c) that at the relevant date the landlord habitually paid or allowed a deduction or set-off against, or indemnified the tenant in respect of the rates or any part thereof, and</P>
    <P>(d) that the basic rent of the premises is less than the rent (in this sub-section referred to as the national rent) which, if the said remission or deduction had continued to be in force, the landlord might, at the relevant date, reasonably have expected under a contract of tenancy in the same terms as the contract of tenancy subsisting at the said date, assuming that the tenant was responsible for the rates,</P>
    <P>the basic rent of the premises shall be determined by the court and shall be the amount which, in the opinion of the court, represents the notional rent, and thenceforth the premises shall, without prejudice to the previous application thereto of paragraph (a) of Section 23 of this Act, become premises to which Section 16 of this Act applies as if such determination had been made under that section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is the converse of what we have in Section 15.  Under that section, if the remission of rates ceases, the tenant can take advantage of that.  In this case we want to ensure that the landlord, if he has been paying the rates and if he finds, when the period for remission of rates has expired, that he is not getting a fair rent, should be entitled to the same rights as the tenant has in the converse case under Section 15.  I think that is a reasonable corollary to Section 15.  I do not think there is any ground for opposing it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 49:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (3) and to insert in lieu thereof the following sub-section:</P>
      <P>(3) For the purpose of the determination by the court of the basic rent under this section the tenant shall be deemed to be responsible for the rates.</P>
      <P>This amendment is in the nature of a corollary to the amendment of Section 9.  The purpose of the amendment is to eliminate the reference in paragraph (d) of sub-section (3) of Section 16 to the liability for repairs; so that the court, when determining the basic rent under Section 16, will be free to decide the question, as in Section 9 cases, on the basis of the facts of the particular case.  The tenant is deemed to be responsible for rates because, again as in Section 9 cases, the landlord is allowed to add the rates as a lawful addition to the basic rent.</P>
      <P>I think that is an improvement.  The court will deal with the case as it is, and without holding the tenant or the landlord liable for repairs.  It will determine the matter on the facts of the case.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to correct a mistake in the existing draft. Paragraph (d) of sub-section (2) of Section 17 provides for a lawful addition, in the case of premises to which Section 14 applies, in respect of expenditure on improvements or structural alterations incurred before the critical date, that is, the date of the passing of the Act.  As paragraph (d) stands, the lawful addition is restricted to expenditure incurred in the period between the 8th February, 1944, and the critical date.  The period to be covered should clearly commence on the relevant date, that is, the 7th May, 1941, or the date within five years before that by reference to which the basic rent is fixed under Section 14. Obviously the landlord is entitled to the lawful addition in respect of any expenditure on improvements or structural alterations which he may incur after the relevant date.  This is actually the existing position under Emergency Powers (No. 313) Order, 1944, which applies to the premises to which the provisions of Section 17 will apply when the Bill is law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but that the landlord, in fixing the rent for those houses built after 1919, and which were subject to control, took into account&mdash; this is the belief, and I am satisfied about it&mdash;what the annual cost of the repairs would be.  Therefore, I omitted from the Emergency Powers Order any allowance for repairs, and I think that is justifiable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This refers only to the 1941 cases, the ones that were covered by the Emergency Powers Order which dated from May, 1941.  There is provision for repairs in the case of the older houses covered by the 1923 Act. I am just incorporating in this Bill the provisions of the Emergency Powers Order, as amended by shifting the date back from February, 1944, to May, 1941.  I am satisfied that, in fixing the rents, after the experience of landlords under the Rent Restrictions Acts, they included in the rent an amount for the repairs which they would have to make to the premises.  That is the reason it was left out of the Emergency Powers Order, and I am continuing that in this Bill.  There is no injustice there.</P>

      <P>The Emergency Powers Order stabilised the rent at a certain figure, just as wages were stabilised.  I suppose everyone feels a grievance, but it was considered in the general interest an advisable course to pursue. <Col N="1008" /> It applies to people who own houses as well as to others, and there is no difference in principle.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 58:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) (a), after the word &ldquo;section&rdquo; in line 40, to insert the words: &ldquo;or by order of a competent court&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The method &ldquo;by order of a competent court&rdquo; is the third method whereby the rent may be amended.  I think these words are necessary, and if the amendment is agreed to I suggest they would also be necessary in the following sub-sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that this amendment is unnecessary.  Section 20 provides a comprehensive machinery for the adjustment from time to time, as occasion may require, of the rent to be paid.  In the opening paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) it is provided that the landlord and tenant may agree upon the rent and, provided it does not exceed the lawful rent for the time being, that rent remains the rent to be paid until varied by a further agreement or by notice under one of the later paragraphs.</P>
      <P>The words &ldquo;subject to this Act&rdquo; in line 2 of the section make it clear that all the provisions in sub-section (1) are subject to the provisions generally of the Act as regards the lawful rent and naturally any determination by the court on the subject of the amount of the rent must operate to put an end to any temporary agreement under paragraph (a).  It is not necessary to say this again in paragraph (a).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 59:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (1) (d), line 6, page 13, after the word &ldquo;sub-section&rdquo; to insert the following words:&mdash;&ldquo;the <Col N="1009" /> first known rent paid by a tenant in respect of such premises or where such rent is unknown&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the determination of the rent under the Act, paragraph (d) says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(d) where the rent to be paid by a statutory tenant has not been determined under any of the foregoing paragraphs of this sub-section, the rent payable by the tenant for the time being in respect of the premises on the operative date, or the then lawful rent (whichever is the lesser), or if the statutory tenant has since the operative date held under any contract of tenancy, the rent last payable by him under that contract or the then lawful rent (whichever is the lesser), shall, subject to this section, be and continue to be the rent to be paid in respect of the premises.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Heretofore, there was a rent known as the interim rent in cases where it pended an official determination.  If a landlord knows that the rent which is legally chargeable, and which he is entitled to get, was the first known rent after 1914, say in respect of 1923 controlled premises, and the 7th May, 1941, in respect of other cases, it will prevent him from overcharging tenants. I think this is a desirable amendment, since where the first known rent is available, pending the application to the court, that should be the rent accepted and charged by the landlord. I think, in order to prevent landlords getting excess payments out of the tenants&mdash;in this particular case it is irrecoverable as far as the tenant is concerned&mdash;the Minister should accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Section 20, again, is quite sufficient to deal with these cases.  If the Deputy will look at Section 20 he will observe the purpose of paragraphs (d) and (e) of sub-section (1).  It is by agreement under paragraph (a) and by notice under paragraphs (d) and (e).  Paragraph (d) sets out:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the rent payable by the tenant for the time being in respect of the premises on the operative date&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1010" /> that is, the date of the passing of the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>But suppose a tenant does not apply.  Maybe there will be no fault on the part of the tenant; but if, for whatever reasons, he does not apply for a determination and then, after a length of time, he does apply, he cannot recover.  If the first known rent was the rent chargeable it might mean that he could not be made liable, or the landlord would not be able to escape his responsibility for the repayment of the arrears.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very hard to make provision for a lot of people who will not obey the law.  If a tenant is interested, he should take advantage of the Act.  We cannot make provision for people's negligence&mdash;for their failure to act in their own interests. I am satisfied that Section 20 meets the point.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy will admit that one can never cover cases where people do not apply in time, or take advantage of provisions in any statute which are meant for their benefit.  If they do not do that, it is their own fault.  There is no use in trying to provide for the negligence of such people.

      <P>I move amendment No.63:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), lines 28 and 29, to delete the words &ldquo;controlled premises&rdquo; and to insert in lieu thereof the words &ldquo;controlled (1923 Act) premises&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to confine the application of Section 22 to controlled (1923 Act) premises.  Section 22 is a substantial re-enactment of a corresponding provision in the 1923 Act (Section 8 (2)), under which the court was empowered to suspend certain of the permitted increases on the standard rent (including the increases in respect of repairs) if the premises were not kept in good and tenantable repair.  The underlying idea was that the landlord should not be allowed to continue to draw increases permitted by the statute on the basis that he was liable for repairs if he did not, in fact, keep the premises in proper repair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1012" /> Section 22 as it stands applies to both controlled (1923 Act) premises and controlled (non-1923 Act) premises.  It is considered that its application to the latter kind of premises can scarcely be justified since the landlord of such premises is not allowed statutory increases of any kind, whether for repairs or otherwise, under the Bill.  The tenant has other remedies against his landlord for non-fulfilment of his liability in the matter of repairs.  Section 22 provides a very exceptional kind of remedy which, it is considered for the reasons stated, should not apply in the case of controlled (non-1923 Act) premises.  I think that is only fair.  When there is no allowance made for repairs in the rent he should not be liable to be brought in for not doing the repairs.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy M. O'Sullivan, I move amendment No. 64:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), lines 40 and 41, to delete the words &ldquo;not exceeding twenty per cent. of the lawful rent&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We are dealing here with premises which are held to be not in good and tenantable repair and that have come under the notice of the sanitary authority.  The responsibility for the premises being in such a poor condition rests on the landlord.  The premises are in that poor condition because of his failure to carry out his duties in regard to them.  It is provided that there can be a reduction of rent to an extent that the court thinks proper to a limit of 20 per cent.  Apparently it is felt that that overriding limit should not be set down in the Bill and that the reduction might be based either on the condition of the premises or on the degree of negligence of the landlord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is unacceptable. As sub-section (2) of Section 22 stands, the court, if satisfied that the premises are not in all respects in good and tenantable repair and that this is due to the landlord's default, may reduce the rent by such amount, &ldquo;not exceeding 20 per cent. of the lawful rent,&rdquo; as the court thinks proper. The amendment proposes to delete the quoted words, so as to leave the <Col N="1013" /> court free to reduce the rent by any amount it wished.</P>
      <P>Section 22 of the Bill is a substantial re-enactment of a corresponding provision in the 1923 Act.  Under Section 8 (2) of that Act, the court could suspend the permitted increase in respect of repairs, and also the statutory increase of 20 per cent.  On the standard rent.  The 20 per cent. maximum reduction on the lawful rent, which Section 22 (2) of the Bill proposes to allow the court to make, corresponds roughly to the amount by which the rent can be reduced in the similar circumstances under the 1893 Act.</P>
      <P>The idea underlying the 1923 Act provision was that, if the landlord failed to keep the premises in a proper state of repair, he should not be allowed to continue to collect from the tenant the increases which the Act permitted, some of which were in respect of repairs.  My amendment No. 63 proposes to limit the application of Section 22 to 1923 Act cases, and there does not appear to be any good reason why the landlord should be made liable to suffer any greater penalty under Section 22 than he is liable to suffer at present under the 1923 Act.  Accordingly the provision limiting the amount by which the court may reduce the rent to 20 per cent. of the lawful rent should, I think, be preserved.  It has to be borne in mind that the remedy put at the tenant's disposal by Section 22 is over and above other remedies that he may have against his landlord for breach of covenant to keep in repair. The Deputy's amendment would mean that the landlord would no longer be allowed to increase the rent in respect of repairs.  I do not think that would be fair at all.  There is no reason why it should be permissible for the court to take more than he is allowed for repairs, and I think the Deputy would agree that it would not be fair.</P>

      <P>This section is taken out of the 1923 Act, but I think it is less cumbersome than the section as it stands, dealing with sums which are declared to be irrecoverable.  It is possible for a landlord if he wishes, to take advantage of the ignorance, laziness or lack of effort on the part of a tenant who does not seek to secure the payment of sums which are recoverable.  I think the section proposed in the amendment is better because it is still governed by Section 25.</P>

      <P>The position was that a tenant could recover over-payments under the 1923 Act, but where the rent was not really determined and known, it is hardly fair that a landlord should be required to refund back money.  It would be very harsh on a landlord in cases where the rent was not known and had not been determined.  There have been cases where they have had to go back quite a long time, where a tenant continued to pay and did not have the matter determined, and it is unfair to expect the landlord to pay up such arrears.  The tenant ought to be satisfied with getting the relief from the date of the determination.  The Deputy will admit that it is a more satisfactory state of affairs than existed under the old Act and is a fair amendment of the 1923 position.  I do not think he should press his amendment. I have heard of cases of people having to pay big sums in respect of over-payments and it was not good enough if the tenant did not get the matter cleared up in time.  Under this Bill, he will get it from the time the rent is determined.</P>

They find out after quite a long time that they can do so and people who had not very much money who were landlords had to pay back moneys in respect of quite a long period, when, if the tenant had exercised his rights, the rent could have been determined long ago.  If a tenant neglects to do that, it is most unfair that a landlord should be made liable.</P>

      <P>A man may be a tenant for 12 months or two years under conditions which he regarded as harsh in that he was paying an exorbitant rent.  He only then realise his legal position and he goes into court. Surely for that period in any case, for a reasonable period prior to the operative date, he might be allowed to recover?  In that connection, might I read for the Minister another interesting letter which I have received?  The writer says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I paid £60 cash security which will not be refunded until such time as I vacate the house&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This, by the way, is an angle with regard to rent which I have never heard before.</P>
      <P>He goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I paid six months' rent in advance, namely, 27 weeks at 21/- per week&mdash;£28 7s.  This last amount is described by my landlord as 189 days' rent at 3/- per day.  Therefore, his letting to me is daily although I have paid him this large amount of money.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1017" /> He concludes by saying that the house is let to him at 3/- a day.  Apparently, that is the form in which the rent receipt is filled in.  That man has a grievance, and this is obviously a glaring case.  Surely, a tenant of that type is entitled to restitution, if I may put it that way, and should not be precluded by the provisions of this Bill from getting relief.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 25th October, I raised a question in the House relating to the censorship of letters posted and due for delivery within this State. The question was addressed to the Minister for Justice, who, I was informed, was responsible for the issue of all warrants for the opening of correspondence. I asked the Minister to-day if he would state the procedure followed by him in relation to the censorship of private letters posted in Eire for delivery within the State, and the number of warrants at present in operation for this purpose.  In his reply the Minister informed me:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is no `censorship' of private letters, but in accordance with Section 56 of the Post Office Act, 1908, a letter may be detained and examined under the authority of a warrant issued by the Minister for Justice.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely, if a warrant is issued by the Minister for Justice there is censorship of private correspondence.  I want to know who is responsible for compiling the lists submitted to the Minister who issues the warrants.  Is it a civil servant, is it the Minister himself or the Gárda authorities?  The Minister stated that warrants are issued by his Department only in cases where the State could use the information contained in those letters for the detection of crime.  I want to say for the Minister's information that there is, or was, a list called &ldquo;List A&rdquo; at Pearse Street Post Office which contained six pages of foolscap with the names of citizens not only in this country but in England, Denmark and France.  Probably the names of some of the Minister's colleagues in Russia were on the list as well.  I would be glad to know who is responsible for compiling that list.  Will the Minister tell me if a separate warrant is issued by him under his hand in accordance with each <Col N="1019" /> letter that is opened, or is it a general warrant that is issued under which the Post Office authorities are entitled to open any letter they desire, relating to the individuals on that list?  I am sure the position is that a separate warrant is not issued in the case of every letter relating to the individuals on &ldquo;List A&rdquo; in Pearse Street Post Office.  Under Section 56 of the Post Office Act of 1908 it is provided.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that nothing in this section shall extend to the opening, detaining, or delaying of a postal packet returned for want of a true direction, or returned by reason that the person to whom the same is directed is dead or cannot be found, or shall have refused the same, or shall have refused or neglected to pay the postage thereof, or to the opening or detaining or delaying of a postal packet under the authority of this Act or in obedience to an express warrant in writing under the hand of a Secretary of State: Provided that the warrant in Scotland may be either under the hand of a Secretary of State or of the Secretary for Scotland, in Ireland shall be under the hand and seal of the Lord Lieutenant, and in the Isle of Man shall be under the hand of the Governor issued with the sanction of a Secretary of State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If my interpretation of that Act is correct, it is under the hand and seal of the Minister that a separate warrant must be issued in respect of every letter that is opened.  I am now giving the Minister an opportunity to prove to the House that a separate warrant was issued by him in accordance with the provisions of this Act for every letter that was opened.  The Minister cannot say that this is a new thing that has come into operation since the emergency. It was there before the emergency. What guarantee has any respectable law-abiding citizen from the Minister that his private and personal correspondence is not being tampered with and opened by the Minister as he desires? What guarantee have we here on the Opposition that our correspondence going through the post is not being opened at the Minister's request, <Col N="1020" /> with the information contained therein being used for political purposes by the Minister's Party?</P>
    <P>I am sure there will be no danger of the correspondence of the Government Party being opened, because the Minister would not like the scandals contained in some of that correspondence to be disclosed even to the members of his own Civil Service.  I should be very pleased if I could get some information from the Minister as to the whole procedure.  I will go a little further and ask him to make a clear and definite statement to this House about this list which is at Pearse Street Post Office, containing, as I have said, the names of numerous citizens who are respectable and law-abiding. Many of them I know personally. Although the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs said in this House that he was unaware of it, letters addressed to persons whose names are on that list are segregated and taken to Pearse Street.  Is the Minister aware that there is an office in Pearse Street, under the control of a civil servant, where those letters are opened and censored before being taken back to Pearse Street Post Office and delivered next day?</P>
    <P>What guarantee has any Deputy in the Opposition, or any member of this House, or any respectable citizen of whom the Civil Service or the Minister or the Gárda authorities may have suspicions, that his correspondence&mdash;which is in the custody of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and should under any rule of proper administration, be delivered to the person to whom it is addressed without being opened&mdash;is not being opened? Is it any information to the Minister that a letter addressed by me to a certain official of the Minister and Leinster Bank was opened by the authorities? It is a disgraceful state of affairs that a citizen cannot send through the post a letter concerning his own private financial affairs without having it opened by the State.</P>
    <P>I raise this matter here to-night because I believe it is one of very great public importance.  How can the general public have confidence in a Department <Col N="1021" /> such as the Department of Posts and Telegraphs if the Minister for Justice, for political or other purposes, can issue a warrant authorising the opening of correspondence addressed to any private individual?  The Minister cannot tell us that he issues a warrant only in the case of citizens of this country of whom he has suspicions, because as I have already pointed out there are on that list the names of persons as far away as Shanghai, New York, Denmark, Norway and France. Does the Minister deny that addresses in those places are on the list in question? I want to know&mdash;and I want a clear and straight answer&mdash;what law, either of justice or of necessity, can be pleaded in this matter.  I want to know how long this practice has been going on, and whether the Minister will give the House an assurance that it will stop.  I may warn the Minister that, if he gives such an assurance, and the practice does not stop, there is a very easy way for the general public and for public representatives to find out.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs said in this House on the 25th October that he did not know this practice was going on.  To-day I told the Minister, when he denied that there is a censorship of correspondence, that I could give him the address of the office where the correspondence is being opened and censored, and if necessary the name of the civil servant in charge.</P>

      <P>I did not mention names, but if the Minister so desires I will pass on the information to him. I challenge the Minister to deny that, for seven years, his Department has been acting in this matter.  I think it is a practice for which no shade of justification exists.  Every word I have said here to-night is quite true, and the Minister knows that.  I raised this matter here in order to get an assurance from the Minister that the ordinary correspondence of the general public will not be tampered with.  I can give the House an assurance that &mdash;although I was not supposed to see <Col N="1022" /> the list&mdash;I know there are on that list the names of most respectable citizens who are completely cut away from politics, who took no hand or part in the civil war, and who take no hand or part in present-day politics, but for reasons best known to the Government their correspondence is being opened. I want a clear and definite statement from the Minister as to the whole procedure concerning the opening of those letters.  It is a matter of great national importance, because we are supposed to be living in a State where we can carry on our private business without interference.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister to say whether he can deny that this list exists, whether he can deny that there is an office in Pearse Street for the purpose of censoring this correspondence; how long this practice has been going on, and whether it is going to continue. What I am mainly interested in is that, in accordance with this Act which I quoted for the Minister and which the Minister quoted in his reply to me to-day, if he has not issued a separate warrant for every letter opened he has been acting grossly illegally, and is open to very severe criticism.  I shall be very glad to hear under what Act or under what law or what authority the Minister has issued a warrant for the opening of all correspondence addressed to any citizen.  I sincerely hope he will give us a clearer reply than that which he gave me to-day, or that which was given by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who admitted in this House that he knew nothing about the censoring of letters entrusted to his custody for delivery.</P>

      <P>I do not think I can give a clearer reply than I gave this afternoon.  I dare say there is a list.  When I, as Minister for Justice, for the purpose of detecting crime issue a warrant authorising the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to stop correspondence addressed to certain individuals, I presume that he arranges a list in accordance with the number of warrants issued by me, but I do not know what machinery he adopts to do that, or where the office is.  That is not a matter for me.  I am <Col N="1023" /> responsible for the warrants issued.  I issue them, and I issue them for the reason I stated here to-day, to help in the detection of crime.  If Deputy Flanagan has information of the kind he says he has, I should like him to let me have that information.  But it is a remarkable thing that Deputy Flanagan happens to come from the same constituency as another Deputy, Deputy Davin, who raised a similar thing in private with me, and promised in the presence of other members of this House to give me all particulars of a case in which he said that the correspondence of a private citizen was stopped by the authorities.  I waited, and waited in vain, for those particulars from Deputy Davin.  Notwithstanding that, he raised the matter on my Estimate here.  The Guards took up the question, and asked him to help, as they were most anxious to find out if such a thing could have happened. When they invited Deputy Davin to supply all the information he could in order to enable them to trace any leakage that might have occurred &mdash;I admitted to Deputy Davin that, the Guards being human, it was possible a leakage may have occurred, but I did not believe it&mdash;Deputy Davin claimed privilege as a Deputy.  Deputy Davin claimed privilege as a Deputy, which nobody denied he had, and now we have Deputy Flanagan on the same point.</P>

The only guarantee you have in regard to that is my credibility, and if I am not fit to exercise that authority, you should put down a motion saying that I am unfit to be Minister for Justice.  I tell the House quite definitely that for no other purpose than the detection of crime do I issue a warrant.</P>
      <P>I shall not give the number on the list&mdash;it is not a very large number&mdash;but I can assure everybody that it is only for the purpose of detecting crime that this is done.  What the procedure is, I am not going to tell.  I will not advise people, who may be interested in knowing what the procedure is in order to cover up their tracks, as to the procedure that is adopted.  All I do say is that if a warrant is issued by me, I will stand over it, because I would not be doing my duty to the State if I did not help the Gárdaí in their efforts to detect crime.</P>

      <P>Was it for the purpose of detecting crime that my correspondence with the bank was opened?</P>

      <P>I can say this much: that I never signed any warrant for Deputy Flanagan's correspondence to be opened, and I do not believe for a moment that it was opened either by the Gárdaí or the officials of the Minister for posts and Telegraphs.  If it was, it was not on my warrant&mdash;not that I say that I would not do it: not for one moment would I hesitate to do so.  If I got a case from the Gárdaí, and they made it clear to me that Deputy Flanagan or anybody else was engaged in criminal activities, I would not hesitate for a moment to sign a warrant.  However, I did not do so, and I doubt if his correspondence was opened by any Gárda or official.  If it was, it was not on my authority.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister say whether, in addition to this List A, in Pearse Street, which contains six pages of foolscap there is another?  It would appear that if there is a List A, there must be Lists B and C, and so on.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.15 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 14th November.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that the pension portion of the combined health and pensions contribution paid by Eire citizens under the British or Northern Ireland Insurance Acts is not effective for the purpose of qualifying for a widow's or orphan's pension under the Widows' and Orphans' Pension Scheme of Eire; and, if so, if he will introduce legislation to qualify the many thousands of citizens of Eire now paying insurance in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
