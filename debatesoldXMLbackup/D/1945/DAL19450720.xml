      <P>A Chinn Chomhairle, is cúis mhór bróin dúinn a chloisteál go bhfuair an Teachta Risteárd Mac Fheorais bás inné.  Beannacht Dé lena anam.  Níl sé ach seachtain ó bhí sé inár measc anseo, agus é ag labhairt go bríomhar mar ba ghnáthach leis.</P>
      <P>Toghadh ina Theachta Dála don chéad uair é sa mbliain 1921, agus níor chaill sé an gradam sin ó shoin i leith. Bhí d'onóir aige freisin bheith ina Mhaor ar a bhaile dúchais, Loch Garman, ar feadh sé bliana fichead; bhí sé ina Chomhairleoir Contae i Loch Garman ar feadh cúig bliana fichead chomh maith; agus bhí an dá ghradam sin aige go lá a bháis.</P>

      <P>Bhí suim mhór aige i geomhnaí i lúithchleasa na tíre agus ba mhór aige saíocht ár sinsir i geoitinne.  Fear eneasta lách ba ea é agus bhí meas mór ag gach éinne air.</P>

      <Col N="2870" /> The House has learned with deep regret of the death yesterday of Deputy Richard Corish, Beannacht Dé lena anam! It is only a week since he was with us here, speaking in his usual vigorous manner.</P>
    <P>The late Deputy was first elected a member of An Dáil in 1921 and continued to be a member of the House until his death.  He had the honour of being Mayor of his native town, Wexford, continuously for 26 years and a member of the Wexford County Council for 25 years and faithful carried out his duties in both capacities.</P>
    <P>His membership of Dáil Eireann was marked by devoted attention to the welfare of his constituents and by valuable contributions to our debates on matters of public interest, especially those affecting local government, of which he had a wide knowledge and experience.  He took a keen interest in athletics and in Irish culture generally. Of a kind and gentle disposition, he was held in high esteem by everybody.</P>

      <P>I should like to be associated with the tribute that is being paid to the late Deputy Corish. Very many difficult times have been gone through since Deputy Corish, in the thick of these difficulties, came into the Parliamentary life of the country.  Very many delicate decisions had to be taken during these years. The fact that he maintained the affection, not only of everybody who met him here in the Parliamentary life of the country, but of those whom he served so faithfully in local affairs over the same period, marks him as a man of tremendous distinction in the affectionate character of his nature and in his devotion to his public duties.  We will all miss him very much here, but we will, I am sure, remember him as an example to help us, if we have to face difficult times in the future, to face them in such a way that we all will be remembered more for the gentle and systematic way in <Col N="2871" /> which we approach them, than from any other aspect.</P>

      <P>May I be permitted to express to the Taoiseach and to the House the gratitude of the Labour Party for the vote of condolence which has just been passed to the widow and children of the late Deputy Corish?  By his passing, his widow has lost a very kindly husband and his children have lost a very devoted father.  This House has lost an amiable and lovable member.  Wexford, that he loved so well and served so faithfully, has lost a representative of whom it had every right to be proud.  So far as the Labour Party is concerned, it has lost a loyal colleague and a wise counsellor.  I feel that I have lost a very great friend.  I can only hope that Almighty God, whom the late Deputy Corish loved so well, will grant him eternal rest.</P>

      <P>I too, wish to be associated with the tribute paid to the memory of the late Deputy Corish and with the expression of condolence to his widow and family.  Although only a newcomer to the Dáil, I must say that the late Deputy Corish was one of those who struck me, from the very beginning, as a very solid and sensible Deputy, as the type of man who could contribute very constructively to any debate that arose in the House.  He always gave of his best.  His native county has certainly lost a very wonderful type of man, and, on behalf of this Party, I wish to associate myself with the tribute paid to him and the vote of condolence with his widow and family.</P>

      <P>As one closely associated with the late Deputy Corish, I regret his passing.  We regret very much the loss which Wexford has sustained. Although we may have differed politically during our close association for the past 30 years, it did not lessen our friendship, and I join with the other Deputies in paying tribute to the late Deputy Corish and in the expression of sympathy with his widow and family.</P>

      <P>I was occupied last night when the House adjourned in endeavouring to get the House to realise that a certain difficulty which had arisen for the British as a result of the war was bound to have its repercussions here, that in fact we had already felt these repercussions and that, from what we had already experienced, we should try to find a way in which to form a judgment as to what was likely to happen in the near future and in fact possibly for a generation. In endeavouring to associate that with our own relatively small problem, but which to us is possibly as big a problem, I pointed out that the difficulty of Great Britian imposed a difficulty on us, that it raised an immediate problem and raised a problem for the next five, six, ten and possibly 15 years.  I was moving on from that to point out what this country required if that problem was to be solved in a way which would be of benefit to the whole community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get the argument again in form, I had put to the House that it was quite clear from the British economists that the British situation was one which they represented as being of amazing difficulty.  They were faced with the loss of all their old-time investments, with a decline in their supremacy at sea and with very definite competition of a most intense type with regard to all matters of insurance and other commercial matters that used to bring in moneys which bridged the gap in their visible balance of trade, which was generally against them as it was against this country.  I pointed out that that difficulty had impressed itself so much upon English people that the Chancellor of the Exchequer had thought fit on recent occasions to go to various bodies and make the position clear beyond all doubt, using phrases about the country being terribly short of dollars, about the delicate balance of their economy and about how it might be completely destroyed and saying <Col N="2873" /> that if they in Britain were not helped to get the post-war world on its feet, the post-war world was going to collapse.</P>
    <P>I thought it necessary to stress that certain of these economists had used such phrases as this, that the debts they had accumulated would have to be funded&mdash;words which must have an ugly sound to our ears.  I read from economic journals where politer phrases were used, to the effect that these debts of the British would have to be divided into three lots.  So far as they were clearly inter-Allied war debts, there would have to be cancellation; in so far as they were debts somewhat off that line but still for war purposes, they would have to be treated as if on a lend-lease basis; and finally when they came to what might be described as ordinary commercial debts which still hung heavily on their shoulders, the gentle phrase was used that the economy of the British would have to be &ldquo;insulated&rdquo; against any bad effects from these commitments.</P>
    <P>There is the situation: there is an enormous difficulty facing the British, a difficulty which they must meet by expanding exports to the point of doubling the old amount of £450,000,000 or £500,000,000 worth which they send abroad.  They are reduced to a situation in which they are openly talking of the cancelling out of debts, or putting them on a lend-lease basis, which is a basis of very far deferred payments and then only payments of a percentage, and finally using phrases like &ldquo;insulation&rdquo; and at other times the ordinary term &ldquo;funding&rdquo;.  It means that those who are owned money by England and who have old-time accumulated credits are not going to get payment at once.  I do not want to impute any desire to the British to write down their £, but we must know that steadily over the last 15 or 20 years the £ has declined, and that if the repayment of what is owed by England is postponed for half a generation, the likelihood is that the £ will have depreciated to the point at which we will get in value about half what we sent out, and, as I say, we will get it late.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2874" /> In that connection, I had drawn attention to one definition which I think is a very valuable definition for those who talk about sterling assets, and particularly those who pride themselves on the accumulated sterling assets which this country has, to know just what the soundness or unsoundness of that particular accumulation is. The definition I quoted was in these terms, that the £ sterling was a promise by the chief cashier of the Bank of England to pay on such date as the British Parliament might determine such sum as the British Parliament would then decide upon.  In other words, they gave us I.O.U.s with no date for repayment and no sum filled in as the amount which they will repay us.</P>
    <P>Apparently some people in this country are pleased&mdash;the Minister for Local Government certainly was quite pleased&mdash;that we should go on hoarding up these I.O.U.s with no date on them and no really defined sum set out, and that our future is soundly built when built upon these.  I pointed out that that raised two difficulties, two problems, for this country.  We had the immediate problem and the other problem, which will possibly endure for five, ten, 15 and possibly 50 years. They both spring from the same point, that is, that just as Great Britain on visible trade always had an adverse balance, so had this country.  That means&mdash;one must simplify these matters&mdash;that both this country and England used to import more in the way of goods than the value of the goods sent out.  The British amount is about £450,000,000&mdash;it goes up and down with the years, but averages about £450,000,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>In the years before there was any distortion by reason of the economic war or anything like that, the more quiet years of 1924 to 1932&mdash;I use the word &ldquo;quiet&rdquo; in inverted commas and simply leave it at that, without wanting to call attention to what caused disquiet in the country at that time&mdash;on an average we imported almost £16,000,000 worth of goods more than we sent out.  The most important item confronting those who have to guide this country in the next half-dozen <Col N="2875" /> or maybe 25 years is that fact.  How did we achieve that surplus over so many years?  One would think that if it were going on for so long, we were like the man living far beyond his means who would go bankrupt almost immediately.  The situation, of course, was that we had enormous investments abroad&mdash; enormous from the point of view of the size of this country&mdash;and the dividends which we received from these enabled us to bridge the gap between the visible items of trade.</P>
    <P>That means that from emigrants' remittances, from investments or from adventitious aids like the sweepstake at certain times&mdash;and now from the adventitious aids of new remittances from new emigrants&mdash;we bridged for years the gap in our trade of about £16,000,000.  In those days, most of our trade went to England&mdash;not as much as Fianna Fáil succeeded in making go to England in later years, but always the greater part of it was with the United Kingdom.  In the early days, it did not matter where our trade went, because, if you bought sterling, it was an international unit of currency.  Sterling bought dollars, bought kroner, bought anything, and when you bought sterling, you bought, as I say, an international unit.  You bought something which was certainly as valuable as will be the new unit, if any new unit of currency proceeds from the Bretton Woods Conference. We carried on trade, not merely bilaterally between ourselves and Great Britain, but multi-laterally.  We traded with England for anything we got from her, but we got goods also from America, the Argentine and other places and we had a unit of currency which was as good as gold.</P>
    <P>That situation has long since gone. This is where our difficulty links up with the British difficulty.  The English are not now in the position in which they could rely on getting in the old £400,000,000 or more that they used to get as a result of their foreign investments. Their foreign investments are gone.  They are transformed into debts now.  In the days when they <Col N="2876" /> were drawing in some £400,000,000 or £450,000,000 per annum, they could easily spare us what paid our £15,000,000 even if we were going to spend that in countries outside England.  That could easily be done. The British had money in plenty and foreign currencies floated in at such a rate that they reinvested a certain amount of the money each year.  That situation has gone and the British are going to find it hard, desperately hard, to meet the new position.  In this situation, nobody in this country with any sanity can believe that, for many a long day ahead, we can see a situation in which the old easy position will be achieved.  The British now talk in terms of cancellation, a wiping out of debts; sometimes it is phrased as a &ldquo;loan&rdquo; from America of £1,000,000,000.  Sir John Anderson, Chancellor of the Exchequer, says they do not want a loan of £1,000,000,000, but rather a gift of that amount because a loan, bearing with it the obligation of repayment, would involve calculations as to rates of interest, amortisation, etc., and they do not want to complicate the situation further in that way.</P>
    <P>They being in that position, will anyone believe that they are going to work to pay us over the next ten or 15 years anything on account of these old credits?  Can we get away from these symbols?  Money after all is only a symbol; it is a very valuable symbol, a symbol we cannot do without, but the background of this talk about money is work&mdash;the production of goods and the exchange of goods. England in order to keep up her standard of living to the point at which it stood before the war&mdash;they even talk of increasing it&mdash;has to import the goods she imported before.  She has got to export more goods to procure the goods she used to buy before with dividends and investments.  It is going to put them to the pin of their collar to produce all these goods to get in from any of these other countries new goods.  Who are we to think that the British are going to stop work for one single week out of the 52 in order to give us goods, not in return for new <Col N="2877" /> goods but in return for old accumulated debts owing to us by them for many years?  I certainly I do not think it is same to ask them and I do no think it is sane to expect they are going to do it.  We have had a number of signs and hints by various people which would indicate that much as they would like to get back to the old position their position is somewhat similar to that which obtained after the last war when Lord Balfour wrote, somewhere around 1922, that they were contemplating asking for a moratorium.</P>
    <P>What is the reaction from that? What are we going to do about the £15,000,000 we used to get in without sending out visible goods in payment for it?  The immediate problem is a very serious one.  The Minister for Finance, in the course of an earlier debate last night, pointed out that if anybody thought that sterling balances were of no use for trading with the hard currency countries, he would like them to remember that we utilised sterling assets to purchase a large percentage of the goods we required in hard currency countries during the past few years.  So we did, but how did we manage it?  The British managed it for us.  It was not due to any Minister here or to any management carried out on this side.  The one thing that emerges from the table is that the British had through circumstances, particularly finance, shipping, import licences, etc., control of these matters. They so ruled the matter that although we did get goods, it was they who got them for us.  We did to some extent get some goods ourselves from some of the hard currency countries but they got for us the bulk of our imports. What did they get in return?  They took sometimes one-and-a-half times the value of the stuff, sometimes twice as much as what they sent back.  They ruled that roost.</P>
    <P>There is a mind behind the figures revealed by this table.  For four years back the British have not allowed to come into this or any other outside country even as much as was sent out from these countries to them, let alone allowing us to cash-in in the way of goods on these old credits of ours which we have accumulated.  In the <Col N="2878" /> last four years, taking the trade from all over the world, whatever trade we were building up in the last four years, we were forced to send out something in the region of £3,000,000 worth of goods more than we were allowed to bring in.  I understood from the Minister for Local Government in a recent debate that it was proposed with happiness to continue that system.  The Taoiseach told us here the other night that he was not going, hat in hand, to any other country.  He has been going to England hat in hand and with a terrific hatful of goods for the British for the £3,000,000 we have got in each year in the last four years and, apparently, he is going to continue that policy.  Of course, there is a difference of view on the Government Benches. The Minister for Local Government feels with Churchill that everything will come right eventually.  The Taoiseach says, no; he does not like the situation but what can we do? That is the immediate problem that confronts the Government to-day.</P>
    <P>I notice the Minister for Supplies quoted in this morning's paper as saying that the supplies position is going to be normal after another four or five years.  I think that is a developing view of the position.  The immediate position is to extend over four or five years.  Apparently for four or five years, even if we think that the supplies position is not developing properly, we are going to continue to give the British more goods than they give us.  I do not think that is right.  Certainly if I thought that we were to get about even in five years the prospect might not be too bad, but have we had any guarantee as to the payment that we might expect from Britain within five years?  Have we had any guarantee about payment or have we made any inquiry from Britain as to the payment of that amount which after all is relatively small?  I asked questions here before on which I hoped to found a debate in regard to this matter and I was told that no inquiry was made, that we were going on the assumption that goods would be forthcoming.  I do not think that is a right assumption to make.  I want to draw attention to this matter.  Even if we have not got <Col N="2879" /> any guarantee from England, if we have not entered into any conversations with them, if we have no arrangement as to the immediate future, I see no good whatever in giving the British one single pound's worth of stuff more than what she gives us.  I see no good in international trade in giving a single pound's worth of goods to anybody surplus to what they give us.</P>
    <P>I know I will be asked immediately, as if it were the only alternative, am I going back to slaughtering calves.  I never slaughtered calves.  That was one of the fine points of folly of the Fianna Fáil Party, and I was rather glad to notice from the speech of the Minister for Local Government the other day that he has now realised what consummate folly that was. There are other ways of dealing with calves than slaughtering them to throw them out.  They may be slaughtered and made into foodstuffs for the people of this country.  They may even be slaughtered and made into foodstuffs for the people of this country which the people of this country could buy if the people of this country were put into some sort of production.  Nobody can say&mdash;I mentioned the phrase last night&mdash;that this country is either overfed or overworked. We have idle men, we have idle resources, and, very often, hunger through the country.  Notwithstanding that, it is thought a desirable position that we have reached&mdash;that we are giving England, or countries other than England, more goods than they send us or than they promise to send us.</P>
    <P>The bigger problem, of course, is the one that is not associated with this odd million or two that we are giving to England more than we get back from them.  The big problem is: What are we going to do about the £15,000,000?  In the old days we imported a certain amount of goods.  As to £15,000,000 of that, we did not balance on a payment for goods we got in from investments.  I suggest&mdash; of course if I am wrong in this the whole basis of my argument is destroyed&mdash;that nobody can with <Col N="2880" /> assurance say there is any hope that we will be allowed to get those investments going again.  If we are not, what are we going to do?  We used to bring in a certain amount of goods. It is possible to say that we brought in too much, and, therefore, that we could live, even at our present standard of living, without bringing in as much as we did before.  I do not know anybody who will say that our standard of living was so high that we could do without those altogether and that we could live as if we never had that £15,000,000 worth of goods coming in as a result of old-time investments.</P>
    <P>Certainly, when one examines this table, one can see how amazing the trend of Fianna Fáil economics has been.  They used to talk, No. 1: as if there was no necessity for imports; No. 2: as if we could get big business done in industrial exports; and No. 3: as if they had markets for their produce other than England.  This table, which was given to me in reply to a question on 4th July, denies all those old views of Fianna Fáil, and shows how they have been denied by circumstances and facts.  As far as the exports to countries other than the United Kingdom in the years 1924 to 1932 are concerned, there is an average export of £2,000,000.  Since that time, in 1933 to 1938&mdash;I leave out the war years; I can add them in if necessary, but they do not really, to any great extent, affect the picture&mdash;Fianna Fáil reduced that export to countries other than the United Kingdom to about £1,500,000.  That is not a very big difference, but it shows the tendency. The tendency was to develop trade more and more with the United Kingdom, more and more to the exclusion of those other countries.  As far as exports other than live animals, food and drink, are concerned&mdash;and that was a figure given to me in reply to a question about exports of industrial products&mdash;the situation is that in the years from 1924 to 1932 there was an average export of those industrial products of £6,000,000 per annum.  Since 1933 up to the war years that has been reduced from £6,000,000 to £2,500,000.</P>
    <P>Apart from platform talk, the reality is that Fianna Fáil has developed trade <Col N="2881" /> more and more with Great Britain to the exclusion of other countries, and has developed trade more and more in agricultural products to the temporary eclipse of industrial products. We have now at last, according to the statements of three Ministers, arrived at the conclusion that we must have these imports&mdash;that they are necessary for our standard of living.  I ask myself then: what are we going to do? We have got to the point of trading in the main with Great Britain; we have got to the point of trading almost entirely in agricultural products; and we have got to the point of recognising that imports are necessary for the maintenance of our standard of living.  What are we going to do to get the old £15,000,000 worth of goods?  I hold that we cannot rely on the credits being there for us.  I hold that Britain has not enough of other currency to go round to allow us to get hard currency, and I do not believe that Britain, even in connection with the sterling area, is going to work hard for us for a week or two to provide us, in her extremity, with goods, except we send goods to her in return. It seems to me that the whole tendency of Fianna Fáil has shown only one thing, that all we can hope to do is to export more goods to England, to export more agricultural goods.  If we have got to get that old £15,000,000 worth of stuff in to-day, and cannot pay for it by dividends on investments, we have to pay for it by goods.  That is a considerable task.  We have to increase our exportable surplus, which, in the main has to be agricultural goods, by £15,000,000.  In fact, we have to increase it by more.  We have to increase it by whatever volume of goods would, about 1930, have brought us in £15,000,000.  Of course that means a great deal more at the moment.</P>
    <P>I should point out that trade in this country, which the Minister for Finance seems to think is on the upgrade, is, of course, declining.  In 1943, we were supposed to have an import trade of £26,000,000, which, valued at 1930 prices, means only £13,000,000.  In comparison to the old days of, say, £56,000,000 imports, our trade is down to £13,000,000.  I do not think anybody is foolish enough to <Col N="2882" /> believe that we could go on living and maintaining a proper standard of living with the imports just as we have them at the moment.  Accordingly, we must get exports.  We either have to get exports or else tighten our belts and live on in the present narrow circumstances for many years to come. Which is it proposed to do?  I do not think anybody can seriously contemplate a future in which we will live as we are.  Therefore, the only thing we can hope to do is bend our backs, and see can we get more production in this country on the agricultural side, and, finally, when we have got it, will the British take it from us and at what price and when will they pay us for it? I am no believer in giving the British goods merely with the idea that some day, sooner or later, they will pay us some sum of money, whatever they may determine.  I am not a believer in that policy at all.  I would believe in giving them immediate trade, even increased trade, when they give us increased imports from that country in return.</P>
    <P>Have any inquiries been set on foot in regard to that?  I have asked about that, and been told &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I even asked about a question which I thought was definitely tending towards what would be called capital goods, and got a not very satisfactory answer.  At the start of the war the Minister who was then in charge of Industry and Commerce said that the only thing that was likely to be interfered with in this country if a European war broke out was supplies of raw and partly-finished materials, fuel, machinery, mechanical replacements and stores.  For a self-sufficient country it was a pretty tall order that there was going to be interruption in those things.  I went back to that old statement of his, and asked him what forward arrangements had been made for the importation into this country of&mdash;then I quoted the various items&mdash;raw or partly-finished materials, fuel, machinery, mechanical replacements and stores.  I was told it was not clear what I meant, and that industrial firms were endeavouring to make contracts for supplies of these things and would be <Col N="2883" /> assisted by the Government in whatever manner was possible.</P>
    <P>In other words, the Government has done nothing.  If the Government has not done anything, what then about the great plans that we have for the future?  Two at least have been mentioned. One is rural electrification, and the other is not so much a plan as a statement of fact with regard to housing. For housing, one requires timber, and for rural electrification there is a need for electrical equipment.  Where is the electrical equipment to come from?  There is only one country outside the sterling area that can supply it.  Have we made any arrangements to get it from that country?  Again, I asked in that connection a very pertinent question.  Recently an arrangement has been made between England and Sweden, in which both countries have agreed to trade without there being any passage of gold between them, which was the old system. The idea is to allow a debt of something in or about £100,000,000 to be run up, but until that limit is reached no gold will be demanded, and kroner will be exchanged freely against sterling.  The agreement is framed in terms of sterling against kroner.  It is not stated in whose hands the sterling is.  I asked whether it was thought that the agreement covered the sterling in our hands, and whether we could use it for the importation of electrical equipment, if we desired to import that equipment from Sweden. I was told that it was presumed it was.</P>
    <P>That was the answer I got, but I suggest that the Ministry are not so stupid as all that, and must know that the Swedes themselves hold that it does not cover it.  I think that the Ministry are aware of what the situation with regard to the importation of timber into this country from Sweden is, and that we are not going to get any unless we are able to pay in kroner.  If we have no kroner we cannot buy much timber, and if we cannot get either electrical machinery or timber, where are we going to get the supplies that we require?  I may mention, incidentally, that there is a well-authenticated story that Russia <Col N="2884" /> has decided that there will be no trade in timber done with this country, and that she has put a definite veto on that.  As I have said, I have that as a fairly well-authenticated story.  If the Minister were to make inquiries from the Timber Trade Association in England he would probably be able to get advice on that.</P>
    <P>By the autumn it should be possible to ask the various Ministers what goods have been got into this country from the hard currency countries, or what goods that we require in the nature of capital goods, such as raw materials, partly finished materials, stores and machinery have come in.  Possibly, when another four or five months have rolled by, and when the Ministry have had time to place their complacency in opposition to facts, then probably they will have got a better realisation of what the true situation is.  I suggest that it is extremely serious and that our needs are not going to be given any very definite priority over the needs of the war-scarred countries and that we certainly are not going to ask people to let us get goods on the old accumulated balances of many years ago.  Therefore, we must go back to increased production in agriculture.  I see no hope for it except increased production in agriculture, and in a bigger exportable surplus directed to Great Britain.  Before commencing on a programme like that there would have to be arrangements made with England.  I understand that there has not even been an inquiry made from England to see what the situation is likely to be.  I do not believe anyone thinks that we can go on as we are talking in terms of keeping up the old standard of living.  If we cannot have the old £15,000,000 worth of imports, then we are going to have a lower level than we ever had before, and we all know that the old level was not anything to be proud of.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion I quoted, from the Report of the Inquiry into the Housing of the Working Classess in Dublin, the significant paragraph 133, and the reference in appendix 17.  In that appendix there is set out a summary of 10,500 families in and around Dublin as a sample of 33,000 working-class <Col N="2885" /> families, previously the subject of an inquiry in 1939, when the committee reported.  It appeared that of the 10,500 families which were taken as a sample, 20 per cent. of them had incomes of from 5/- to £1 a week: almost 26 per cent. had family incomes of from 20/- to 40/- and something short of 50 per cent. of the 10,500 families, which were regarded as a good example of the total of 33,000 families, had family incomes somewhere about £2 a week.  Now £2 a week in these days is the equivalent of in or about 23/- and by taking 23/- one is putting the figure high.  To think of the standard of living that used to be maintained in the way that I talk of is not, of course, to say that the old standard of living was very much, but still there it was.  People had to pay something out of their income in those days to meet rent, if they wanted to live any sort of a decent life at all they had to pay something in the way of insurance, they had to buy books for children attending school, and they had to buy clothes, fuel and food.  In regard to 50 per cent. of the families that I have been speaking of, all that had to be done out a family wage of £2 a week, the present purchasing power of which is something less than 23/-.  That is part of the situation.</P>
    <P>In another debate in the House I read a series of extracts from statements made by doctors when we were speaking here mainly in connection with disease.</P>

      <P>I am pointing out that if we do not get a better trade, based on more production, we are going to have a lower standard of living than that which we used to have. I am not going to go very far on this, but talking on the standard of living here recently&mdash;the reference will be found in the Official Debates for the 31st January last&mdash;I referred to the reports of various medical authorities in this country some months <Col N="2886" /> previously.  I referred to one very striking comment which was made by a medical officer of health at a meeting of Muintir na Tíre in St. Kieran's Colleage, Ardee, on the 20th August, 1944, in which he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The stark, naked, cruel truth appears to be that half of our people are in varying degrees starving. Since the war their standard of feeding had gone down very considerably. Present wage and price levels prevented almost half their people from having access to adequate food supplies.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This doctor said that there was a marked failure in the stamina, energy and fertility of the people, and that the low marriage rate and falling birth rate were in themselves symptoms of decay.  Later he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Malnutrition is just a polite word for starvation.  No amount of providence or thrift would enable the average wage earner in this country to-day to feed, house and clothe properly an average family.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>My thesis is that if we cannot meet the old-time deficit in our balance of trade and cannot have the old £15,000,000 of imports, we are in a bad way.  If we did meet it and reached that standard of living, I am pointing out that this is the position we have arrived at.  I ask the indulgence of the Chair to give one more quotation.  One medical gentleman that I quoted said that:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Investigations which he had made last year into the living conditions of 100 Dublin working-class families showed them to be in a very disquieting economic state.  It would cost 77/- a week, at the prevailing Dublin prices, to provide a family of father, mother and three children under 14 with the necessities of life, according to the British Medical <Col N="2887" /> Association diet scale, which, he said, was too low.  No allowance was made for sickness, old age, savings, burial, holidays, tobacco, drink, renewals of linen, etc.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He went on to say that out of a total of 684 persons, only 170&mdash;98 adults and 72 children&mdash;were above that minimum standard; 27 adults and 28 children were border-line, while below the standard needs were 459 persons. That is the old standard that we will achieve, even if we get the old-time imports coming in.  What is our situation going to be if we do not get them and then, how are we going to get them?</P>
    <P>Look at the situation we have reached practically at this moment. I have heard Minister after Minister asking in exaggerated tones of surprise, whether anybody would ever think that we would ever succumb to the totalitarian idea of restraining people, and yet here in the last fortnight we have decided that we must give the Government power to make it a criminal offence for people to leave this country.  They are leaving it so fast, in such numbers, that we have now got to the point where the Government must have power to make it a criminal offence in order to keep them at home.  What are we going to keep them at home for?  Once we tell the people: &ldquo;We will not allow you to go abroad to get better conditions,&rdquo; are we going to say to them: &ldquo;We will make you work here on whatever conditions we like to establish&rdquo;? I do not know what the Minister's view of all that is going to be.  We think of the flight from the country itself, that old heritage that we had in our time from the days of the famine, that flight which was stopped and which started again in the time of the present Government and now has got to the point where, as a Deputy put it the other day, we have got to make the country a prison house from which those who go out go on a ticket-of-leave.  We have got to the point where there is malnutrition where tuberculosis has become one of the social scandals of the country and we have got to the point revealed by <Col N="2888" /> the Housing of the Working Classes Report.</P>
    <P>As against all that there is a new policy that is accepted pretty nearly everywhere except in this country&mdash; the policy that I mentioned in the last debate, as put in very picturesque language by Mr. Vinson, who was then in charge of War Economy and has more recently become Secretary of State in America.  He told the American people that they were in what he called the happy predicament that they had to live on a 50 per cent. higher standard of living than they ever had to before and, if they did not achieve that ideal, then they were down and out, but if they did achieve that ideal, not merely were they going to be on easy terms but they would help the rest of the world to be on easy terms.</P>
    <P>There is that mood abraod of trying out this new theory, developing from Lord Keynes' theory with regard to unemployment, that unemployment in the main was due to what he called deficiency of demand, and that if you gave people purchasing power with which to make bigger demands, particularly if you put people into productive industries and gave them bigger purchasing power, they demanded and demanded more from their fellows in productive industry, and you got ultimately to a higher standard of living.  It is in a sense only a swerve from the old-time theories of production and expansion which depended on a growing population.  If you had more mouths brought into the world, afterwards to be fed, then you had an expanding area.  But, once populations began to decline or got on the downgrade, it was thought that system had lost its principle, and, therefore, had lost its power.  Then it was suddenly realised that possibly you did not require more mouths to feed if there was not enough going into the mouths that were already there, and that if you could increase the amount that you gave to those who were already in existence, then you could get to the same position as if you had suddenly multiplied your population by a big number.</P>
    <P>That is the new theory, and on that <Col N="2889" /> policy all countries are setting their house in order to go in for larger and larger measures of production.  All countries except this.  We have no plan revealed by any Minister in this country with regard to production.  We have one plan that can really be called a plan, for rural electrification, and that was not prepared by the Government. We have, as I said, a statement of a problem in connection with housing. We had a Bill passed into law here with regard to drainage.  We were told it is going to cost £7,000,000, and then suddenly the Parliamentary Secretary lobbed into the House and said, lest we might be afraid of this tremendous expenditure, that it was going to take 28 years to do, at the rate of £250,000 a year.  But none of these&mdash;the statement of the problem about housing, the legislation about drainage&mdash;on which very little has been done yet&mdash;and the plan for rural electrification prepared by an outside body&mdash;none of these, except indirectly, is productive.  Housing is not at all to be related to production.  It is very, very remotely related, because you might say that if people were better housed there would be better work got out of them, but, of direct impact upon production, we have none, and no idea of a plan.  What bewilders me more is that we have not even got any statement from the Minister indicating that there is proper appreciation of the fact that there are idle resources here, both in men and materials, that the only thing that is required to join those is this mysterious thing we call money, and that we also have plenty of that.  We have all the three conditions making for new production in this country, and yet we have, certainly as far as I can make out, no appreciation from any member of the Government that these three things are there to be got into a decent connection from which we could get what we desire.</P>
    <P>I have on other occasions&mdash;I am not going to go through the full details now&mdash;laboured this matter here.  We had revealed last night, in a casual answer to a question, at a time when the war in England is being run on the basis of something less than 1½ per <Col N="2890" /> cent. interest rate for money, and when we are tied up in that particular economy too, and when our banks are freely disposing of some of the resources they get here to the British for use in the war, at 1½ per cent., that notwithstanding all that, when people look for loans in this country, they still have the old medieval, antiquated rate of 4½, 4¼ or 5 per cent. And that in this country, where there never was as much money as there is at the moment.  There is a dangerous amount of money in the country.  But, apart from the sort of money that is coming into existence through emigrants' remittances&mdash;all that overflow here of the surplus purchasing power manufactured in England &mdash; apart from that, remember, we have good credits in the country.  We have had them for years.</P>
    <P>I have, on a number of occasions, drawn attention to the savings banks, the savings certificates and the trustee banks.  In those funds there are £23,000,000 and the people who put their money into those things, certainly do not demand more and do not get more than 2 per cent. on the average of the whole three.  Yet, we had the amazing situation in which a very eminent citizen in this country found it necessary to broadcast to the people of the country that those who were the propagandists for the Central Savings Fund had been told to stop any further propaganda, to remit all the references, that the Government did not want cheap money and that that situation is to last.  When I ask about it, I am given a whole lot of medievalism about rates of interest and how you must think of the lender as well as thinking of the borrower. But the lender in these cases was quite satisfied to get 2 per cent. and, for some reason or another, the Government decided that they would stop down on that because they wanted to raise a 5 per cent. loan at the time and they did not want people to be shoving their money into even Government-sponsored matters which only brought them 2 per cent. as long as there was a good 5 per cent. investment in the loan the Government was going to issue.  That seems to me the most <Col N="2891" /> arrant nonsense, and I do not see how we could tolerate it at this stage.</P>
    <P>If we are going to enter into new production, one of the things to be considered is how that production is going to be financed.  There is plenty of money available in the country for the financing of production but apparently our Government the whole time decides that they would rather go to the owners of money, the people who have got a fair amount of money in peculiar ways in the last four or five years.  They are going to throw open to those people loans at 4 or 5 per cent., rather than get, by a very simple change, the full use of this £23,000,000 which is invested in British funds.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Government must pay attention to new production and they cannot do anything about new production unless they pay attention to the financing of the new production. I suggest that they have at hand abundant resources to provide plenty of new production in this country at an easy rate.  The background of that is that there is no use in producing more agricultural goods than we can consume ourselves, even under a system of expansion, unless we know we are going to export them, unless we know the terms on which we can export them, and unless we know whether we are going to be paid in goods for the things we export.  Up to date, however, no arrangement has been made.  I understood that schemes had already been submitted to the Government along these lines, by outside bodies, which show it would pay the Government to give money at a very low rate of interest to the farmers, and even to offer to remit all interest to any farmers who take money from them if they guarantee a certain percentage increase in their production.  Although I understand the Government has not been able to find any flaw in the argument, for some reason or other the Government has not found it possible to adopt the scheme.</P>
    <P>Although I have no personal experience of the matter myself, one can see that the development of farm buildings, of everything except the land, stopped about 70 years ago, and there <Col N="2892" /> has been no real improvement in the matters that are affecting the land for the last 70 or 80 years.  It is certainly a fact that there has been very little increase in the volume of production from the land in the last 60 years.  It rose for a bit and then the present Minister for Agriculture sent it back again.  The volume of production in agriculture has been declining even during the war, but there is plenty of slack to be gathered in and plenty of opportunities.  People are anxious and willing to work and there are many people to buy the products of the land, if they can obtain the purchasing power.  The Government has apparently resigned itself to not doing anything in the way of production, to enable people to stay in this country and apparently is going to rely on the new powers to stop people from leaving by making it a criminal offence and adopting the totalitarian systems of countries they so often despise.  That is the extremity to which we have been brought.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Government that, without any frantic rejoinders about doing this country harm or causing mischief, what I have been speaking of for the last couple of days shows a problem that requires examination, that requires to be taken quietly, a problem on which detailed statistics can be produced, and which can be laid bare.  The people are entitled to have their Ministers tell them what the problem is, and, when they have studied it fairly and squarely, and revealed the seriousness of the situation, they should be able to tell them what they are going to do to find a solution.  People are getting tired of this method of treating a serious debate by frantically endeavouring to talk about malice and mischief.  People are getting tired of that system of meeting the very definite problems ahead of us.  I would ask the present Minister for Finance, newly come to his post, to take the problem seriously. It comes back in the end to the question as to how we manipulate whatever resources we have in the country in the way of production.  As I see it, the problem departs from the Minister for Finance at one point and goes to <Col N="2893" /> other Ministers, who are in touch with those with whom we must do our trade, to find out the terms on which we can do that trade.  Anyone would think, from the policy we have, that we have nothing to do but simply give away goods to the extent of £3,000,000, over four years, more than we have got in, and then we are amassing £15,000,000 that has to be filled in some way or another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention on this Bill, with you permission, to say a few words on the weather.  It is a sobering thought that, even in an Irish Republic, the sun does not always shine.  During the past few months of what is supposed to be the summer, we have had the heaviest rainfall probably for a great number of years.  This raises a very serious problem in regard to our food and fuel supplies.  We know that, in our turf bogs, men are struggling, nearly submerged in water, to produce turf.  The position may not be as bad in all counties as it is in the constituency I represent, but I can say that, in the fairly extensive bogs of County Wicklow, practically no turf has been saved so far and the prospects, with the year now far advanced, are that very little will be saved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question naturally arises as to what provision the Government is making to meet that alarming situation. I do not know exactly what our fuel resources are at present, but I know that they must have been very much reduced in the last couple of years and that we must be dependent on a big output during the present year&mdash;which, I am afraid, will not be available.  We can easily understand the problem that arises in all the counties that depend on turf and the problem that arises in the cities, too, in that respect.  If we have a big falling off in turf production this year, the only remedies are to increase our imports of coal by every possible means and make a big effort to increase our output of firewood.  It is <Col N="2894" /> the duty of the Government to go to whatever extremes may be necessary to bring in a larger quantity of coal, but if the prospects are not good in that direction, then urgent and immediate measures should be adopted to increase the output of firewood, by the felling of suitable timber and by the setting up of plant, without delay, for its conversion into firewood. Under no circumstances should we leave our people to endure the hardships which would inevitably ensue from a shortage of fuel.</P>
    <P>What is true in regard to fuel is true, to a certain extent, in regard to food supplies.  Those of us old enough to remember 1930 will remember the conditions that prevailed during the harvest of that year.  It was an abnormally wet summer and the corn crop was beaten to the ground, the reapers and binders were bogged in the fields and the common mowers which had to be substituted were also bogged down. Even the men with the scythes, who had to be called in, were bogged in the mud, in trying to reap the harvest. Every encouragement that can be given to the saving of the harvest should be given now.</P>
    <P>This raises a question as to what assurance the farmer is being given that, after having struggled with the harvest and saved it, he will not be robbed in regard to price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's remarks might be considered as being outside the scope of this Bill, but it being in the nature, on this occasion, as it has been on others, of an Adjournment debate, a certain latitude is allowed.  However, the matters the Deputy is now discussing are obviously matters for the Minister for Agriculture and were discussed on that Minister's Vote.  If anybody tried to contend that whatever was raised on the Estimates was legitimate on this Bill, the position would be an utterly impossible one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>A very abnormal position has arisen, particularly owing to the weather.  The saving of the harvest is infinitely cheaper in a dry year than in a wet year.  Costs are increased owing to the necessity, perhaps, <Col N="2895" /> of employing additional labour and spending a longer period in grappling with the harvest.  For that reason, I think that some attempt, at least, should be made by the Government to ensure that there would not be exploitation of the producers by those who are not engaged in production. However, I shall not deal further with that matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan spoke at some length about the difficulties in regard to exports in the next few years.  I think that in that connection it is on the farmers that the Government will have to rely to a great extent.  I think that the farmer is capable of meeting the problem of expanding production by £15,000,000 a year, which Deputy McGilligan says is necessary.  Here again, however, it is essential that the farmer's costs should be reduced, mainly by providing him with capital at the lowest possible rate of interest, so as to enable him to get proper farm buildings, equipment, and so on, and all the various improvements which are necessary to enable him to carry on. If that is done by the Government, I have no doubt that the agricultural community can expand production to such an extent as to make up our trade balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection also, it is essential that in regard to exports and imports we should not have a sort of economic war with other nations.  Our export policy, or our external relations policy, should not be based on unfriendly relations, or a sort of economic war, with other nations.  We should try to base our economy on the needs of other nations.  We should try to meet the representatives of Great Britain and make a long-term trade policy with them so as to ensure that our export trade will not interfere with their economy, and their export trade will not interfere with our economy.  We should try to have a mutual exchange of goods which will be of benefit to both countries.  Having achieved a policy of that kind with Great Britain, I think we could then achieve a similar policy with other nations.  There are other countries than Great Britain which would require some of our produce. <Col N="2896" /> South America, for instance, has always required to import seed potatoes, and other commodities, which we can produce.  These countries also might be able to send us things that we require, and I think that we might be able to come to some arrangement with those countries. That is the only basis of an external trade&mdash;a basis that will be mutually beneficial to both exports and imports.</P>

      <P>I want to confine myself to a net matter, but a very important one.  When we were dealing with the Central Fund Bill, on the 14th March last, I drew the attention of the then Minister for Finance to certain matters, particularly in regard to the financing of housing and some aspects of the report on housing conditions in the City of Dublin, made by the Banking Commission, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, I drew his attention to a report which was prepared after examination, by some of the principal officers of the Local Government Department, assisted by a principal officer of the Department of Finance. After a discussion on some of the details in connection with the actual matters that had taken place there, I stepped aside into a most detached atmosphere and asked to have examined one particular point, and from one particular point alone, which was the purely arithmetical aspect of it. In column 1366 of the Official Debates, I asked the Minister to examine the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy, please, give the volume?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is column 1366, of volume 96, 14th March, 1945.  I asked the Minister what effect, so far as the banking system was concerned, the loan of £1,000,000 by private persons to the State or to local authorities, for the purposes of housing, would have, where one-third of the money is spent on imported materials, and what, on the other hand, would be the effect if the banks, under the banking system, themselves lent £1,000,000 for the same purpose, on the assumption that the money was being used for housing purposes and that in the one case one-third of the money subscribed <Col N="2897" /> was spent on the import of materials required for housing from abroad.  I asked the Minister if he would examine the figures, but he threw some doubt on the figures I gave him, as showing what would happen. I then asked him if he would examine the case further, and he said that he would.  Then, later on, in column 1638, I said: &ldquo;Therefore, that requires to be examined and I ask the Minister to examine the case&rdquo;.  And Mr. O Ceallaigh, who was the then Minister for Finance, answered: &ldquo;I will&rdquo;. Later on, I was asked was I pressing the amendment, and I said that I was &mdash;in order to get a reply, at any rate&mdash; and the amendment that I had put was defeated.  The amendment dealt with the rate of interest on money when borrowed, but Mr. O Ceallaigh then repeated what he had already said. He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I will have examined the supposed facts which the Deputy has given us.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I think it is a very regrettable thing that we have not had the undertaking given by the Minister, that the matter would be examined, carried out.  In the first place, I think it is one of the main functions of the Department of Finance to keep us right in connection with all of those matters that affect in any way the financing of Public Works, and I feel that the Department of Finance, for one reason or another, are deliberately endeavouring to avoid carrying out the examination that I suggested was necessary, and are deliberately denying to this House their services in the matter of that examination.  However, I do not desire to press that unnecessarily, because I want, because of the importance and the urgency of the matter, to keep the argument I am putting to the Minister in a detached and isolated atmosphere.  I do not even want to examine the effects in various ways.  I say that, when the public lend £1,000,000 to the Government and one-third of that is exported for the import of goods, a certain thing takes place affecting the balance sheets and the income of the banking system.  When the banks lend money, there is a different effect.  I want to <Col N="2898" /> be assisted in learning whether I and those who argue on the same lines are right in their conclusions.  It is important that that should be fixed.  For that reason, I again put the matter to the Minister and ask his co-operation in having the facts examined.</P>
    <P>I say that, when £1,000,000 is lent by the public to the Government and one-third of that is exported, the following things happen: that there is withdrawn from the banking system, in order to pay for the exports, £333,333 of British Government securities. Those are handed over to some other banking system or some other persons to pay for those exports.  While they held those securities, the banking system here was earning on them an average rate of 2 per cent.  That is my assumption.  Therefore, when it parted with that amount of securities, the banking system lost an income of £6,666 a year.  They lost that sum in respect of that side of the transaction. As well as that, that amount of money went out of circulation here.  According to the report of the Banking Commission, money in actual circulation here is held in three ways, the proportions being very constant: one-sixth of the money is held in cash, one-sixth is held on current account in the banks and four-sixths is held in deposit account.  When one-sixth of that sum of £333,333 went out of circulation here, £55,555 in cash was withdrawn from circulation and it costs the banks 2 per cent. to keep cash in circulation.  Therefore, when that cash was withdrawn in respect of that part of the transaction, the banks saved at the rate of £1,111 per year. The money drawn off current account did not affect in any way the profits of the banks, but £222,232 was taken off deposit.  The banks, which were paying 1 per cent. on these deposits, saved £2,222, so that the net effect on banking income, as a result of £1,000,000 being lent by the public to the Government, one-third of which went abroad for payment of imports, was that they had, on one side, on parting with securities to pay for the goods, a loss of £6,666 a year and that they were saved by a reduction of the <Col N="2899" /> cash in circulation and by a reduction of the amount of money on deposit a sum of £3,333, so that their net loss over the whole of that transaction was a figure of £3,333.</P>
    <P>If, on the other hand, the loan was made by the banks to the Government or to the Dublin Corporation, in respect of the payment for goods brought in from abroad and the consequent surrender of securities by the banks there would be a loss of £6,666 in the same way as there was when the public lent the money.  So far as the banks were concerned, there was then £666,666 of new money in circulation and that new money in circulation fell under the three heads I mentioned: one-sixth was held in extra cash in the country; one-sixth was represented by extra money on current account and four-sixths by extra deposits in the banks.  To maintain the additional cash to the extent of £111,111 in circulation cost the banks 2 per cent.  That comes off their £2,222.  The additional deposits, £444,444, cost them 1 per cent., which was paid to the people who held those deposits.  They paid out annually £4,444, so that the banks lost annually, due to this transaction, £6,666 in respect of the securities parted with for the payment of imports, £2,222 to keep the additional cash in circulation and £4,444 for the additional deposits brought into existence, the total loss being £13,332.</P>

      <P>While the banks had a reduced annual income of £13,332 as a result of that transaction, they had certain receipts, because they lent the money either to the Dublin Corporation or to the Government at a certain rate.  If they lent it to the Government at a rate of 3 per cent., then they had, as a result of the income on Government securities, £30,000 coming into them which, placed against the loss of £13,332, gave them a net annual profit of £16,668. If their loan was made to the Government at 2 per cent., they had an income from their additional Government securities of £20,000, which, placed against the previous loss of £13,332, left the banks with a gross profit of £6,668.</P>
      <P>I have stated that, when the public lent £1,000,000 to the Government, the banking system had a net loss of income of £3,333, and when the banks themselves lent to the Government, even at 2 per cent., they had a profit of £6,668.  I ask the assistance of the Minister and the Department of Finance in indicating whether that is right or not.  What is wrong in that calculation?  If we establish the arguments that are made there as correct, then we can proceed to superimpose on that any other facts that arise out of such a transaction.  I isolate it completely for the purpose of having it clearly examined and for the purpose of seeing where the arguments are wrong.  I do not think it can be demonstrated that they are, but I think it is essential for us to say to one another: &ldquo;Here is a thing we agree happens, when the banks lend money to the Government, on the one hand, and the people lend money to the Government on the other&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have shown that in the early part of 1939 the standing committee declined to underwrite a loan of £2,000,000 for the Dublin Corporation. <Col N="2901" /> Then, having dragged it out for a couple of months, and having, to my mind, injured the credit of the Dublin Corporation in the finance market, they agreed to underwrite a loan of £1,500,000, which was not all taken up.  The standing committee of the banks had to take up £650,000.  If the public had lent, at no matter what rate of interest, the £2,000,000 originally asked for by the Dublin Corporation, the banking system here would have lost a good income.  It would not have killed the banks; it is simply one of the ordinary things that happens to the banking system.  But they would have lost a certain amount of money.  On the other hand, when the banks lent £650,000 to the Dublin Corporation, which was supposed to be a bankrupt concern whose loan to the extent of £2,000,000 could not be underwritten by the banks&mdash;when they lent them £650,000 at what amounted to 4.1 per cent., the banks made a profit of £19,000 a year out of this bankrupt concern.  I ask the Minister to examine the case I have made with regard to the loan, under two alternative conditions, of £1,000,000 to the Government or to a public body.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect that also requires examination.  The same report in paragraph 652 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We assume the adoption of a building programme of 2,300 dwellings per annum for 20 years, on capital borrowed at 3 per cent. for a 60-year repayment period, and we estimate the financial effects to be as under....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later, on the question of the capital cost, in paragraph 660 the report says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The total capital expenditure involved would be, therefore, for 20 years £22,135,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us take that figure for the moment. That capital will be borrowed under circumstances in which the Dublin Corporation, it is assumed, would pay 3 per cent. for the money over a 60-year repayment period.  All the money that we have borrowed in the past for housing purposes has been borrowed over a period of 35 years.</P>
    <P>There is a difference in the amount <Col N="2902" /> of money that is paid as an annuity for a loan borrowed for 35 years or borrowed for 60 years.  If the Minister will refer to any of the general tables dealing with these matters, he will see that for £100 borrowed at 3 per cent. for 35 years, the annuity required to pay off capital and interest over the period of 35 years would be £4 13s. 1d. If the repayment is to take place over 60 years, the annual amount would be £3 12s. 3¼d.  The Minister will find that if he was borrowing money at 3 per cent. over 35 years, on the one hand, and over 60 years on the other hand, the total amount he would have to pay to redeem the 35 years' loan would be £162 17s. 11d., by way of principal and interest, whereas if he were borrowing over 60 years he, or the local body, would have to repay £220 8s. 6¼d. That is to say, that he would have to pay £57 10s. 7½d. more when borrowing over a period of 60 years than if he were borrowing over a period of 35 years.</P>
    <P>If we take it that the Dublin Corporation will have, over 20 years, a capital expenditure of £22,135,000, then somebody in Dublin will have unnecessarily to pay out over those 20 years, by way of additional interest charges alone, a sum of £17,727,000, an amount greater than the whole of State grant and the whole amount of capital which it is contemplated will be given by the State for housing plans in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>When we consider the arguments that have been included in the report, based on costs, I think the houses will cost very much more.  It is shown in appendices 21 and 22 that flats in the City of Dublin in 1939 cost on the average £913 and cottages £620.  If we are to be able to get our houses built even at 1939 costs, it is going to cost us more.  The total capital expenditure for a 20-years programme in Dublin would be £31,000,000 and the excess interest paid in borrowing for the 60 years as against 35 years would be £18,000,000.  The report on building indicates that unless steps are taken pretty quickly to get started, valuable opportunities will be lost and we may not be able to get our programme started at all.  The report on the postwar <Col N="2903" /> building programme at page 9 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The successful determination of these two elements of the building programme, namely, the best initial effort and the best rate of development, is of paramount importance to the future of the building industry. Unless there is an effective start, opportunities may be lost which can never be recovered&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Unless we get clear immediately as to the principles upon which we are going to finance housing carried out by local authorities there can be no reasonable or quick start which will ensure systematic continuity of the building of houses.</P>
    <P>The cost of money is of the highest importance in connection with housing, so that these points have to be examined urgently and at once: the rate the Government are going to adopt as a policy in respect of payment for money and the period over which the Government are going to borrow. It is very difficult not to comment in a general way on it, but all our purposes would be better served if these matters were examined in a practical and detached way as early as possible. There is a very considerable amount of additional money in circulation, and, so long as that additional money is in circulation, it will be making claims of one kind or another.  There is a tendency for the population to fall, a tendency for the national income to become static and a tendency, because of the greater amount of money in circulation, and particularly idle money, which does not know what to do with itself, to make very considerable claims on the people.  I do not think that persons holding idle money should be given the opportunity of making additional claims on the national income, which would reduce the amount of national income available for those who are workers.</P>
    <P>In that connection, and just by way of suggestion, I should like to refer the Minister to a paragraph on page 34 of <i>The Economist</i> of 14th July, 1945, which, rather in connection with a different matter but nevertheless with <Col N="2904" /> a bearing on the distribution of the national income, says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The primary need now is to re-establish in the ordinary man's mind the idea that there is a direct connection between his own output and his own income.  If the unions...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that is, the trade unions&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...would join in a campaign of industrial education of this kind&mdash; similar to the war-time drive for production&mdash;then, as was suggested in <i>The Economist's</i> Election Manifesto, some sort of solemn treaty should be concluded with them guaranteeing that the lion's share of any benefit from increased productivity should go to the wage earner.  The lion's share is not the whole&mdash;the wealth-producing capital must be remunerated sufficiently to maintain its flow&mdash;nor would it be right that any benefits of increased productivity in an industry should go exclusively to the wage earners in that particular industry, who may have had little to do with it and may deserve a bonus no better than the workers in other industries less susceptible of technical improvement. Some part of the benefits of technical progress must be allowed to go, by lower prices, to the generality of consumers.  But the principle does mean that a demonstration must be made at all times that the ordinary man is the main beneficiary of the fruits of progress and that they are not squandered on the capitalist or the rentier.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That does not bear directly on what we are discussing here, but I quote it in order to emphasise that producers, whether workers or people with capital which they are using in a productive way &mdash; increasing employment and increasing production&mdash; cannot afford to have merely idle money demanding such rates of interest as will raise the cost of houses and take substantial sums&mdash;small individually, but substantial in the aggregate&mdash;out of the pockets of people who are the real workers in the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2905" /> There is a definite problem to be faced there and I think we can face it effectively and with understanding only if we isolate, in the way I endeavoured to isolate them in March last, and in which I again endeavour now, some of the important aspects of the transactions which have to take place in the lending of money, examine them carefully and openly and are enabled to come to a common understanding on them.  The Minister, when speaking on his Estimate, seemed not to have quite grasped either what I was at or the spirit in which I was arguing.  I ask him now to refer to the things I have said here to-day and to the matters I put before him on 14th March last.  I can communicate with him, and put the matter on paper for him, and would be glad to receive any comment from him on the case put up here and, if necessary, follow it up either by correspondence or by further examination from my point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess to a great ignorance of finance.  I got a cheque book about 30 years ago and never had an hour's peace since.  You cannot do without finance, and, to get finance, you must have exports. According to that very interesting fictitious story by Daniel Defoe, Robinson Crusoe had no exports and his life was very primitive as a result. Many humourists have dealt with finance.  Mark Twain gave a very good description of it on his return from the South Sea Islands.  I understand that 90 per cent. of the inhabitants of these islands are naked, and, being asked what was the principal industry of the islands, he replied &ldquo;Taking in each other's washing&rdquo;.  A similar reply is credited to a Dublin jarvey when bringing an American visitor around the city in the years before we started the factories.  We had only Guinness' brewery and a few distilleries and the jarvey's reply to the American was: &ldquo;Taking in each other's washing&rdquo;.  That was right to a great extent, but, in the past 25 years, we have started many industries.  I lived in this city for many years.  I have watched these industries grow apace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2906" /> I am glad that the position has changed from the day when, if one wanted a pair of thongs, or a pair of laces or a tin of blacking for one's boots, one had to buy a foreign product.  Yet we are not exporting much of the home-manufactured products. Our exports are still confined to such products as stout, whiskey, poplin and things of that kind.  We may yet come to the point at which we shall be able to produce goods in some of our new factories which we can export.  I hope we shall.  We have still to depend on agriculture to supply the bulk of our exports.  I was struck by the fact published in yesterday's papers that Denmark can get only 25 per cent. more for butter than she was getting in the pre-war days and the boats and ships are going back empty from England.  She can get not coal. Thereby hangs a tale.  Europe is coalless from Norway to Italy.  All these countries want coal.  Thank God, we are bogmen and that we have an adequate supply of turf.  I hope I may prove to be a false prophet but personally I do not think that we shall see much more coal than we are getting at present for the next five or six years &mdash;household coal at any rate.  It may be just as well.</P>
    <P>Can we not do something to help the old cow?  The cow is the bedrock of Irish farming.  I know that butter is subsidised and that that subsidy is coming back to the farmer, but our exports are still largely the products of the cow.  Some Deputies here may sneer at the bullock, but I do not.  I am too old to sneer at anything.  Our friend, Deputy Mulcahy, made a census some years ago in which he proved that there was more employment provided in County Limerick from the tillage point of view than in County Wexford, which is called the model county.</P>
    <P>I doubt if there is any model county in Ireland.  In my native county, in the lighter lands of South Tipperary, we challenge their record.  We are always able to carry on a fair amount of tillage.  There is more employment provided in the cattle-rearing counties than anywhere else.  I do not live in the Golden Vale but, up to some years <Col N="2907" /> ago, I milked 32 cows.  I am now down to 18 largely because I could not get an economic price for milk.  There are many causes responsible for that.</P>
    <P>I know I am addressing myself to the Minister for Finance, whom I heard in Clonmel at a food production meeting some time ago.  He amazed us all there with his knowledge of agriculture. I take it he is a farmer.  As I say, he amazed the Tipperary farmers with his knowledge of farming and I know he is sympathetic to agriculture. I say definitely that the whole basis of agriculture is the cow.  A writer described her as the bedrock of Irish farming and the foster-mother of humanity.  On her depend the pig industry, the fowl industry and many other branches of agriculture which supply us with an exportable surplus. She is certainly the mainstay of agriculture, particularly in County Limerick and in the heavier lands in my native county, in the Golden Vale, which extends from east of Cashel to the City of Limerick to a width of ten or 15 miles, 20 miles in some places. Up to the last thraneen the cow is fed in that area.  You have men there each milking ten or 15 cows morning and night.  They may not work so hard during the midday.  In the lighter lands we would work perhaps a little harder at midday.  But in the Golden Vale and the heavier parts of Tipperary these milkers are very useful men.  I wonder if we could cash-in on that economy?  Denmark is not able to supply all the butter that is needed, and butter will be needed.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see statements which were reported to have been made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister, for Agriculture at some function yesterday. In one of these the Minister for Agriculture announced that there had been an increase in the production of beet and butter.  All that makes for easier finance but I doubt if there has been any great increase in the production of beet.  Last year was a particularly bad year for beet.  We have the spectre of starving Europe before us and I was glad to see that <Col N="2908" /> a sum of £3,000,000 is being provided for relief.  I did not like to intervene in the debate in which the Taoiseach spoke but I was glad to see that the item of sugar was mentioned.  Some letters have appeared in the Press from which it would appear that some people are perturbed by the decrease in the ration of sugar coming on the threshing season.  I certainly should like to help starving Europe.  I should like to sacrifice a spoon of sugar at each meal to give it to youngsters in starving Europe but we have youngsters in Ireland too for whom we ought to care.</P>
    <P>Seas and fences will not keep out the typhus that we are told is raging in Europe.  We all remember the outbreak of the Black Plague which finished the previous war in Europe. They were fighting to the last man in the last ditch, to the last days of October 1918, but one fortnight later the treaty of peace was signed.  The unfortunate soldiers died like flies in the trenches of the Black Plague.  That plague eventually reached this country and I know one church in Clonmel to which 15 bodies were brought one night.  We are very lucky if we escape from the latest plague because as I have said, seas or boundary fences will not keep out plague, unless you have the people fed.  I certainly say that we must get sugar.  Sugar next to flour is a great asset in feeding the young.  I put figures before the Minister for Agriculture here before based on a price of £4 5s. 0d. for beet grown adjacent to a factory.</P>

      <P>I do not like to interrupt the Deputy's interesting discourse, but I should like him to come back now to the Appropriation Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I have been out of order.  I shall not develop the point further, but I would suggest that if you increase the price of sugar from 6d. to 7½d. or 7¼d. per lb. you would have plenty of sugar to give to Europe and to barter for many other goods.  I bow, however, to your ruling Sir.  In reply to a question in this House, we were told that £435,685 came in here for greyhounds last year. <Col N="2909" /> I know a young fellow who bought three dogs for £10 each and, inside 18 months, he got £196 for the three of them.  He never had a &ldquo;bob&rdquo; in his life; he got the £30 from his uncle to buy the dogs.  It is a good thing to get money in here by any legitimate method.  I would not suggest that Ireland is going to the dogs, but a large proportion of our population is visiting the greyhound tracks.</P>
      <P>With regard to this £400,000,000 invested principally in the Colonies&mdash; Deputy Mulcahy is better up in those matters than I am&mdash;that money went out under the British Government.  It has been going out for hundreds of years.  It went out under the present Government and the previous Government. Anyone who is lucky enough to have a little deposit in the bank gets 1 per cent. on it.  If you go up to £500 or £600 or £700, I understand that the bank manager gives you a hint about a little investment.  If there are ten depositors with £200, that comes to £2,000, and although the bank manager is not supposed to recommend investments I understand that he does it on the quiet.  That money goes out at 5 per cent. or 6 per cent., and there is not a city or colony in the world that has not been developed at the expense of Irish money.</P>
      <P>I remember that some years ago a loan for £2,000,000 was floated, I think, in an Australian city, and it was subscribed twice over in 48 hours.  There was a flotation in Uganda about 30 years ago&mdash;I think the sum was £10,000,000&mdash;and £2,000,000 of that came to Ireland and was subscribed twice over in 48 hours.  Some time afterwards there was a little flotation for the Congested Districts Board in the West of Ireland, and the Tory Government in power would not give it.  After about four months they did. They were shamed into it, in his own inimitable way by Tim Healy, who said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I object to that.  They could give it to Uganda, but they will not give it to the Congested Districts Board in the West of Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That £400,000,000 is spread all over Europe, Asia and the Colonies, and <Col N="2910" /> here we are with our country undeveloped. Can anything be done about it?  The Minister for Finance should put on his considering cap.  Where did that money come from?  We export whiskey, stout and a few poplin ties. Guinness' could not get good enough barley in Ireland up to five years ago. It was not good enough for the palate of the native until it could be grown nowhere else.  Yet, they are making the finest drink in the world.  It is good enough now.  Guinness' can make stout from Irish barley at the moment.  I suggest that Guinness' stout as well as whiskey and everything we export come from the Irish agriculturist.  I would suggest that that whole £400,000,000 comes off the soil of Ireland.  I would suggest that the Irish farmers own that £400,000,000.  They worked 12 hours a day to produce the goods, as against the eight hours a day of the town and city worker, and I would suggest that that money should not be allowed out while the country is undeveloped. The Minister for Finance and his financial experts should get thinking about that.  That is the groundwork of financial success in this country.  I have not even an elementary knowledge of those matters, but that sum of £400,000,000 has been hitting me in the eye from the time I got my first cheque book, or, perhaps, long before that.  I should like to see it made the subject of thought.  I would suggest a better price for the beet, and also that the greyhounds should be looked after. Perhaps that is more a matter for the Minister for Agriculture, but it is also one for co-operation between the two Departments.  I would also suggest that, in connection with the now-famous Tully farm, something might be done in regard to greyhounds.  I would say finally that the Minister struck me as being agriculture-minded by his pronouncement in Clonmel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what we can do about the millions that went to Uganda when Deputy O'Donnell was young.  Deputy Mulcahy was back here again to-day with the two questions which he put <Col N="2911" /> to my predecessor.  It is true to say that, if you extend the number of years over which a loan is repayable, the total interest paid over the longer period will be greater than that which would have been paid had the loan been for a shorter period.  It is also true that another aspect of that statement is that the annual charges for sinking fund and interest are less for the longer period than they are for the shorter period.  I have no doubt, in regard to Deputy Mulcahy's calculations of the very much larger sum that would be repayable by the Dublin Corporation if the improvements were financed by a 3 per cent. loan repayable in 60 years, that the total sum paid back by the citizens over that 60 years would be much greater than if the loan were for 35 years, but, as between the two terms of years, the effect would be about £1 per £100 on cost of a house.</P>
      <P>On this other question, the Deputy has failed again to-day to give all the data upon which he bases his various assumptions; at least there are one or two more assumptions that he would have to make before his figures could be checked.  He spoke, both on the last occasion and to-day, as if all the commercial banks in this country were one system, one bank.  There are, as a matter of fact, five or six commercial banks, and if Deputy Mulcahy's £1,000,000 came from one of those banks, if say, the Bank of Ireland advanced to the Dublin Corporation £1,000,000, it would have the effect&mdash; unless that £1,000,000 came back into its coffers again over the cashier's counter&mdash;of creating deposits in other banks, perhaps, which would have to be payable by the Bank of Ireland out of its liquid cash resources, or out of its capital resources which it had liquefied.  Does the Deputy want us to make calculation as if this £1,000,000 came from the Bank of Ireland alone?</P>

      <P>I am asking the Deputy now, and I am approaching this in the spirit in which the Deputy spoke <Col N="2912" /> to-day.  Does he want us to make the calculation as if that figure were divided by six, a quota being taken by each of the six commercial banks, or in what way does he assume that the £1,000,000 ought to be divided up among the various banks?  I suggest that is a factor which would have to be taken into account when considering what would happen if £1,000,000 were advanced by the banks to the Dublin Corporation for the building of houses.</P>

      <P>I am considering the matter and I am interested in it, because I think this new development with regard to housing is going to be most important.  Deputy McGilligan, when speaking here to-day, was quite brilliant, as he usually is, in examining one aspect of the subject without, however, doing very much to enlighten us in regard to the total problem.  He often reminds me, when I see him scintillating, of a fire-fly which sparkles very brilliantly without, at the same time, giving out sufficient light to show the difficulties of the terrain over which it flies.  This country, like every other country in the world, is facing certain difficulties in the post-war period.  It is facing certain difficulties with regard to trade, and unless the various countries can agree on something approaching absolute reciprocity in trade, then you are going to have deficits as between one country with another, and, also, surpluses. Wherever there is a deficit there has to be a surplus in the hands of the opposite country.  Whether some nations are going to be content to continue to be in a deficit position, and whether other nations are prepared to <Col N="2913" /> advance them loans to allow them to get into that position, I cannot foretell. At the present time you have this Bretton Woods Conference which, I think, has outlined a certain procedure for international trade and finance in the future.  That has not yet been accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, that is one step.  Whether other countries would agree that, what is acceptable to the United States Government with its peculiar position in the financial world at the moment, would be of benefit to them, without some adjustment being made beforehand in regard to the general position of debts, I am not able to say.  However, I should think that within a reasonable period of time, within say the next six months or a year, we are going to see upon what basis international trade is to take place: whether there is going to be any elasticity as between the debtor and creditor nations, and whether nations that are in deficit will have to tighten up and effect exchange control in as tight a way as Deputy McGilligan anticipates the British are going to do, I do not know.  That may or may not happen, but we may take it that if the world is to go back to the 1939 position, so far as international trading affairs are concerned, then we are facing another period of very tight exchange control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan's assumption is that the British are going to freeze the sterling balances in London as tightly as, say, the Argentine Government froze balances in that country for years before the war, or as the Germans froze foreign balances in their country for many years before the war.  That may be so, but there is also one other aspect of that problem, and that is that the Germans, the Argentinos and certain other countries with their complete and tight exchange control in operation for many years before the last war were in a different position from the British. Neither Germany, the Argentine nor Russia was a financial centre of the <Col N="2914" /> world, and when Deputy McGilligan was talking yesterday and to-day about England's difficulty in balancing her books of international trade after the war, and pointed out that she would have to double her visible exports in order to do so, he left out of account one big factor by which Britain balanced her books prior to the last war, namely, the profit she made on being the centre of international finance, insurance and so forth. If the British Government want&mdash;I do not know whether they will or not&mdash; to continue to remain as an important medium or centre of international exchange and finance, they will have to get back to the position when their pound will be made freely available to those who want to purchase it, and when the purchaser will have the right to transfer those pounds to any of his creditors.  I do not know whether that is going to come about or not, but at any rate it is one of the factors that makes me hesitate to agree with Deputy McGilligan that the sterling balances which we have accumulated in London will be worth nothing after the war.  It was, generally speaking, because that was the theme of the approach which Deputy McGilligan made to this question on the last occasion that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Local Government referred to his speech as being mischievous. Yesterday, he questioned me as to whether he had ever said that we had got nothing from the mass of sterling balances that we had built up in London.  Here are his exact words from the Dáil Debates, column 2004, of the 5th July:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the background there is the immense mass of several hundred million pounds sterling, not one shilling of which we have been able to cash-in for goods we required during the past four years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That just was not true.  Of the immense mass of millions of pounds that we built up and which we have increased during the war, we were, in fact, able to use £78,000,000 to buy goods which we imported during this last five years from countries other than the United Kingdom.  We have been able to do at least that much <Col N="2915" /> with it.  How much more we are going to be able to do with it I do not know, but naturally, having that amount of credit built up abroad, we hope, for the sake of our people, that we will be able to use it for their benefit and for the things we want to do when the war is over and the supply position becomes somewhat easier.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan, on that point, should remember, no matter what suspicions he might have of the British on a political matter, that when it comes to business and finance, it just pays the British to be honest.  It has paid them to be honest in questions of trade and to get the reputation for it. I think a complete repudiation of all the moneys that they owe to the various countries would not pay them if they mean to remain in international trade, and particularly if they mean in any way to redress some of their visible adverse trade balances with what are called invisible exports&mdash;the profits of international trading.  I do not think it would pay them to do it.</P>
    <P>Let us take the worst.  Let us take, for the sake of argument, Deputy McGilligan's assumption that whatever surplus assets we have in sterling funds in London are worth nothing, what are we to do about it?  Deputy McGilligan, while he is advancing, I am glad to say, in political and economic thinking since the bad old days when he had some responsibility for the government of the country, says that in the event which he postulates we must rely upon increasing our exports or on tightening our belt &mdash;that is, if we are to maintain the standard of living which we had prior to the war.  There is still another way which may contribute to lightening the burden on our people in that eventuality and which Deputy McGilligan, to-day, yesterday and all the time, ignores as completely as he did 15 or 20 years ago, and that is the fact that, if we cannot export more to pay for imports, our best policy is to try to produce these goods, or substitutes for them, ourselves.</P>
    <P>I am not decrying an attempt to export on a reasonable basis for goods that we can easily import but, if we <Col N="2916" /> can help it, we must not allow ourselves again to get into the position in which we were ten or 15 years ago in which we were depending on foreign countries for everything.  Deputy McGilligan quite rightly stresses the difficulty we would be in to-day, to buy even the amount of necessities of life that we are compelled to import, if we could not export and if our former profits of international trade were not available for us wherewith to purchase the things we require; but he ignored altogether, in regard to the list of trade statistics that he got, that if his old policy had been continued, instead of wanting exports or sterling balances to buy in £20,000,000 or £30,000,000, we would have been wanting exports or sterling balances to buy twice that much, and wanting them to buy things of absolute necessity to keep our people alive.</P>
    <P>Bad and all as the Fianna Fáil Government have been, we have at least in these last 12 years led the people in a campaign which left us less dependent upon exports and upon sterling balances and, if we are still left dependent upon exports and sterling balances for some of the necessities of life, it is not the fault of Fianna Fáil and I think that Fianna Fáil, when you take all the circumstances into consideration, and one circumstance in particular, did not do too badly.  That one particular circumstance is that, not only had we to deal with all the physical difficulties of getting proper wheat-seed, getting the farmers to sow the wheat, and getting the people to produce the turf, and so on, but we had to deal with the befogged mind of the Opposition Parties that were still dominated by the maxims of the Manchester school of 100 years ago.  Thank goodness, at least they have dropped some of that fog and are prepared to consider an approach to life and to economic matters somewhat in keeping with the Fianna Fáil policy, which has produced a certain amount of the goods that the Irish people required to give them a reasonable standard of living.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should go on to use the same old cry, &ldquo;and is reducing our sterling balances&rdquo;. There is no Fianna Fáil supporter claiming that, with all the difficulties, and particularly the difficulties of treating with a befogged and ignorant Opposition, we were able to create a paradise in this country.  We were not able to do it but, with all our difficulties, we did at least this much that, whereas we were depending for about £70,000,000 or £80,000,000 of imports in order to keep our people alive, under the Fine Gael régime, when we were depending on foreigners to supply us with every grain of bread that we ate, we got into the position in which we were able to exist on the low standard of imports that we had during this war.  That is a big advance.  I doubt&mdash; and will continue to doubt&mdash;the conversion of the Fine Gael members to any modern thinking in relation to modern problems if they do not admit at least that it was a good job that in 1939 we had made the advance towards self-sufficiency that we had made.  I do not want people to go out on platforms to praise the Taoiseach or the Minister for Agriculture for the advance, but at least let them not be repeating the old catch cries they used when there were opposing the measures we were taking here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go into all the details with which Deputy McGilligan dealt during his two hours' speech, as we are at the end of the session and I am sure Deputies would like to get home.  I am not quite as pessimistic as Deputy McGilligan is about the future of our trade.  I am hoping that the world has got some little sense as a result of the war and that we are not going back to the bad old days, either here or in other countries, when a hopeless view was taken of the production of goods which people badly required, while at the same time there were plenty of men and machines idle. Deputy McGilligan was talking about England's visible export trade in the pre-war years amounting to only £500,000,000.  For the last five years, she has had a visible export balance <Col N="2918" /> of somewhere around £3,000,000,000, in war goods which she dropped on her enemies without getting any return.  I am hoping that these countries will see that, if they can create that amount of goods and dump them in the sea or dump them in foreign countries, they can at least produce, with the same machines and the same men, sufficient consumable goods to enable the people to live on a fairly high standard of living and even to improve it.</P>
    <P>The quotation which Deputy McGilligan gave from the American Secretary Vinson was an expression somewhat along those lines, that with modern machinery and modern technical knowledge, there is a possibility of improving the standard of life, if we are enable to distribute the products. That is the problem facing practically every country in the world, over the long term.  However, for the immediate post-war years and for some years to come our difficulty is not how to distribute the surplus products but how to ration out fairly the deficit in products.  The idea Deputy McGilligan seems to have is that you can cure such a situation by pouring out more money.  I think that would only lead to disaster, when you have a fixed quantity of goods.  Simply pouring out more money will not cure the problem of distribution but may make it worse still.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the rate of interest, as it empowers the Minister to borrow.  The Minister raised the question as to whether, in putting up the facts I was putting before him, I considered that the Government was dealing with one particular bank.  The Minister will understand that I dealt with the banking system as such.  When the Government <Col N="2919" /> has to fall back on the banks to borrow money which it does not get subscribed by the ordinary public, it falls back on the banks as the lender of last resort.</P>
      <P>When the Dublin Corporation were dealing with the loan they wanted in January, 1939, it was the Banks' Standing Committee as a whole that dealt with them.  It was they who refused to underwrite and it was they as a whole who took up the £650,000 not subscribed for later on.  So far as the banks go, they have no difficulty in standing together as a group to do business of any kind.  If the banks have to stand together as a whole, to act as lender of last resort to the Government, then it should be quite easy to find a way to do it.  You cannot have the banks standing together when it suits them and then standing aside individually and claiming that, on account of their individual position, they are not going to accept a reasonable approach to the rates that have to be paid by the Government for money that is practically new money.</P>
      <P>We have a position to-day in which the Minister tells us that, from the Local Loans Fund, the local authorities are borrowing at 4¼ per cent. for housing.  If we consider the income that the Central Bank is getting from the investments it has abroad, we find that the accounts of the Central Bank for the last year for which they have been issued show that the average income the Central Bank is getting, on about £28,000,000 of British securities, is 1.66 per cent.  Now, as against an earning by that part of our banking system represented by the Central Bank here of 1.66 per cent. on £28,000,000 lent to the British Government, we have the earning by individual banks here of 4¼ per cent. on money lent to the Irish people for housing.  There is a shocking distance between those two points and it requires to be examined.  As a matter of fact, it must be examined, if we are not to have some hidden man of the sea of finance dragging the sustenance of our people from them and putting a very heavy burden on the ordinary working occupiers of houses in order to maintain idle money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2920" /> We will have to come to closer grips with that question very soon.  Just as the United States has been, in the last few years, endeavouring to prevent the banks from subscribing for Government loans which ought to be left to the ordinary people, we will have to see that such loans as can or should be made available in order to give people that money who are anxious to use it in constructive ways will be kept for the people.  When the people, for one reason or another, do not subscribe to those loans and when the Government has to turn to the banking system for them, we must see that the Government will not offer the banking system anything like the same rate of interest for loans subscribed in this way as they would be prepared to offer to people with genuine savings anxious to apply them to work which the Government or the local authorities intend to carry out. I do not think you can have a situation in the future in which the Government will pay the same rate of interest on money received by them or by local authorities from the banking system as they would pay to ordinary people.</P>
