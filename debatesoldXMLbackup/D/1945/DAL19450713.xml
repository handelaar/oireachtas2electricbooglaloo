No one could have assumed, from the information at our disposal last night, that the Estimates of the Minister for Finance were likely to be taken to-day.  At any rate, I could not be told at 20 minutes past 10 o'clock this morning in what order business was going to be taken.  I object to the order in which the Estimates are being taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to be very brief this morning because I know that every reasonable Deputy is anxious to discharge the work before the House as expeditiously as possible.  In my opening remarks, I contended that all the speeches from the Opposition Benches were based on a false assumption&mdash;the assumption that the Government were seeking powers which they would use in a tyrannical and undiscriminating manner, which would be brought to bear on everyone in the country and those who wish to leave this country to seek work abroad.  I pointed out that farmers, those who are afraid of the danger of fuel shortage, those who are anxiously awaiting the erection of houses and flats, especially in the City of Dublin, those who are concerned with the manning of our fields and factories, in fact, everyone concerned for the future of this country, would give very little thanks to the members of the Opposition Parties who are, apparently, trying to encourage, or at least to facilitate, young people in leaving this country.  All the speeches were full of sweeping statements and untrue statements. For instance, it is quite untrue to say that no one leaves this country to seek work abroad except those who cannot obtain employment in this country.  There is no need, for instance, for any domestic servant to leave this country.  There is a shortage of domestic servants in the City of Dublin, and any good domestic servant can get good wages, very good food and very much better homes, social and moral surroundings in Dublin than probably she will get in Britain or possibly any other country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that many fathers and mothers are very concerned because <Col N="2435" /> their sons and daughters are anxious to get away, very often for the mere sake of change.  I have known farmers' sons whose labour was badly needed on the home farm to come to Dublin on the off chance of picking up a job. Hundreds, possibly thousands of them go to Britain and work there for less than what their labour on their own farms at the present time would bring them.  Young people will go out of a spirit of adventure or a desire for change or, possibly, on account of a family quarrel or a false sense of values.  A contributory cause may well be the sort of propaganda that is being used by the chief Opposition Party and by the Opposition Press to the effect that this country is in a state of wretchedness and misery and which paints our neighbouring country as a sort of El Dorado.  Whatever the cause is it is true that quite a number go abroad who could get good remunerative work at home.  Frequently people who have been working in England come to me to ask me to help them to get a job here.  They have come back voluntarily, and they have confessed to me that they left jobs here to go to England only to find that, with the high cost of lodgings, the very much higher cost of cigarettes and luxuries outside the rationed commodities, and deductions for income-tax, they were in a much worse position there than they had been in Dublin.  Last week a fine young fellow came to me and told me he came from a medium-sized farm in Longford.  I pointed out to him that his labour was badly needed on that farm at the present time.  He told me he wanted a change and came to the city to seek work.  This week another young man came to me to help him to get something to do.  He told me he had been working in England, had married there and had to pay 50/- a week in Oxford for one room for himself and his wife.</P>
    <P>It is true that many people leave this country lightly to go abroad.  I do not for one moment mean to contend that there is no unemployment here.  There is, unfortunately.  I do not mean to contend that there is no poverty here.  There is, unfortunately. <Col N="2436" /> But a Higher Authority than any in this House has said: &ldquo;The poor you have always with you&rdquo;.  As long as human nature is what it is and as long as human frailties are what they are, there will be poverty in every country in the world, no matter what the general conditions may be.  Some of the poorest families that I know are families into which quite good money is going, but in which there is, possibly, a drunken or gambling father or an improvident, incompetent mother.  There will be the greatest poverty in homes of that sort.  I do not say that in any callous or fatalistic way.  It is our duty to alleviate human suffering and to work towards the elimination of poverty to the utmost of our power, but it is wrong to say that this country is in the plight that was indicated by Deputy Dillon and other Deputies.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan treated this question in a light and facetious way, as, indeed, he seems to treat most important questions.  He made great play on the words &ldquo;control&rdquo; and &ldquo;prohibit&rdquo;.  I suppose the Government Department concerned, when people apply to leave this country, will make inquiries, and if they find it unnecessary for these people to leave and that it is necessary for them to remain in the country, they will prohibit them from leaving the country. &ldquo;Prohibit.&rdquo; is the right word and the right thing.</P>
    <P>When Deputy McGilligan spoke of control, I wonder if he meant that the Government should determine whether these people crossing over to England should swim or go by air, by steam packet, yacht or sailing boat.  There must be some sort of control over them.  Deputy Dillon has very fantastic ideas about Fianna Fáil.  His talk about coercion and free men is all humbug.  I think Deputy Cosgrave, on reflection, will admit that the control in this measure is much different from that in the unhappy days of long ago when the conditions were purposely designed to make the people flee from this country.  Deputy Dillon and others might as well say that a man cannot call himself a free man when he cannot stop in a public house <Col N="2437" /> after 10.30, or because he must obey the traffic rules.  It is rubbish to talk of coercion, as was done last night.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon appears to look upon Ireland with a very jaundiced eye, seeing nothing good in the country at present.  It is very disedifying to hear and see Deputy Dillon sealing the heights of mock indignation and plumbing the depths of theatrical pathos, in order to make people believe that this country is in a state of wretchedness, misery and misfortune, when he knows in his heart that he should be thanking God, since we are probably the happiest country in the world to-day and the envy of other nations.  It is unworthy of Fine Gael, Labour and Clann na Talmhan to try to sow the seeds of discontent among our workers, to belittle the efforts of the native Government, to create an inferiority complex among Irishmen, to point Ireland out as a sort of purgatory from which to seek relief, and to picture every other country as an El Dorado to which Irishmen should flee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably no Deputy has spoken so frequently as I have against the evil of emigration.  I regard the emigration of our young people as an open gash in the nation's main artery, through which the nation is bleeding to death.  Nevertheless, I do not hold that the way to stop emigration is the way indicated by Deputy Fogarty, by a ruthless coercion measure prohibiting our people from leaving.  In his buoyant and boyish days, the Taoiseach used to talk about building a wall around Ireland.  At that time, the wall was intended mainly to keep out goods and commodities; but in this amendment we are presented with another type of wall, in which all the barbed wire is on the inside, a wall intended to keep our people within the country and turn this State into a kind of internment camp.</P>

      <P>That is good talk from the representative of a so-called Farmers' Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that interruption is relevant.  I have made it clear that we farmers do not believe <Col N="2438" /> in internment.  In some districts, there may be a shortage of good farm workers, but the way to obtain them is not by depriving them of their liberty to seek employment where they will.  The real reason why we are short of farm workers is that farming is a bad paying proposition.  Make it a better paying one and there will be an ample supply of workers, both of farmers' sons and farm labourers. Here we have an attempt to take from the ordinary citizen&mdash;and particularly from the humbler citizen&mdash;the liberty to which he is entitled.  It might be said that, even if we had the best possible conditions and unexampled prosperity, a certain number of our people would seek to leave.  That is true, and it is not an undesirable state of affairs, as the number who would leave when conditions were prosperous would be only a small minority and would not affect the life of the nation. If conditions were prosperous, there would also be a certain number of people coming in from outside, there would be an exchange of a small section of the populations of all nations, and that would not be an evil but would make for better intercourse between nations.  There is always a certain minority in every country who want to travel to see life, to see the conditions elsewhere and compare them with conditions in their own country; and it would be an undesirable state of affairs to take that liberty from our citizens.</P>
      <P>The speeches of Deputies Fogarty and Butler represent a type of mentality which would exist in a completely totalitarian State where the ordinary citizens are not considered to be entitled to ordinary human liberty. We all deplore the evil of mass emigration and consider it serious that many of our people should be forced to emigrate, but that cannot be stopped by the lazy incompetent method of coercion.  It must be stopped by the concentrated energy of all our people in the development of our resources, and not by interference with human liberty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mícheál Ó Cléirigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to prolong the debate as it was deliberately prolonged yesterday evening, but <Col N="2439" /> in the course of it many statements were made which, on reflection, the Deputies who made them will realise are entirely unfounded and are against the interests of the communities that they themselves claim to represent. As a matter of fact, the difficulties of emigration complained of are not put in their way by this Government at all.  Most of the difficulties talked about yesterday were created by the British Government and, if they are to be remedied, the statements made here should have been directed to the Premier of the British Government. For instance, quite a number of people chose to come to this country from Britain a number of years ago and are anxious to get back to England now, but the British Government will not allow them in again.  There are numbers of women in this country whose husbands are in England.  They are here with their children and they are anxious to get back to England because of certain conditions that exist there, but the British Government will not have them, with or without their children.</P>
      <P>The suggestion that this Government is preventing women from going to England to join their husbands there is absolutely unfounded.  Deputies who make that type of complaint should be better informed and they should not lay the blame at the Minister's door.  If there is any reason why our Government would prevent wives joining their husbands in England it is because in some cases both husbands and wives are anxious to leave their children unprovided for in this country. Can any Deputy with any sense of responsibility say that that is incorrect or wrong on the part of this Government?  Surely, it is the responsibility of the Government to ensure that children left here will not be forsaken by their parents.  Adequate provision must be made for their upkeep here.  Are we to take it that the Farmer's Party do not object to these children being put on our rates?  I think the Department have always met, in a resonable way, applications for facilities to travel by men and women of all grades in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2440" /> The provision that is suggested now in relation to certain classes of people is such that, if it were not there, we would have the loudest protests imaginable from Deputies on the opposite benches.  If there were unrestricted travel facilities from this country, and if the Government took no precautions, by having sufficient labour here, to ensure that our crops would be harvested, so that we shall have sufficient food and fuel, I have no doubt we would have an outery from the Opposition.  If no provision were made by the Government towards that end, we would have among the Opposition an atmosphere of ugliness and nothing but abuse of the Government. In this amendment the merest provision is being made to ensure that food and fuel will be provided for our people.  I think that is the first thing that should be considered here by all responsible people.</P>
    <P>Nobody who is employed in this country wants to go to England. There are, of course, certain people who may be anxious to go, and I think that is mainly due to the idea that has been created that everything in England is grand and everything here is in a hopeless condition.  Deputies should remember there are many people in England anxious to get back here.  They are continually writing to know when an opening may occur, even as a farm labourer, in guaranteed employment.  We have had statements like Deputy Cogan's a moment ago that farming is a bad proposition from the paying point of view.  If people in England were to take such statements seriously, they would not be anxious to come here and, indeed, not many of our own people would be anxious to remain here.  If Deputy Cogan would discuss that matter with the leader of his Party, Deputy Blowick, of my own county, I think Deputy Blowick would hotly contradict him.  Farming is a paying proposition for good farmers&mdash;a good paying proposition&mdash;and there is a greater anxiety as the years go by on the part of more men to get on the land as farmers.</P>
    <P>It is the greatest hypocrisy for Deputy Cogan to state that farming is <Col N="2441" /> a bad paying proposition.  There are no sales by down-and-out farmers nowadays; there are no farmers selling out because they cannot remain on the land.  It is absolute hypocrisy on the part of any Deputy to make that kind of statement.  If Deputy Cogan discussed the subject of farming as a paying proposition with the Leader of his Party, he would be hotly contradicted, if not in public, at least in private, for the sake of policy.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is very wise and reasonable in putting in this provision. It does not limit the natural freedom of the individual.  There are restrictions in every country in the matter of travel.  In many countries people will not be allowed back to their homeland under the laws of their own Governments. There is conscription in practically every country of any note in the world.  Because men here are told by the Government that it considers their labour necessary for the life of the nation and that they must remain here in order to provide food and fuel for the people, certain Deputies protest. I think it is a perfectly reasonable provision and it cannot be contested by any person who seriously considers his responsibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Many Deputies, even before this Emergency Bill was introduced, have brought to the notice of the Minister for External Affairs the cases of people wishing to go from this country to England to work, so that there is nothing new in discussing this matter here.  I am one of those who never taxed the Government for their failure to solve the unemployment problem.  I know they are not in a position to do so.  Many Deputies are very fond of twitting the Government for their failure in that respect.  Possibly that may be attributed to a great extent to the lavish promises which the Fianna Fáil Party made years ago. I believe all the crocodile tears shed in regard to emigration are nothing but pure hypocrisy.  I never regarded emigration as a thing to be ashamed of, as a thing to be avoided or scorned, and I never felt that legislation should be introduced in order to prevent it. I think that emigration during the past <Col N="2442" /> five or six years has been a great safety valve for this country.  It was a very good thing that so many people were able to go away.  Take the building trade, to which Deputy Butler referred. There are very few men in that trade to-day who could say they were born and reared and were able to earn their living in the one town.  Only one man in a thousand, possibly, could say that with truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This world was made for mankind. God made the world for mankind.  He did not make any particular country for any particular race or sect.  The world is there for every man to go through.  That is my idea and I suggest that every right-thinking man has the same idea.  We have heard a lot of talk about keeping people here.  Why, a man coming up from the country to look for a job in Dublin would be chased like a Red Indian.  We hear a lot of talk about freedom inside our own country.  I hold that for the last six years our people, having put up with a great many inconvenient restrictions, are yearning for the time when all controls and restrictions will be discontinued, and when the necessity for them will cease.  I believe that time has arrived.  I also believe that the Taoiseach has no right to curtail the liberty of any man who wants to go away to look for work.  I am accustomed to hard work.  I know all about it.  In the first world war I did not remain here idle one day, but went to work in England.  I finished work as a clerk of works on Wednesday and I was working on a scaffold in the North of England on Friday.  That did not make me any the less an Irishman.  It did not make me forget my wife and family.  It takes a manly man to make up his mind to travel.  When he does, it shows that there is something in him. With all respect to the Taoiseach I hold that he should not in any way restrict the freedom of any man who wants to go away to earn a living. Next to murder, the greatest crime that can be committed against a human being is to deprive him of liberty.  If you cannot give him work here, do not prevent him earning a living elsewhere. I think I am on firm ground in taxing the Government with attacking that <Col N="2443" /> liberty.  Therefore, allow every man to earn a living somewhere.</P>
    <P>Great play was made by some Deputies about the shortage of human material that might arise in the event of work starting here on an enormous scale.  Deputy Butler said that he had some experience of the building trade. I have some experience of that trade. The Deputy suggested that if building starts here, when materials are available for bricklayers, carpenters, plumbers and others engaged in ancillary trades, if workers were allowed to go away, we would have a shortage of skilled labour.  While using the words &ldquo;if&rdquo; and &ldquo;when&rdquo; Deputy Butler did not give any hint as to when materials will be available, or as to what these bricklayers and carpenters are going to do for employment in the meantime.  The Government speak of proposing to spend £100,000,000 over a number of years on building houses.  Imagine the number of years that must elapse before £100,000,000 is spent on such work.  An Order was made recently by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the effect that no person can start structural work exceeding £500 without a licence.  Deputy Butler may be a mathematician.  If so, he can divide £500 into £100,000,000 and find the number of years that would elapse before that amount was spent.  In the meantime where would all the men find work?  I am not one who belittles this country.  I think this is a good country.  I never said in this House that here conditions were bad.  I am not arguing from that point of view now.  I consider that this amendment restricts the freedom of the individual. If I decide to go to another country whether I am in employment here or not, I should be free to make a choice.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why restrictions should be placed, especially on the working classes as distinct from the professional classes.  If the average labourer living one and a half miles outside a town cannot get work in a town in the vicinity of his residence, is he to be precluded from going across the Channel to take up employment?  Why <Col N="2444" /> is that distinction made when doctors, nurses, and the professional classes are allowed to go in hundreds and thousands?  I cannot understand why there is one law for the professional classes and another law for the working classes.  We will always have an exportable surplus of human beings. Deputies should get that into their heads.  There is no use in getting up and saying that young men leave this country in a spirit of adventure.  That is a new saying of Fianna Fáil Deputies, very different from what they said prior to the advent of a Fianna Fáil Government, and different from a statement made at one time by the Taoiseach: that he saw no reason why this country should not be able to support 9,000,000 people instead of 3,000,000.  The Taoiseach made that statement some years ago, but, like a wise man, he found that he had made a mistake.  He had not the practical experience that some of us have had. Though some of us may not be Leaders of Parties, speaking from practical experience, I would not play second fiddle to any man in my understanding of human psychology.  Workmen want no restrictions on their freedom. They want to be able to go to Liverpool if they are fit to go there for work.  Dundalk is a seaport, and it is regarded as a next-door neighbour of Liverpool by workers, many of whom would not think of coming to Dublin when they want a job.  They cross to Liverpool just as casually as they cross the street, and they send money they earn home to their families.  Instead of being a loss, I think these earnings are invisible assets.  Men go away to work, and I do not see any harm in that if work is not available here.</P>
    <P>For that reason I do not see why this amendment should be included in our legislation.  It is only going to cause friction between different classes. As far as I can see it will not go to militate against this country if the amendment is withdrawn.  It will not affect the farming community or the provision of sufficient fuel.  I am as much interested in the progress of the farmers as any Deputy.  A great hullabaloo was raised last year about a shortage of labour.  I have not had <Col N="2445" /> any experience of it.  I have spoken to many farmers and as far as I know there is no shortage of labour, in the sense that any losses resulted from such shortage.  Some people might consider that a man should go to an employer on Monday morning, should go again on Tuesday, and then come back on Wednesday; that he should go as a mendicant day after day looking for work.  Let us be realists.  Does any Deputy think that any man of 24 or 25 years of age, who has any sense of manliness, should be asked to remain in this country looking for work that does not extend at the best of times beyond three weeks in the sowing season and three weeks in the harvest?  Is he to wait for nine or ten months idle or on the dole for a few weeks' work?  Of course it is all right for people with £800 or £1,000 a year, or those who have other sources of income to say that young men go away in a spirit of adventure.  Let Deputy Butler put himself in the position of a young man who wants to improve himself, or in the position of an only son who wants to go away and earn a little money for the support of his widowed mother, because an elder son had got married.  Put himself in the position of that young man who wants to get away to earn money, which he cannot earn here and which he is willing to earn if he gets the opportunity to do so.</P>

      <P>I am quite prepared to go with Deputy Butler to the labour exchange and have an interview with the manager, and he will soon know what the facts are.  Now, I am not one to go against the Government merely because it is the Government. As a matter of fact, behind their backs, I give them more support than some of their own supporters give them, and if their own supporters would follow my suggestions at county council meetings the Government would be better off.  At county council meetings I have frequently pointed out proposals of the Government that should be supported when their own people were only making things more difficult for the Minister concerned.  I have had experience of that, and therefore <Col N="2446" /> I say to the Taoiseach that he should withdraw this amendment and should not impose any restrictions whatsoever on people who cannot get work here but who are able to get work on the far side and would send the money home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know, of course, that when this amendment is passed people will still be allowed to go.  I am not so innocent as to think that the Taoiseach could, even if he would, prevent all and sundry from going.  There would be a revolution here if that were done.  I quite appreciate that.  On the other hand, there are men who are prevented from going on the plea that there may be a shortage here.  The question of the building trade has been referred to, and the question of fuel, food production, and so on.  That is just a myth.  You cannot build all the houses overnight.  You cannot build all the houses in a year.  That would be bad policy.  It cannot be done, for one thing, but even if it could be done it would be bad policy. First of all, the materials are not here, and then there will always be a certain amount of come and go; you will have men working to-day and idle to-morrow.  We have had that for a great number of years, but, for goodness sake, do not have any more restrictions on the freedom of the individual.  We have experienced restrictions for the last four or five years, and we put up with them.  I quite agree that that situation could have been far worse, but everybody is yearing for the day when we will come back to the old normal times. Businessmen, industrialists&mdash;everyone of them wants all restrictions and controls taken off, as far as it is humanly possible to do so, except those that can be proved to be indispensable and essential for the safety of the State. I maintain that restricting the liberty of a workingman in this way is not essential.  The fact that he is going away is not going to sabotage this country.  They went in years gone by, and they will continue to go. They have been going from time immemorial, and will continue to go, because I believe it is ordained that the people of this country will go out as they did of old, not alone in search <Col N="2447" /> of work but, as in the olden days, to educate the peoples of the world.  I believe that this is the lot of this country, whether we like it or not. Consequently, I appeal to the Taoiseach to withdraw this amendment and, now that the war is over, allow things to get back to normal as soon as possible because, by doing that, it will not create anything that would be inimical to the best interests of the people of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if I could bring this back to its proper setting again.  This is not asking for new powers for the Government.  It is simply asking for the retention of powers, or a section of the powers, which the Government has had up to the present.  The last speaker said that everybody is yearning for the day when these restrictions, controls, and so on, will all be removed.  I am sure he will admit that there ought to be no people who are so anxious for that as the Government, because a tremendous amount of time and a great deal of hard work have been devoted to the framing of these, and anxiety for the welfare of the people as a whole has been caused by the fact that we have had to have restrictions, but the restrictions were necessary for the life of the community in view of the situation in which we found ourselves.  The whole difficulty is that some people will not realise that we are not yet out of the wood.  Europe is in a desperate condition, and there is a war on in which our nearest neighbour is engaged.  Supplies are not available, transport is not available, and the life of this community cannot yet be carried on as normally as it would in full peace times.  That is the first thing that Deputies and people in the country will have to get into their minds.  What we are asking is to retain some of the powers we believe to be necessary to cope with the difficulties that remain.  We would be only too anxious for the day to come in which that situation could be completely and fully changed.  We are getting rid of a number of the powers we had.  In my opinion, and in the opinion of Ministers who have to deal <Col N="2448" /> with it, we cannot give up completely the power to control the departure of our citizens from this country.  I indicated last night that the power of that control&mdash;and you cannot have the power to control without the power of prohibiting&mdash;was necessitated by the fact that the neighbouring country to which they go has its own regulations; that life in that country for the last five or six years is not a normal life, and that people going from this country over there, unless arrangements were properly made for them, would find themselves in a very difficult situation indeed, and most of these controls have resulted in safeguarding the interests of the very people who went.  Controls are necessary in order that our arrangements will fit in with the arrangements of the people on the other side.  Controls are necessary in order that the life of the community will not suffer severely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is said that this is a restriction of liberty.  Of course, all these things are restrictions of liberty.  Law is a restriction of liberty.  There is no people which is living in absolute liberty in an ordered society.  It cannot be done. That is simply anarchy, and it would not be liberty because it would be only liberty for the bully and the strong. In order to maintain liberty for the ordinary person you have to have regulation, and you cannot have that absolute liberty which people talk about.  It simply does not exist in any ordered society.  I agree that the less control we have the better, but once it is realised that certain controls are necessary and that that is all that is asked for, in order to safeguard the interests of the community, then I am with those who seek less restrictions and controls.  The only question, then, that remains is: Is it necessary?  Coming back to general principles, have individuals in a State no obligations to the community in which they live?  Have individuals, who have been educated in the country, who, by the ordered society of the country, have been enabled to grow up, no responsibilities and no obligations whatever to the community of which they form a part? There is no State in the world that would accept that.  There is no State <Col N="2449" /> in the world that would act on that principle.  Every State in the world, or every organised community, holds that in virtue of the protection and support it gives its citizens in ordinary times, it has a right to control these citizens in times of crisis and when it is necessary to control them in the interests of the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>We are not doing anything abnormal in maintaining controls in time of emergency.  That is the ordinary, natural thing to do in every State. Again, I say that the fewer controls we have the better but, when it is clear that these controls are necessary either in the interests of the community as a whole or in the interests of the individuals themselves, the State has a right to exercise them. Will any Deputy on the opposite side say that it is a good thing that young girls should be allowed to put themselves in a position in which they may find themselves without any control, that they should go to England or any other country without anybody to look after them?  I do not think that anybody would say that it would be to the benefit of the individuals concerned, of their families or of the community that that should happen.  Will anybody say that a mother should be allowed to leave her children here and to go elsewhere to join her husband? I am not quite sure whether wives are permitted to go across unless they are going into work themselves but, suppose a mother left this country and left her children behind, would we have no responsibility as a State to those children?  Have we not the right to say to the mother: &ldquo;No, you must take your children with you.  If you want to join your husband and if you take your family, well and good, but you are not going to desert your children and leave them here&rdquo;?  Is it not obvious that you must have controls of that sort?</P>
    <P>Coming back to the other question, is it not well to have controls so as to be able to assure ourselves that our people who are going over are going into employment?  That is approaching the matter from the point of view of the welfare of the people immediately affected.  Inducements of various kinds are being offered to <Col N="2450" /> people to go out at present.  Advertisements are being issued so that many of our people think that there is an El Dorado on the other side.  We all know that cows far away have long horns and that young people can be played upon.  Have we no responsibility to see that those young people are not led away by these inducements and that, if they do leave the country, they will be leaving to go into certain employment?  That is looking at the matter from the point of view of the individuals themselves. Let us look at it from the point of view of the community.  I have said that every State recognises that the individuals of the community have a responsibility to the State in time of emergency.  Otherwise, why should such things as complete and absolute conscription of wealth and property and individual liberty&mdash;the putting of men into armies and the sending of them out to die&mdash;be accepted?  That is done to maintain the independence of the State and to provide for its wellbeing. Are all these things wrong or immoral?  Are they against the ordinary liberties which an individual ought to possess?  They are the complement to the doctrine that the State is there for the good of the individual. If the State is to effect that good for the individual, it must be in a position to preserve itself.</P>
    <P>Suppose we had only one special class of persons who were turf workers. Suppose they were the only persons who could provide fuel.  Would we be right or wrong in saying that we would not allow them out of the country, that they were indispensable to the well-being of the community?  Would we be right in saying to them that if we allowed them out there would be children in our cities who would be famished?  I am going on the hypothesis that we had only a special class who could produce fuel.  Would we not be entitled to say to those people: &ldquo;You cannot go because, if you go, the children in our cities will be famished.&rdquo;  Similarly, if we had merely one class able to produce essential food, would we not be entitled to say to them that they could not go because, if they did, the people would starve?  We have a right to do <Col N="2451" /> these things if they are absolutely necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody knows that, when you are carrying out general regulations, it is almost impossible to provide for every single case on its merits.  In all these regulations, a general rule has to be adopted.  A general rule will always be favourable to some particular person or persons and harsh to others. You cannot administer any system of laws or general regulations so as to bear only proportionately on the different individuals affected.  That would mean a separate examination of each case, which is quite impossible.  The only way to administer those general regulations is to work on the average because you cannot have regard to each particular case.  I believe that exceptions brought to notice by Deputies would be attended to.  That is one of the services which Deputies render to the community.  It causes a good deal of inconvenience at times, but Deputies are able to serve the community by making representations in cases in which the law falls rather heavily and harshly on individuals&mdash; cases in which the Legislature would have made an exception if they had had in mind such circumstances. Deputies perform that service constantly. Doubtless, there have been cases&mdash;I do not know of any myself&mdash; in which those general rules have borne harshly on certain individuals but, on the whole, I think that they have been administered as generously in regard to the individual as was possible.  If those rules had been applied in the way suggested by Deputies, the people would not have gone away at all.  While power of control will have to be retained, it may be possible, as time goes on, more and more to alter the classes and individuals who are affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain classes, I think, in respect to whom, so long as this emergency lasts, nobody would urge that the powers should be altered.  I have mentioned one or two.  So far as others are concerned, I assure the House that the attitude of the Government has been, first of all, to try to use whatever materials we have to provide employment here so that there will not be any inducement to emigrate but there <Col N="2453" /> are exceptional circumstances on the other side which make for very high wages there.  In these circumstances there are attractions for individuals to leave which will probably cease after a short time when a more natural level will be reached.  Remember, however, that those who go abroad will have the right to come back and when they come back, they will have the right to be treated as members of our community. If they have that right to come back, when things go bad on the other side, have we not the right, when it is regarded as necessary for the life of the community, to say to them: &ldquo;Very well this will be a refuge for you afterwards. Can you expect to have that refuge, if you will not help our community in its time of need?&rdquo; I think the matter can be looked at in that way.</P>
    <P>However, the desire is to get rid of these restrictions from every point of view, from the point of view of principle as well as from the point of view of convenience <Col N="2454" /> and practice, as soon as possible. The power of controlling departure, however, is necessary, both in the interests of the community, so long as the scarcity of supplies lasts, and in the interests of individuals themselves. I am sorry, therefore, that I must press for the adoption of the amendment.</P>

      <P>I accept the form in which the Taoiseach has put the amendment dealing with the matters to which he agreed the other day and I accept that he meets me with regard to every one of the matters then agreed to, except the matter of the Government's taking power to prohibit travelling out of the country of Irish nationals.  To some extent, I accept that.  In so far as my amendment No. 6 deals with removing that power from the Government, it has fallen on the vote which has just been taken, but I want to say, on the general principle which the Taoiseach raised on amendment No. 1, that I do not accept that the State has any right to prevent me leaving this country, if I want to leave it, and has any right to order me to do a particular class of work which it considers I am the only person able to do in the interests of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This, perhaps, is not the time to argue the full implications of the theory which the Taoiseach lays down, but I think it necessary for me to say that I resist and reject that theory. To go further into the matter would open quite a big and wide discussion. If the State is to have the protection of all its citizens, it must be a State so conducted that it will have the willing service of citizens, educated and cared for in a suitable way.  If we are to have a State here which is to claim the right&mdash;and particularly over the <Col N="2457" /> poorer sections, because, in relation to all this theory and all these plans about which we are talking, we are talking about the poorer section of the people&mdash;in respect of the people, some of whom get early education as infants in classes of 100 and thousands of whom in the City of Dublin leave their schools, to the number of 5,000 or 6,000 a year, with no place in which to get employment, but compelled to hang around their homes or the streets in the very formative part of their lives, seeing day in and day out their hopes wasting and their faith in things around them being blasted, to do as the Taoiseach lays down we are going to run into a very nasty period.</P>
    <P>There are men in this country who risked all, who risked their lives, in order to give the people freedom to manage their own affairs.  They would not have done that under a sentence of law, and if it were a rule of law that governed them in their action, they would not have gone through those times or brought about the solidarity of national opinion which they brought about.  Let us face things in a realistic way.  Let us get people to realise that this country is a free country and that its people will be treated as free people.  Let them be taught to hold up their heads as free people, and, holding up their heads, realise their responsibilities to their neighbours and the capacity which a human being has for serving his neighbour, if he brings his mind and spirit to it in a proper way.</P>
    <P>But if in this hour of the world's day and with the passing of the war emergency, we are to have theories laid down and expressed in actual practice such as that of which the Taoiseach speaks, with the temptation which the present Government has with regard to its own prestige, its love for power and the power it actually has, then this country is going to have a difficult and disturbed time of it.  I resist the Taoiseach's theory now, and the fact does emerge that much of what the Taoiseach now says will find itself in the backs of our minds when we come to discuss very many matters both constructively and in a critical way in future.</P>

      <P>With regard to what Deputy Mulcahy has said, I stood up not to advance new theories but rather to deal with statements that were made which were contrary to ordinary practice in every State in the world.  If, during the emergency, we did not have the right to do the things we suggest, we were wrong all the time.  Mind you, I was speaking of an emergency.  If the State, in a time of emergency, had not the right of control such as we have exercised here, then we were wrong all the time.  Why did Deputies opposite give us power to do those things?  They did it because they knew that citizens have a duty to the State just as the State has a duty to citizens&mdash;that there is a reverse side to that medal.  We have those controls because they were necessary for the well-being of the community, and for no other reason.</P>

That is my proposition.  It is also the proposition that in peace times there is no such thing as this absolute liberty at any time, and those who preach that doctrine to individuals are preaching a false doctrine.  Individuals cannot live in absolute freedom in the community. They have to live subject to the regulations which the community makes for the well-being of each individual citizen in it.  The other is anarchy, and it is the preaching of anarchy that is responsible for a great deal of the wrong-doing in the world.

      <P>Controls may be necessary in peace times.  We are passing laws here which are restricting individuals from doing what they like.  We cannot, in a civilised and ordered community, do just what we like.  The well-being of the community has to be taken into account.  The thing is that the well-being of the community has to be provided for with the least possible interference.  That is what we ought to aim at&mdash;only such interference as is proved necessary for the well-being of the community. In pressing for this amendment here, that departure be subject to control, we are pressing for it on the basis that the well-being of the community demands it, and that there is no avoidable hardship on the individual in the doing of it.  People who cannot get employment are not stopped here.  People who were under 22 years of age, when there was a call for the Army, were stopped, because it was felt that people who are in a position to serve the country when it is asked of them should do so if they have the means of doing it.  There were some restrictions of that sort, with a very good reason behind them. What I am telling the House is that the powers of control are necessary for the good of the individual, and for the community as a whole, and that the aim of the Government is with all possible speed to get rid of those controls the moment circumstances make it possible to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is not normally so anxious to speak.  To-day he was particularly alert.  The point I want to make is that the Taoiseach seems to me to be trying to import into his arguments for this amendment a philosophy based upon the restrictions which everybody accepts as applicable to our circumstances in time of war.  The Taoiseach said, for instance, that the Opposition Parties gave him those powers to exercise during the war.  They did, because they knew that war was raging in Europe.  They did, because they knew that titanic armies were marching over frontiers.  They did it, because they <Col N="2461" /> witnessed the Armageddon that was before their eyes.  They gave those powers to the Government, to be exercised in times of war.  But the Taoiseach must know that the war in Europe has ended.  We must approach the situation from the standpoint of that fact, and realise that the things you are justified in doing daring war you are not justified in doing when war has ceased, when the peoples of the world are turning their minds to a peace-time evolution of their national lives, and to preparing the world for a period of peace.  The Taoiseach, however, wants to say that, because he was enabled to do those things during the war, because he was permitted to do them in the interests of the well-being of the nation, he ought also to be entitled to do them when the war drums have ceased.  But the Taoiseach must recognise that, by reason of the powers contained in this amending Bill, he is exercising a domination over the lives of citizens which this or any other Government never sought in times of peace.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking now about pre-1939.  Before 1939 the Taoiseach never sought to equip the Government with powers of this character.  During the war, however, it was felt that certain extreme powers of this kind, if not absolutely necessary, should at least be acknowledged as something that a Government might utilise because of the circumstances confronting it.  But now, we are moving from a war-time situation into a time of peace, and the Taoiseach is defending this power with all the vigour that one would expect him to use in a war-time situation.  But circumstances, of course, are entirely different to-day. The Taoiseach made the case&mdash;I quite agree with a couple of the cases he made&mdash;that it is not desirable to allow a woman to go to England and leave her children behind her; that it may not be desirable to let a young girl go to England without the consent of her parents, and mix with a community with which she is not normally identified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2462" /> These are just commonplace matters about which there should be some type of control.  But in this Bill the Government is taking wider powers of control. It wants absolute power to decide whether or not a citizen will be allowed to leave the country.  So far as this Bill is concerned it is not the well-to-do classes, the big business people, the big farmers or those who occupy houses in Dublin's suburbia who want to leave the country.  The Bill does not affect them, but it does affect the ordinary working-class people, the ordinary workers who are bewildered from one end of the year to the other as to how they are going to make ends meet and discharge their family responsibilities on the low rates of wages they are receiving.  The Taoiseach says, for instance, that if the State decides that a particular man is necessary to do a particular job it has the right to prevent him from leaving the country. If the State claims the right to exercise that power it cannot do so in logic, I suggest, without recognising that there is an obligation on it to give the man a decent competence within the State so that he may provide for his wife, children and himself in the manner that he desires.  We might have a different outlook on this if we saw that agricultural workers were being paid a decent rate of wages, but they are not.  The Minister for Agriculture will not take steps to do that for them.  They are compelled to work for a beggarly wage.  They have to try to maintain themselves, their wives and children&mdash;some of them with families of six children&mdash;on a wage of £2 a week in this year of 1945 when the cost of living has increased by over 70 per cent. as compared with 1939.</P>
    <P>It is that low-wage policy, and the fact that the worker is given no release within the State from its operation, which makes this kind of domination particularly objectionable to me.  If the State would recognise, in respect of every citizen, the right to a decent family wage to enable him to keep his wife, children and himself in decency, one could probably justify the retention of our citizens here because by their efforts they would help not only <Col N="2463" /> to create wealth but to diffuse it here. While you have, as part of the Government's deliberate policy, low wage standards, of which the worker is the victim, and while you will not allow him out of the country but will compel him to work here for a low rate of wages, then no matter how much the Taoiseach may pine about his conceptions of individual liberty, he is, in fact, regimenting the lives of our ordinary working-class people.  The desirable thing would be to aim at a position in which our people would be induced to remain here because of the decent rates of wages and of the high standards of social services that obtained, standards that would be in accordance with Irish concepts of life, but we are not doing that. Instead of doing that we are exercising this domination over them and preventing them from going elsewhere. I could see this matter in an entirely different light if the Government had a different wage policy, but, so long as it condemns people to work for low rates of wages, it has no right to deny them the opportunity of getting elsewhere, either in Ireland or abroad, that standard of life which they rightly aspire to.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On that question, I want to say that we have endeavoured to get clear what elements the Government think are in the present situation that impact either on the public safety, on public order or on the preservation of the State.  So far as we can find out from the minds of the Government, there is no danger in any of these directions, except the danger that arises out of supplies and the provision of the things that are necessary for the maintenance of the <Col N="2464" /> lives of the people.  That has cleared our minds a bit.  I hope it will set the minds of a number of people outside at rest, too.  While that is so, we still require very much more detail in regard to what the Government is doing in its general plans so as to reopen the normal economic and trade activities of our people, so that the shortages we are experiencing may gradually disappear, and that the exercise of emergency powers over the lives of our people may be completely dropped at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
      <P>This Bill gives the Government power to continue the Emergency Acts until September, 1946.  We hope that, long before that date, the Government will be able to say that it has dropped all the powers except those that deal with production and with the distribution and supply of certain specific goods.  I opposed the Bill on the Second Reading, and I am opposing it now because of the powers which the Government is talking to prohibit exit from the country.</P>

      <P>I want to give my views on the Bill.  The members of our Party felt that, when the war in Europe terminated, we would have been able to do without any of these powers, with the exception of those which are concerned with the control of essential supplies.  Nevertheless, most of the powers are being retained. The Taoiseach's amendment, dealing with the departure of people out of the country, which has been very fully discussed, was one of the most contentious that came before the House. There has been a great difference of opinion on both sides of the House on this question of the control of persons leaving the country.  Some of the Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches have spoken as if there was full employment for all the people within the State.  That is not so.  The amendment that I have referred to is now incorporated in the Bill.  In view of that, I would ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce to take into account the fact that vast numbers of our people are definitely without employment, and that they should, at the earliest opportunity, <Col N="2465" /> grant some relaxation, thereby allowing people out of the country who cannot find employment here, or for whom the Government has failed to find reasonable employment.</P>

      <P>In North and South Mayo I know, from the number of requests I have received to intercede with the Department of Industry and Commerce, that it would be safe to say that there are between 3,000 and 4,000 people who are anxious to leave. I have yet to meet the young man or woman who goes cheerfully to seek employment in England.  Most of them would prefer to stay at home, and would stay at home even at a much lower wage than they can get in England.  I quite realise that at present, while war conditions obtain, <Col N="2466" /> we would not be able to compete with England in the matter of wages.  I do not ask for that, but I do ask that every reasonable effort should be made to provide employment here.  If employment cannot be provided, 2/- or 3/- a week dole is not sufficient to meet the situation, and they should be allowed to leave the country.  There are 1,200 people employed on turf production in Mayo.  What is the use of keeping 3,000 or 4,000 at home when only 1,000 are required?  According to the report of the county surveyor, a large number of the 1,200 are women.</P>
      <P>I know that we must have turf and food.  I am in favour of the Government providing turf and food by all means while the semblance of an emergency remains.  We must all admit that a certain amount of emergency conditions still exists.  I ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce to give a chance to those who cannot find work here to go elsewhere, while they are young, to earn a little money.  Most of the holdings in the West of Ireland are small.  There may be three or four boys on a holding and they cannot all find employment locally.  Why not give them a chance to go and save a few pounds to enable them to settle down later on in life? That is the argument I put up.  We had speeches from the Fianna Fáil Deputies who should know better.  We had city Deputies speaking of conditions in the country and it was obvious from their speeches that they do not know a thing about it.  They were merely trying to pull wool over our eyes.  Let them go to Mayo or anywhere on the western seaboard, and study the conditions, where the holdings are small and the families large.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All I ask of the Taoiseach is, in view of the fact that this Bill will become law in a very short time, to give more attention to the case of those people who cannot find work at home or for whom the Government cannot find work.  By all means keep the number of turf workers and agricultural workers that you want at home, but let the unemployable surplus get a chance to earn a wage in a foreign country. None of them likes to go.  It is the <Col N="2467" /> dearest wish of my heart to see the day when emigration will cease.  I think the same applies to every Deputy, no matter what political affiliations he may have.  Apparently we have not yet reached that position. Although we have had freedom for so long, it seems we cannot employ all our young men and women.  Do not keep them at home if you cannot provide employment for them.  Keep the number you want for turf and agricultural production, because we must have food and fuel, but do not keep four people at home for every job that is available.</P>

      <P>I oppose the passage of this Bill because I cannot get from the Taoiseach, at any stage, a firm undertaking on which this Oireachtas can depend that on a given day he will abandon the emergency legislation and seek from Oireachtas Éireann such powers as the Executive of this country may properly ask for the purpose of maintaining order, the safety of the State and supply in normal times.  What puzzles me about the Taoiseach is his manifest reluctance to trust the House.  He seems to think that, were he to let go these emergency powers, he might find himself on the morrow faced with some new and unforeseen critical situation and denied the necessary power to deal with it.  Why should he think that?</P>

      <P>There is no need for the Taoiseach to get vexed.  I am not trying to vex him at all.  Let me try to recall to him things that should be a source of gratification to him and to me rather than things calculated to irritate him.  In 1940, when France <Col N="2468" /> fell, the situation became infinitely more critical and the Taoiseach felt that, for certain Departments of Government, in any case, it was necessary to have something more than Government drawn from one Party&mdash;if that pleases the Taoiseach better&mdash;and he sent for the Opposition to ask them for their co-operation.  Can he deny that in that situation we were able to sit down together and, in one half-hour, overcome a lot of delicate and difficult problems connected with the establishment of the Defence Conference?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am arguing against the passage of the Bill, because I do not think it is necessary, because I think the Taoiseach ought to know that, without retaining any of these emergency powers, if any unforeseen contingency arises, he could get help to meet that contingency, without hesitation.  It might very well seem that our opposition to this Bill was irresponsible.  It really is not.  I think some of us gave clear evidence by our attitude on the Committee Stage that in regard to the matter of supplies we were very glad to leave with the Taoiseach powers which in themselves <Col N="2469" /> were obnoxious to us, but we felt&mdash; some of us at least&mdash;that if you had to choose between doing that and the black market, you hated the black market much more than the necessity of leaving these powers with the Taoiseach, and some of us took the view that we would give him these powers so long as he had the black market to grapple with.</P>
      <P>To-day the front page of the <i>Daily Sketch</i> in London is plastered with a story that an illegal body in this country has sentenced the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice, the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>To the Fifth Stage of this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that this Bill or powers of this kind are necessary to meet an incident of this kind. If people outside imagine that irresponsible threats against the lives of our Ministers or public servants are calculated to throw this Dáil into such a state of chaos as would induce them to suspend the Constitution in order to deal with threats of that character, they are making a very great mistake. The Parliament of this country 100 per cent. supports the Government in suppressing the attempt of any unauthorised power inside or outside this country to challenge the right of the legitimate Government of Ireland to govern the country in the name of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2470" /> We disagree with the Government in many matters; we are prepared to censure them vigorously in Dáil Eireann and outside it; but if anybody imagines that that attitude involves the support of any element in this country which would challenge the authority of the legitimate Government, they make a great mistake.  If anybody outside this country imagines that Parliament in Ireland, acting through the elected Government, is not able to deal with any conspiracy that is set on foot by a small or large group, they are quite mistaken.  We do not have, in this day and age in Ireland, to resort to emergency legislation or to violent methods to sustain ordered government against the attempt of an irresponsible few, or indeed of an irresponsible individual who may be concerned in this case and may address threatening letters to public figures in the country.  It ought to be remembered that, although newspapers inside or outside this country may feature such things as being occasions of great drama, such letters are continually appearing in the police files of Great Britain, the United States of America and every civilised State in the world. Any lunatic can steal a sheet of notepaper from a Government Department and use it to write a threatening letter to one or more important figures in the community to which he belongs.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I beg of the Taoiseach, even at this late stage, to do something which will secure for him the kind of co-operation which he got when we were putting the Defence Conference into operation, that is, to say now: &ldquo;I will come back to this House on a given date and I will repeal all emergency legislation; and, at the same time, I will ask the House frankly for the specific powers which the Government requires and will advance my reasons to justify my request for each several power for which I ask.&rdquo;  Should he do that, this House might, with a very much easier conscience, give him a prolongation of these powers which he now seeks to maintain, giving him six or even 12 months to examine the position and make up his mind as to what precise powers he may require for the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2471" /> I do not think it is necessary to recall to the Taoiseach's mind that, for two years of which I had a knowledge, his Ministers and the Leaders of the Opposition were able to sit around a table and, in the Defence Conference, argue and discuss in the most intimate and frank way the gravest possible matters.  I am speaking now of the years that I knew of; I do not know what happened after I left the Conference.  I do not think in all that time there was a single breach of confidence in regard to the proceedings of that body, and I think his own Ministers are constrained to admit in this House that those members of that body who were most opposed to them were helpful and co-operated in whatever work they had to do.  Why does the Taoiseach think, with that experience at his disposal, that in the future, if unforeseen difficulties arose, he would find himself obstructively harassed by the Parties of this House?</P>
    <P>Surely, there was never a time when it was more incumbent on us to make clear to those inside and outside the country that, trenchant as our differences may be on almost everything, there is one common ground between us all, that is, that the legitimate Government of this country shall govern without interference from any other body whatsoever and that any person who calls that in question faces not only the Government but the whole Oireachtas of Ireland?  How better could that be underlined and emphasised than by a declaration from the Taoiseach that he was resolved to put emergency powers out of existence and to trust to Dáil Éireann in future to give him the help in emergency that has been given him in the past?</P>
    <P>Now, I do not think I have said anything designed to irritate the Taoiseach.  I want to safeguard the reputation of my own country.  I want to feel in my own country that I am a free man; I resent the feeling that the Government of this country can infringe my liberty and leave me without any remedy whatsoever to vindicate my rights under the Constitution against the Government.  Is there anything wrong in that?  I cannot help <Col N="2472" /> feeling that a great many members of the Fianna Fáil Party, having lived through six years of emergency under Emergency Powers Acts, have developed a kind of feeling that that ought to be the norm, that there is nothing queer about living in that way. I have never felt that and do not feel it now.  I have always resented the necessity of living under powers of that kind.  I have recognised that one had to bury one's resentment and endure the humiliation of submitting to tyrannical powers of that kind, because the alternative was to put the whole State in jeopardy to the armies of the Third Reich.  Once the German menace has passed, I ask the Taoiseach to give me back the freedom I enjoyed before that menace manifested itself. The Taoiseach's reply is that he cannot do that, as some unforeseen crisis might come upon him, in which he would need to have recourse to these emergency powers again.  Surely that is what the Taoiseach has said.</P>
    <P>Now, he has said further: &ldquo;I want time to examine the whole thing and ascertain what powers I may require permanently&rdquo;.  Surely the test is whether the Taoiseach would say: &ldquo;On this day six months I am going to abandon the emergency powers altogether and then going to ask Dáil Eireann for powers to deal with the emergencies of which I then have knowledge&rdquo;.  But that involves the Taoiseach trusting Dáil Eireann that if some emergency arises which he has not foreseen, he will get from the Dáil the powers necessary to deal with it forthwith.  I say to him that his past experience should teach him that he might safely depend on the Oireachtas to do so; and it is because he will not trust the Oireachtas to do so that he wants to hang on to all these powers until he is perfectly certain that he knows of every contingency which may arise.  If he adheres to that view, he is going to hang on to the powers for ever, since no man can foresee the future with certainty.</P>
    <P>There is the issue joined between us.  I ask him to trust Oireachtas Eireann to give the legitimate Government of this country adequate powers <Col N="2473" /> to deal with any threat that may arise to the safety of the State, to the maintenance of public order or to the protection of the people; and the Taoiseach's reply is: &ldquo;I cannot do that; I must retain all the powers and use them, if and when I think it necessary to do so&rdquo;.  I beg of the Taoiseach to see where that is leading.</P>
    <P>I ask the Taoiseach to think of himself as being on the Opposition side and, hearing the Leader of the Government, of which he was not a member, making that claim, what would he say to himself?  Would he not say: &ldquo;That means that he wants to keep these powers forever; that means that for ever more the Constitution of this country is in abeyance&rdquo;. And, remember, that so long as the Emergency Powers Act is in operation the Constitution is in virtual abeyance. I am asking the Taoiseach to bring the Constitution back into operation and give us back all our constitutional rights.  I have not yet had from him any satisfactory explanation of why he will not.</P>
    <P>This much is certain, if he adheres to the view that he will never surrender the Emergency Powers Acts until he has foreseen every contingency that can possibly arise, it means that we never will have the Constitution back; that we never will have the Emergency Powers Act code relinquished, and that the status of every citizen is altered, and altered in such a way as to leave the Irish people infinitely less liberty than they enjoyed under the bloodiest administration that Balfour ever sustained in this country.  None of us complained of that while the World War was in progress, but it will be an enduring shame to this country if, when the crisis has passed, the shade of Balfour can say: &ldquo;The worst that I dared to do in Ireland pales into insignificance beside what an Irish Government claims the right to do 50 years after I left the scene&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>As I and the Party to which I belong opposed the amendment which the Taoiseach has embodied in the Bill, with the assistance of the majority in the House, I feel I could not let the Fifth Stage of this <Col N="2474" /> measure pass without making some comments.  The Taoiseach seems to be completely unaware of the fact that there are considerable numbers of men and women, particularly men, who have sought facilities to leave this country in order to get work abroad, and have been refused.  He seems to be absolutely unaware of that fact, but, if he is, I and others like me, who come from the West of Ireland, are not unaware of it.  At a rough guess I can say that I have had 300 letters asking me to intercede with the Department of Industry and Commerce in order to help the writers to leave the country.  Hundreds more have been turned away from my door and from the door of Deputy Blowick on the ground that nothing can be done for them.</P>
      <P>The decision of the local Gárdaí counts for everything.  Many of the Gárdaí are desirous to help, but they are afraid that if they do anything it will get them into trouble.  Therefore, they are reluctant to define who is or is not an agricultural worker or a person experienced in turf production. There are many men in the West who are carpenters, joiners or engaged in other trades who have got offers of work abroad.  They cannot get employment in this country.  They have sought for facilities to leave the country, but they have been turned down merely because they have a knowledge of agricultural work and turf production.  I am a joiner by trade, but I have a knowledge of agricultural work and of turf production. If I was anxious to get to England, if I was not a member of the Dáil and wanted to get employment in England, I would be stopped by the Gárdaí, who would tell me that I have experience of turf production. But I have never earned my living by producing turf, and that is the difficulty that many people experience.  It is obvious that, with the Taoiseach's amendment embodied in the Bill, we will experience still more difficulties.</P>

      <P>I suggest to the Taoiseach and the Department of <Col N="2475" /> Industry and Commerce that when we make representations to them we do so merely because we feel it is our duty and because we know that the men who desire to leave the country have good reasons for making their requests to get away.  Their chief reason is their anxiety to maintain their offspring, their parents or other dependents.  I have worked outside this country for a number of years.  I did not do so in order to see London, or other big English cities.  Once you have seen one you have seen the lot, because they are all alike.  I remember coming home in April, 1942.  I made every possible effort to get back the following September but I was not allowed to do so.  I was told I could not go, although there was work waiting for me on the Clyde, in the shipyards of Glasgow, at £10 a week.  It was my good or my bad fortune to have to remain here.</P>

If it was for the purpose of helping to build up British social standards, it would be different, but when it was for the purpose of constructing something intended for the destruction of the human race, I had the feeling I was as well off not to go back.</P>
      <P>I listened to Deputy Dillon talking about the emergency powers and the dangers of these powers in relation to the Constitution.  I understand that when certain men here are brought before the civil courts, especially in connection with political crimes, the jury are nervous about giving a decision and for that reason it is felt that it is necessary to have powers so that a jury can be dispensed with and the men can be tried in what is known as a military court.</P>

While, on the one hand they can retain the emergency powers, on the other, let them set an example by having these individuals tried in the ordinary civil courts, or the High Courts, before a judge and jury.  The juries could be drawn from widely different areas&mdash;it is a pretty large country&mdash;and I cannot see how their identity could be established or how it could be ascertained where they come from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we should make an effort to get away from the practice of mentioning what is known as I.R.A. and Republicans, who plead for the Republic which the Taoiseach and <Col N="2477" /> many more set out to achieve&mdash;but which has not yet been achieved&mdash;and that these people say they are the only persons capable of achieving, either by force or by other methods. If these men are not going to accept the ordinary decisions of the civil courts, and if they are going by blackmail and threats to prevent juries from coming to decisions, then come back to Parliament which can enable the military courts to be used.  The first thing to be done is to give these people the privilege of trial in the ordinary civil courts.</P>

      <P>After what the Taoiseach and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle have said I do not intend to refer further to that subject.  I think it would be a wise and proper step to take if any crimes are committed in future which could be described as political crimes, that the culprits should be tried in the ordinary courts, until there is a genuine cause for going back to military courts. Until that is achieved I think there is a good case for the argument of these gentlemen, that they are not treated as citizens, or as if they were in an ordinary civilian community or democratic State.  Because of that state of affairs, as Deputy Dillon stated, newspapers can try to create the impression amongst the people, and outside this State, that we are living in a country where there is turmoil and insecurity, and where ordinary citizens have no guarantee of security. It is for that reason that I have tried to make this point that we should make a start, now that hostilities have ceased in Europe, and turn over a new leaf, by trying to make men who commit crimes believe that we are prepared to give them all the facilities <Col N="2479" /> of the civil courts and of juries when defending themselves and declaring themselves to be innocent.  It was stated by Deputies on the Government Benches that the amendment which has caused this controversy is an essential one.  It may be essential with regard to providing the necessary supplies of fuel and food.  As far as the fuel supply is concerned, if it has not been secured already, there will be a poor chance of getting it now, as the greater portion of the season for saving fuel is over.</P>
      <P>It has been argued by some Deputies that our attitude in opposing the amendment is to create the impression outside this country that this Government or any future Government will not be able to bring about a situation in which the majority of our people will be able to make a living at home. No Deputy has greater experience of what it means to have to go outside to earn a living than I have had.  As a boy I followed the early campaign of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I followed the Taoiseach and gate crashed his meetings so that I should not miss any of his words.  I thought when I would come of age that I would have security of employment in this State. When I came of age and had my time served I found that my only hope was to emigrate.  I could not see any difference in that respect between the previous Administration and the present one.  It was stated that the emigration from this country was a disgrace.  Deputy Butler can make a speech which will appeal to the patriotic section of the community, and to every man who loves Ireland, but the purpose of such a speech is to cloud the real issue.  No Deputy on the Opposition or on the Farmers' Benches wishes to discredit this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I shall conclude by saying that it is my opinion and belief that if we are to keep our people here at home, if we are to divest ourselves of the necessity for introducing legislation of the kind that is before the House now, it can only be done by a complete overhaul of the social system that exists here at the present moment.  There is no other possible way in which we can achieve the ultimate desire which the people of this country possess.  There is no other possible way in which we can achieve ultimate agreement, and there is no other possible way in which this country can be governed except by giving to the people security of employment and security of wage so that as they grow up they will be able to look to the future in this country with a certain guarantee that when they are able to take up employment it will be within the State, and not outside it.  If they grow up along these lines, it will be good for the future and there will be no need of legislation of this kind to curtail emigration.  That is a public admission by the Fianna Fáil Party and by the Taoiseach himself of his failure in the past 15 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understood, and so did many others, that instead of having to introduce legislation to prevent our people from emigrating it might be necessary to introduce legislation to bring back to the country those who had emigrated, but I see now that, instead of there being an enticement or security which would induce people to come back, legislation has to be brought in to prevent our people from emigrating.  There is no case to be made for such a thing.  The case is being made now that legislation is necessary, and instead of bringing people back to the country they are preventing them from leaving.  Now, there is no Irishman or Irishwoman, no matter from what part of the country they come, who is willing to leave this country, having regard to the state in which the world is at the moment and the state in which our nearest neighbour finds herself.  Consequently, our people are not anxious to go, and the only reason they are <Col N="2482" /> leaving the country is that there is no security here and no employment, and because the social system under which we live is not a system which will give us in the future any more security than it has given us in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an annual Bill, and the existing statute must expire in September next.  Because of the fact that it will expire in September, and that the House is not likely to sit between this and next September, we are asked to pass it now without amendment.  When it was introduced in September, 1939, it was to have an annual life and the House was to be given an opportunity of reviewing it every year and be given an opportunity of ascertaining the manner in which the Bill was utilised by the Government, and generally reviewing the Government's activities under the Act.  If we pass this Bill to-day, the House will see the Bill again in September, 1946.  In other words, in 1946, the Taoiseach, with his affection for the powers contained in this Bill, will come along here and ask the House to continue and amend the Bill unless, of course, in the meantime, he decides to shed the powers which are contained in this Bill.  I put this suggestion to the Taoiseach&mdash;it is a double-barrelled suggestion&mdash;firstly, I think it is preferable, if this Bill is to be continued, that we should discuss it at some other time instead of at the end of a Parliamentary Session, when tempers are frayed and temperatures are high and when you do not get that calmness of discussion which is so desirable on a Bill of this character. I suggest, therefore, that the Taoiseach might utilise the Seanad to amend this Bill so as to provide that its normal life will terminate in March or April next, so that we can discuss the question of its continuance free from that <Col N="2484" /> feeling of hurry, haste and irritation which has been a feature of the discussion of the Bill this year and, so far as I recollect, other years as well. That is my first suggestion.</P>
      <P>My second suggestion is that, in any event, we should get an earlier opportunity than we have previously had of reviewing the Government's activities under this Bill.  In other words, we ought not to have to wait until September, 1946, before we are presented with a proposal for the continuance of this Act.  The Taoiseach might consent to let us review the entire position in, say, March next, when we could see the changes which had taken place in world circumstances and the changes which had taken place in our internal position and arrive at a conclusion as to the powers with which it would be necessary to equip the Government to deal with such problems as required to be dealt with in the post-war period, and the powers which the Government should shed, having regard to the return of normal conditions.  I hope that the Taoiseach will be able to tell us that he has no objection to providing us, by shortening the life of this Bill, with an opportunity of reviewing the whole position much earlier than would be the case ordinarily, if this Bill continues to be one of an annual character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter on which I should like to get an indication of the mind of the Taoiseach and of the Government.  I refer to the Government's wage policy in relation to this Bill.  As the Taoiseach knows, this Bill is being utilised for the purpose of regulating wages and fixing wage ceilings.  The Government say, in effect, to the workers: &ldquo;No matter how the cost of living increases, you will get only the increase conditioned by the ceiling which has been fixed.&rdquo; The ceiling to-day is 11/- per week.  In other words, no class of worker can receive an emergency bonus at a rate greater than 11/- per week.  While the Government tell the workers, through the medium of this Emergency Powers Act, that the maximum increase they will be able to obtain is 11/-, on the other hand, they appear to be quite <Col N="2485" /> satisfied with a price policy which has permitted a price increase of not less than 71 per cent.  While prices have risen by not less than 71 per cent., wages have risen by not more than 11/- or, approximately, 15 per cent.  I should like to know whether the Government intends to perpetuate that lopsided conception of economics which compels people to pay prices greater by 71 per cent. than they were in 1939 out of a wage increase of, approximately, 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach is fair in this discussion, he will have to acknowledge that the efforts of the Government to control prices were, in the main, a dismal failure.  While the average increase in the cost of living is represented by the index figure as 71 per cent., if you were to go into a draper's shop to purchase certain goods, you would pay substantially more than 71 per cent. over the 1939 prices.  The real increase in the cost of living is substantially greater than 71 per cent. While the Government have permitted prices to increase to that extent and have permitted those who manufacture and distribute on a large scale to get substantial rates of profit, on the other hand, they have been wickedly efficient in compelling workers to accept a wage increase which is completely and adversely disproportionate to the increase which has taken place in the cost of living during the past five and a half years.  Does the Government intend to continue that policy?  Is it intended, for instance, to permit the cost of living to remain as high, judged by Government standards, as 71 per cent. over the 1939 figure and is it intended that the workers should get no more than an increase of 15 per cent. in their wages to meet that substantial increase in the cost of living? If that is intended then, although the workers will have seen the war end, they will not have seen an end of the problems which arose out of the war.</P>
    <P>The effect of the Government's policy during the past five years has been to make the struggle for life, so far as the mass of working people are concerned, keener and sterner and a continuance of that policy will result in the continued debasement of the <Col N="2486" /> standard of living of the masses of the people.  To ask workers in receipt of low wages, particularly workers in the agricultural industry, when prices are 195 per cent. over the level of July, 1914, and 73 per cent. over those of August, 1939, to produce, say, food for the nation on a wage of £2 per week is to ask them to live on less than subsistence standards.  The Taoiseach owes it to the House and to the country to say in what direction the Government's mind is moving in respect of wage and price levels.  It is not an unusual thing for persons who move through this city to see certain traders advertising that the controlled price of a certain commodity is so much but that the price charged by that particular firm is less than the controlled price.  Inasmuch as none of these firms is in business for charity or to sell goods at a lesser sum than will yield them a substantial profit, that indicates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall discuss the wage policy of the Government and of the Taoiseach.  This Bill is the villain of the whole piece so far as wages are concerned.  It is the Bill by which the Government clamp down wages.  My contention is that the <Col N="2487" /> Government have utilised their powers to clamp down wages as low as possible while, on the other hand, they have permitted prices to rocket skywards without displaying the same efficiency that they displayed in relation to wages.  Does the Taoiseach intend to continue that policy?  Is the policy to be a continuance of small wage increases for the workers and substantial profits for the producers and large-scale distributors, or are we to get any approximation to pre-war standards of living with pre-war relationship to price levels?  Are we to be compelled to accept for another generation the lopsided levels we have had during the past five years, with prices rocketing and wages forced down as low as the Government can force them?</P>
      <P>I saw in the Press the other day a reply by the Minister for Education to a Parliamentary question in which he said that the Government had worked out some new scales of salary for the teachers, that these would be applied when the emergency was over and that he hoped to have discussions with representatives of the teachers in the course of the next few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody will welcome an increase in salaries for teachers because of the fact that they have been very badly paid but the Minister's reply appeared to indicate that, as far as he was concerned, he saw the emergency ending in the course of a few months and that the ending of the emergency, as he saw it, would apparently permit the lifting of the wage ceiling and the introduction and application of new scales of salaries for teachers.  Would the Taoiseach mind telling us whether his mind is running in the same direction as that of the Minister for Education? Would he tell us for instance whether he contemplates the termination of the emergency so far as wage standards are concerned in the course of a few months?  Would he say whether the Government contemplates the lifting of the ceiling in relation to other grades of workers such as apparently is contemplated by the Minister for Education in relation to teachers?  One thing I would impress on the Taoiseach <Col N="2488" /> is that the whole wage policy of the Government has resulted in foreing down the standard of living of the masses of workers in this country.  At the same time, the effect of the Government's price policy has been to allow well-to-do people to get wealthier during the emergency.</P>
    <P>Many firms, producers and distributors have made profits at the expense of workers during the emergency which they never dreamt of.  Approximately £4,000,000 was ranked in last year in the form of excess profits, ranked in by robbing the pockets of the workers.  I suggest that that £4,000,000 might have been spent in an effort to reduce prices and to bring these prices within the ability of the masses of the people to pay.  I think the Taoiseach should tell us whether the Government is going to continue the policy which they have pursued for the past five-and-a-half years or whether they will revise their price policy, insist on keeping prices at a reasonable level and on maintaining at least the pre-war relationship of wages and prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think many Deputies have contributed to this debate from the farmer's point of view but one point emerged that struck me very forcibly.  The late Arthur Griffith and the late D. P. Moran agreed about 40 years ago that it took about £200 to rear a young man or a young woman up to the age at which they could emigrate, say 19 or 20.  I wonder what it would take at the moment?  I suppose one could add £50 or £100 to that figure.  One wonders how a poor man can raise a family at all in these circumstances. Those who go away when they reach that age are a great loss to the nation, yet we know that there is £400,000,000 of our money invested in foreign countries.  That has been going on for 100 years and it is still going on while the country remains practically undeveloped.  There are about 55 per cent. or 60 per cent. of our people engaged on the land.  I mentioned here some time ago that in every 30-acre farm it would be possible to add another man to the number employed, while on a farm from 30 to 60 acres we could add two, and in the <Col N="2489" /> case of a farm from 60 to 90 acres three additional employees.  Our young boys and girls are going abroad.  Why? Because the farmer cannot afford to pay them attractive wages at the price which he at present receives for his produce.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to a continuance of the powers of prohibition <Col N="2490" /> on travel which the Government have enjoyed because I greatly fear that these powers will be exercised unduly to keep at home people who are anxious to better themselves abroad. Take, for instance, the case of the nurses.  If nurses go to England they can get double the salaries they are paid here.  There is a big demand for probationers in England and probationers are generally girls of from 19 to 20 years.  The Government may use these powers to say: &ldquo;We shall not let you go.&rdquo;  I am afraid the Government will use the powers unduly and unfairly.  I would ask the Taoiseach to give us a guarantee that if persons of that type, probationers and others, are given opportunities to go away and to earn much better salaries than they are offered here, he will see that they are permitted to go.</P>
      <P>We all know that working conditions for nurses in this country are anything but fair.  I suppose they are the worst paid female workers in the whole country. If this power is given to the Government, a nurse may want to get away to take up a better position and the Government may say: &ldquo;We shall not let you go.&rdquo;  On the other hand a nursing home or an institution may say to such a nurse: &ldquo;If you do not come to work with us, we shall report you and say that you are an essential worker.&rdquo;  That unfortunate nurse is then forced to take up a position here on the miserable wages and conditions that are offered at home.  If travel permits were not unduly withheld in that way, employers, institutions and local authorities, such as county boards of health, would have to increase nurses' salaries, improve their conditions and make these positions pensionable.  There would then be some inducement for nurses to remain at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another case comes to my mind.  A few years ago the travel restrictions were used against a particular individual who was classed as an essential man in the shipbuilding trade.  He has a wonderful pair of hands, but he was paid only £4 a week here in Ireland.  He was offered a job in Canada at £1,000 a year.  I raised the case here in the House at <Col N="2491" /> the time.  His employers used the Emergency Powers Order to restrain him.  They said: &ldquo;He is essential to our industry and we cannot spare him&rdquo;.  That man was refused permission to leave the country.  Then, having promised the man permanent work&mdash;I think he had £6 or £7 a week as he was a pretty good man&mdash;his employers said: &ldquo;Although we put you down as essential, we now find that we can do without you, but we will put you on repair work at £4 a week&rdquo;.  They first put his name on the list as an essential man and said that they wanted him for development work.  In that way, they prevented him from getting a job in Canada. Then they reduced his wages and offered him temporary work at £4 a week.  I raised the case in this House, and because the Minister saw that the terms of contract of this man of £6 or £7 a week were being broken he allowed the man to go away; but, by the time permission was granted, the job was not available.  Thanks, however, to his trade union, he was able to apply for a similar job and he travelled to Canada, where he is now doing well.</P>
    <P>Surely this emergency legislation will not be used to prevent other men getting opportunities to make good in other hands and surely the Taoiseach can give us some guarantee that if such a case arises the authorities will not use their powers to prevent such men going away.  The Government have a majority and can do what they like.  I do not want to use the word &ldquo;dictatorship&rdquo;, but when a Government with an overwhelming majority puts forward a proposal, we all know that it will be carried.  All we can do is to ask the Taoiseach to give us a guarantee that such people as I refer to will not be unfairly treated.</P>
    <P>I have in mind especially the cases of nurses.  County councils, homes and hospitals in England look for Irish nurses, and these girls should get an opportunity of taking up employment there, if they so desire, until such time as the wage standards and conditions of their profession are as good here as across the water. <Col N="2492" /> Most Deputies have spoken of going to England, but in the old days it was America, to which country our fathers and grandfathers went in those days. Is that kind of thing to be prevented under these new powers and are our people to be denied the opportunities available in these distant lands?  Far away fields are green, as the Taoiseach said, but even if that is so, there is such a thing as liberty.  This measure is really a coercion measure and means coercion, if full effect is given to it, and I ask the Taoiseach to give us an assurance that the powers contained in it will not be unfairly used against our citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy talks about new powers.  I anticipated, of course, that there would be a considerable amount of opposition to this Bill. I think it only right that there should be a full discussion of any measure of this sort, but I hoped that that discussion would be based on the Bill and on what the Bill sought to do and would be narrowed down to a relatively small field, but it has roved over the whole wide world.  When I came here asking for certain powers nearly six years ago, we had to face the possibility of one of the greatest dangers this country ever had to face. We did not know what it might hold for us and we therefore got very full powers, but in fact during those five or six years, while there were dangers around us, the only immediate internal problem we had to deal with was mainly of an economic character and not of a military character.  Whatever threats and dangers existed&mdash;and we had to have powers to meet not merely what was happening but what might happen &mdash; during the last five and a half years, the immediate difficulties we encountered in practice were difficulties of an economic character, related mainly to the problem of getting supplies and so on.  That is the position, and I think all Deputies will admit that it is so.</P>

      <P>Certainly.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not in that connection that we brought in these Bills.  We had the Offences Against the State Act which was ordinarily sufficient to enable us to deal with that situation.  The difficulty was accentuated by the fact that there was a war, but mainly our difficulties in this community for the last five and a half years were of an economic character, created mainly by the fact that it was difficult to obtain supplies from outside. That is my view of it.  We had to have powers, it will be admitted, to face many other possibilities.  We had to do all sorts of things in preparation for meeting possible military attack from outside, but the difficulties we really suffered from here were difficulties of an economic character.  We were fortunate of all the nations of the earth that that was so, because these other nations had to deal, directly and immediately, with attacks of a military character.  They were waging war and war was waged upon them.  We were fortunate and therefore most of our difficulties worked out in practice to be difficulties of an economic character, because the threats did not materialise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not so, but I cannot argue that with the Deputy here.  They did not materialise because some particular individuals who had the power to do things did not wish to do them, whatever may have been behind their ultimate decision not to do them.  I do not propose to go into that, but ultimately it hung on that. We, however, were fortunate that we did not have to deal with military attack on this country, and we have been, of all the nations on the earth, most fortunate for that reason, because these military attacks brought with them not merely immediate danger and <Col N="2494" /> death but also the tearing asunder of social life in these countries.  It brought an economic situation on them tenfold more terrible than was brought upon us.</P>
      <P>We have been fortunate, and, if we had not been, we would not be discussing these questions in the spirit in which we have been discussing them here in the last two or three days. We have a feeling of happiness, although matters may have been irritating at times, that this thing is possible because we have been fortunate. What is actually being done by us here?  We said it is our intention, and we have not deviated from it, to get rid of those powers which were given to us in certain circumstances, as quickly as the circumstances would permit.  I said at the start that this war is only two months over, the European side of it; that there is still a major world war on; that it is not simply being waged at the other side of the world&mdash;that our next-door neighbour is engaged in it; that that next-door neighbour of ours is at war; that war restrictions are in force there; that the United States of America is also at war; and that, therefore, the supply position, as far as we are concerned, has not improved to any extent, and may become worse than it has been at any particular period during the war. That is a fact.  Now, that being a fact, what can we do about it?  We said that we were anxious to get rid of those powers as soon as we could. The moment the European war was over, we got rid of a number of them. At least we got rid of the particular Orders that were made under those powers, and we came to the point at which we said: &ldquo;We can practically get rid of everything now except that which has immediate and direct relation to supplies&rdquo;, or to the economic situation, if I keep it a little bit wider, but mainly with regard to supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do not forget that people could have starved in this country, because, although we are producing food in excess of our needs, there is the distribution of that food, and it cannot always be made available for the ordinary citizen.  People could have <Col N="2495" /> been shivering with cold in our houses here.  Some of them are even as it is, but that situation could have been ten times worse.  We could have been short of food.  We could have been short of clothing.  We could have been short of fuel.  All those things were possible, and the Government had to have powers to try to see that in so far as we could make them available from our own resources, those supplies would be made available.  We had to turn to turf.  We had to increase our production of wheat.  We had to do a number of things, and we did not get those things done simply by the goodwill of everybody in the community. Even a large section of the community could not have done it if there was not co-operation, and in every community there will be a number of people who will not co-operate, who will not be good citizens, and of course if a certain section will not be good citizens their neighbours will say: &ldquo;Why should we do those things when others are let off?&rdquo; Therefore, powers of compulsion were absolutely necessary in order to get through that situation as well as we have been able to get through it. Again I say it refers mainly to the questions of supply and production. That situation has not altered to any large extent.  Therefore, we say that we are not yet in a position in which we can dispense with all those powers, but we have come in here to the Dáil and said: &ldquo;Give us time to segregate them.  We have had only two months.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Do not imagine that Departments of Government, which should be staffed only to the extent required to meet ordinary work, can cope with peak work of that particular kind.  If we are going to carry staffs to deal with that, then for ordinary circumstances we would be carrying surplus staffs.  Give us a chance of going through those Orders and segregating them, but we say, without going through them at all, that there are certain things we are prepared to do. There was the question of censorship. That is not immediately related to supplies.  Out it goes.  There was the question of arrest and detention and so on.  That goes.  That Bill <Col N="2496" /> takes it away.  There was the question of minimum fines.  That has gone.  It has, of course.  There was the question of a special court, the military court.  There are two courts. There is the court under the Emergency Powers Acts.  That has gone. The Deputy says no?  Can he not read? The trouble about Deputy Dillon in this particular case is either that he is deliberately not wanting to see or he has not studied the Bill at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not fair.  I have studied the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, if the Deputy has studied the Bill, he knows definitely that the military court has gone; that the minimum fines have gone; that the powers of arrest and detention have gone; that the power of interfering with the movement of citizens, Irish citizens, has gone, except in the one regard, and we have had a long discussion of that, and the need for it has been pointed out on our side&mdash;the question of the restriction on the departure of citizens from this country.  I say you cannot control that unless you have prohibition as well.  I am not going to deal with that particular point because we have dealt with it separately.  This Bill then is the prohibition of ourselves from using this Act as a means of doing things that we are getting rid of.  We are getting rid of a number of the powers which we have and we are retaining others in a general form.  The reason we are retaining the others in a general form is that it has not been possible to go through them and say: &ldquo;We want to do this, that and the other thing&rdquo; precisely and particularly with respect to certain cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot set a date to the ending of this situation with regard to supplies. I have said to the Dáil that when this period comes around again, if I should be alive and here I hope to bring in a Bill which will be replacing this one, and to say: &ldquo;This is the sort of powers we find that we need to continue.  We do not need those other powers&rdquo;, but I do not see what particular advantage there is at the moment in doing it in that precise form.  Are we not getting to our ultimate aim just as <Col N="2497" /> quickly by getting rid of the things that are no longer needed, and that are objectionable?  Nobody here in this House who has spoken against restrictions would speak any more strongly than I would.  I detest them. I should like to see everybody in the community having as much freedom of every type as is consistent with the welfare of the community as a whole. Therefore, I have no desire, and I do not think any member of the Government has a desire, to keep those powers on, but we have the responsibility of safeguarding the interests of the community during the period that is ahead of us, and the period of danger from the supply position still continues.  I think, therefore&mdash; although I am prepared to do the other&mdash;that we are proceeding in that direction just as well by the process of getting rid of things we do not want and trying to retain in the continuing powers only that which we do want. That is what is being done here.  We are continuing the powers, it is true, but we are doing so after getting rid of a number of others.  We are amending the Act by saying that we cannot do to-day what we could do yesterday or the day before.  I am asking the House, therefore, as a necessary measure to pass this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon seemed to suggest but I do not trust the House in an emergency. We are not in this Bill taking powers to deal with an emergency such as the Deputy has in mind.  The powers that are being kept deal with an emergency that is on, the emergency of supplies, and what it would lead to.  I am perfectly certain that we can trust the House, because whatever differences there may be between us, and whatever arguments we may have here from time to time, I think that when a common danger threatens all of us have good sense enough to know that if we do not hang together then we will hang separately.</P>

      <P>I think this is sufficient to force people, no matter how different their views may be on other matters, to come together in a time of crisis.  What I am asking the House now is&mdash;it is not so easy perhaps to see it when there are inducements to <Col N="2498" /> people to forget it&mdash;to give us the powers to preserve this community during the dangerous period that is still ahead from the supply position, in the same way that it gave us powers to preserve it during the period we have passed through.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What have the school teachers to do with this?  I am asking the House to give us the powers which we deem to be necessary. My first request to all the Departments, at the end of the European war, was: &ldquo;Go through all the Orders that have been made, examine the powers which you have been exercising and get rid as quickly as possible of the ones you think you can get rid of.&rdquo;  As regards the other powers which have been so valuable from the community point of view and which you think should be embodied in ordinary legislation&mdash;they might, for example, have discovered that, in the period we have gone through, there were certain things which it would be valuable to the community to have preserved in ordinary legislation&mdash;I asked them, if there were such things, to put them aside, and then try to get for us the precise powers which we want.  As the result of that examination they gave me this Bill as the best thing they could do at the present time.  They are waiting to get rid of this, that and the other, but they do want these powers to deal with the matter of supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the House to be wise now in giving us these powers for this particular continuation of the emergency. I ask the House to be as wise now in giving us these powers as they were wise in giving them to us originally. It may be that there were differences of opinion as to whether, in particular cases, the powers were used wisely or unwisely, harshly or otherwise; but, on the whole, is there any Deputy who is not going to say that the fact that we had these powers has been the instrument, in fact the main instrument, in saving our economic structure here during the emergency? Deputies know perfectly well that we would have gone to pieces if we had <Col N="2499" /> not got them.  Do Deputies want us to go to pieces now?  I am sure they do not.  I believe that the good sense of Deputies will lead them to give us a continuation of these powers, such of them as remain, for the period that we have still to go.  I assure the House&mdash;and this is my last word&mdash;that the moment we can get rid of this whole code completely and absolutely the better I will be pleased.</P>
