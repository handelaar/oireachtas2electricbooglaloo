    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will seek powers, in cases where at least 50 per cent. of the people concerned are agreeable to repairs to roads being carried out, to compel the dissentient persons to engage in such work, particularly in cases where the entrance to roads is affected by such objection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not proposed to seek the powers suggested in the Deputy's question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, I should like to point out that in a good many areas, particularly in the case of <i>culs-de-sac</i>, we find that some of the people affected object to repairs being carried out to the roads.  That is very unfair to the others who wish to have the repairs carried out.  At least where there are 50 per cent. or more of the people concerned willing to carry out the repairs, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to seek the powers necessary in order to facilitate them. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear as to what type of scheme the Deputy has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two case in mind where applications have been made to have work carried out under the rural improvement scheme.  One of these cases is in connection with a <Col N="1338" /> boreen leading into seven farms.  The two farmers at the entrance to the boreen object to the work being carried out inasmuch as the work entails the widening of the entrance and the removal of a small portion of wall.  They are not willing to have that wall removed or to have the boreen widened, and, therefore, the work cannot be considered by the Board of Works.  Unless compulsory powers are taken to have the portion of wall removed, the road repairs cannot be undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case the objector could not be compelled to contribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>How is it that if a road is declared to be a public road under the county council, the county surveyor can come and do as he wishes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy suggest that under the rural improvement scheme not only should power be taken to compel an objector to allow the work to proceed, but that he should be compelled to contribute to the cost of the work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>In the cases I have in mind I believe if the people who object were exempt from contributing the others would be quite satisfied if the objection could be overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of cases in which objections are raised would not represent more than about 3 per cent. of the entire schemes carried out by my office.  This matter has been examined over a period of years and because of the few objections that have been raised it was not considered desirable to seek the powers to which the Deputy refers.  I can see no reason for changing that view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>In one particular case I have in mind, seven farmers are concerned and unless they get the consent of one of the people at the entrance to allow a machine to go through a haggard, they cannot get their threshing done.  I think that is a very bad state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are to confer compulsory powers on the Parliamentary Secretary to take down a neighbour's <Col N="1339" /> wall, are we to stop there or are we to seek compulsory powers to enable the Parliamentary Secretary to take down the gable of my house if my neighbours want a road up to their house?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that my own prejudices were in favour of seeking the powers now recommended by Deputy Heskin, but on examination I found that the objection was raised so seldom that one could hardly justify seeking such drastic powers to deal with so few cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state why shopkeepers and general merchants are not allowed to convey their goods from railway stations in their own vehicles; and why public carriers are not allowed to carry such goods; if he will state further if Córas Iompair Éireann have a monopoly of the haulage business; and if public carriers will be compensated for loss of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I am aware, there is nothing to prevent shopkeepers and general merchants from arranging with suppliers to consign goods to the railway station of destination to be taken delivery of by them or by carriers paid by them.  The third and fourth parts of the question do not therefore arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Minister know that in certain areas of this country shopkeepers and merchants are not allowed to operate a lorry at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a separate question.  The question on the Order Paper asks: &ldquo;if he will state why shopkeepers and general merchants are not allowed to convey their goods from railway stations in their own vehicles&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1340" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The vehicles need not necessarily be lorries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They need not but there are areas in which men own motor lorries and desire to carry goods from the railway station, three or four miles, and they must leave their lorries in their sheds because they are not allowed to use them under the Emergency Powers Order made by the Minister prohibiting the use of lorries by private individuals in certain areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>Not alone does that affect the conveyance of stuff from the station, but there is also this point, in the case of returnable empties, they must be left there until such time as Córas Iompair Éireann will collect them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is certainly true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>Another point arises. Suppose that for any reason a man has to put empties outside his business premises, on the kerb, and that somebody walking on the path is injured thereby, the owner of the premises or the owner of the empties is liable for compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is perfectly true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Conveyance of School-children.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state what arrangements have been made for the conveyance of school-children from Glenpatrick and Curraghkiely districts to Rathcormack National Schools; or if he will reconsider the erection of a school in Glenpatrick or Curraghkiely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is prepared to make a grant towards the cost of the operation of a van service for the conveyance of children between six and 14 years of age from the Glenpatrick and Curraghkiely districts to the Rathcormack National Schools, subject to the average daily number of eligible children conveyed being not less than six per quarter.  The manager has been advised of the conditions under which the grant will be paid and it is a <Col N="1341" /> matter for him to make the necessary arrangements for the operation of the service.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the question I have carefully considered the necessity for a new school in the districts mentioned by the Deputy but I am satisfied that the number of children of school-going age in the area is not at present sufficient to warrant the establishment of a new school.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he is aware that soldiers who applied for their discharge have been refused the 21 days pre-discharge leave and have also been refused the civilian suit to which they are entitled or cash allowance in lieu thereof; and, if so, he will make inquiries into the matter with a view to having the position rectified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any cases in which soldiers have not received pre-discharge leave or civilian clothing to which they are entitled under existing Defence Force Regulations.  In view, however, of the Deputy's query, I am having the matter fully investigated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he is prepared to offer for sale a number of lorries that will not now be required for the Defence Services as many grain merchants are badly in need of them because of the excessive wear during the emergency when replacement of spare parts could not be secured for lorries owned by them; and, if so, if he will arrange that the sales be held at different centres so that travel inconvenience will not be caused to intending purchasers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>In the public interest, it has been decided to give Córas Iompair Éireann the option of purchasing lorries which are at present surplus to Army requirements and which would be suitable for the company's <Col N="1342" /> purpose.  The lorries which may not be found suitable to the requirements of the company will be sold singly by public auction.  In such an event, the Deputy's representations regarding sales at different centres will be borne in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to understand from the Minister's reply that only lorries rejected by Córas Iompair Éireann will be offered to the public by public auction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Only the lorries which Córas Iompair Éireann do not regard as being suitable for their purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, lorries rejected by the company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Lorries not suitable for their requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say on what terms the lorries are to be offered to Córas Iompair Éireann?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>They are to be valued by three expert valuers, who will put a price on them.  If Córas Iompair Éireann decide that they are worth the money asked, they will probably purchase them; if not they will not accept them.  They will purchase only lorries which will be suitable for the purposes of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state what is the objection to having all the lorries sold by public auction and letting Córas Iompair Éireann buy them in competition with other purchasers, in view of the fact that they are State property and that the State is entitled to get the market value of them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a revolutionary departure from all finance practice to dispose of Government property without tenders or public auction?  If that is to be taken as a precedent for other Departments, will the Minister allow the Minister for Finance to examine the question with a view to the possible implications of it?  Has the Committee of Public Accounts any thing to say to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a national transport organisation for which the <Col N="1343" /> Government must see that proper facilities are provided.  Lorries are difficult to secure at the present moment.  The Deputy was talking a few minutes ago about sufficient provision not being made.  This will help to supply whatever deficiency there is at the moment.  As I said a few minutes ago, the price will be fixed by expert valuers; they will put on the lorries the price which they deem the vehicles are worth.  If the company does not purchase them at that price, then they will go to auction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I repeat my question to the Minister?  What is the objection to having all the lorries offered in the first place by public auction, and letting Córas Iompair Éireann, in competition with other citizens, purchase them if they so desire?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing to add to the information already given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be prepared to give the grain merchants the option of buying some of the lorries?  They are the men who really deal with the farmers of the country. Having gone through the emergency and gone to the expense of growing wheat, very often the grain is left in the farmers' haggards.  Where there are grain merchants in the area, would not the Minister consider it only reasonable that they should get the option, as well as Córas Iompair Éireann, of selecting some of the lorries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister for Defence consulted the Minister for Finance in regard to this transaction? Is the Minister for Defence aware that there are Department of Finance regulations in existence definitely prohibiting the course of conduct he describes to the House?  Will the Minister at least consult the Minister for Finance before this departure is embarked upon, because, so far as I am aware, the Committee of Public Accounts will report the matter to the House, and the Comptroller and Auditor-General will strenuously object to the procedure <Col N="1344" /> envisaged?  It is a complete departure from Finance practice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  In the Electoral (Dáil <Col N="1350" /> Éireann and Local Authorities) Act, which was enacted earlier this year, the qualifying date and certain other dates in connection with the preparation of voters' lists were altered.  In consequence, it has become necessary to alter the corresponding dates prescribed in the Juries Act, 1927, as regards the preparation of jurors' lists. This is done by Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The opportunity presented by the preparation of the Bill has been availed of to make a few other minor amendments of the law relating to juries.  These new provisions have been explained in the memorandum which has been circulated to Deputies with the Bill and I propose to read these brief explanations merely in order that they may be on record in the Official Report of the Debates.</P>
      <P>Section 5.&mdash;Under the present law, as contained in sub-section (2) of Section 63 of the 1927 Act, juries in certain classes of cases are not permitted to separate until the trial has concluded.  When the jury happens to consist of persons of different religions and the trial is prolonged over a Sunday or Church holy-day, the jurors must either attend together at the same religious service or not attend any religious service. The refusal of any one juror to attend with the 11 others makes it impossible for them to attend either. The object of the section is to allow each juror to attend whatever religious service he desires to attend, or not to attend any service, without thereby inconveniencing the other jurors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6.&mdash;At present, if a juror falls ill during the course of a trial, he may be discharged and the trial may proceed and a verdict found unless the judge otherwise directs or the number of jurors is reduced below ten (Section 64 of the 1927 Act).  There is, however, no power to discharge a juror whose wife or child or other near relation may have died or become seriously ill.  This might involve serious hardship or distress for the parties concerned.  It is accordingly proposed in Section 6 to give a discretionary power to the <Col N="1351" /> judge to discharge a juror in the circumstances mentioned.  Sub-section (2) makes provision corresponding to that in Section 64 of the 1927 Act for the continuation of the trial despite the discharge of a juror.</P>
    <P>Section 7. &mdash; This section deals with the summoning of jurors and any duties subsequent to the summoning in civil cases in the High Court.</P>
    <P>At present these duties are divided between the Master of the High Court and the under-sheriff for the County of Dublin.  It is considered simpler and better to entrust these duties to the Registrar of the High Court who deals generally with jury trials under the direction of the President of the High Court.</P>
    <P>Section 8.&mdash;This section deals with the rare case of juries required in lunacy matters in the High Court. The section proposes to entrust the summoning, etc., of jurors in such cases to the Registrar of Wards of Court.  The only change which this involves, as compared with the existing position, is to relieve the under-sheriff for County Dublin of the duty of summoning such of those jurors as reside in the county.</P>
    <P>Neither Section 8 nor Section 9 will affect the selection of jurors who are to be summoned: they will continue to be selected from the general body of persons who are enrolled as jurors for the City and County of Dublin in the same manner as at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the provisions of this Bill are desirable.  It is certainly desirable that jurors should be discharged in the event of illness amongst their families, and it is also, of course, desirable that provision be made for the attendance at religious services of people of different religions.  One thing which should be considered is the hardship which jury service, by its very nature, imposes upon citizens of this country, particularly in large counties, where jurors have to travel very considerable distances in order to attend court when summoned and have to remain away from their business for a very considerable time.  Citizens of this State are <Col N="1352" /> only too glad and too willing to contribute towards the administration of justice and it is the wish of every fair-minded person that the jury system should be preserved, but there is growing up amongst farmers and business people a very strong feeling that they are being treated very unfairly.</P>
      <P>At the present time&mdash;perhaps it is due to the advance of more liberal ideas in regard to the treatment of people who are called upon to give service to the State&mdash;we find that nearly everybody who contributes or assists in the administration of justice is compensated.  Witnesses and all officials of the courts are given remuneration, at least of some kind. The juror, however, receives only one form of remuneration, a fee of 5/- in the event of his being called upon to act in a civil case.  In the event of his being summoned to court but not required to act in a case, he receives no compensation whatever.  In the event of his being called upon to act in a criminal case he receives no compensation, except here in the City of Dublin where, on murder trials, provision is made for the accommodation of juries.  In the County Wicklow it takes almost two days to get to the town of Wicklow from West Wicklow for a juror to attend a court and answer his name.  That juror may not be required to give service, but he is taken away from his business for a very considerable time.  In a Bill such as this it should be possible, first of all, to select from the panel of jurors a more limited number than is summoned at present.  At the present time, a very large number is summoned to the county court and from that number a small selection is made and the rest are sent about their business.  It should be possible to select the names of the jurors from the list with, perhaps, a few over, in order to allow for non-attendances or some accidental cause which might debar a juror from serving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision should also be made in this Bill for reasonable compensation or out-of-pocket expenses in respect of loss sustained by jurors in performing this important duty.  It does not make for confidence or satisfaction in the present system of administering justice <Col N="1353" /> when there is no compensation.  Certainly, farmers all over the country are complaining very bitterly about the system.  In many cases, jury service is demanded in the busiest seasons of the year&mdash;very often in the spring and in the harvest season.  During the spring months, farmers are often summoned away for three or four days when they cannot afford to be away from their farms.  The average farmer is in an entirely different position from the big business man or the big employer, as he cannot make provision for his business being carried on in his absence.  Very often, the work on the farm is dependent on the farmer being present with his two or three employees.  The small farmer who has no employees at all and very little financial resources cannot make any provision for his absence and that means the work is not done.  Those who know this country know that our very variable climate allows sometimes only two or three days, during a critical period of the year, for doing the most important items of work on the farm.  I ask the Minister to revise this Bill if possible, so as to make provision for some compensation to jurors and also to provide against having to call too great a number to the county court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Cogan in regard to this Bill. It affects rural communities very vitally, as certain courts very often are held at the busiest part of the spring season and in the summer and autumn seasons, when it is often inconvenient for a farmer to absent himself from the farming operations for two or three days.  I think there is a good case for giving jurors a subsistence allowance and providing for out-of-pocket expenses and, over and above that, something for the loss of time from their own operations.  Members of various agricultural and vocational committees and members of other public bodies throughout the country get subsistence and travelling allowance and there seems no reason for discriminating against jurors.  Nobody wishes to end the service and everybody appreciates the necessity for the maintenance of the system, but in view <Col N="1354" /> of the tendency to compensate all classes of public representatives to-day for their loss of time and for travelling and so on, I think there is a good case for payment of subsistence and travelling allowances to jurors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Some matters arise in connection with this Juries Bill which call for comment.  Under some one of the Emergency Powers Orders or under an amendment of the law, the traditional jury of 12 has given way to a jury of seven.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think the time is approaching when that arrangement ought to be ended? I am always profoundly apprehensive that an arrangement which is arrived at for an emergency will become so familiar to the public mind that it will fail to realise the importance of returning to the old procedure as soon as the circumstances permit.  To the average person, seven good men and true are as good as 12 good men and true but, in fact, long user has demonstrated that 12 men in the jury box have functioned down through the centuries as a pretty effective bar to injustice. It might transpire, over a protracted period, that seven would prove to be sufficient, but we have no reason to believe that they would.  If a man has an important cause joined with another party, it is necessary to send him out of the court, not only with justice but conviced that he has had justice.  I understand that, in criminal cases, defendants can insist on a jury of 12 or, perhaps, it is only in the case of indictable offences that they can insist on a jury of 12.  It is of vital importance, if any person's liberty or reputation is at stake, that we should restore to him the right to stipulate for a jury of 12 men; and I think the time has come when that right ought to be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the payment of jurors, I suppose it is a popular thing to suggest that anybody should be paid for doing anything.  Indeed, I have a certain sympathy with Deputy Cogan and Deputy Coogan when they say <Col N="1355" /> that everybody is getting paid now for everything he or she does, so we might as well pay the jurors.  If you fell and broke your leg in the street now you would nearly have to pay the man who lifts you up and puts you on a doorstep. That is the way the world is wagging and that type of thing is not peculiar to this country.  It is not very laudable, but still, as Deputy Coogan says, if we pay the county councillors and T.D.s and members of agricultural committees and everybody else, I cannot quite see why jurors should be denied payment for the services they render.</P>
    <P>I submit that jurors have a better claim for payment, for this reason. Nobody must become a member of a county council; if he does not want to discharge the duties of a councillor, he need not seek election.  Nobody need become a member of Dáil Eireann and nobody need become a member of a committee of agriculture if he does not want to.  But the juror must attend the court if he is summoned.  Very considerable categories of persons in this community have been excluded from the obligation to do jury service. Clergymen are excluded and so also are doctors, barristers, solicitors, members of Dáil Eireann and members of a very wide number of professions.  They are all exempted from jury service, with the result that the burden of jury service falls more heavily on the remaining categories of persons who are eligible than it would were every citizen obliged to undertake his share of the work.  Therefore, the Minister might favourably consider giving the juror at least travelling expenses and subsistence expenses.</P>
    <P>I do not see how he can resist the logic of the demand on behalf of jurors that they should receive a sum sufficient to pay a substitute to do the work from which they are taken away while serving on a jury.  Conceive what it means to a man who is brought into a complicated criminal or civil case and is required to sit on a jury perhaps from 14 to 18 days.  The material loss that such a man endures must be very heavy indeed.  It is true that jurors who have that experience <Col N="1356" /> are exempted for a protracted period, but still they have a claim on the State and I cannot imagine that any section of the House would be prepared to maintain that they have not.  If the claim is founded on justice, sooner or later it will be granted, and surely it is better to grant it before there is a row about it than to wait for the row and then give under duress what you have withheld until duress is evoked? Personally, I attach more importance to the restoration of juries to 12 than I do to compensation.  I shall be grateful if the Minister will say something on that aspect.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Dillon or Deputy Coogan that it is necessary to pay juries for doing their duty.  The jury system is a sort of insurance for the people of the country and the number of times an individual will be called, in a five-year period, to serve on a jury, is very small.  The Minister has power under the Juries Act to make Orders as to the type of person who should serve on juries.  I suggest he should arrange for a larger panel.  The complaint could be made that the panel is too restricted and that far more persons in any constituency should be qualified to serve on juries.  It is necessary to have a £50 or £60 valuation&mdash;some fairly high valuation&mdash;in order to qualify as a juror and many people are of the opinion that that is all wrong.  There are different valuations in different counties for the purpose of jury service, so far as I am aware.  I think the Minister should widen the panel and so allow more persons to become qualified to act as jurors.  That would solve the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point about payment arose during the emergency, largely because of the difficulty of travelling.  When there were normal transport facilities most towns were within convenient reach of jurors.  It was possible for people liable to act on juries to get home each night.  During the emergency persons acting as jurors were often two or three days away from their homes.  I am talking about country areas now, areas quite distinct from the cities.  People found it impossible <Col N="1357" /> to get motor transport to bring them to the areas where the courts were sitting.  If normal transport was restored, the position would be much easier.  I never heard men who were called upon to sit on juries objecting. They are called upon once in every four or five years.  There are thousands of people, men and women, who would make good jurors in every county and they could be included in wider panels. The Minister has power to do that.</P>
    <P>Men and women living in country districts are at a certain disadvantage compared to people who live in cities. The city dwellers have their homes almost within a stone's throw of the court and they have telephones to their places of business.  Farmers may not like the job, but they do not raise any objection.  I know numbers of them who act as jurors and who travel perhaps 30 or 40 miles and have to stay away from home two or three nights while acting as jurors, but they do not object; they look upon it as an insurance.  If the jury system were abolished I believe you would have an outcry in the country and people would say that it was taking away their liberty.</P>

The Minister for Local Government brought in a Bill changing the qualifying period for the ordinary voters from November to September.

      <P>It reached me only this morning and that leaves no time whatever to get in touch with interested parties on certain technical matters contained in it.  With regard to the jurors' list and the classification of people from whom juries are selected, I should like to support what another Deputy has said about a widening of the panel.  Cases are brought to Dublin from all over the country for trial here and that throws a tremendous strain on the Dublin jury panel.  Anybody who has served on a jury in this city will see time and again the same names going forward and anybody in business in the city will notice the same persons from the same businesses being called for jury service, while there seem to be many other people who have never served on a jury in their lives.  I do not know exactly on what basis the jurors' lists are compiled, but certainly here in the city there is a very good case for a widening of the list and for bringing in people who never have to discharge this very important civic function.  I urge the Minister to look into it, with a view to seeing if, more especially for the City of Dublin, he can widen the list, because there is a great deal of dissatisfaction among the ordinary public, who feel that they are called far too often to serve on juries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot agree with Deputy Allen.  I should like to support Deputy Cogan's demand that jurors should be paid.  The professional classes are out of it&mdash;they are not called on to do the job at all&mdash; and a great number of people in the cities and towns are also out of it <Col N="1359" /> because of the valuation qualification. What happens at present is that the wise man goes deaf, because the man who is deaf cannot serve on a jury. Men are dragged into the cities and towns from their work for a certain number of days.  They are called in on public work but the people who could best afford the time, the professional classes, are exempt.  The solicitor goes in on the same day as the farmer. He sits on one seat and the poor farmer sits in the jury-box.  The solicitor draws his £3 or £4 for the day while the farmer draws nothing. In all fairness, provision should be made for the payment of jurors. Further, the class distinction should go and the valuation distinction should also go.  Let everybody be liable.  Why exempt a certain class or profession and why narrow it down, through exemption of the professions, the valuation clauses and other means, until the point is reached when nobody can be called to serve on a jury but farmers? As we are amending the Bill, two definite changes should be made: a change in regard to the valuation proviso and also in regard to the exemption of the professional classes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Corry and Deputy Cogan with regard to the payment of jurors.  There is great dissatisfaction amongst those called to serve on juries because they are brought long distances.  They are brought distances of 15 to 25 miles and, in many cases, they have to cycle, and in other cases to walk, six or seven miles.  When they get to the town, they find very little hotel accommodation and they have to stay in third-rate houses.  If they are kept for three or four days, it represents a big loss because in most cases they are small farmers who do the work on their farms themselves.  I do not see why they should not be paid.  Everybody else is getting payment of some kind and there is no reason why the farmer should be left out.  There should be no such thing as class distinction.  In the old days, the aristocrats who ruled the country were well able to serve on juries without pay, but the ordinary farmer cannot afford to be away from <Col N="1360" /> his work for five or six days and it is only right that he should be compensated.</P>
      <P>There should also be more concern for the accommodation of jurors brought into small towns.  Twenty or 30 jurors are brought into the town of Trim and half of them cannot get accommodation. They have to go out to the country districts and beg farmers to take them in for the night.  Some scheme should be devised whereby hotel accommodation would be arranged three or four days in advance for such people.  Far more should be done for them because they are performing a very important function and they are a part of the community who should get more consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know why the Minister considered it necessary to insert Section 8.  One would think that the jurors' lists would be left to the Central Office, and that, when the Registrar of Lunacy wanted a jury, he would go to that office and get the officer in charge to summon a jury for him.  It strikes me as a duplication of the functions of the Central Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the last point, I understand that it was considered that the Registrar of Wards of Court was the best person to summon a jury in lunacy matters.  The President of the High Court thought so, too, and on his advice we adopted it.  That was the advice we got from those best qualified in the matter.  As to the payment of jurors, I have never heard any demand for it.  There may be a feeling amongst people that they ought to be paid, but there has undoubtedly been a demand for the payment of expenses and subsistence allowance.  I have taken that matter up with the Minister for Finance and he has agreed to consider favourably claims for the recoupment of expenses where jurors are compelled to stay overnight in a hotel, so that we have made an advance in that respect.  So far as payment for actual service is concerned, I have never thought of amending the law in that regard.</P>

    <Col N="1361" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It may apply only to the emergency period when travel conditions are so difficult that people have to stay overnight, but the Minister is prepared to consider favourably claims in respect of transport and hotel accommodation arising out of jury service.</P>
      <P>With regard to widening the panel, the reason that small farmers and work people were exempted is that it was considered it would be too great a hardship on such people who have to depend for their livelihood on their daily toil to be liable for jury service. They were exempted more from the point of view of removing a hardship than anything else.  Quite a large number of people are set out in the Act here, and I do not know why they are excluded, but I know that some of them, certainly, should be exempt from jury duty, such as medical doctors, who might be engaged on very important cases, veterinary surgeons, who might also be engaged on important cases, and other people, such as school teachers, who could not leave their classes.  Such people should be exempted and, accordingly, it will be seen that there are reasons for these exemptions and that they were well thought-out when the Juries Act was being passed in 1927.  I think that Deputy M.E. Dockrell is wrong in saying that the same people are doing jury duty all the time or that they are serving on juries very often.  I am informed that the actual recurrence of jury service would be once in three years at a maximum, and I would imagine that that is not very onerous.  Then, of course, some court cases&mdash;murder cases, and so on&mdash;may last a very long time, and in such cases the judge generally gives an exemption to the jury for a number of years.  I myself have seen where a judge has, after a prolonged case, exempted the jury from service for as much as ten years.  So that, there is not such a great hardship there, and particularly where, as I am told, the maximum is about once in three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of the <Col N="1362" /> seven jurymen, I think that Deputy Dillon is wrong in saying that in criminal cases a defendant can demand a jury of 12.  I understand that he can only do that in the Central Criminal Court, but in the Circuit Court the jury is only seven, and that was due to transport difficulties arising out of the emergency, and we shall have to keep to that until these transport difficulties cease to exist.  When that occurs, the necessity for having only seven jurors will disappear and we can go back to the other system, but in the interests of the jurors themselves, I think it is better because, very often, jurors may have to spend a night or two in the town where the court is being held.</P>
    <P>I think, Sir, that I have dealt with the various points that were raised. As I have said, the necessity for this Bill arose from the Electoral Bill recently passed.  Then also there was the case of hardship of certain people who were not able to attend their religious duties on a Sunday because members of the jury, of another persuasion, were not willing to go with them, and under the law a jury cannot be separated.  Accordingly, provision is made to enable people to attend their religious duties, and there is also relief in the case of certain people whose relatives might be sick or dying.  With regard to the question of payment, I could not bring it into this Bill, but the matter of expenses is being examined.</P>

If the Committee Stage of the Bill is to be brought in on Tuesday next, that means that such people have only two days to look into it.  I suggest that in connection with a Bill that affects a very wide body of people they should be given some time to consider it.  I should like to suggest that these people should be given an opportunity to consider the matter because it must be remembered that it makes for the ease of mind of people if, afterwards, you can say to them: &ldquo;Well, you were given the opportunity, and you did not make any objection.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking on this Vote last night, Sir, I had not had the advantage of hearing the Minister's opening statement, but his opening statement only makes my argument all the stronger, both as regards the coal question in Cork and the question of the ships from Lisbon into Cork as well.  As I stated last night, when the coal question came on it was said that it was all a question of a time limit for ships, or how much could be done by a ship in a certain period.  The experiment of taking ships into Cork proved definitely that Cork was as handy as Dublin, and that no time would be lost. Still the ships were again taken to Dublin, the excuse given being that the coal on them would have to be made into briquettes, that the plant for making the briquettes was in Dublin and not in Cork, and that, therefore, the ships could not go to Cork.  The briquette plant had been shifted from Cork to Dublin only three weeks before this trouble arose.  If there was objection in Cork to the particular places at which the briquettes were being made, I want to point out that there are two alternative sites available in Cork. There is a site quite near my place which is from ten to 15 acres in extent. It is at the Fort junction, and there is plenty of room there for making all the briquettes that we want.  There is another site at Kilbarry.  If the making of briquettes was undertaken on either of these sites it would not interfere with the residents in the locality. I cannot see any justification for bringing a ship load of coal into Dublin and then using a share of the small amount of coal we have in lugging that coal down to Cork again, particularly when we can make briquettes in Cork if the plant was sent down there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same position arose in regard to <Col N="1366" /> the Lisbon boats.  In view of the scarcity of shipping at present, I can see no justification for bringing a boat from Lisbon up to Dublin to discharge. That boat should be discharged in Cork or at one of the other southern ports.  I understand that a boat which was to have discharged in Cork was brought to Dublin on the excuse that a new propeller had to be fitted.  I cannot see any justification, simply because the owner of that boat is also a shareholder in the Dublin Dockyard Company, why the country should lose three days on the work of that boat by bringing her to Dublin to discharge, especially when the work could be done just as well, and better I think, at Rushbrooke in Cork.</P>
    <P>I come now to another matter, the price of coal.  Industrialists are entitled to come to the Department and plead for an increase in their costings with a view to getting the prices of the commodities which they sell to the public fixed.  When is the Minister going to make that right available for the agricultural community?  Surely, the biggest industrialists in this country&mdash;the farmers&mdash;ought to have the same right as industrialists in any of the new industries.  Take, for instance, the price of beet.  The same price has been fixed for beet for the past three years, despite the fact that legislation has driven up costings and that the Minister's Department has sanctioned an increase in costings in the case of lime.  When we wrote to the Minister's Department last year about the increase in the price of lime we got a reply from the Department saying that the increase was justified.  Yet the price of the article that we produce, when we use lime as a fertiliser for it, has been pegged down for the past three years.  Another Department of the Minister's comes along and increases agricultural wages by 5/- a week.  But yet the article that is produced with that increased cost of labour still remains the same as it was three years ago.  I submit that the members of the agricultural community are entitled to the same treatment as other industrialists: that they are entitled to come to the Department, go before its price-fixing board and put forward their case and have <Col N="1367" /> the price of their commodities fixed. I say that it is the duty of the Minister to set up such a prices commission.  I was placed in a ridiculous position about six weeks ago when I had to come to Dublin and give evidence before one of these boards set up by the Minister's Department which was dealing with a demand by milk retailers for an increased margin.  I gave evidence there.  While that is so, I think it is a rather extraordinary thing that when I rear and feed a cow, when I milk the cow and send her milk to the city, the price that I get for my milk is fixed arbitrarily without any consultation whatever with me as to my costings.  But the man who takes the milk from me and delivers it to householders can come up to Dublin and make his case before a prices board as to his costings, and I cannot. I suggest that such a thing as that is against the Constitution of the State. The Constitution guarantees equal rights to all citizens.  I suggest that the agricultural community have equal rights with the industrial community in that matter, and I further suggest to the Minister that it is a matter that should be rectified.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in connection with the Minister's Department to which I want to refer.  It concerns distributing agents.  I do not know what they are there for since almost everything in this country at present is in short supply.  Still we have scandals like the scandal that was exposed the other day by Deputy Cogan about iron.</P>

      <P>I happened to be in the House at the time and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle raised no objection. I do not wish to go into the matter now.  It was a good job there was some Deputy in the House to expose <Col N="1368" /> it.  I want to come now to this question of distributing agents.  We have too many distributing agents.  We cannot carry any more drones.  Farmers cannot obtain sufficient iron for the shoeing of their horses although the price charged for such material is high. I should like to see some justification for distributors drawing 5 per cent. or 10 per cent. of the cost of iron needed for agricultural purposes.  I do not know of any justification for that state of affairs.  I do not see any justification for a couple of Englishmen or Jewmen calling themselves distributing agents and drawing 5 per cent. or 10 per cent. of the price of every pair of horse shoes.  If drones cannot earn an honest livelihood let them get out.  On behalf of the farming community I object to what is happening.  I am interested in regard to shipping, in regard to distributing agents, and, above all, in regard to the absolute right of the agricultural community to have a prices board set up before which they could appear to argue their case regarding the fixed price of commodities, so that they would not be fixed arbitrarily by some department official.  These are some of the matters I wish the Minister to deal with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>In his introductory speech the Minister indicated that the Department of Supplies was about to be amalgamated with or absorbed by the Department of Industry and Commerce, and that all the work would be brought under the supervision of the same Minister.  That is a desirable change following the emergency period, if the emergency has actually ceased to exist.  I should like the Minister to indicate the effect of the reorganisation he announced and the saving that will be effected thereby.  I do not think any Deputy would dare to suggest that even in present circumstances many important sections of the Department of Supplies can be abolished.  In fact, they cannot be abolished for many years, or until sufficient commodities are available here, or are imported to supply the reasonable needs of the people as a whole.  I do not think the price control section of the Department of Supplies can be abolished at an early date, or that the <Col N="1369" /> section which deals with the allocation of petrol or other things in short supply can be abolished.  While I can give reasons, if allowed to do so, for disagreeing with policy decisions of the Department of Supplies during the emergency period, I certainly admit gladly that the administration of the Department was highly efficient.  I am glad to be able to say that.  My limited knowledge of that Department was mostly gained by written communications, as I did not occupy the time of the officials with interviews.  I must say that the Department, especially at a very critical period of the emergency, functioned in a much more efficient manner than some of the old Departments that were handed over to us and that were supposed to be highly organised. I hope I am correct in suggesting that that efficiency will be seen in the new scheme of reorganisation which is to come into operation at an early date.  The Minister gave interesting figures concerning the administration of the prices control section of the Department, and the number of prosecutions and convictions, but he omitted to give any figures&mdash;which I should be glad to have &mdash; concerning the amount of fines collected as a result of these prosecutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am interested to hear the amount of fines imposed in cases tried under what is known as the Special Criminal Court.  Personally I strongly object now, as I did previously in this House, to the kind of activity carried on before the Special Criminal Court.  I noticed that in many cases huge sums by way of fines were imposed, whereas for similar offences other types of people were sent to prison.  I take it that I am entitled to deal with that question now.  I cannot understand why huge fines were imposed on people who were found to be racketeering, while other people were sent to prison for similar offences.  I hope we have heard the last of all that type of case at the Special Criminal Court.  I do not want to criticise the members of the Special Criminal Court, because I think they are quite capable of giving in cases that come before them as sound commonsense decisions as those given in Civil Courts by experienced lawyers. <Col N="1370" /> However, I think it was wrong, and very unfair to bring certain types of cases before the Special Criminal Court which would require to be dealt with by men of long legal experience to enable them to give fair decisions.</P>
    <P>I also wish to get from the Minister some figures concerning the allocation of petrol.  During the emergency period a high percentage of the petrol imported was set aside for Army purposes. In the early days of the emergency a specially reserved supply was made available for that purpose and was stored in specially made sealed tanks.  Has there been any change since the European war ended in the percentage of petrol made available for civilian use and for Army purposes?  I think there is no justification now for the allocation of the same percentage of petrol for Army use as was originally allocated.  In regard to the allocation of petrol for civilian use, I should like to have figures showing the quantity of petrol allocated for use by Córas Iompair Éireann as against other public transport services, including hackney and taxi cars.  I understand the Minister is responsible for policy decisions affecting the allocation of petrol and other commodities, and I wish to know whether in allocating petrol for use by Córas Iompair Éireann, it was made available for certain specific purposes, and for carrying out certain work that was hitherto carried out by that particular company, or any of the constituent organisations that now make up Córas Iompair Éireann.  The Minister knows that in pre-war days, and prior to the establishment of Córas Iompair Éireann, the carting of road-making material, sand and gravel, and work of that kind carried out for local authorities was done by local hauliers or small farmers and others with horses and carts, and that in some cases work of that kind was the means of livelihood of such hauliers and cartage contractors.</P>
    <P>Recently, complaints have been coming to me that Córas Iompair Éireann have been allocated petrol for this purpose. By giving them an allocation, the means of livelihood of a large <Col N="1371" /> number of carters and others is being cut out.  Local hauliers have been deprived of the right to get petrol for this purpose.  Did the Minister knowingly and consciously give petrol to Córas Iompair Éireann in order to cut across and cut out the work previously done by the persons I have mentioned? Cases have been brought to my notice in this connection from my own constituency. I made submissions on these matters to the Department of Supplies.  I find that the county surveyor in Leix in one case undertook to provide employment for two hauliers in Stradbally provided the Minister for Supplies would give the necessary allocation of petrol to enable them to do the work for which they were provisionally employed by the county council.  Prior to the emergency, such persons were always employed in this way and the Great Southern Railways never carried out work of that type.  I know of two cases of that kind from one town.  The replies refusing an allocation of petrol in these cases are very interesting. One of the persons concerned made representations to my colleague, Deputy Flanagan, and on the 13th April he received this reply which conflicts with the other reply:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In addition to the services provided by Córas Iompair Éireann, there are at present four licensed hauliers in Stradbally and further 21 within a radius of 20 miles of that town.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A similar application was submitted by myself on behalf of the second person and the reply was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It will be appreciated that the conditions under which the Minister is free to grant new licences to non-statutory carriers limit the grant of such licences to cases of extreme transport need which cannot otherwise be met.  Apart from the services provided by Córas Iompair Éireann, there are 15 licensed hauliers within a radius of ten miles of Stradbally&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That reply is dated 2nd May.  I am fairly well acquainted with the conditions in the town concerned and I have good reason to believe, as a result of <Col N="1372" /> inquiries, that there was no change in regard to the number of hauliers in that area as between the 13th April and 2nd May.  I want to protest against the action of the Minister in making an allocation of petrol available to a company which never previously carried out this type of work and in refusing it to two hauliers who, in pre-emergency days, would be the persons selected to do that work. Apart from those two cases, I have a case in Edenderry area.  I suggest that it was never intended, when the Transport Bill was being considered, that work of this kind would be taken from other citizens and handed over to this new company.  If the Minister intended that, he did not make it clear to the House at the time.  I understood that the petrol to be supplied to Córas Iompair would be made available only for the usual commercial carrying purposes.  While sand and gravel and material of that kind may be legally defined as &ldquo;merchandise,&rdquo; they cannot be so regarded in the accepted, commonsense interpretation of that word.  If the Minister looks into the matter, I am sure he will not go so far as to say that the petrol allocation in cases of this kind was given for the purpose of allowing a big public carrying concern to take over work which had hitherto been carried on by local hauliers and owners of horses and carts.</P>
    <P>In another case of the same kind, not yet finally decided, I understand that there is considerable reluctance on the part of the Department to grant a petrol allowance to a haulier in Edenderry area.  In this area, a petrol allowance has been refused to a local haulier who previously did that kind of work for the county council and who was conditionally employed by the county surveyor to do the work now, provided he got a petrol allocation, while a petrol allowance has been made to other hauliers in Edenderry area for carrying similar materials from quarries there on behalf of the Turf Development Board.  The same policy should be applied in cases of this kind.  A petrol allocation should not be refused to local hauliers to <Col N="1373" /> carry road-making material for the county council and given to other hauliers for carting the same kind of material for the Turf Development Board.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made by a number of speakers to the refusal of the Minister to sanction applications for permits for additional hackney licences.  I recall reading an advertisement in the newspapers some months ago in which the Minister announced that no further applications would be entertained for the issue of permits for additional hackney licences.  A number of persons are anxious to secure hackney licences. Some of them never held them before. I sent in the applications to the Department in the ordinary way and the reply, whether verbally or in writing, indicated that there was no hope, in view of the Minister's advertisement, of these applications being sanctioned.  I understand&mdash;the Minister can deny this if I am not correctly informed &mdash; that the Minister himself keeps his finger on this particular kind of activity and is personally responsible for refusing to sanction the issue of such permits or, in some cases, as alleged, for sanctioning the issue of permits, especially in the City of Dublin.  I should like if the Minister would tell us the number of additional licences, if any, issued since the date of that public advertisement and the number of additional hackney and taxi licences granted in the City of Dublin.</P>

      <P>I must admit that I do not understand the difference between a taxi licence and a hackney licence, but I do not propose to prolong the debate for the purpose of getting an understandable definition of that difference.  How many additional taxi or hackney licences have been issued since the date of that advertisement and how many of these were issued to people residing in the City of Dublin, and outside the city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a previous occasion, by means of a Parliamentary question, I <Col N="1374" /> endeavoured to gain the sympathy of the Minister and to induce him to do something in connection with the allocation and sale of cycle tyres.  That is a matter of serious complaint in almost every part of the country.  It is, perhaps, more serious in constituencies like mine, which are in the centre of turf-cutting areas, than in other districts. As a result of the failure of 90 per cent. or 95 per cent. of turf workers who live long distances from their place of work to get an allocation of tyres and of their inability to purchase tyres, proposals were submitted by certain county managers to the Minister for Local Government last year.  As a result, it was made possible, in certain circumstances, for turf workers living a distance from the bogs on which they were working to get free transport from the local authority. That arrangement was, I think, sanctioned by the Minister for Supplies.  I heard the Minister replying to Deputy Mulcahy regarding complaints from Clonmel.  There is no justification whatever, from a public service point of view, provided the petrol is available, for refusing the concession of free transport to large groups of workers who live in towns and have to travel to their work on the bogs, a distance of four or five miles.</P>
    <P>I was on a bog on a recent occasion engaged in turf-cutting operations with some of my friends.  I spent a very pleasant day there on a bog situated in Deputy Morrissey's constituency. During the time I was there &mdash; it was a lovely sunny day &mdash; I was approached by a number of workers who were working for the North Tipperary County Council on that bog.  They pointed out that approximately 200 men and women have to walk from the town of Roscrea to a place called Birches Bog, about five miles from where they reside, morning and evening. The Minister will appreciate that the fact that such workers have to travel long distances to and from their work must have a very serious effect on turf production.  I think there is a case, provided transport is available &mdash; and I was assured that it was available in that area &mdash; for providing free transport in instances of that kind.  It <Col N="1375" /> is outside my constituency though part of the bog is inside it, but I know other cases of a similar kind which are inside my constituency.  Provided petrol is available, or provided it can be made available from the quantity allocated to the military during the emergency, I think it could not be put to better use than carrying large groups of such workers to and from their work.  I would urge the Minister to consider that particular case and other cases which I can quote if he wishes me to do so.  I think that that kind of case should be most sympathetically approached and that, if necessary, petrol should be taken from others who do not want it so badly and allocated for the transport of these people to enable them to produce turf where it is badly needed.  I quoted that case because it came under my personal observation.</P>
    <P>I fully subscribe to the Ministerial policy of continuing turf production even after the emergency period, but if we are to get the best results for the money spent on that kind of national development work, there will have to be a further review of the conditions under which various sections of turf workers are employed for the purpose of producing turf for sale.  We have three different classes of people engaged in the work of turf production in my constituency.  There are firstly the workers employed under the supervision of the Department of Industry and Commerce, who reside in turf camps.  Then there are the workers employed by the county council for five or six months in the year, men who are compelled to accept work on turf production when they register at the labour exchange.  There is also a large number of persons employed by private turf producers in the same area.  The Minister must be aware of the varying conditions applicable to these different classes of turf workers. Is it correct to state that the cost of keeping men who live and who are fed in the turf camps plus their average weekly earnings would amount to about £5 10s. 0d. or £6 each per week? It is correct to state that men employed in the same area &mdash; in some cases <Col N="1376" /> on the same bog, or on the same estate at any rate &mdash; as county council workers are getting only 8/- and 9/- as sleán men and barrow men, while in the same area men employed by private producers are getting 12/- and 13/- per day as sleán men and barrow men. That state of affairs is causing considerable confusion and irritation in my constituency.</P>
    <P>As a result of the difference in conditions of employment, a large number of people who normally would register as unemployed at the local labour exchange are not now registering at these exchanges because if they did so register, they would be sent to work on schemes where they would get a small rate of pay and would be deprived, because they registered at the labour exchange, of employment which they could get from private producers at from 40 to 50 per cent. better rates than they get from the county council. Is there not a case for making some attempt to standardise the conditions of employment of such workers, especially those who are employed by the county council and the Department of Industry and Commerce?  The sleán men and the barrow men who are employed by the county council at a rate of 8/- and 9/- per day are men who have local knowledge and they are as good men, in my opinion better men, than those who have been imported from the Gaeltacht area and who cost the State, through wages and their maintenance in the camps, anything from £5 10s. 0d. to £6 per week.  I am quoting particulars that have been given to me on the subject.  I suppose the Minister cannot very well regulate the wages or conditions of employment of men employed by private turf producers but at any rate there is a clear case for some Minister of the Government attempting to level up the pay and conditions of employment imposed on county council workers, who are compelled to work for the community during the turf-cutting season, with the pay and conditions enjoyed by other workers on bogs in the same area.  If the Minister will look into that and try to bring about standard working conditions and wages for all sections of workers on these bogs, I think it would produce a better spirit <Col N="1377" /> and feeling amongst all types of turf workers who are employed by the different classes of turf producers in these counties.</P>
    <P>The figures given by the Minister yesterday evening in justification of the huge sum now asked for for the purpose of subsidising turf production are amazing to anybody who knows anything about the actual cost of turf production, in the midland counties at any rate.  I know nothing whatever about the conditions operating in western counties or in the Gaeltacht areas but I am assured by Deputy Blowick and some other Deputies sitting here on the Front Bench that the cost of production there is much lower than in the midland counties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I could find out in any part of the country, private turf producers who pay the wage I have just mentioned, a fairly decent wage, can produce turf at a rate of 22/- per ton.  That is certainly much higher than the cost of production in the western or seaboard counties.  If it can be produced at 22/- per ton in these counties, there are no conditions that I know of that would justify the fixing of a price, an economic price as we are told, of £5 3s. 9d. or £5 per ton for such turf. It would be interesting to get an explanation from the Minister of the factors responsible for the fixing of such a price.  I think we are entitled to ask him for them having regard to the policy of the Government for the post-war period.  I should like him to give us the figures which I think he gave on a previous occasion representing the average cost of production for turf produced by those who work for the Department of Industry and Commerce and live in the turf camps, the cost of turf produced by Fuel Importers, Limited, and the price paid by Fuel Importers, Limited, to the local authorities and the price paid by Fuel Importers from time to time to private turf producers from whom they have purchased turf in areas in which turf has been produced by the county councils.  I am aware that Fuel Importers have paid roughly £2 to £2 6s. per ton for turf which they purchased <Col N="1378" /> from the county councils in my constituency, while at the same time I have seen letters in which they offered to pay no higher than 28/- per ton to private producers.  Why are they prepared, and why has the Minister authorised Fuel Importers, Limited, to pay up to £2 6s. for turf produced and purchased from the county councils, while he fixes his own arbitrary figure of 28/- per ton for the same kind of turf produced by private producers in the same area?  There is something wrong there.  At any rate, there is something requiring explanation.</P>
      <P>It is assumed, however, that a very high percentage of the economic price &mdash;if I am right in using the word&mdash;paid for turf by the consumers goes in transport charges.  Will the Minister, therefore, give the House the average cost of transporting turf by rail?  When I ask for the cost of transporting turf by rail I want included in that cost the terminal charges, which are very important. The terminal charges in some cases, so far as getting turf from my constituency is concerned, are higher than the actual rail charge, station to station.  I have seen the rail charge in one case quoted as 7/11 from a very important turf loading station in my constituency and the terminal charge at both ends amounted to 10/-.  That is 10/- for a terminal charge as against 7/11 for the rail charge.  I want the inclusive charge covering collection and delivery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Cartage from the bog to the loading railway dump and cartage from the railway terminus at this end to the house of the consumer.  The terminal charge in one particular case is 10/- as against 7/11 for service by rail.  I should also like as against that &mdash;because these figures are very interesting in connection with this matter as well as in connection with other matters&mdash;to get the average cost of carrying turf by road from the bog to the house of the consumer or to the dump in the Phoenix Park, the North Wall, or wherever the dump may be. <Col N="1379" /> These are figures which the Minister has at hand and, if he has not got them immediately to hand, I am sure he has people at his right hand who will give them to him in a very short time.  Will the Minister also give us, if he has these figures, the average tonnage per rail wagon as against the average tonnage carried by road service vehicles?  I should like to get the percentages of the total cost price attributable to transport and wages, including wages paid at the bog, if they can be given separately.  They can be given in the case of the county council and turf camp workers.</P>
      <P>These are figures which I am sure every Deputy would be glad to get and, if he had them, might be in a position to make some constructive suggestions as to how the excessive price of turf might be reduced in the years of come. There is no doubt about it that if imported coal is made available for domestic purposes in this country, many housewives who have been in the habit of using bad turf will never look at turf again.  The tens of thousands of tons of bad turf which were imported into the city have made the work of carrying on the home very difficult for most housewives.  One thing that affects everyone who uses this bad turf is the very high cost. I suppose, in respect of the very best turf, one could regard two tons of turf as being equal to one ton of pre-war domestic coal.  I do not know when domestic coal will be made available in the same quantities as were available pre-war, but there is no doubt that unless the production of good-class turf is increased and unless the price of that turf is reduced far below the present figure, there is very little hope for turf producers in the post-war period, when coal is made available for domestic purposes either from home or foreign sources.  That matter must be seriously considered in the next year or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice from personal observation that large quantities of turf that came into the city by rail were condemned and refused delivery from time to time by the coal merchants in the city.  Can the Minister give us any approximate <Col N="1380" /> figure as to the tonnage of turf that was refused delivery by the coal merchants during the past year or two? It must amount to a fairly high figure. I have seen full railway wagons turned away from temporary turf sidings at the North Wall.  What has become of that turf and what is the loss to the taxpayer by the refusal of the merchants to accept what, in their opinion, was bad turf that they could not dispose of in a satisfactory way?</P>
    <P>Is there any figure available to the Minister as to the percentage of deterioration caused by every handling necessary?  There is an advantage in carrying turf from the bog to the consumer or even to the dump by road as against rail.  Rail transport involves two extra handlings in the average case.  There must be considerable additional deterioration involved in carriage by rail as against carriage by road and I should like the Minister, if he has the figures available, to give us the percentage of deterioration in respect of turf carried by rail as against turf carried by road, for instance, or by any other means.  In some cases turf has to be brought out from the face of the bog to a road into which a lorry can be brought. That involves two handlings.  It is then taken by lorry and has to be taken out of the lorry at the consumer's premises.  Turf must be carried by rail if it is to be carried in the quantities required, but there is depreciation and that is why some of the city coal merchants have refused large quantities of turf from time to time.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised at the high figure quoted by the Minister yesterday in respect of the proportion of the cost allocated to turf merchants for delivery in the city.  Am I correct in repeating that the figure is 17/9 per ton?  If it is 17/9 per ton or anything like it, it is a ridiculously high figure and I should like the Minister, in his reply, to try to give us the particulars as to how that figure is made up.  If the average cost of producing good class turf in midland counties is only 22/- per ton, nobody can justify the cost of delivering that turf in the City of Dublin at such a high figure as 17/9 per <Col N="1381" /> ton.  I am very suspicious as to how the whole thing has worked in the case of the coal merchants.  It is a great pity that the delivery of this turf has been handed to the coal merchants. On a previous occasion the Minister gave the House his reasons for doing that &mdash; that they had the equipment, personnel and everything else.  I am very suspicious that the coal merchants have not used this opportunity&mdash;and they have been well paid for their services at 17/9 per ton&mdash;to deal with the turf position in such a way that nobody will ever buy turf from them or through them again, whenever coal is available for domestic purposes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey mentioned another matter, which is a very important one. It applies to a large number of the bogs in my area.  There is &mdash; or at least there was up to two weeks ago at any rate&mdash; a considerable quantity of turf which was cut last year still lying on the bogs, and covering up the spreading ground on those bogs, which prevents turf cutting operations being carried out in a thorough manner this year.  A large quantity of that turf has been cut by the local authorities. Could the Minister give us any particulars as to the total tonnage of turf produced by the county councils still lying on the bogs?  There was a question on the Order Paper yesterday from Deputy Spring of Kerry.  That question and even the Minister's reply indicated that the reason why the turf produced by the Kerry County Council could not be taken from the bogs in that county was that sufficient transport was not made available for the purpose in that area.  That may be true, but I do not think it is altogether true of the position in my particular part of the country.  The point I want to make is this&mdash;and perhaps the Minister understands it more fully than I do&mdash;that while that turf is left on those bogs in large quantities it will limit the production of turf during the present year, and will add to the losses which the taxpayer in the long run will have to pay in connection with turf that is either left lying on the bogs or is eventually brought off those bogs in a bad or unsaleable condition. Since the policy of peat development <Col N="1382" /> was first submitted to this House I have given my full and unqualified support to that policy, and I feel bound to continue to do so in the future.  I would ask the minister to take my questions and my&mdash;I hope&mdash; constructive criticism as suggestions put forward for the purpose of improving a position that does not look too healthy at the present time, and which if allowed to continue will seriously affect the production of turf and those who have to rely on the production of turf for a livelihood in the next two or three critical years.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I desire to refer, and that is the statement made by the Minister in the opening portion of his speech in connection with the principal reason why supplies of essential commodities have not been brought into this country. He indicated that the principal reason why sufficient supplies of articles which we had to import in pre-war days have not been brought into the country is the shortage of shipping tonnage.  I hope I am correct in assuming that the Minister and his Department will take steps to see that whenever the opportunity arises sufficient shipping tonnage of modern type will be purchased and made available for the future.  I have had the privilege of reading a number of reports of a semi-confidential nature concerning the business of an international conference recently held in London in connection with the future of the merchant service of many countries.  I have also read the reports and minutes of conferences that were held by a certain union representing the majority of the merchant service men employed in British-owned ships, in which it is clearly admitted that the conditions, and the living conditions in particular, on British-owned ships are very bad, and that it is the intention of many Governments, and particularly of the British Government, to see that the ships that will be built in future will be built to meet modern needs so far as the carrying of cargoes is concerned, and that the living conditions in those ships will be the very best that can be made available.</P>
    <P>I have seen it quoted that a particular <Col N="1383" /> country stands as No. 1 in the list of countries which have the best ships on the sea at the present time.  I know and understand quite well that it was extremely difficult if not almost impossible, at the period which the Minister came in to buy ships, to get ships that could be called modern sea going ships, or ships exceptionally suitable for the work which the Government wanted them to do.  I am not sure if the Minister has had any reports from those conferences which were attended by representatives of the organised workers in the merchant services of many of the principal countries, and particularly the merchant service of Great Britain, but I daresay it is not necessary for me to over-emphasise the necessity for buying the best ships when they become available, and seeing that the living conditions in those ships are as good as those that are provided at the present time or those that will be provided in the future for the merchant service men in other countries in the world.</P>

      <P>Now that the Department of Supplies is about to come to an end, I think the best thing to do is to treat it with charity, because one should start very early in the morning and continue for quite a considerable part of the day to deal with its many failures, in particular the failure of the Minister to see that the control of certain essential article was properly carried out and rigorously adhered to. I refer to clothes, boots, shoes, and other articles, the prices of which even to-day are exorbitant.  No matter how other Deputies who may be in that particular business may argue that there is not such a profit on clothes, I hold a different view.  Certain business people with whom I have spoken frankly admitted that instead of trying to force the controlled price on the customers they are in a position where they can very well afford to sell many articles 10/-, 15/-, and in some cases a couple of pounds cheaper than the controlled price.  That being so, I think it would be very unjust to the people of this country to start singing the praises of that Department which is about to disappear.  I do not blame <Col N="1384" /> the officials, of course.  They fulfilled their duties to the best of their ability under strained circumstances.  Admittedly, the shortage of certain commodities brought about many of those difficulties, but a large number of those shortages were due to the lack of foresight of this and previous Governments; they were due to their failure to provide a sufficient merchant fleet to bring in essential commodities. I have heard it advocated that the present or some future Government should buy sufficient ships for that purpose.  I say that they should be constructed in this country when things become normal and the necessary material is available.  However, I am not going to deal with that because I do not think it comes under this Estimate.</P>
      <P>I will revert to the turf situation, which concerns my county and the workers in my county to a great extent.  When the Minister is replying, I should like him to explain how it is that a ton of turf in the City of Dublin is costing £5 3s. 9d.  I have here before me a letter from the Mayo County Surveyor, Mr. Flanagan, B.E., in which he says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;So many inaccurate and misleading statements in connection with turf production have recently been made throughout the country that I have been asked by Mr. Kilroy, chairman of the county council, to set out the true position with regard to turf production and costs.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Nobody will doubt or question Mr. Flanagan's ability, and he sets out here facts which I am sure even the Minister will be rather surprised to hear.  He goes on to tell the people of my county:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In 1941 we sold to Fuel Importers 88,927 tons of turf which was purchased from private producers or produced by direct labour and the actual ultimate cost per ton of this turf delivered on the roadside worked out at 18/1 per ton, which figures have been audited.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Later on in his letter&mdash;I will not read the whole of it as it would be too long <Col N="1385" />&mdash;he gives this very startling information:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In comparing the price paid to private producers it would be well to compare an area near our own. Messrs.  Wallace Bros. of Ballinlough buy on behalf of Fuel Importers all the private turf produced in that area of County Roscommon adjoining Kilmovee, Crossard, Ballyhaunis, Cloonfad and on to Dunmore.  They buy from the private producers on the condition that the private producers deliver their turf into the wagons at the nearest station and the producers have to wait for their money until their turf is weighed in Dublin, when they are paid £1 per ton for the weight ascertained in Dublin, and £1 a ton covers the loss on the road to Dublin together with the filling of the turf into the carts or lorries and unloading into the wagons, so that the price which they receive of £1 a ton is equivalent to no more than 17/-....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want the minister to explain to the House how it is that turf produced there and transported to Dublin at a cost of 17/- is sold to poor and rich alike here in Dublin at £5 3s. 9d. per ton.  That is an explanation which I think it will take a very clever mathematician to give.  I do not think we will get it from the Minister, if we get the true facts; at least I would be surprised if the House can get the proper explanation.  How is it that this turf, produced by sweated labour, by workers who have to go out in the boiling sun to cut it, throw it out on a high bank and spread it, and then put it into carts and bring it to the station at a price which is only equivalent to 17/- per ton, is sold here in Dublin to working men, some of them perhaps on the dole or only earning a small wage, at £5 3s. 9d. per ton?  The people who have been singing the praises of the Department of Supplies must not be aware of these facts.  If they were aware of them, then they were not doing a service to the people whom they claim to represent.  I consider it an injustice not only to the people of Dublin but to the people of my own county who are being not only asked <Col N="1386" /> but practically forced to cut this turf. They have no other alternative, because the Minister took good care that they could not emigrate to England, where they could get a decent wage.  They have to work at producing this turf, which ultimately is sold here at £5 3s. 9d. a ton to other workers in the slums of Dublin.  I think there is an explanation needed for that.  These workers, according to Mr. Flanagan, only received in 1941-42 a wage of 30/-. In 1943 it was increased to 36/- and in 1944 it was further increased to 39/-. That is a very small wage when you take into account that they would have to work for three weeks before they could afford to buy a pair of working boots, if they could get them.  If they got them, they would not last them a week working in the bog; they would fall off their feet.</P>
    <P>The position is that we are entitled to assume that Fuel Importers, Ltd., made vast sums of money at the expense of the producers and consumers of this turf.  If we got the figures in connection with this company I am sure they would be quite surprising and show what they had extracted from the sweated labour of young and old men and women in the bogs of Mayo, Roscommon and elsewhere.  I read a certain statement made at the Mayo County Council during the last few months.  I was very doubtful as to the authenticity or truth of this statement; but there can be no doubt whatever about it, as Mr. Flanagan now admits it, in black and white.</P>
    <P>As regards turf in the city of Dublin, I had the pleasure of being in the Pænix Park on a few occasions last November and I saw there how the turf is being stacked and filled. The conclusion I came to was that the stackers and fillers knew nothing about turf.  There were long ricks of turf there extending for about one-eighth of a mile.  They were so many yards wide at the bottom and then went up to a certain height.  They were built in such a way that the water, instead of running off the turf, went into the rick of turf.  It could not run off, because there was not sufficient of a slope.  Furthermore, the rick was too wide at the bottom.  When <Col N="1387" /> they went to fill their carts and lorries, instead of starting at the end at which the least rain had got in, they started where the rain was constantly pouring into the centre of the rick.  They started in the middle, so that the whole of it came down.  Then they backed their lorries into it, until half of it was turned into mud.  In my opinion the men supervising that work had not the foggiest idea of how to deal with turf.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Blowick, who suggested that at the beginning of the emergency sheds should have been erected to cover the turf in Dublin and that covers should have been provided for the turf conveyed to Dublin, whether by wagon or by lorry.  If, as we are told and as I hope will be the case, turf production is going to be one of our main industries and that even when normal conditions return we will not allow in the same quantity of coal here, that turf will be used where it can be used, then we must improve on our present methods. First, we must make provision for keeping the turf dry.  Secondly, we must see that the turf will be produced at a price within the reach of the ordinary man so that he can purchase it as near to the price of coal as possible and, at the same time, we must treat the producer fairly as well as the consumer.  That can be done by eliminating a certain number of the overseers and gangers and semi-engineers who, in my opinion, are eating up a vast amount of this money voted for turf out of the Central Fund. Extravagant is the word for it.  Furthermore, if the onus or responsibility for conveying of turf to Dublin and to the railway station were placed upon the shoulders of the lorry drivers, those drivers could act as gangers and see that the turf was up to a certain quality and type.  Any man in Mayo or Roscommon, or in any county in Connaught, knows the difference between good turf and bad turf, even if he never stood in a bog, from the experience of using turf on the hearth or in a grate or stove; and if the responsibility were on those drivers' shoulders, the stuff which is sometimes put over on the <Col N="1388" /> people of Dublin would never be transported by lorry or train to the city, but would be left on the bog.  If it were made clear to the drivers that the rate depended on the quality of the turf they allowed to be conveyed to its destination, whether it be the city or the railway station, there would be an improvement in the position.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to reply to some questions regarding the County Kildare camps.  What are the conditions obtaining in those camps?  What are the wages?  What type of hygiene is there?  What kind of bedding are the men asked to sleep in?  How often are the sheets and pillow cases changed? How often are they examined for cleanliness?  What type of food is there and how is it served?  I would like to know from the Minister, here and now, if it is true that the food given to the men working in those camps is not of the standard that it should be, that the bedding is not what it should be, that the bedclothes are not changed as regularly each week as they should be?  On every occasion when a new person takes over a bed, are the sheets changed and the bedclothes examined?  Is there proper medical supervision?  Is there proper hygiene?  Is the food properly cooked and supervised and properly served to these workers?</P>
    <P>From information&mdash;how true it is I do not know, but I cannot imagine any young man coming to me and telling falsehoods for no reason whatsoever&mdash; available to me from many Mayo workers who had to leave those camps sick, tired, weary and unfed, and in a certain state which I do not desire to mention in this House, it seems that the position must be very bad and, if that is so, the sooner the camps are abolished the better.  Is it that these camps are run by the State and workers can come along and tell us that they were not fit for human habitation, that a loaf of bread was presented to them in the morning with tea that was comparable only to bog water?  Their belief was that the tea which should have been used for them was sold and not given to the workers. How true that is I do not know, but I am asking the Minister for information. These camps are not kept up <Col N="1389" /> to the standard to which they should be kept, if the workers are presented with chunks of bread with some butter between them.  They are expected to work for the day and then they are given half-boiled potatoes and half-boiled cabbage, with very little bacon. How do you expect workers to live on that?  Has the Minister ever cut turf himself or does he know the energy that has to be applied to the work? Does he know that it is a strenuous job, a man's job?  We had to endure an Order prohibiting these young men from emigrating.  They were sent up to Kildare, but they came back again and some said they would prefer to sing on the roadside and beg, rather than stay under the conditions existing in the camps.  I would like that to be contradicted now, or else it should be admitted that these are the facts and that, in the very near future, a remedy will be applied&mdash;a remedy for which there should be no necessity, as the conditions should never have existed.</P>
    <P>I am told that the type of leather which manufacturers are putting into the making of boots and shoes is inferior and that the good quality stuff is sold for repairs, as more profit can be made when it is sold in that way in small quantities than when it is sold in large quantities for manufacturing purposes. The ordinary retailer sells it for half soles and in two lb. and one lb. lots and there is more profit in that way.  I have had the experience that the leather going into the soleing and repairing of boots is far better than that which goes into the construction and bending of them, so presumably there must be something in the statement. If that is true, the manufacturers must be adopting that policy for the sake of profit, to make more money at the expense of the people.  It is up to the Minister to prevent that immediately.</P>
    <P>The type of shoe purchased to-day in a country town is scarcely worth carrying home.  A workingman's boot cannot be bought under £3 10s. to-day. A workingman will not go into a shop to pay 50/- or £2 for a pair of boots that will only last a week.  Instead, he will go to a nearby cobbler with the old gift of making by hand, and buy a <Col N="1390" /> pair for £3 10/-, which may last him a year or a year and a half, depending on the type of work he is doing.  How does the Minister expect a young man to do that on the wages I have quoted here&mdash;39/- or 30/&mdash;as it was up to about a year ago?</P>
    <P>Then there is the exorbitant price of clothes&mdash;underwear, shirts, overalls, trousers and jackets.  All these things cost far too much, considering the average income.  Unless there is a change&mdash;and an immediate change&mdash;the seeds of revolution are gradually being sown by the present administration, as people are finding it very hard to make ends meet.</P>
    <P>There is a decline in the amount of money coming from abroad, particularly from England, on account of the high income-tax in that country, and the workers there cannot send as much as they used to send in the earlier days of the war.  Although a large amount of money was coming in here, the cost of living was increased so much in excess of pre-war days that the extra income was not sufficient to meet it.  Persons with small families find to-day that there is little coming in and that prices are far in excess of what they should be.  In many instances the controlled price is not observed.  I listened to Deputy Dillon, I think, on this point, and he seemed to shed crocodile tears at the thought of merchants being taken to court in rural Ireland and sent to jail and fined. I say that such people are mean frauds and that they deserve to be punished, irrespective of who they are.  If such a merchant is committing fraud to-day, he will be a fraud for the rest of his life.  Not only is he a fraud in breaking the law but he is breaking the Commandments of God by deliberately charging more than the just price to which he is entitled.  He has been allowed a considerable profit by the Department of Supplies, sometimes a profit in excess of what he should have, yet he is not satisfied with that and tries to extract from poor, humble people far more than what they can afford to pay.  They know that they must get these things and there is no alternative then but to pay for them.</P>
    <P>The people in rural Ireland are <Col N="1391" /> reluctant to expose those frauds, those racketeers, those black-marketeers. They are people who were brought up in the tradition not to inform; they are people who were brought up in the tradition not to spill the beans, and they have not got out of that tradition.  Consequently, it is only in very rare cases they are prepared to expose a fraud or a black-marketeer. When the offenders are brought to court, very often the fine is so small that they simply laugh at it.  They will tell you quite plainly across the counter: &ldquo;The fine is nothing; we can make that up in a few hours.&rdquo;  If they are fined £5, £10, £20 or £100 it means nothing to them. Nothing less than jail is good enough for some of those offenders.  Anyone who charges above the controlled price should be sent to jail.  I would not shed crocodile tears or worry about these people.  Jail is the best place for them and it is fitting punishment. More severe punishment should be given to some of those who are carrying on racketeering in the larger towns and cities.</P>
    <P>I do not throw bouquets at the Department of Supplies in view of what the people have suffered during the past four or five years, and more particularly since commodities became scarce.  I am aware of the difficulties the ordinary citizens had to undergo trying to get commodities from these cute folk.  I admit that in business circles in this country there are many very decent people who are prepared to abide by the law.  There are times when they can make a mistake and accidentally charge a ½d. or a ¼d. over and above the controlled price.  It is easy to understand that such mistakes can be made, more especially when the Department issues numerous Orders and counter-Orders.  On the other hand, there are certain articles in regard to which deliberate efforts are made to reap big profits.  For the mere sake of profit, some people will do a lot.  There are some people full of the idea of building up vast sums and they carried out that policy while the going was good, at the expense of <Col N="1392" /> the poor, humble people.  I would not shed crocodile tears over anyone who was punished for acting in such a manner, and if I were on the bench it would be woe betide them.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to state (1) How is it that turf produced at 17/- a ton in County Mayo and County Roscommon is sold here at £5 3s. 9d. a ton, and will he take into consideration the small wages paid to the turf producers; (2) if it is true that camps in Kildare and Leix and Offaly are not as they should be, that the workers are not getting a fair crack of the whip and that their hygiene and general cleanliness are not as they should be; (3) if there is any medical supervision in these camps or any doctor permanently stationed there; (4) how is the food cooked and served and what type of supervision is there; (5) what is the position as regards boots at the present moment, and is there any hope of a better quality and a better supply at reduced prices? We demand a better quality of boots and a larger supply and a reduction in price because the people in rural Ireland cannot afford to pay the prices which they have to pay for boots in order to do the work that needs to be done to keep the wheels spinning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate will in future be considered with the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I do not know why this year we could not have discussed the two Estimates together, but that is a matter that concerns the Minister and the Government.  I am glad to see the present absurd position is being altered; one never knew when one was passing from Supplies to Industry and Commerce or <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to speak, first of all, on the subject of turf.  There has been a good deal of reference to turf, but I do not think it has all been accurate. There is a fuel subsidy of £1,400,000 and there is another £600,000 for the production of turf and for other operations of the Turf Development Board. That tots up to £2,000,000 roughly.  I understand that turf is sold in the City <Col N="1393" /> of Dublin at the rate of £3 5s. per ton for a half ton, but I will leave it at £3 5s. per ton.  I take it the figure of £5 3s. 9d., which some Deputies have mentioned as the selling price&mdash;which, of course, it is not&mdash;is the economic price.  I am wondering if the difference between £3 5s. and £5 3s. 9d.&mdash; roughly, £2&mdash;represents all the cost because in this Estimate, as I have said, there is round about £2,000,000, but there is a further loss which, I understand, is suffered by the county councils which cut turf.  I would like to ask the Minister has that loss been brought into the figure which he gave?</P>
    <P>Last year we had two Supplementary Estimates for losses on the fuel subsidy granted under this Vote.  Does the Minister anticipate that this figure will be held for the rest of the year?  Most people compare turf with coal.  Nobody suggests that during the emergency the Minister could have got coal. Whatever his sins are, and they are numerous, I do not think we can charge it against him, as a major fault, that he did not get us coal.  It just was not available.  When you consider the economic price of £5 3s. 9d., and take about 2½ tons or 2¼ tons of turf to equal a ton of coal, that would represent coal at round about £13 a ton.  Last year, when I made that comparison, the Minister was kind enough to say that he did not understand what I was driving at.  I am now repeating it, with the object of showing that that would be the price which it would be economic to pay for coal, if it were available.</P>
    <P>Some of the previous speakers have referred to the production of turf and, I think, they were perfectly right in their argument.  They wanted turf stacked in a shed with a roof and open sides so that the wind could dry it, but I am afraid that that is not all the story because very many people who had accommodation for coal had not accommodation for turf.  I was one of those people, and last winter during the very cold weather I saw turf burning in an open grate&mdash;it was really wet, having been brought in from under the weather&mdash;without throwing out any heat whatever.  That is the position of a certain number of people who had to use turf.  If turf is to compete as an economic fuel&mdash;and we would all <Col N="1394" /> like to see that&mdash;it will have to be produced and supplied to the people in a dry condition, so that it can be used, quite apart from its quality.  A number of people installed turf-burning ranges and hot-water systems run on turf in Dublin City and County, but they have found these to be quite inadequate to supply their needs.</P>
    <P>What it comes down to is that you cannot burn turf in a coal range and you cannot burn coal in a turf range &mdash;when I speak of a range, I mean a stove or boiler&mdash;because their calorific values are entirely different.  If you have a system designed for turf and you can get dry turf, you will get satisfactory results, but if you burn wet turf in an open grate designed for coal, you will get the opposite result, and sooner or later somebody in this country will have to face up to that fact.  I never could understand why the production and drying of turf which presumably will be used in some of the steam-generating plants for electricity could not have been done earlier and dry turf of good quality supplied during the emergency.  If that had been done turf would have a much better reputation in the City of Dublin than it has.</P>
    <P>I should like now to deal with the question of supplies generally.  While the Minister gave us a comprehensive statement on some aspects, he was strangely silent on others.  There is no doubt that the industrial policy of the Government in pre-war days, along the lines of promoting the manufacture of whatever could be made here, has had a very good effect on the country's capacity to stand the shock of the emergency, but, having said that, we must remember that anybody who has experience of manufacturing under war conditions for the last five or six years in England or elsewhere must realise that it has made about 50 years' progress, so that I am afraid we are relatively further behind industrially than ever we were.  It looks as if the Government said: &ldquo;We will not do war work and we cannot get supplies of ordinary goods&rdquo;.  If they did not say that, that has been the effect.  As a result, our workers have had to be-exported, more or less on the hoof.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1395" /> Now the war is over, but nobody can say that the emergency conditions have disappeared.  A new set of conditions, however, has arisen in which it is almost more difficult to obtain supplies than it was during the war period, and I am sorry to say that the Government have not been very informative to the average manufacturer as to the supply position.  I should like to mention what I think is at present a common occurrence.  A number of producers find that goods which they require are in stock in England.  They write and give an order.  The English supplier writes back that he has forwarded the application to the Board of Trade, and a month later the producers here get a reply from the other side stating that the Board of Trade have granted the necessary licence, but unfortunately the goods have been sold in the interval.  That is a very common occurence and one would think that, if the Government were really in touch with people on the other side, they would know what was available and how delays of that sort could be short-circuited. How can anybody over here make plans for the future when such conditions prevail?</P>
    <P>Workers are making tentative inquiries about the prospects of employment. Either they have come back from the other side, or they are writing from the other side to know what are the prospects of employment here, and producers here do not know, from day to day, what the supply position is. Now, the Minister was exceptionally gloomy about the position of supplies, and I am wondering whether that was caused by an absolutely new condition with regard to shipping which now prevails in the Allied nations' economy. Under present conditions, apparently, there is such a demand for shipping that the position has been taken up that there is no use in a country saying that they want shipping for the export of their goods.  The position, apparently, has been taken up that the most serious and most important part of the economy of these countries is that they want shipping in order to import goods, and it would appear that it is really the countries that want to import goods which must make <Col N="1396" /> arrangements for shipping.  I am sure that the Minister is more aware of the position than I am, but I should like to ask him if that is not the present position, and whether it is not a fact that it is a profound change from what took place in the past.  It would appear that any country that is not represented by some sort of a request or claim before that body has absolutely no chance of importing anything.</P>
    <P>Another matter about which the Minister was strangely silent is what I mentioned in regard to the position in England.  I quite agree with what other speakers have said, that the present position of supplies comes down to the question of shipping.  Before the war, however, we had a regular line of steamers running from this country to Belgium and Holland, and we also had another line running from Sweden to this country.  We also had &mdash;I do not know whether it was a different line or a different route&mdash;a number of steamers that went on periodic trips to Italy, Spain and Portugal, and back again.  I should like to know whether the Minister has approached these foreign countries in regard to that matter, and what is their reaction to it.  I am sure that they are very anxious to get things started again, but, at least, if the Minister has made such an approach, one would think that on the occasion of the Vote for his Department he would have referred to that matter.</P>
    <P>Certainly, I cannot think of anything that could come before this House that would be more important than the establishment of shipping lines with the countries with which, before the war, we had connections. In a daily paper to-day, as a matter of fact, I read of Belgian cattle buyers who have come over to this country and who are purchasing cattle, to be sent, presumably, to Belgium.  Now, nobody imagines that these cattle can get over there of their own volition: transport must be provided for them either by this country or by Belgium, and we should like to know whether there is to be a return journey and what is the date of that.  If we could be informed on such matters, people in <Col N="1397" /> this country would have something to work upon, and I should like the Minister, when he is replying, to give us some explanation of what the position is, first of all, with regard to our request in the matter of shipping&mdash;I think that U.M.A. is the name of the body which is controlling the shipping position&mdash;and also what is the position in regard to Belgium, Sweden, France, Spain and Italy, so far as we are concerned. Although the Minister gave us a comprehensive review of the position in general, he was strangely silent on that matter, and I, for one and, I am sure, other Deputies, would be deeply interested in hearing his reply in regard to what is probably the most important matter in his whole Department, so far as supplies are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in his opening statement, said that the Ministry of Supplies would be now absorbed in the Ministry for Industry and Commerce.  Personally, I think that that is right, because it was very hard, during the period of the emergency, to know which body to approach.  Apart from that, however, I should like to pay a tribute to the Department of Supplies.  We may not have always agreed with their policy but, in general, it must be said that they carried out their very difficult task in a creditable manner.  What I am particularly interested in is the matter of shipping.  The Minister knows the difficulty that we experienced when British shipping was withdrawn and we found it necessary to find ships to carry on at the beginning of the emergency.  Certain ships were bought, and some of them were not of the sort we should like to have. That, perhaps, could not be helped, but I should like to know what the Minister's post-war policy will be in so far as shipping is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have in mind the fact that certain public-spirited citizens in this country, at various periods, purchased ships or got them built and tried to operate them here, and that after a time other people absorbed their trade and the ships had to be withdrawn.  I think the Minister ought to bear that in mind and to take steps to see that that sort of thing will not occur again.  I think we should also pay a tribute to <Col N="1398" /> the people who manned those ships during the emergency period, because, if they had not done so, most of our people would have been without food. I am sure that the Minister will admit that some of the ships that we acquired during the emergency period were not sea-worthy, but there was no reluctance on the part of our people to man those ships.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy Corry in his remarks about the shipping position here.  I represent a constituency where we have such important ports as Rosslare Harbour and Wexford Harbour.  I know that there are certain difficulties in connection with Wexford Harbour, but so far as Rosslare is concerned I think the conditions are such as would enable any of the ships coming in there to operate quite satisfactorily, and I think I can guarantee to the Minister that he can get dispatch&mdash;a matter to which he referred&mdash;as quickly from Rosslare Harbour as from any other port in the country.  Mention was made of the case of gas coal being brought into Dublin, and that the cost of bringing the gas coal down to Wexford from Dublin amounted to another £1 per ton.  I suggest that if cargoes of gas coal were brought in to Rosslare, Waterford, or Wexford, it would be far easier to distribute the coal, and at a much cheaper rate, through the counties affected, such as Waterford, Wexford and Kilkenny.  I hope the Minister will deal with that matter, because there is a good deal of talk about the way shipping has been distributed.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have referred to the allocation of petrol.  I know that it presented the Minister with a very heavy task all during the emergency, but there are some snags, if I may use the word for want of a better one, in connection with the allocation of petrol.  I heard of a case which occurred in my native town of a large maltster who applied for extra petrol to enable him to carry corn from one place to another.  He was refused and told that, if approached, the railway company would be in a position to do the work for him.  When he did so, he was informed by the railway people <Col N="1399" /> in Wexford that there was no lorry there, but that they could get one from Waterford.  The lorry was brought from Waterford to Wexford, and for the double journey the man had to pay a sum of £7, apart altogether from the charge that he had to meet for the particular work that he wanted done by the lorry.  I think the Minister will agree that a hardship of that kind should not be imposed upon anybody, apart altogether from the undue expense involved.  I am sure that he will also admit that it was a waste of petrol to bring the lorry from Waterford to Wexford and back again when perhaps an allowance of a couple of gallons of petrol would have been sufficient for the amount of work to be done by the lorry.  I think the Minister should investigate cases of that kind.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned something about fruit.  I did not gather what he said on the subject.  I would like to know from him if there is any immediate prospect of bringing in oranges and fruit of that kind.  Medical men will tell one that fruit, such as oranges, should be given as soon as possible to the younger generation.  I know, of course, that there is a glut of goods at Lisbon waiting to be shipped here. Still, I think something should be done to bring in supplies of fruit.  I should also like to know from him if he has made any effort at all to control the price of Irish-grown fruit.  Surely there is no justification for a person in this country having to pay 8d. or 9d. for an apple.  The cost of the production of apples has not increased during the past five or six years to such an extent as to justify charges of that sort, and particularly when we remember that, pre-war, apples were available at a halfpenny and a penny each.  I think the Minister should intervene in cases of that sort also.  I doubt very much if the producers are getting prices commensurate with what the purchasers of apples have to pay for them in the retail shops.  In conclusion, I would like if the Minister would give an indication of what his policy is in regard to the distribution of shipping and especially the coal that is imported for gas companies.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise what <Col N="1400" /> Deputy Norton said on the question of supplies.  I think that the Minister, or some important person from his Department, should get in touch with persons occupying similar positions on the other side with a view to arranging that we would be able to secure supplies of certain commodities.  I agree with Deputy Dockrell as to the delay or, should we say, the procrastination that prevails in regard to the transportation of goods from England to this country.  I believe that matter could be eased and short-circuted, and that we should be able to get the goods that we deem to be necessary in a shorter period than that stated by Deputy Dockrell.</P>

      <P>The fact that the Department of Supplies is about to be brought to an end tends to introduce into the debate the atmosphere of the wake room, with the Minister occupying the dignified and privileged position of the corpse.  I do not intend to join in the wake-room compliments which have been paid to the Minister except to say that I must congratulate him upon his promotion to the high position of Tánaiste which, I think, he deserves. His position as Minister for Supplies is concerned mainly with getting supplies for this country.  He also has to do, of course, with the production of substitute materials here, but I think the main function of the Department of Supplies is to get supplies and to see that they are fairly distributed. In that connection, one of the most important considerations is the priority or the order in which shipping space should be provided for the importation of essential goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt but that up to the present the Minister has been forced&mdash; no doubt, will be forced in the future&mdash; to put wheat first in the order of priority since we are essentially a bread-eating people.  While on the question of wheat&mdash;I am looking on this matter as a farmer and have discussed it with some very extensive and progressive farmers&mdash;I would like to press strongly on the Minister the claims of fertilisers for a large measure of shipping space.  There is no doubt <Col N="1401" /> whatever but that if we can increase our supplies of fertilisers from any source it will tend to increase our food supplies.  Some days ago I was speaking to a farmer who is engaged very extensively in milk and food production. He said to me that, of all the shortages he had experienced during the emergency, there was none which had inflicted greater hardship and loss on him than the shortage of fertilisers, because due to their absence he was forced to be satisfied with a lower production of food supplies on his farm, of feeding stuffs for his produce and, incidentally, smaller supplies of farmyard manure to improve the quality and output of his land.  Therefore, I strongly appeal to the Minister to place a very high priority on the importation of fertilisers.</P>
    <P>With regard to the functions which the Minister discharges in the allocation of supplies, there is one matter on which I should like to have some explanation from him, and that is in regard to the large increase in the number of hackney permits issued last year.  During the first six months of 1944, three new hackney permits were issued.  During the last six months there were 255 permits issued.  It seems a strange thing that this increase in the issue of permits for hackney licences should have taken place immediately after the general election of 1944.  It would look as if, and in some districts it does look as if, those permits were issued as a reward for political service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be the wrong time to issue them&mdash;when the election was over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Candidates and agents have got to enlist support and have got to make promises.  If they make a definite promise in regard to the issue of a hackney permit, they cannot very well violate that promise.  I assume that a large number of those promises were honoured during the few months immediately succeeding the general election.  Having opened the sluice gate in regard to the issue of permits, they found, after some months, that they were unable to stem the flood of applications, and they had to close <Col N="1402" /> down completely on the issue of permits. The point on which I want to get information is as to what intimation was conveyed to the general public that these hackney licences were about to be issued and what procedure was adopted in the selection of persons suitable for permits.  New permits were issued in one district where there were already a fair number of hackney vehicles.  In other districts, where there was very urgent need for additional transport facilities, no permits whatever were issued.  I should like to know on what basis those allocations were made.</P>
      <P>There is another matter about which I should like to get information from the Minister.  That is in regard to the penalties imposed upon hackney owners.  As I understand, hackney owners who were reported to the Department of Supplies as having violated certain regulations were deprived of their permits without any court proceedings.  That seems to me to be rather drastic action.  While, in some cases, the ownership of a hackney car is only a minor portion of a man's general business, in other cases the ownership and management of a hackney car may represent a man's entire means of livelihood.  To deprive a man of his entire means of livelihood merely upon a complaint made to the Department of Supplies is hardly justifiable.  At least, there should be court proceedings, so that the person aggrieved would have a chance of pleading his case.  In this country, a fine cannot be imposed upon a man for violating the lighting Acts or any other statutes dealing with minor offences without taking him into court.  In this case, you fine a man to the extent of depriving him of his entire means of living for a considerable period without any court inquiry or court proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an example of the harsh and unjust manner in which this system has operated, I want to draw the Minister's attention to a particular case. It is a case in which I myself made representations to the Minister.  In my constituency, a man who depends for his entire means of living on the ownership of a small hackney vehicle was <Col N="1403" /> deprived of his hackney licence early in March.  It was not restored until the present month.  He was deprived of that licence for a period of three months, the offence of which he was accused being that he conveyed one passenger to a race meeting.  The circumstances in which this alleged offence occurred are well known to the Department of Supplies.  This hackney owner was in the habit of using his car for the conveyance of cattle dealers from Naas to a certain fair and from the fair home.  On the occasion on which the offence is alleged to have been committed, this driver, as was his custom, conveyed two cattle dealers to a certain fair and took them back to the town of Naas.  No offence was committed in respect of those cattle dealers, even though they may have attended the race meeting at Naas when they arrived home.  But, on this occasion, a cattle dealer travelled with the other two dealers on business to Naas and is alleged to have attended the race meeting there.  I want to emphasise the very technical nature of the offence.  The car was not employed to convey people to a race meeting.  It was employed for the purpose of conveying two cattle dealers to a fair and home again.  It was customary for those cattle dealers to utilise that car on all occasions for fairs in that area, so that there could be no question of the car being employed for the purpose of conveying people to a race meeting. The fact that the passenger who availed of the car which was travelling in that direction did afterwards attend a race meeting was a very small offence.  In addition, it was made very clear to the Department that exceptional hardship was inflicted upon this man by the loss of his hackney permit. He is an invalid.  He has been in hospital for the past two years and he has a young family who are dependent upon the utilisation of his car.  During his illness, he has had to employ a man to drive the car.</P>
    <P>Taking all those circumstances into consideration, surely the Minister will agree that the cancellation of that man's permit for three months was an excessively harsh punishment.  If the permit had been cancelled for a short <Col N="1404" /> period&mdash;say, a fortnight or even a month&mdash;there might not be so much ground for complaint, but three months was an excessively long period. No justice, if the case could have been brought before him, would, in the circumstances, have imposed such a penalty.  It is because of the severity shown in this case, which is, I think, typical of the attitude of the Department in such cases, that I want to suggest that matters of this kind should be referred to a court and not dealt with by a Government Department. If the Department of Supplies is going to be wound up, it is only fair that the issuing and cancelling of permits without reference to a court, should be brought to an end at the earliest date. In referring to butter, the Minister said that the increase in price had no effect on production.  Knowing the circumstances connected with butter production, the Minister should be aware that those engaged in that industry have been for a long time very dissatisfied with prices, and have strenuously advocated a substantially in creased price for milk at creameries as well as for home-made butter.  If the Minister wants to get supplies of butter, wheat and sugar, home-produced commodities, he would be well-advised to ensure that producers are paid economic prices.  He can ensure that by setting up some tribunal to ascertain production costs.  I am supporting the plea that has been made in that respect by Deputy Corry, who is one of the most enlightened members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I also want to call attention to the difficulty of securing bicycle tyres.  Workers are experiencing great hardship owing to the shortage of tyres.  If we were absolutely certain that the shortage could not be got over, and that whatever supplies are in existence are fairly distributed, there would be no reason to complain.  But there is a feeling that a fairly substantial percentage of the available tyres are going upon the black market, and are being diverted from ordinary trade channels and hawked around the country at prices that are beyond the reach of ordinary workers.  I have received complaints in that connection and I have tried to ascertain the true facts.</P>
    <P>I have been told that travelling <Col N="1405" /> dealers have fairly substantial supplies of what I am informed are Irish produced tyres and that they are offering them for sale.  I suggest that some system of rationing should be established to deal with the distribution of tyres so that those who have to travel considerable distances to their work could be supplied.  In Wicklow there is a fairly considerable amount of turf bogs scattered throughout the county, and for the most part they are situated long distances from the homes of workers engaged in the production of turf.  In some cases that involves travelling from 7 to 10 miles to work. It is a severe hardship on such workers when they are unable to obtain bicycle tyres.  No matter what difficulty is involved in establishing a rationing system for tyres something should be done to remedy the present position. The Minister indicated that there was little prospect of improving the allowance of tea during the coming months. He forecast that the ration might be increased during the winter.  Would it not be possible to provide an additional allowance of tea and sugar for those engaged in turf production?  Certain categories of turf workers are able to get additional supplies but their numbers are limited. An additional allowance should be provided during harvesting operations, because there is no source from which farmers can secure tea and sugar for those engaged in that work.  The workers are only employed casually and it is impossible for farmers to get them to bring their ration books with them.  Farmers who have to employ extra labour at that period have to try to make up the amount of tea and sugar required out of the rations allowed their families.  I consider the Minister should realise the hardship that that involves.  The amount of tea and sugar that would be required for the purpose would not be considerable. Coming to the supply of fuel for the winter, the Minister must realise that this has been an exceptional year as far as turf production is concerned. Unless the weather improves very much during the next few weeks I believe there will be a marked decline in the volume of turf produced.  For that reason serious consideration should be <Col N="1406" /> given to the problem as it may be necessary for the Minister to make arrangements to provide additional firing.  I understand that reserves of firewood have been exhausted.  It may be considered desirable to provide additional reserves in the event of turf production falling down very much below what it was during the past few years, especially if no substantial addition to the coal supplies arrives.</P>

      <P>A number of Deputies described my statement introducing this Estimate as gloomy.  I had not intended it to be gloomy.  I considered that it was necessary to counteract the unfounded optimism which had been generated by misleading newspaper reports.  My statement was a factual statement.  It may have appeared gloomy to persons who have been engaged in wishful thinking, but I do not think it will have any depressing effect on persons who were familiar with the facts of the situation.  I did not intend it to have.  The position through which we are now passing has this one advantage over any position which existed since the outbreak of the war, in that it is reasonable to hope that the passage of time will bring an improvement in it, and not the reverse, as was the case heretofore. Deputies inquired about the measures being taken to secure increased supplies from other countries, or a modification of the restrictions upon the export of supplies from these countries in our interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey inquired as to the means employed in maintaining contact with Government Departments elsewhere which regulate exports.  The State maintains Legations in all the important supply countries and the staffs of these Legations have been augmented.  To an extent which bears no relation to the practice in peace-times when Government control over trade was less noticeable than it is now, the staffs of these Legations are concerned almost daily in dealing with the various Government Departments and Governmental agencies which are concerned with the release of supplies to this country.  It may be that these Legation staffs might be further augmented with advantage, and if the <Col N="1407" /> area of control over supplies is likely to be extended in other countries or these controls maintained for a longer period, consideration may have to be given to the strengthening of the staffs of these Legations to ensure that our interests will not be neglected if the release of additional supplies becomes possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton, Deputy Corish and a number of other Deputies urged that the time had come when I, or some other Minister, should go to Great Britain or the United States for the purpose of negotiating additional supplies. That suggestion has been made year after year in the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Supplies. I have dealt with it on these previous occasions.  I admit that the end of the war in Europe has changed the position and makes inappropriate to this occasion the arguments which I advanced previously.  During the war years, it was believed that discussions on a Ministerial level with other countries could not be confined to matters of trade only.  It was believed that such discussions, if undertaken at our instance, would do little to improve supplies and might create new and avoidable difficulties.  The end of the war in Europe has changed that position to some extent.  There is, however, no reason to believe that the sending of a Minister abroad would improve supplies.  There is, in fact, every reason to assume the contrary. The belief that Ministerial discussions would improve the supplies position must be based on the assumption that supplies to this country are being impeded by political difficulties which Ministers could remove.  There is no evidence to support that view, no evidence that such is the case.  Generally speaking, it is not desirable that Ministers should proceed abroad for the purpose of discussion of matters of trade with other Governments unless it is clear that such visits by our Ministers are desired by the other Government concerned and that some definite results will follow.  The position is, as I have said, different from that which existed in previous years, but it is I believe still a false assumption <Col N="1408" /> that there are difficulties affecting the flow of goods to this country which Ministerial discussions at the present time could remove.  If at any time it is clear that such difficulties exist or might arise, then there will be no hesitation in taking whatever may seem to be appropriate steps for dealing with them.</P>
    <P>Deputies have dealt at some length in this debate with our shipping problem, and rightly so, because it is the most important of all the factors affecting the supply position here.  Deputy Morrissey inquired, in the first instance, the number of ships that were lost at sea in the service of Irish shipping companies or conveying goods to this country.  In so far as Irish ships are concerned, I should like to make it clear that no information concerning the loss of these ships was withheld under the censorship.  As these losses occurred, they were reported here. Altogether during the war some 20 Irish ships were lost and with them 138 lives.  Of these 20 vessels it is considered that the loss of four must be regarded as due to normal maritime risks.  In the case of the other 16, it appears beyond doubt that the loss of the vessels was due to belligerent action.  Two of these ships belonged to Irish Shipping, Limited, four to the Limerick Steamship Company, three to the Saorstat and Continental Steamship Company, and 11 smaller ships belonged to various owners.  In addition, 17 foreign ships bringing cargoes to this country which were on charter to Irish importers were lost.  The loss in all cases was either ascertained or presumed to be due to belligerent action.</P>

      <P>The answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo; I should say that in the vast majority, <Col N="1409" /> if not all of the cases, the nationality of the belligerent involved was never definitely ascertained in a manner which would admit of a claim for compensation being made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not give that at the moment.  The two big ships were the &ldquo;Irish Pine&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Irish Oak&rdquo;, which were in the service of Irish Shipping, Limited.  Deputy Norton inquired whether, on the assumption that the wheat harvest this year will be as good as Deputy Hughes, for example, believes it is going to be, the shipping released thereby would be available for the shipment of other goods.  It would, of course, be available for other goods.  The wheat harvest, however, in which the Department of Supplies is mainly concerned, is represented not by the total acreage of wheat grown or the total tonnage of wheat harvested but by the tonnage delivered to the mills.  For some reason which has never been made clear to me, the quantity of wheat delivered to the mills has been a substantially smaller proportion of the total harvest than it had been assumed would be the case.  In fact, it appears that not more than 50 per cent.  of the total tonnage of wheat harvested will of a certainty reach the mills and be available for the manufacture of flour.</P>

      <P>It would not be anything like half the total production. Deputy Dillon spoke at some length concerning the method of operation of Irish Shipping, Limited.  He is under such grave misapprehensions regarding the practices of that company that I would have considerable difficulty in putting him entirely right regarding them.  It is perfectly correct that the directors of Irish Shipping, Limited, have not been receiving remuneration. The non-service directors of the company were offered remuneration and preferred not to accept it.  Only three of the six directors of the company are managing directors of other shipping companies which have the management of the ships of Irish Shipping, Limited.  The remuneration which these companies receive for the management of a ship is fixed upon a fee basis, a fixed sum per ship per year, and it is such an insignificant part of the total freights earned by the ships that it could not be held to have any influence whatever upon the freight charges.</P>
      <P>I should like to make it clear also that these managing companies have no contract with Irish Shipping, Limited.  The arrangement by which these ships are managed by existing shipping companies for Irish Shipping, Limited, was made by Irish Shipping, Limited, because it seemed to be the best possible method of securing the effective use of their vessels under present circumstances.  Irish Shipping, Limited, is, however, free to change that arrangement and substitute some other arrangement for it, such as the creation of its own organisation, if it considers it to be in its interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection Deputy Dillon <Col N="1411" /> made reference to the effect of the management charges and of the freight charges on the wheat subsidy.  I think that his remarks may have given rise to some misapprehension.  At the present time the total cost of the wheat used in the manufacture of flour here is made up as follows: 300,000 tons of native wheat at £25.4 per ton, equivalent to £7,560,000; 165,500 tons of imported wheat at £21 per ton, equivalent to £3,475,500.  The total cost of the wheat used here, therefore, is £11,035,500.  Against that total cost the State provides in subsidy £2,840,000, leaving the cost of the wheat to the millers at £8,195,500 or an average cost of £17 12s. per ton. The subsidy provided by the State on Irish grown wheat is, therefore, at the rate of £7 12s. per ton, to a total cost of £2,280,000; the subsidy provided on imported wheat is £3 8s. per ton, representing a total cost of £560,000. It will be clear, therefore, that the freights charged by Irish Shipping, Limited, do not affect the subsidy which the State has to pay.  In fact, if the shipping facilities available to us were used to import a larger proportion of our total consumption of wheat then the amount required in subsidy from the State would be reduced and not increased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the subsidy bring the home and foreign wheat to the same level?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It takes a subsidy of £7 12s. in respect of native wheat and a subsidy of £3 8s. in respect of imported wheat to enable these wheats to be sold at the average price of £17 12s. per ton to the millers.  Some Cork Deputies have made reference to the fact that ships on the Lisbon route and other ships under the control of the Department are not making sufficient use, in their opinion, of the <Col N="1412" /> facilities at the port of Cork.  That statement has been given publicity by local Cork interests but it is entirely inaccurate.  I mentioned in my introductory speech here that 25 per cent. of the total tonnage of commodities imported overseas in last year was imported through Cork, and that that was a much higher percentage of our total imports than pre-war imports through Cork were of normal pre-war total imports.  During the past two months 6,909 tons of coal were discharged at Cork in the month of May and 4,581 tons in the month of June to date.  A claim has been made on behalf of Cork that the ships now restored to the Lisbon route should operate from Cork.  It is, however, incorrect to assume that the operation of these ships from the port of Cork would involve a shorter journey and a quicker turn round.  A fact of which the Cork interests who have been advancing the claim are not aware of is that the British authorities still require our ships to call at a British port both on the outward and homeward journeys.  The ports that have been used in connection with the first of the resumed voyages are Holyhead and certain ports in the Bristol Channel, and so long as that requirement to call at a British port is insisted upon by the British naval authorities then there will be no saving of time whatever in utilising the port of Cork for ships on the Lisbon route.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is part of their general control over shipping.  The exact reason for it I do not know.  The ships provided by the British authorities to lift goods at Lisbon for transshipment here were not allowed by the British authorities to unload at Cork although these authorities were requested so to allow them on various occasions.  In the main, the management of our ships must be designed to ensure two main objectives, one, the fullest possible use of the ships, and secondly, that we reduce the need for internal transport to a minimum. There would, I think, be little point in <Col N="1413" /> importing all the goods coming from Lisbon through Cork if the net result was so to clutter up our internal transport system that no immediate benefit would accrue from the arrival of these goods.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin made reference to an international agreement concerning conditions on ships which has been prepared, I understand, under the auspices of the International Labour Office.  I think I can inform Deputy Davin that the conditions on the ships under the ownership of Irish Shipping Limited are as good as they can be made.  In the case of every single one of those ships after their purchase there was a complete reconstruction of the crews' quarters.  The aim has been to establish conditions of comfort for the officers and crews as high as the design of the ships permitted, or as high as is the normal practice in other countries.  I think I can say also that whatever international agreement may emerge from those discussions under the auspices of the International Labour Office relating to the conditions of crews employed upon ships will be observed by the shipping companies operating under our flag.</P>

    <P>Deputy Hughes complained that I had made no reference to the exchange problem.  I avoided any such reference deliberately.  I avoided it because I consider that nothing useful can be said at present in relation to it.  The position is altogether too indeterminate. I can say that the arrangements which we made pre-war to provide foreign exchange for wartime purchases are still operating.  I can assure the Deputy that no supplies were lost during the war years or up to date by reason of exchange difficulties.  The matter is one which is giving the Government great concern, but the Deputy will understand that the obligation of making any statement on the matter rests primarily with the Minister for Finance.  I should say, however, that in my opinion any solution of the exchange problems which it seems likely will arise for us in future must envisage increased exports to the hard currency countries, and, having regard <Col N="1414" /> to the general conditions which we know to exist, such increased exports must in the main take the form of industrial products.  Deputy Hughes also inquired what priorities will be in operation in respect of overseas supplies and what will be our position in that regard.  Frankly, I do not think there is anybody who could answer those questions at the present time&mdash; I do not mean anybody in this country; I mean anybody anywhere who could give the Deputy the information which he would like to have and which I would like to have in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey asked a very pertinent question.  Why, he inquired, cannot we get more tea.  I cannot answer the Deputy's question.  I cannot answer his question because I do not know the answer.  In the years before the war we in this country purchased the bulk of our tea supplies on the British market.  At the beginning of the war, the British authorities requested that we should confine our purchases of tea in that way.  It was in their interests that the purchases of tea for both countries should be combined.  Competition between us in other spheres had forced up prices to the detriment of both of us.  We agreed to that arrangement, and our agreement was due to the impression &mdash;I do not wish to put it any stronger than that&mdash;which we received that we would obtain in consequence an appropriate share of the available supplies.</P>
    <P>If we had thought otherwise at the time we could have made much earlier arrangements to obtain bulk supplies by direct shipment.  We, however, respected the request which had been made to us by the British authorities, and delayed the making of arrangements for bulk purchases of tea for direct shipment until it became obvious that tea deliveries from the United Kingdom to this country were being cut on a far more drastic scale than to British consumers.  In the years before the war, the average consumption of tea per head in Great Britain was much the same as in this country.  The average was about 2½ ounces per head per week.  During the whole of the war period the tea ration in Great <Col N="1415" /> Britain has been maintained at two ounces per head per week.  Here, as Deputies know, for the greater part of the period it has been a half-ounce per week, and is at the present time a half-ounce per week.  We have made repeated representations to the British authorities in that regard, representations to the effect that this drastic curtailment in supplies to this country was countrary to our interpretation of the understanding which had been reached, and was, in any event, inequitable. Those representations were renewed no later than during the present week.  I find it difficult to understand the attitude of the United Kingdom authorities in that regard, in view of the discussions which took place between us at the beginning of the war.  It is possible that those authorities&mdash;the particular section of the food control department which is concerned with tea supplies&mdash;were subject to pressure by British trade interests, and that the drastic cut in supplies to this country resulted from such pressure.  If that guess is not correct, it is certainly true that the British tea wholesalers who had a profitable pre-war business here appear to have made no effort, or no significant effort, to secure equitable supplies for us.  As to the future, I can only assure the Dáil that at the earliest moment at which it will become possible direct purchases in the country of origin will be resumed, and that an organisation of traders has already been established for that purpose and will be utilised for that purpose when the opportunity arises.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister allow me to ask him a question before he leaves that?  If the Minister had not entered into the agreement with the British authorities to which he has referred, would we, in the circumstances of the war years, have been able to import as much or more tea direct than we got from the British through the agreement into which we have entered?</P>

      <P>I think so.  As the Deputy knows, we went out in 1941 to purchase tea in India and arrange for its shipment here.  A very large quantity <Col N="1416" /> of tea was purchased, but the completion of the shipment of the whole quantity became impossible because of the outbreak of the war.  If we had taken those steps earlier it is obvious that we could have shipped and stored here a substantially larger quantity of tea than did in fact reach us as a result of that effort.</P>

      <P>I do not think that is correct.  However, there is no use in discussing those matters on the basis of hazy recollections.  Deputy Dillon raised a matter relating to the woollen and worsted quota to which I should like to make some reference.  He referred to the case of two clothing manufacturing firms which recently received an increase in their quotas.  I do not want to deal with that matter at any length, because I have recently received representations concerning these two cases from the trade organisations which are concerned. These representations reached me only some days ago, although there had been previous discussions with the officers of my Department, and I have not yet had an opportunity of considering them fully.  I am anxious, therefore, to avoid a position in which anything I may say now would appear to prevent me from exercising my judgment on the representations which I have received, giving the fullest possible consideration to these representations and acting upon them, if I am satisfied that they are well founded.  I will, however, make these observations. First, we decided to allocate to the various interests concerned the available supplies of woollen and worsted cloths on the basis of their purchases in the year 1940.  Now it will be obvious <Col N="1417" /> that any such system of distributing supplies will give rise to inequalities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It was 1940 in the case of woollen and worsted cloths.  In such a system of distribution some firms will, because of purely accidental circumstances, do much better than others and some firms will do very badly indeed.  From the point of view of the Minister responsible to the Dáil, the simplest course is to accept such a basis of allocation and to adhere rigidly to it.  The basis has the approval of the representative committee from the trade which was brought into consultation and strict adherence to a fixed basis of allocation of that kind avoids any possibility of allegations of discrimination.  It would, however, in my opinion&mdash;and I have expressed this opinion to the interests concerned in the clothing trade and, on similar occasions, to other interests representing other trades&mdash;be fundamentally wrong to adopt such a rigid attitude and not endeavour to adjust the unduly harsh application of the general rule to individual cases.  In relation to this woollen and worsted quota many such adjustments have from time to time been made.  In the case of merchant tailors it was found that the smaller firms could not possibly continue in business on the basis of the quota so fixed and the device of a minimum quota was operated to ensure for them sufficient supplies of cloth to keep them in business.  In the case of certain manufacturers, whose purchases in the datum year were unduly low by reason of abnormal causes, adjustments in quotas were made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two firms to which Deputy Dillon referred and concerning which I have received these representations from the trade interests pleaded that they were new firms only getting into their stride in the datum year and that quotas based upon their 1940 purchases were unduly low in relation to their machine capacity, so unduly low that it would be impracticable for them to remain in business during the war years.  Frankly, I was not at any time pleased with the system of allocating <Col N="1418" /> woollen cloth amongst the trade interests on a basis of 1940 purchases and I have had consideration given over a long period to the possibility of basing the quota, not upon the actual purchases of some past period, but upon the output capacity of manufacturers, the number of machines which they had installed or some similar standard.</P>
    <P>I found it impracticable, however, to obtain what I would regard as a satisfactory system that would operate fairly in all cases.  I decided then that it would be reasonable to adjust the quotas of the two firms to which I have referred, two firms that were, under the arrangement, given extraordinarily small quotas in relation to their machine capacity, so as to permit them to carry on on some minimum basis.  The adjusted quota which they received, related to their machine capacity, is still very substantially below the quotas of other firms in the same business with which comparison is practicable.</P>
    <P>The advisory committee which was established in connection with that quota system has made representations, and these representations are under consideration.  I should like to say that that advisory committee has been extraordinarily useful in the administration of the whole woollen and worsted quota system, and I would naturally pay great attention to any representations it made.  It has been consulted far more frequently than similar committees established for other trades, and the members of the committee have had to give a great deal of their time to its work. I think I can say that its recommendations have been accepted in the vast majority of the cases in which it was consulted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Where were those members taken from&mdash;all over the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They were nominated by the trades bodies concerned.  I may say, however, that the responsibility for the action taken is the Minister's and he must act in accordance with his own judgment in all circumstances. He cannot relieve himself of that responsibility by pleading a recommendation <Col N="1419" /> from the committee.  He has to proceed in accordance with his judgment, whether or not he has a recommendation from the committee with which he agrees.  It is not the practice to give to the committee, or to other committees in other trades, details of the business of individual firms.  I feel sure that in this particular case, if the details of the business of the firms concerned were given, a great deal of the agitation which has been aroused in connection with them would be removed.</P>
      <P>But, even for that purpose, I think it would be very undesirable to depart in any way from the traditional practice of the Department of Industry and Commerce to decline, in any circumstances whatever, to give to trade competitors information supplied in confidence to the Department concerning the business of individual firms.  In the two cases to which I have referred it is possible that the objections raised by the trade organisations are based upon a misunderstanding, but I would not like to say definitely that such is the case.  Their representations are under consideration, and I should like to keep an open mind in that connection until these representations have been fully and carefully considered.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies referred to what they described as the failure of our attempt to control the prices of drapery goods. I think, however, Deputies must give consideration to the enormous difficulty of imposing any price control at all.  So great are the difficulties of controlling the prices of drapery products that for a long time I, and the officers under me, shirked the task.  It was only when it became obvious that we would have to do something to deal with the problem that was developing that we devised the present system of control. I am sure Deputies will understand that it it very difficult indeed to devise a system of control which will operate in Grafton Street, Dublin, or Kiltimagh, Ballina, or any other place throughout the country irrespective of the different trading circumstances, the different costs of carrying on a drapery business and the different characters of the trades done in various centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1420" /> We endeavoured to establish a system of price control by the device of requiring the manufacturers&mdash;who were working on a basis of controlled margins of profit&mdash;to stamp a maximum price upon the products, calculated in accordance with the predetermined margins for the wholesalers and retailers by whom the goods would be sold.  I confess that, in fixing those prices, we were proceeding experimentally. We fixed lower margins for the cheaper goods and higher margins for the dearer goods and waited for a year's experience to ascertain whether those margins were unduly generous or unduly severe on the traders.</P>
    <P>I think I can say that, in the case of wholesalers, the margins were fair on the whole, although some adjustment downwards in those margins is practicable.  In the case of retailers, in so far as the larger houses are concerned&mdash;and Deputies will understand that it is only in the case of the larger houses that we can get really reliable information&mdash;it is obvious that the margins are unduly generous, and arrangements are at present being made to initiate consultations with the trading interests, with a view to a reduction in those margins.</P>
    <P>I would advise Deputies, however, not to pay too much attention to the fact that traders occasionally will offer for sale some line of goods at a price below the maximum price stamped on those goods by the manufacturers. That is normal trading practice.  There are, of course, some traders who work as a matter of policy on lower margins than others, aiming to get higher profits by increased turnover, but I should say that every enterprising trader at some time in his business career proceeds to sell a particular line of goods at a lower price than his neighbours, or without any substantial profit, in order to attract trade to his establishment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon raised the question of the trial in the Special Criminal Court of persons who commit offences of a black-marketing nature against the Emergency Powers Orders.  Deputy Davin also made reference to that practice and hoped, as Deputy Dillon hoped, that the practice would be abolished.  Now, the decision as to <Col N="1421" /> whether any particular case will be heard in the Special Criminal Court or in the District Court is solely a matter for the Attorney-General to decide, but I want to put forward, as Minister for Supplies responsible for the enforcement of these Price Control and Rationing Orders, our point of view&mdash;a point of view which, naturally, conflicts with that put forward by Deputy Dillon.  Deputy Dillon spoke very eloquently about the importance of an independent judiciary.  I think that, in the trial of these offences against Emergency Powers Orders, the Special Criminal Court is as independent as the district court.  But Deputy Dillon was thinking only of a judiciary independent of the Government.  I should like to put forward the importance to the plain people of this country of a judiciary that is also independent of the influence of the local golf club or local hotel.  The persons who come to trial before a district justice on these black-marketing offences are not the usual types of person that the district justice sees in his court; and experience has shown that the district justices, taking them by and large, are not prepared to deal with persons charged with such offences in a manner which the members of this House would regard as sufficiently drastic.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cafferky said that imprisonment was a reasonable punishment for those people, and I agree.  In the majority of these cases of overcharging, the imposition of a penalty by way of fine is completely inadequate and we will not get from that class of person automatic respect for Price Control Orders until they realise that the penalty for default is imprisonment and not a fine.  The persons whose cases are transferred to the Special Criminal Court are not, as Deputy Dillon said, humble persons who commit trivial offences.  In the main they are persons of influence, persons of much greater influence than are normally found in the dock of a district court; and their offences are in no case trivial.  In all cases where offences could properly be described as trivial, they are still heard in the district court.  It is only where it is clear that a case has wider ramifications than concerns the individual who is actually <Col N="1422" /> on trial and where that individual is a person of such influence in his locality that the manner in which he is dealt with is likely to have a reaction upon public opinion&mdash;and, particularly, amongst other traders in the locality&mdash; that the policy of transferring the case to the Special Criminal Court is adopted.  The public are entitled, not merely to the benefit of an independent judiciary but also to adequate protection against blackmarketing activities, and our experience during the war years has shown that the district court is not a suitable instrument for giving the public that protection.</P>
    <P>It may be that the passage of time will involve the disappearance of the Special Criminal Court, at any rate in respect of offences of this character; but I think it should go on record, for whatever Government may have the responsibility of discharging functions of this character in another war, that if they are to deal properly with black-marketing offences they need some instrument for the enforcement of these Orders of a character different from that of the district court.  That, at any rate, is my opinion.</P>
    <P>Deputies also spoke about the policy of the Department of cancelling traders' licences, following their conviction for offences under price control or rationing Orders, and generally referred to the cancellation of licences as another penalty imposed by administrative action in addition to the penalty imposed by the court. That is not what the cancellation of the licences is.  When a trader has been convicted of the offence of overcharging or of the improper disposal of rationed goods, his licence is withdrawn, because we can no longer regard him as a suitable distributor of essential goods which are in short supply to the people in the locality who are dependent on him for supplies. It is having regard to the future problem of distribution that I act in cancelling a trader's licence.  It may be, in fact, a further penalty, but the justification for the withdrawal of a trader's licence is the necessity to ensure that some suitable arrangements for the distribution of goods will exist in that neighbourhood in the <Col N="1423" /> future.  I think, then, that it is as necessary to maintain that practice now as it was in the past.  It is, possibly, even more necessary.  Because of the ending of the war in Europe traders are inclined to take chances, on the assumption that, before they are detected or, if detected, before the case has come to trial, there will have been such a general improvement in the situation that people will regard these offences as something related to the emergency, which can be forgotten when the emergency is over.  For that reason, I want to make it quite clear that, so long as rationing has to be maintained, this policy of cancelling licences for serious offences against Emergency Powers Orders will continue, and I think its continuation is fully justified.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies voiced complaints concerning the inadequacy of the supply and the quality of the boots available for agricultural workers and for children.  I cannot deny that the quality of the agricultural boots available is substantially below the pre-war quality, but that is unavoidable. It is due to a number of causes.  It is due to the difficulty of producing leather of pre-war quality arising out of the inadequacy of tanning materials and the inability to import certain classes of hides which were used mainly for the production of strong leathers.  That type of strong leather cannot be produced with native hides. It is due also to the lack of protective grindery which in the past made the boot wear much longer than the boot shod with leather only.  It is due also to the quality of the thread.</P>
    <P>The cobbler's thread that was made out of waxed linen yarn before the war was not available.  Some quantity is available now.  There was a small quantity of linen yarn imported recently, and the whole of it was diverted to the manufacture of thread for boot manufacture; but in recent years the boot manufacturers have had to use a reinforced cotton thread, which is by no means as durable as the linen thread, which was the normal material used in the trade.  We expect there will be substantially increased <Col N="1424" /> supplies of heavy boots available this year, due not to any improvement in the supply situation, but to a very substantial contraction in the demand from the Army for such boots.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the problems affecting transport, to which Deputies referred, it is quite true that our present facilities are inadequate.  I stated there is no immediate prospect of improvement, and I want to make it clear that the estimate is based not merely upon the difficulty of procuring increased supplies of fuel, but also upon the difficulty of replacing outworn vehicles, securing spare parts for these vehicles, and particularly upon the problem of maintaining an adequate production of tyres for those heavy transport vehicles.  There is apparently some prospect that the position in respect of vehicles may improve. I do not know how real these prospects are, but there are indications that in the course of a year or so some supplies of new vehicles may be available, however inadequate to our needs.  If that should prove to be the case, then some improvement of services may be possible, because the existing allocation of fuel would give far better mileage in new vehicles than it would in those now in service. I do not think it is possible to assume that the reduction in the Army's requirements of petrol will effect any material alteration in the situation such as Deputy Davin anticipates.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies referred to the position of hackney vehicles, and I want to clear up that position so as to get rid of future misunderstandings.  It is quite true that when petrol supplies became scarce, and it was decided to give a special ration to hackney owners, the number of private motor vehicles which were disclosed as having been regularly registered as hackneys before the war was a revelation to me.  I had no idea that the proportion of private vehicles on the roads which are registered as hackneys was as high as it proved to be. Whether these vehicles were <i>bona fide</i> hackneys or not, I could not know.  I am sure a large number of them were not, but at that particular period I had to assume that every vehicle <Col N="1425" /> registered as a hackney was, in fact, a hackney, and to give it a petrol allocation accordingly.</P>
    <P>The Civic Guard authorities were required to report regularly upon the use to which these vehicles were being put and, if it became clear that they were not hackney vehicles available for hire to the public, the permits were withdrawn.  Large numbers of permits were withdrawn on that ground&mdash;on the ground that the vehicles were not available to the public or were being used exclusively for the private convenience of the owners.  Even to the present day hackney permits are being withdrawn on the ground that the vehicle is being used mainly for the convenience of the owner and not for the convenience of the public.</P>
    <P>After a time, with a deterioration in the petrol situation, it was decided that new applications for hackney permits could not be granted.  Previously a small number was granted on the representations of the Gárda authorities, supported by the Motor Trade Association, that particular districts were without hackney facilities.  The idea of giving petrol allocations to hackney car owners on the scale decided upon was to enable an emergency transport service to exist in every part of the country, a service which would ensure that people taken ill and requiring to be transported to a doctor, or for other reasons wishing to travel at a time when public services would not be available, would not be denied transport facilities.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of last year there was an improvement in our petrol situation.  Certain arrears of our petrol quota were delivered and Deputies will remember that petrol rations were improved all round.  Various classes of persons got increased rations, amongst them being hackney owners. In addition, it was decided then to allow a certain number of new hackney permits to be granted.  The conditions under which they would be granted were stated in the newspapers.  The applications had to be from districts where a need for new hackney facilities existed.  They had to be persons who were wholly or almost wholly depending on the earnings of the hackney car for <Col N="1426" /> their livelihood and, if possible, persons previously engaged in the hackney car business.  After a time our petrol supplies deteriorated again and at some date in December last I had to announce that no new hackney permits would be issued.</P>
    <P>The fact that some 200 were issued in the last few months of 1944, and that no permits were issued since has created an idea that certain individuals got preferential treatment. The only ground upon which there was a difference of treatment was that one case was dealt with when new permits were being issued and the other after it was announced that no new permits would be considered.  I can assure Deputy Cogan that rewards for political services during the election had nothing to do with the issue of permits and I advise the Deputy, if he thinks of proceeding along those lines, to have his cash in hand before the election, because he will find that people will respond more to some material advantage before they cast a vote than to any promise of what is likely to take place after their votes have been cast.  At any rate, 200 hackney car permits would make little difference in the result of the election.</P>

      <P>That is a different matter.  At the moment I am dealing with hackney permits.  At present no new hackney permits are being issued except to soldiers, with a good discharge, recently demobilised from the Army, who were previously engaged in the hackney business, or for whom the hackney business would be normally regarded as suitable, having regard to their previous qualifications and experience.  Except in the cases of certain soldiers now leaving the Army, no new hackney permits are being granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1427" /> Deputy Davin was misled by his failure to understand the distinction between a hackney and a taxi.  A taxi is a car which has a taximeter and which plies for hire in the street. There is not, and there has not been, any curtailment in the issue of permits for taxies.  Our policy has been to encourage an increase in the number of taxies.  That policy has not been very effective owing to the difficulty which persons desiring to enter that trade have in securing taximeters. But where a person can secure a taximeter and is passed by the Gárda authorities who are concerned in the matter as suitable for the operation of a taxi&mdash;that is, for plying in the street &mdash;the necessary permit will be given automatically by the Department of Supplies.  The number in Dublin and in other centres where taxis are used, has declined since the outbreak of the war.</P>
    <P>We have adopted the policy of cancelling permits for hackney vehicles for abuse of the regulations attaching to the use of such vehicles.  Every hackney owner gets a printed copy of his instructions.  He is told the precise purposes for which he may or may not allow his hackney to be hired.  The principal abuse, of course, is the use of hackneys in connection with sporting events, and some Deputies have urged that hackneys should be allowed to be used in connection with sporting events.  My objection to that is that if we allow hackneys to be used in connection with sporting events, they will be used for practically nothing else. With the limited petrol ration which the hackney owner gets, he will inevitably keep his hackney for the use of those who want to hire it to go to sporting events.  I think it is traditionally true that people going to sporting events regard the cost of a hackney as a very small item in the total of their day's expenses.  They will tend to compete against one another to get the exclusive use of the services of some hackney, and the whole cost of the hackney facilities available throughout the country will be increased, if in fact they are available at all for other than sporting events.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1428" /> Until we can either increase the ration of petrol to them, or give some basic allowance to private car owners, it would be unwise in the public interest to allow hackney cars to be used in connection with sporting events.  When a hackney owner is stopped by a Guard outside a racecourse and the Guard looks into the back of the car and sees sitting there a racehorse owner, a jockey and a horse, and reports the hackney owner to the Department, and the hackney owner's permit is withdrawn, it almost inevitably happens that some Deputy writes in to say that the horse was going to see its sick mother in the local hospital and that the owner was only accompanying it in case it fainted at the door.  These stories are extraordinarily ingenious at times, but the hackney owner who drives his hackney car in the vicinity of a rececourse on a race day is taking a chance of losing his permit which he should not take, unless he adopts the ordinary precaution which a sensible man adopts, when he is hired for a journey of that kind, of making inquiries as to the nature of the journey and checking up with the local Guards as to whether the journey is in order.</P>

The great majority of them now take elaborate precautions, and, if a Deputy wants to drive to the Shelbourne Hotel, he will have to specify &ldquo;hotel&rdquo;, or the hackney owner will think he means Shelbourne Park and refuse to drive him there. The majority take ample precautions against being involved in the loss of <Col N="1429" /> their permits, and the common device of the sensible owner is to check up as nearly as possible on the story given by the person hiring the car with the local Guards.  The ingenuity of the excuses offered when a permit is lost, however, will, no doubt, continue to grow.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies asked for particulars concerning the cost of producing turf. I could not attempt to give the elaborate statistical detail which Deputy Davin required, but I should like to say this, that the average price to Fuel Importers, Limited, of the turf which they obtain from county councils and which they acquire from private producers is very much higher than the figures quoted here by Deputies.  I want to make it clear that the Minister for Supplies is not responsible for the production of turf by the county surveyors. That is the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government. His Department supervises the activities of the county surveyors in that regard.  The obligation on Fuel Importers, Limited, that is to say, the organisation which was established and which works in conjunction with the Department of Supplies, is to take from the county councils all the turf they make available at whatever price recovers to the county council the whole cost of its production and avoids involving it in a loss.  In fact, the actual amount paid to each county council for turf delivered by it is often not ascertained until long after the turf has been delivered, or perhaps even consumed, in a non-turf area.</P>
      <P>The average transport cost is very high.  Deputy Norton spoke about the transportation of turf from Kildare, but only a small proportion of our supplies of turf comes from Kildare.  The big supplying areas are Donegal, Mayo and Kerry and the cost of transporting turf from these areas is extraordinarily high.  But we are not concerned with economic methods of transport.  We are concerned with getting the turf into the non-turf area by whatever methods of transport are available&mdash;by road, rail or canal.  In fact, not all the turf produced last year could be transported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some parts of these areas, turf <Col N="1430" /> had to be left over until this spring, because the total of all the facilities available to us was insufficient to move the harvest.  It is undesirable that turf should be left over, but, in South Kerry particularly, from which I have received a number of complaints, the plain fact is that the total capacity of the available railway is very limited and the road transport which could be diverted into the area to supplement the railway was not sufficient to clear all the turf produced there by the county council and by private producers. That turf has been cleared now, with a preference for the private producer's turf, but it is undesirable that this clearance should have been left as late as this, because, as was pointed out by some Deputies, it impedes the production of turf this year.</P>
    <P>I may say that we are very much concerned about the apparent fall in the quantity of turf being produced by private producers in the present year.  That is, no doubt, mainly due to the adverse weather conditions, but if the fall in the output of turf by private producers should be continued, we may have a serious fuel problem between now and this time next year. I should like, therefore, Deputies to urge that the improvement in the weather, which has now made it possible to increase output, should be fully availed of in order to make up for the decline in production during the earlier months of the season. There is only about a month left now in which that decline in output can be made good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I intervene for a moment to point out that a number of private producers who come from the City of Dublin had to cease production because lorry owners' permits were withdrawn and the turf could not be transported to the city?  I think that that is one of the causes of the decrease in production.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No; that is not correct. The only restriction on transport was on personal transport for people themselves. Facilities for the transport of turf were provided, and there will be transport facilities for such people who wish to bring in the turf.  In <Col N="1431" /> fact, we have eased the position in regard to those people to the extent that not alone can they have the turf transported for their own use, but also to dispose of it to other people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>In the earlier part of the year, the people concerned were not permitted to remove the turf, cut by private owners, by lorry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It may have been the case that they would not be allowed to remove the turf to a non-turf area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I understand it, the position is that if I cut turf last year, I would not be allowed to remove that turf by lorry to my own home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that that is the case, except that there may have been a prohibition by the company at a certain period of the year in order to give priority to the removal of wheat or beet.  Another matter that was raised was the question of the cost <Col N="1432" /> of storing turf in the dumps.  Deputies, in calculating the total cost of turf in Dublin, are inclined to ignore the fact that there are certain costs involved in the storing of turf in dumps and keeping it in proper condition, and that, in fact, that cost can be described as an insurance charge.  We can provide facilities for the transport of turf at certain periods of the year, but we cannot provide those facilities at other periods of the year.</P>
      <P>The practice, accordingly, is to bring the turf in to these dumps and store it, and the cost of storing it adds something like 25/- a ton to the cost of the turf to Fuel Importers, Limited.  However, I do not want to deal with that matter in detail, because I hope that a permanent plan, dealing with the whole matter of turf development, will be before the Dáil next autumn&mdash;a plan in connection with which legislation is being prepared.  In that regard, I should like to say that I think that, largely, the problem of post-war turf development is fundamentally different from the problem which we had to face during the war period.  The lessons we learned during the war period may be of some value, but I do not think they will be of much value, because the question of the permanent development of our peat resources is largely a matter of adapting machines to the production of turf and utilising the turf for the production of electricity rather than for any other purpose.  I think that the problems that arose in connection with the production of turf by hand for domestic use during the war years will be of little guidance to us as far as permanent plans are concerned. However, as I have said, these plans, I hope, will be available for us in the autumn.</P>

    <P>Deputy Cafferky astonished me by making complaints in connection with the conditions in the turf camps.  It is the first time for a number of years that I have heard complaints in that regard, and I think the Deputy must have been misled by wrong information. I should like to extend to him and to other Deputies an invitation to visit these camps, and I am sure that the Turf Development Board will be glad to provide the Deputy with every <Col N="1433" /> facility to visit the camps and see whether or not the conditions are as he suggested.  I shall not undertake to provide transport for the Deputy, but I think that the best possible answer to the complaints he voiced is that the first people to apply for re-admission to the camps this season were those who were engaged on that work last year, and that, whereas in the earliest years we had difficulty in getting people to come to the turf camps, there are so many applications now that the Turf Development Board has a difficulty in selecting, from the numerous applicants, those who will be permitted to go to those camps.  Certainly, there are many thousands of people who go into those camps, or who make applications to be permitted to work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>If I visit those camps, I presume that I will be provided with facilities for examining the case, and that then I can give the Minister the facts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, and I am sure that the Turf Development Board will give the Deputy every opportunity of springing any surprise he likes on me.  Now, in regard to the question of the supply of agricultural machinery, tractors, disc harrows, reapers and binders, and mowers, we were able to import a certain quantity, and increased supplies are arranged for this year from the United Kingdom, and of tractors, disc harrows and reapers and binders from Canada, and although the supplies will be much less than would be purchased by our farmers, still it will be a considerable help, and in addition, increased supplies of raw materials have been made available to the manufacturers here so as to permit of increased output in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon voiced a very &ldquo;fishy&rdquo; complaint concerning the refusal of the Minister for Supplies to permit him to charge more for fish in Ballaghaderreen on account of the cost of the transport of fish coming from Dublin.  We organised this matter of the control of fish prices on the basis of fixing maximum wholesale and retail prices, and in determining the gap between wholesale <Col N="1434" /> and retail prices, we had regard to the costs of retail distribution in Dublin.  A fishmonger in Ballaghaderreen may have to meet higher transport costs than a trader in Dublin, but I believe that in Ballaghaderreen he would have a much lower cost in respect of selling organisation, rent, or rates than the man in Dublin.  Accordingly, I think that the refusal to permit him to make the price in Ballaghaderreen higher than in Dublin was not unreasonable. We know that he has higher transport costs to meet than the man in Dublin, but we also know that the margin between the retail and wholesale price is still sufficient to permit him to make a reasonable profit.</P>
    <P>Deputies have said many nice things about the Department of Supplies, now that they are bidding farewell to it, and Deputy Dillon was most eloquent in his farewell remarks.  Perhaps I should be just as eloquent in my farewell remarks to Deputy Dillon.  I should like, however, to express my appreciation of the remarks made by Deputies about the Department of Supplies, now that it is disappearing. The decision to amalgamate the Department of Supplies with the Department of Industry and Commerce is based on the assumption&mdash;it may be wishful thinking for some years to come, but that is not an argument against it&mdash;that the work of the Department of Supplies will gradually diminish and that the work involved will be facilitated if that Department can be absorbed in a Department the functions of which, we hope, may grow with the revival of industry in the post-war years. As the Minister who was in charge of the Department of Supplies, I think that the tributes paid by Deputies&mdash;they made it quite clear that they were to the staff and not to the Minister&mdash;were well-founded.  That staff has tackled a very difficult administrative problem, and tackled it very well, and it was a very great pleasure to me to have been associated with them all these years.</P>
    <P>I realise, Sir, that I have not dealt with some of the matters mentioned by <Col N="1435" /> Deputies.  I have dealt with things of general interest.  I could not go, in detail, into such cases as those of hackney owners or individual traders, and if Deputies want to deal with such matters, I suggest that they should bring them forward by way of Parliamentary Question or by correspondence with me.  It would be impossible, in the time available to me, to get details of these cases for the purpose of ascertaining the strength or otherwise of the representations made by Deputies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the prospect of Irish Shipping, Limited, ships using Rosslare in the near future, is not very bright.  The policy at the moment, apart from ensuring the quickest turn round of ships, is to bring them to the four main ports with cargoes that are intended for local use. The cargoes intended for local use are mainly wheat.  Ninety per cent. of the total shipping space is used in the transportation of wheat, and that is brought into Waterford, Cork, Limerick or Dublin, and is mainly for the purpose of having the wheat available for use in local mills.  The fact that Rosslare has an excellent harbour and can provide a quick turn round for ships is not a sufficient argument in favour of its use.  No doubt some obstacles to its use have disappeared with the end of hostilities but, nevertheless, it is unlikely that it will be used in any general way for the transhipment of goods in the very near future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £5,467,047 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1946, for the Army and the Army Reserve (including certain Grants-in-Aid) under the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts, and for certain administrative Expenses in connection therewith; for the Expenses of the Office of the Minister for the Coordination of Defensive Measures; for Expenses in connection with the trial and detention of certain persons (No. 28 of 1939, No. 1 of 1940 and No. 16 of 1940, etc.); for certain Expenses under the Offences against the State Acts, 1939 and 1940 (No. 13 of 1939 and No. 2 of 1940) and the Air-raid Precautions Act, 1939 (No. 21 of 1939); for Reserve Medical Supplies for Civilian Hospitals; for certain Expenses of the Local Defence Force (including Grants-in-Aid) (No 28 of 1939); for Expenses in connection with the issue of Medals commemorating <Col N="1437" /> the 1916 Rising, etc.; for certain Expenses in connection with Blood Transfusion; for a Grant to the Irish Red Cross Society; and for Expenses in connection with the Production of certain Chemicals for Sale.</P>
    <P>When last November the Estimate for the Army Vote for the financial year 1945-46 was being prepared, it did not seem unlikely that the emergency, so far as the Army was concerned, would last another year, and, accordingly, the Estimate was compiled and printed in the form with which Deputies have become familiar for the past four years.  All the expenditure and receipts were shown under two broad sub-heads without any attempt to give details.  The debit or expense sub-head for £8,411,942 provided for:&mdash; (1)  An Army strength based on war establishments; (2) Pay, stores, supplies and equipment for such a force; (3) Grants, stores, supplies and equipment for the L.D.F.; (4) Stores and equipment with grants to local authorities for the A.R.P. service; (5) The expenses incurred in connection with the censorship.</P>
    <P>Now, however, with the cessation of hostilities in Europe, it has been decided to recast the Estimate, to show expenditure under the normal pre-emergency subheads of the Army Vote, and, accordingly, a revised Estimate within the original gross total of £8,411,942 has been presented to the House.</P>
    <P>The main basis of the revised Estimate is the average strength of the Army over the financial year 1945-46.  That basis is not any particular establishment, but rather the average number of all ranks which will have to be paid and maintained during the year.  Starting with the actual strength of the Army on 1st April, 1945, the Estimate proceeds on the basis of a gradual reduction in Army strengths until the figure of 12,500 is reached at the end of March, 1946. This gives an average of 22,249 all ranks over the year, consisting of:&mdash;</P>

    <P>In addition to military personnel proper, the Department employs quite a large body of civilians.  Some of these are civil servants, permanent and temporary, employed at Headquarters and in the Commands, others are various types of tradesmen engaged on maintenance and other work, while still others are civilians attached to Units for various purposes.  In all, the Department controls about 2,300 civilians and their salaries, wages, and allowances amount to the sum of £514,132 or 6.10 per cent. of the Vote.</P>
    <P>The next charge on the Vote in order of importance is that for Stores.  Stores held by the Army are of two distinct types according to whether they are primarily intended for warlike purposes, or are of an ordinary nature. Ordinary stores, for instance, include medicines, drugs, instruments, mechanical transport, petrol, oils, cooking equipment and engineer stores, barrack services, etc.  The cost of such ordinary stores borne on this Vote is £580,505 or 6.9 per cent. of the total Vote.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on warlike stores at £133,040 absorbs only 1.58 per cent. of <Col N="1439" /> the present Estimate.  The reason for this is that owing to the end of the war in Europe, it has been deemed advisable to cancel large indents for warlike stores, and to await new developments in such stores.  Much of the money, therefore, provided for warlike stores in the original Estimate has been transferred in the revised Estimate to meet commitments in regard to gratuities.  The amount of £133,040 will be found under Subheads O, P, P.2, Q, and X.3.</P>
    <P>Incidental expenses and miscellaneous minor services borne on the Army Vote are many and varied.  The expenses proper to the Army consist of such items as the maintenance and hire of land, compensation in cases of motor accidents, contributions to welfare funds to provide better dining amenities for soldiers; telegrams, telephones, advertisements and funeral expenses, etc.  These may be said to be proper to the Army and to be incidental to its normal activities.  But, in addition to these expenses, there are a number of miscellaneous services borne by the Vote which are not directly attributable to the Army normally.  These services include assistance to Civil Aviation, the expenses of the National Blood Transfusion Council, and a grant-in-aid to the Irish Red Cross Society to cover a percentage of the cost of freight of certain medical stores donated by the American Red Cross Society.  The total cost of the incidental expenses and the minor miscellaneous services is £122,875 or 1.46 per cent. of the Vote. The incidental expenses proper may be said to cost £94,858 and the miscellaneous minor services £28,017.</P>
    <P>So far I have dealt with the Army proper, and there now remains the Army Reserve, the Local Defence Force and the Air Raid Precautions Service.  As regards the Reserve&mdash;that is, Class A and B and the Volunteer Force Reserve&mdash; we are only allowing in the present Estimate for the payment of the normal annual grants to those officers and men who have already been transferred to the Reserve or who may be transferred thereto during the year. <Col N="1440" /> The amount involved is £12,310.  Provision is also made in the Estimate for the maintenance of the Local Defence Force at a cost of £256,435 or 3.05 per cent. of the Vote.  The provision includes Grants-in-Aid to unit funds at £83,000; subsistence and training allowances at £142,735; and other expenses at £30,700.  Here it is to be noted that the form which both the Reserve and the Local Defence Force will take in the post-emergency period is still undecided but is under active consideration.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are already aware, it has been decided to retain the Air Raid Precautions Service, and the cost of the service in the present year is £93,885.  The most of this sum, actually about £50,000, represents outstanding liabilities in respect of grants to local authorities, essential undertakers, factory owners, etc., and another £25,000 will be absorbed in the removal of shelters.  This brings me to the last item, the Emergency Gratuities and Re-enlistment Bounties provided for under the new Sub-head A. (4).  The three problems at present confronting the Army, the strength of the post-emergency Army, the process of demobilisation, and the resettlement of discharged officers and men, are dealt with in the White Paper, so that it only remains for me to indicate their general outlines.</P>
    <P>The problem of the post-emergency Regular Army has been given the most intensive study by the General Staff, and though details have yet to be hammered out, the general plan of an army at least in the immediate future of about two and a half times the size of the pre-emergency Army has been approved.  To reduce the Army more at this stage would not, it is considered, be wise national policy.  Now many of the long-service permanent officers are due for retirement on one ground or another at the end of the emergency so that it is estimated that there will have to be recruited about 600 officers to complete the provisional post-emergency establishment.  As regards other ranks, the position is similar.  About 2,000 are due for discharge or transfer to the Reserve and it is estimated that it will be necessary <Col N="1441" /> to recruit about 6,000 other ranks to complete the provisional establishments.</P>
    <P>A large number of patriotic young men came forward during the emergency to fill the gaps in our ranks.  We are hoping that a selected number of these young soldiers will be induced to take up the Army as a career.  The selection will be made according to prescribed standards of age, height, and physical fitness with, in the case of officers, an interview by a board of military officers.  To the other ranks thus selected, we shall offer the following inducements to remain in the Army:&mdash;(1) Payment of the appropriate emergency gratuities; (2) pre-demobilisation leave with pay and allowances according to length of service; (3) special re-enlistment leave with pay and allowances and free travelling warrants; (4) special re-enlistment bounties varying, according to rank, from £10 in the case of a private, to £18 in that of a sergeant-major; (5) re-enlistment as far as possible in existing rank, temporary ranks being made substantive; (6) service during the emergency to count for any pension or gratuity payable under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes.</P>
    <P>To the officers selected as suitable, we are offering: (1) Confirmation, if possible, in existing ranks, or if not possible, in a lower rank but at the highest scale of pay appropriate to that rank.  (2) Service during the emergency to count for pension under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes.</P>
    <P>I suggest that these inducements are generous, and it is hoped they will have the desired effect of attracting suitable men to take up the Army as a definite occupation.  As soon as the regulations dealing with the recruitment of officers and other ranks for the post-emergency Army have been promulgated, the applications for commissions or re-enlistment will be dealt with immediately.  This will take some little time, after which the process of demobilising the remainder&mdash;about 20,000 all ranks&mdash;will commence.  This process will be carried out in stages and by categories.  It is not intended that the rate of demobilisation should <Col N="1442" /> exceed an average of about 2,000 a month, so that, allowing for the recruitment for the regular Army, the whole process will be extended over a period of 13 or 14 months.  There is, therefore, no intention whatsoever of throwing a large body of men at any one time on the labour market.  Moreover, the demobilisation will be effected by priorities, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  Men with employment or desiring to resume their studies will be the first to be released.</P>
    <P>2.  Men who desire to be released from Army service, whether they have or have not employment, will be released in a second class.</P>
    <P>3.  Single men who, having completed their engagements, are eligible for pensions, will constitute a third class.</P>
    <P>4.  Married men similarly circumstanced will form a fourth class.</P>
    <P>5.  Men willing to serve but unsuitable for retention in the Army will be the last to be demobilised.</P>
    <P>The demobilisation of the third, fourth and fifth categories will be the subject of constant discussions with the Department of Industry and Commerce and, during the first year of demobilisation, no soldier will be forced to take his discharge unless he is unsuitable for retention or that no vacancy exists for him in the establishment.</P>
    <P>This brings us to the third problem &mdash;what plans have been made for the resettlement in civilian life of men who desire to leave the Army or who, eventually, will be found to be surplus to requirements?  The plans may be summarised thus:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  The payments of gratuities to all persons with, at least, one year's service during the emergency.</P>
    <P>2.  The granting of special marks for Army service and of concessions regarding age limits to members of the forces who qualify as candidates for professional, technical or similar posts in the Civil Service or in the employment of local authorities.</P>
    <P>3.  Special limited examinations for posts in the Civil Service as junior executive or clerical officers.</P>
    <P>In addition to the gratuity to which <Col N="1443" /> an officer or a soldier may be entitled, he will be also entitled to pre-demobilisation leave, with full pay and allowances. If he has served between one and a half and two and a half years he will get 14 days' leave and 21 days if his service is two and a half years or more.  Gratuity coupled with pre-demobilisation leave, therefore, means in effect that if a man has served the 72 periods, he will have nearly eight months on pay and allowances to make up his mind about the future and to see what he will be able to do.  Moreover, we are taking special precautions to see that the gratuity given is spent to the best advantage.  The gratuity will not be paid direct but, in the case of soldiers, will be lodged to their credit in a post office deposit account and, in the case of officers, either to a private bank account or to a post office account.  Again, in regard to soldiers, that portion of the gratuity which is made up of marriage allowance will be paid not to the soldier but to the soldier's wife, and it will be paid in weekly instalments, equalling the old marriage allowance, until that portion of the gratuity has been exhausted. We are taking these precautions in the interests of the soldiers and not for administrative or any other convenience.  We know too well that many soldiers would not prepare for the proverbial rainy day if the money were given direct into their hands and we are, therefore, adopting these special precautions to protect the soldiers and their families.</P>
    <P>The second plan for re-settlement consists in the granting of concessions to discharged personnel who qualify as candidates for professional, technical or similar posts in the Civil Service or with local authorities. Subject to certain over-riding maxima, such qualified candidates will be credited with extra marks for each year of service and, in respect of age, again subject to certain over-riding maxima, such candidates will be allowed to deduct from their age their period of aggregate Army service during the emergency up to a limit of six years.  These concessions will secure that candidates for professional, technical or similar posts in the Civil <Col N="1444" /> Service or with local authorities will not, in relation to their civilian colleagues, be at a disadvantage when competing with them for public appointments.</P>
    <P>The second plan, obviously, only concerns those men who leave the Army with professional or technical qualifications, such as engineers and doctors, but the third relates to those young men who responded to the Government's call and went direct from school into the Army.  Many of these patriotic young men went straight into the Army after obtaining the intermediate, leaving or primary certificates.  It is for these mainly that the third plan of limited examinations for posts as junior executive and clerical officers in the Civil Service has been designed.  That, however, does not mean that such certificates will be a necessary condition for such candidates, because the examinations will be open to all ex-officers and soldiers, and the candidates best qualified will receive the posts.  The number of such limited competitions to be held will, naturally, depend on post-emergency conditions, including the rate of demobilisation, but the age limits will be fixed so as to give full opportunity to compete to ex-members of the forces.</P>
    <P>The plans just described will, it must be admitted, create employment for only a small fraction of those to be demobilised and, consequently, a very large proportion will have to seek a livelihood in the ordinary industrial and commercial markets.  The Government, in its plans, has shown its goodwill to the men who have served their country so faithfully and so well, and it will, of course, do all in its power by its post-emergency plans to stimulate a demand for labour.</P>
    <P>The Government's good will is manifest and it is now for the trade unions and employers to show it in the same way.  Take, for instance, the case of men who have been receiving additional pay in the Army in respect of qualifications as tradesmen.  This pay is not granted unless the men have passed various trade tests.  Many of those to be demobilised have acquired <Col N="1445" /> their proficiency from training under skilled craftsmen, developed by special technical courses, and, as a result, they have become fully qualified tradesmen, no less skilled than many an apprentice trained wholly in civil life.  These men, on demobilisation, will not be able to follow their occupations unless they are admitted as members of the appropriate union, and I would, therefore, most earnestly appeal to the unions to give sympathetic, practical consideration to the claims on behalf of those men which have already been put forward by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The unions may fear that the admission of such men may tend to lower the standard of qualification for membership but I am assured that their training has been so intensive that there is little fear of any such a thing happening.  Already, at least one union has agreed to admit these men, and I trust the good example will be gradually followed.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the function of employers in helping demobilised men to resettle in civilian life, and, first, to the position of men who left their employment to answer their country's call.  Under the Defence Forces Acts, such men are, so far as is reasonably practicable, entitled to their former employment on demobilisation, and I want employers to interpret the phrase &ldquo;reasonably practicable&rdquo; in the widest possible manner so as not to leave men out of work one hour more than is necessary.  These will on demobilisation be fully instructed as to their rights of reinstatement.  I shall not, however, as Minister for Defence, hesitate to intervene as a matter of public policy in any case where there exists what is considered to be a definite injustice done to the ex-soldier. But I do not want to rely on statutory rights.  I want matters put on a higher plane.  Those men have deserved well of their country, and I want employers to show their appreciation of that fact by regarding it as a public as well as a statutory duty to do all in their power to reinstate their former employees in the occupations they left in order to respond to the nation's call.  I have had a number of favourable replies to the letter that I personally <Col N="1446" /> addressed to employers throughout the country.</P>
    <P>But there will be still a residue&mdash;a residue of men who have no professional, technical or trades qualifications &mdash;of men who will not be absorbed by the civil service or by local authorities &mdash;of men who have no former employment to go back to&mdash;of men who are ineligible for or unwilling to be retained in Army Service.  Their re-settlement in civil life is a special problem in itself.  It is the same problem as that of young men leaving school with high hopes and willing hands but without any definite prospect of employment.  Their absorption in gainful employment is dependent on economic conditions over which we have little control.  As far as we have that control the Government will use it to the fullest by creating conditions which will stimulate the demand for labour.  In so far as those demands exist or will be created, I appeal to employers to give preference to the men who have served in the Forces.  It is their duty to do so because as a nation we are indebted to those men, and it is to their benefit to do so because their fitness, training, discipline, and adaptability should prove an asset to any employer.</P>
    <P>If employers want&mdash;as I hope they will want&mdash;ex-members of the Forces, then my own Department and that of the Minister for Industry and Commerce will co-operate to the fullest extent in making available particulars of such men to employers and in getting the men required into contact with them.  In order to give such men every chance to tide over any period of unemployment we are taking steps to provide that all demobilised N.C.O.s and men will be credited with a contribution under the Unemployment Insurance Acts in respect of each week or portion of a week of full time service during the emergency.  We are doing this although in the normal course soldiers are not credited with Unemployment Insurance during their service.</P>
    <P>As far as the present Estimate is concerned, it provides £700,000 for deferred pay, £1,488,250 for gratuities and £75,000 for re-enlistment bounties. <Col N="1447" /> It is estimated that the total cost of the resettlement plans will be about £4,000,000&mdash;gratuities absorbing about £2,500,000, deferred credits £800,000 and unemployment benefit £270,000.  I suggest that this provision is as generous as can be made within the narrow limits of the State's financial resources.</P>
    <P>I have already said that the post-emergency regular Army will be about two and a half times the size of the pre-emergency Army.  That figure does not, of course, include reserves.  The old reserves on which we depended to reinforce the regular Army and to serve with that Army as a nucleus for the expansion of the force in a period of emergency were the reserve of officers, class A and B, and Volunteer reserve.  With this reserve we are confronted with much the same problem as in the case of the permanent force.  Many of the reserve are due for retirement or are unwilling to extend their existing engagements so that some inducements must be offered to stimulate recruitment.  This problem is the subject of anxious consideration, but final decisions have not yet been <Col N="1448" /> reached.  As soon as they have been reached, the terms will be promulgated and this will be done simultaneously with the publication of the terms for the regular Army.  Intimately bound up with the question of the reserve is the future of that magnificent patriotic body of men in the Local Defence Force.  We have decided not to disband this force but to retain it on a territorial basis as a second-line reserve of the Army.  For that purpose the force will be reorganised, but until that is done, I appeal to all officers and men of the force to carry on and not to lose interest in their work.</P>
    <P>As regards the Air-Raid Precautions service, it has been decided to retain the service in a modified form, but that form has not yet been determined. Meanwhile, there has been a gradual release from training and the more onerous duties of the service.  Arrangements are also being made with local authorities to remove cowls from street lights and the surface raid shelters from streets.</P>
    <P>To sum up, therefore, the present gross Estimate for £8,411,942 is made up as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>During the past four years, on the occasion of presenting the annual Estimate, I have reported to this House on the discipline, training, fitness and morale of the Army and of the other Emergency Services covered by the Army Vote.  I have dealt with other matters on this occasion because of their immediate relevancy, but I should say that the forces have continued to live up to the high standards set before them, and have fully maintained the traditions of the past.  Now it only remains for me, as Minister for Defence, to express the Government's and the country's gratitude to all the forces and services which have helped us through this emergency.  The sacrifices and steadfastness of the men comprising these forces and services have been all that any country could desire, and the country as a whole owes a deep debt of gratitude to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to the Minister for Defence reading out that statement of details of Army expenditure I felt like a person living in an entirely unreal world, in a world where people play about with words in order to distract attention from awkward facts.  I felt I was listening to a person who had not made <Col N="1449" /> up his mind whether he was preparing for peace or for war, a person who had been playing the game of war so long under peace conditions that he did not know what kind of a world might be before him to-morrow.</P>
    <P>But in the course of that statement there was one declaration of policy slipped in of an immensely serious kind to the people of this country, to the soldiers themselves and to the taxpayers. Without any reason advanced, without any facts being given, without any arguments being framed, we were told, in a happy-go-lucky, casual manner, that the strength of the post-war Army in this country would be 2½ times the strength of the pre-war Army. And why?&mdash;No why given.  What is the reason?&mdash;No reason given.  Either there is or there is not a reason.  If there is a reason for increasing the strength of the Army in times to come to 2½ times the pre-war strength, there should be some reason advanced.  Does the Minister imagine that we are all such feckless, irresponsible representatives of the people that, happy-go-lucky, when the bell rings, and bang goes the money, we will not even ask where or the reason why?</P>
    <P>The Minister was spoiled by the fact that for five years, on account of war conditions near our shores, he was never asked a question about the Army; he got what he wanted; he was not asked the reason why.  But, when the Minister makes a pronouncement of that kind with regard to the future, we are entitled to expect some responsible outlook in a man holding Ministerial position.  It is certainly definite indication of irresponsibility to come along with such a statement and to advance no reason.  As far as that thin end of the wedge on future policy has slipped into an Estimate covering a period which ends on the 31st March next, I want to challenge it and I say that the Minister is unreasonable to the House and that the House would be unreasonable with the people outside if they were to subscribe to such a declaration of policy without thrashing it out properly and without getting somebody to come and give a reason why our military expenditure post-war should be considerably more <Col N="1450" /> than two and a half times that of pre-war.</P>
    <P>There are other things in the Minister's statement that are advanced in just the same glib manner, without any explanation, any reason, or any justification for asking for the money, in so far as it refers to the future.  The Minister tells us that air-raid precaution services, and the couple of hundred thousand pounds per annum that that represents, are to remain post-war &mdash;post-war, when there is not a military bomber or plane flying in the whole civilised world.  Does the Minister think that the people of this country, the people living down the lanes, who are paying for all this kind of thing in their tea, their bread, their sugar and butter, get money so easily that they can chuck it away without knowing why, that they can spend money without any reason being advanced as to why it is spent?</P>
    <P>Is it not about time that the Minister realised that the function of a Minister for Defence or Minister for War in any country in introducing an Estimate is not just to read out how he proposes to spend money?  Any Tom, Dick or Harry off the streets could walk in and read out how it is proposed that the money should be expended. It is a Minister's function to give the reason why it is to be expended. One would expect from the Minister for Defence, facing a post-war situation, that we would get some little hint or some little outline as to what is our post-war military policy or defence policy.  Spending money is not a policy.  Spending money without stating the reason why is not a defence policy.  The Minister knows as well as I do that we are an island people and that if we are to have any kind of defence policy in the future it has got to be based on defence of the seas around us, defence of the skies over our head and of the land under our feet.  If we were really approaching this matter seriously and learning any lesson from the past, learning any lesson from the tragedies elsewhere, we would realise that unless even the most powerful army in the world, if it is standing on an island, is well protected both on sky and sea, it would be as well if it never existed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1451" /> The whole question of approaching our future defences in a realistic way will have to be undertaken some fine day by some Minister who will face up to the facts bravely and put the situation clearly to Parliament and ask for the approval of Parliament. This is a happy-go-lucky clerical style of presenting the Estimate, saying what is wanted without saying why, merely presenting a bill, ringing a bell and saying, &ldquo;pay that&rdquo;.  Those days should be gone.  It may be just a shade too early to face up to an open discussion on the whole question of the adequate future defence of this three-quarters of an island, but the Minister or, if not the Minister, certainly his staff, know that the defence of three-quarters of an island by a land force alone is too fantastically absurd to be considered by reasonable people in the year 1945.</P>
    <P>If the Minister, instead of having a land force, as he says he hopes to have post-war, 2½ times the size of our pre-war land force, were saying: &ldquo;We will have a smaller land force than we had pre-war, but the extra money that a force 2½ times that size would cost will be devoted to developing some sort of naval protection or some kind of aerial smokescreen protection&rdquo;, then he would be beginning to approach things in a realistic manner instead of in a thoroughly casual and irresponsible manner.  In my opinion, it is possibly a little bit too early to go into all that, but it is also a little bit too early to attempt to commit either the Dáil or the country to a post-war Army 2½ times the size of our pre-war Army.  If the Minister can project his mind backwards into normal times of peace, and even is courageous enough to hope that such times will come again, then he will see how nonsensical it is to talk of a land Army 2½ times as great as we had some years ago.  Does the Minister remember a few years ago, in normal times of peace, when there was an Army in this country costing only a fraction of what it cost, say, in 1937, and we had Deputy de Valera, as he was then, and Deputy Traynor, as he was then, sitting here, and every one of them shaking the roof off this building by thundering against the cost of <Col N="1452" /> that Army in times of peace, and the cruelty to the taxpayers of having to keep an Army of that size and cost with the whole world at peace?</P>
    <P>Does he remember that?  Can he project his mind back so far?  Can he visualise the possibility of what he calls the post-war world being a world where we will not be vying with one another in marching and counter-marching, rivalling one another by the magnificence of our expenditure on arms and armaments and warlike stores; where we will begin to think of the two-legged human beings who live in the back streets and the back lanes and the remote rural parts of the country, and begin to think how much we can save on armaments and warlike stores towards making their lives even barely livable?  If, in the post-war situation, there is a good case and a sound reason for a vastly increased Army as against our requirements before the war, then I suggest that we wait until that time comes, and then we will listen to arguments, if not from the present Minister, from some Minister who is prepared to make a case for doubling and more than doubling the expenditure on arms, armaments and armies.  But I would ask the Minister not to presume that, by shoving a remark in like that when he is reading a litany of the proposed expenditure for the next nine months, it is going to be taken as the accepted policy of this Parliament or of this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister went to great lengths to read out the contents of this White Paper which deals with demobilisation and all the rest.  I wonder are we ever going to get any consistency between the statements and the policies preached by any two Ministers of that Government in the same month.  Quite obviously; from this demobilisation White paper and the statement just read out by the Minister, we are proceeding to demobilise, to reduce the strength of our Army, to reduce our purchases, to cancel our contracts.  Of course, the only justification for reducing the Army, for cancelling our contracts for warlike stores, etc., is that the danger is past or passing. But when a few votes were wanted <Col N="1453" /> for a political purpose a week or two ago we had another Minister of that Government trying to play bogeyman on the public once again; trying to play on their nerves, to stampede the nervous woman, and, by that kind of thunderous nonsense of which he is a master, to proclaim to his audience and to the people generally that real physical danger was there for us if we showed any lack of confidence in the Government.  If there are around us the real physical dangers that that Minister portrayed, then it is simply criminal to talk about demobilising our Army or cancelling our contracts for warlike stores.  I leave it between the two of them to decide which of them is uttering the truth and which of them is uttering noisy nonsense; which of them is trying to play honest and which is playing the rogue.  But both of them cannot be honest with the people; either one or the other is playing the rogue.  The Minister can decide which, in collaboration with his colleague.  But let us take those demobilisation plans as being seriously intended.  This White Paper deals with financial grants and devotes certain pages to wordy references to the re-settlement of soldiers in civilian life.  As far as the financial grants go they are generous, but it is the easiest thing in the world to be generous with other people's money.  It is the easiest thing in the world to throw money around if you have control of enough of it, but I should like to see some evidence in that White Paper of serious consideration of the re-settlement of the ex-soldier in employment.</P>
    <P>I read that paper.  I studied it.  I was an Army officer.  I saw men walking out of barracks.  I met a soldier I knew, with his wife and children, leaving Portobello in civilian clothes, and I asked him where he was going.  He said: &ldquo;Sir, when I come to the tram-track it does not matter to me whether I turn right or left.&rdquo;  He was a homeless man.  He had nowhere to go. Whatever gratuity he had in his trouser pockets was going to be salted off him in paying for board and lodgings for his wife and family.  He had previously been in Army quarters. Seeing a period of demobilisation coming many months ago I asked the Minister <Col N="1454" /> what he was doing with regard to finding houses or homes for those men when they leave barracks.  I got the reply: &ldquo;That is a matter for the local boards.&rdquo;  The Minister knows this much, if he is grown up at all, that the absentee can never get consideration from local boards.  If the Minister gets in touch with his colleague in Local Government he will find that the allocation of houses is a strictly mathematical process.  You cannot allow sentiment or anything else to enter into it.  I know that myself, because I am the officer who deals with it in one county.  The houses are allocated strictly on the conditions under which the applicant who is in If you have an applicant who is in Army quarters in Portobello or at the Curragh and you have another applicant living in a condemned house or a very poor house in the locality, do you think any Army medical officer will condemn the Army quarters and say that the official quarters in our Army are unfit for human habitation?  Except that is done, where or how is the soldier to get a house under present regulations?  Did the Minister, before giving that reply to me, discuss the matter with the Minister for Local Government?  If he does, he will learn within one minute that the chance or prospect of any Army man getting a house for his family is hopeless until he comes out of the Army and lives in a condemned house, in some lean-to mud cabin against a ditch and, when he is two years a resident, applies for a cottage.</P>
    <P>That was also so with army men. The British army spent their funds building houses all over this country for ex-service men.  You have the Soldiers' and Sailors' Trust buildings. A foreign army here in Ireland spent its money so that the demobilised sailors and soldiers got residences. Even though it was a foreign army under a foreign Parliament, you had not the Minister getting up in Westminster and cold-bloodedly and casually saying that it was a matter for the local boards.  You had him facing up to the responsibility and to the facts; you had him facing up to his colleague the Minister for Local Government, learning the position and <Col N="1455" /> realising that, if homes were to be found for demobilised soldiers, then homes had to be built for them.  That is so far as the housing side goes.</P>
    <P>So far as the resettlement side goes, that document there is a sham.  Leaving out the money part of it, what are you doing?  You are giving a preference mark for service; competitive examinations for local official vacancies, for the Civil Service and for the Gárda.  What does that preference mark amount to? A man, we will say, left school five years ago and did five years' soldiering. His brother left school five years ago and did five years' grinding.  What use is your preference mark if there is any honesty in the examiners?  You know very well that you could not give sufficient preference.  If you were serious about that, you would have reserved so many vacancies and walked them right into them&mdash; not have a sham competitive examination, a make-believe that you were doing something for these people for whom you are really doing nothing.  Whatever you did, there is a sentence in this document which took it all back.  This says, after dealing with preference marks: &ldquo;The existing practice of granting an over-riding preference for a competent knowledge of Irish will, however, not be disturbed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At the risk of being accused once again of being anti-Irish, as the father of five children, four of whom wear the Fáinne, I say that as long as you keep that clause there you are not giving a fair crack of the whip to the soldier who served for the last five years, and has forgotten any Irish he had.  If there are two men of the same age, one of whom joined the Gaelic League five years ago and the other joined the Gaelic Army five years ago, which of them will get any job that is going, as long as that overriding preference for the man with a competent knowledge of Irish is there in a regulation? If we are to look after the future of our Army men about to be demobilised, we should face up to the matter realistically and not be twiddling about with words.  This document should be framed in the interests of doing the best we can for the ex-soldier, whether <Col N="1456" /> he speaks Irish or French or Yiddish. If you are going to give it with one hand and take it away with the other, the whole thing is a sham.  Outside this bit of preference that you give with one hand and take back with the next, what are you doing?  Are you facing up to anything in a courageous way?</P>
    <P>In the past, when an Army had to be demobilised in this country, the Minister for Defence stood up seriously to his responsibility towards the soldier about to be demobilised so far as employment went.  In conjunction with his colleagues in the Executive Council, he laid it down that, if there was any employment in any works subsidised or even partially subsidised out of public funds, a certain percentage&mdash;I think it was one-third&mdash;of the men employed would have to come from ex-Army men.  That one regulation was worth everything that is in this White Paper.  But probably it would be unpopular. There will probably be 20 non-Army men up for a job against one Army man&mdash;20 votes to 1.  It would be doing the right thing by the ex-Army men, but it would not be universally unpopular.</P>
    <P>That is the precedent that is in the Minister's Department.  Surely some word of explanation is required when you are facing up to the prospect of demobilising a big Army and resettling men in civilian life; some word of explanation is due to the Dáil and to the soldier as to why that precedent is entirely forgotten.  Is the ex-Army man just to take his place at the back of the queue, lining up at the labour exchange, sleeping in the open, eating very little, and hoping for the best, or are all these pious sentiments which are expressed by the Minister to be incorporated in regulations?  Is Government money to be spent on public works without any proviso that even 1 per cent. of the men employed must be taken from ex-Army men?  Are all these pious phrases just going to end up as so many phrases; nothing material going to come out of them? Just as the Minister will not, or did not, face up to formulating any policy, giving any reason why the Army should be big or small, in the same way he side-stepped facing up in any <Col N="1457" /> really worthy manner to making provision for the soldier after his discharge, either as regards housing or employment or anything else, beyond just sticking so much money in the Post Office, as if the Post Office was a kind of fire-proof safe that could not be opened by the soldier.</P>
    <P>It would save a lot of time and expense to give the money straight to the soldier.  If he cannot be relied on to handle money, it is no precaution to put it into the Post Office or into a bank account for him.  If it is put into the bank, he can write a cheque for it and is entitled to get the whole lot from the bank.  It is only playing about with a rather serious subject. There is a question of the advisability in every case of handing out an abnormal <Col N="1458" /> and unusually large sum of money, certainly very much larger than the individual in question ever handled or was given in his life.  It might be better, in certain cases, if there were some really serious work done for the welfare of the soldier after he leaves the Army, if a scheme had been worked out ot give him so much money in cash and back him for so much money in any business or industry or purchase he was inclined to make which would be a help to him in his future.</P>
    <P>I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again to-morrow.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 22nd June.</P>
