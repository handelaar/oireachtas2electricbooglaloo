      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The prices charged by the manufacturers are already subject to control and the question of a reduction in price following on any reduction in the price of iron will receive consideration.  These articles form part of a wide range of goods for which fixing of wholesale and retail prices would be difficult.  I do not propose to fix such prices, but I will, however, have any specific instances of overcharging investigated.</P>

      <P>This matter has been in abeyance for some time.  As indicated in reply to a similar question in the year 1942, certain discussions had been initiated and until these had been satisfactorily completed a decision in regard to the report of the Judge Shannon Committee of Inquiry was not likely to be taken.  There has been no alteration in the position since. The commission was appointed on the 6th March, 1940, and its report was made on the 9th May, 1940.</P>

      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.  I have nothing to add at present to the reply I gave to Deputy Fogarty's question on the 11th July last.  It became necessary to defer consideration of the Superannuation Bill until the preparation of the Local Government Bill and the Public Health Bill had been completed. The terms of the superannuation measure have not yet reached the stage at which it would be possible to give a definite date for introduction, but I hope to be in a position to make a statement on the matter before the end of the present session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he contemplates introducing legislation which will have the effect of segregating films into (a) films for adults only; (b) films suitable for children; and (c) special cinema programmes for children and confining them to those classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given careful consideration to this matter from time to time, but I do not think that legislation on the lines suggested would serve any useful purpose.</P>
      <P>While I am satisfied that the influence of the cinema on children is sometimes injurious, I believe that the injury is caused more by too frequent attendance than by the quality of the films which are exhibited.</P>
      <P>Section 7 (3) of the Censorship of Films Act, 1923, authorises the issue of &ldquo;limited certificates&rdquo;, and under this provision the Official Censor of Films could in effect prohibit the admission of children to the exhibition of particular films.  In fact, the Official Censor has never exercised this power because he and the Appeal Board take the view that there is a danger that films with &ldquo;limited certificates&rdquo; would arouse unhealthy curiosity.  The Official Censor and the Appeal Board have, therefore, thought it better to endeavour to ensure that no film is passed if it contains anything which would be seriously injurious even to young minds.</P>

    <Title>Lough Corrib Navigation Bill, 1945 &mdash; Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill deals with something about which most Deputies, other than those resident in Galway and Mayo, probably never heard, the Lough Corrib navigation. The objects of the Bill are twofold: first, to reconstitute the board of trustees of the navigation, and, secondly, to revise the proportions in which the contributions of the local bodies concerned are made towards the expenses of the navigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Lough Corrib navigation was constructed by the Commissioners of Public Works for navigation, drainage and waterpower under the code of Drainage Acts.  When it was completed, it was vested, under the Drainage Act of 1856, in a board of trustees consisting of representatives of the three contributing areas, Galway City, Galway County and Mayo County.  The functions of the board related to the maintenance of the navigation, including bridges in Galway, canal locks and piers, beacons and buoys in Lough Corrib and in the adjacent loughs and rivers.  This Bill, however, does not affect the functions, powers and duties of the trustees.  The navigation has not in fact been used for passenger transport since 1931, in which year the <Col N="313" /> steamer service which formerly operated between Cong and the City of Galway was discontinued and in recent years merchandise traffic has consisted, chiefly, if not solely, of turf and fishing boats.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1856, provided that every trustee should either be an agent of an estate of a certain yearly valuation or should be possessed of property qualifications of a considerable value.  The Galway County Council has drawn attention to the fact that an alteration in the constitution of the board was desirable as, having regard to these statutory qualifications, there was doubt as to whether certain members of the present board were legally qualified to act and that there was difficulty in finding suitable qualified persons to fill the vacancies.  There are at present four vacancies on the board.</P>
    <P>Under the existing legislation, the board consists of 12 members, six of whom represent County Galway, three County Mayo and three Galway City. It is proposed in this Bill that the reconstituted board should be comprised of eight members, five to be elected by the Galway Corporation, two by the Galway County Council and one by the Mayo County Council. That altered representation is based roughly upon the proportionate expenditure in the different areas.  Instead of the property qualification, it is proposed that any person who is a local government elector for the areas to be represented shall be eligible.  The trustees will be appointed by the contributing authorities in each year in which a local government election is held.  At present the trustees hold office until they die, resign or are removed.  One of the county managers, to be determined by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, will be manager of the board of trustees, with functions analogous to those of a manager in respect of a county council.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1856, to which I have referred, provided that the cost of maintaining navigation, in so far as it was not defrayed out of the income of the trustees from tolls and similar <Col N="314" /> charges, should be borne by the townlands and baronies in the proportion set out in a navigational award of 1859.  That award fixed the following proportions:&mdash; County Galway, 52 per cent.; County Mayo, 32 per cent., and the county of the town of Galway, which does not correspond to the present administrative area of Galway City, 16 per cent.  These figures now bear no relationship to the comparative cost of maintaining the navigation within each area.  Mayo County Council have, for instance, represented that they should be relieved of their liability to contribute to the board on the ground that the navigation is of little or no advantage to the County Mayo, the traffic, so far as that county is concerned, having been practically limited to the despatch of turf to the Galway side of the lough.  Mayo County Council are also concerned that under the existing law they might have to bear a portion of the cost of maintaining certain bridges across the navigation in the Galway urban area, these bridges having been reconstructed on a larger scale than the original bridges in connection with a road improvement scheme, and which new structures, the Mayo County Council hold, confer no benefits on the population of their county.</P>
    <P>Provision is accordingly made for a revision of the contributions to the extent that the expenditure of the board will exceed its income, as follows: the proposed new contributions will be Galway Corporation, 60 per cent.; Galway County Council, 30 per cent., and Mayo County Council, 10 per cent.  These revised contributions are related more closely to the prevailing distribution of expenditure.  The expenses incurred and contributed by the local authorities are to be raised by means of the poor rate, in the case of the county councils as a county-at-large charge instead of a charge upon specified areas as at present.  The amount of the levy by the board of trustees on the local contributors has varied from year to year, but has not exceeded £900 a year.  The proportion of that sum chargeable on the Mayo County Council has been in arrears for some years, according to the last <Col N="315" /> audited statement.  The average annual expenditure in the past three years has been about £600, and at the end of last year the board had a balance in hand of £204.  Having regard to the fact that the navigation is now used only to a very limited extent, and that parts of it were, in fact, never completed, it is proposed to provide means for abandoning or for transferring any works comprised in the navigation under certain conditions to local or drainage authorities without having to resort to the elaborate machinery provided in the Railway and Canal Traffic Act.  Owing to the possibility of abandoning or transferring certain works, power is taken to vary the proportions in which the contributions to the local authorities will be payable.  Provision is also made in the Bill to empower the contributing local authorities, after consultation with the board of trustees, to execute and maintain such works as bridges where the public interest requires the work to be of a more elaborate nature than would be required for the purposes of the navigation. In such cases, the cost is to be allocated between the local authority and the board of trustees, subject to the decision of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health on any questions which may arise.</P>
    <P>There has been some doubt as to the precise legal liability for maintenance, as between the local authority and the board of trustees, in regard to, at least, one of the existing bridges over the Eglinton Canal.  To clear up these doubts, and having regard to the fact that the maintenance of the bridges on the roadway from Wood Quay to the public road in Galway is, in present circumstances, more appropriate to the local authority than to the board of trustees, provision is made to place such liability on the Galway Corporation, the Galway Corporation being the local authority concerned. That provision excludes the possibility of the Mayo County Council being held liable to contribute towards the cost of the maintenance of these bridges.</P>
    <P>These are all the provisions of the <Col N="316" /> Bill, the enactment of which will involve no cost on public funds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated that this Bill does not in any way affect the functions, powers and duties of the trustees.  I would like to direct his attention to Section 5, which says that the board of trustees shall be a joint body for the purposes of the County Management Act of 1940.  It is clear from the provisions of that section, in relation to the County Management Act, that the powers, duties and functions of the board of trustees are, in fact, being transferred to the county manager, and that the board of trustees will have little or no functions or duties to perform under this measure.  As far as I can see, the only duties they will have to perform is to hold an annual meeting of the board for the making of a demand for their expenses on the local authorities, the drafting of a few by-laws or the revocation or amendment of by-laws, and perhaps settling their own procedure.</P>
      <P>Outside these very limited functions, all the other functions will be vested in the county manager.  This is just another case of taking the control of local affairs from the elected representatives of the people and vesting them in the local bureaucracy.  I think that is one very unsatisfactory feature of the Bill, because clearly a joint body, as defined in the County Management Act, is an elected body, and, therefore, it can only exercise such powers as are reserved to it in the Schedule of the County Management Act. These are known as the reserved functions.  I take it, therefore, that this board of trustees will have little or no functions to perform, and will be virtually in the position of the Dean's Grange Burial Board of meeting periodically for the purpose of fixing the date of its next meeting.</P>

    <P>I regard the provision in Section 12 (2) by which the Minister is empowered to alter the rates of contribution as practically cutting away the proportions arranged under Section 12 (1) (a). Under that section, 60 per cent. of the expenses are borne by the Galway Corporation, 30 per cent. by the Galway <Col N="317" /> County Council and 10 per cent. by the Mayo County Council.  The Minister, under Section 12 (2), is empowered, after consultation with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, to alter these contributions in any way he sees fit, to impose the entire contribution on one local authority, or to impose the contribution on two local authorities.  That is a very drastic power to give to the Minister.  I suggest that, on the Committee Stage, provision should be made whereby the Minister should not exercise this power until the three local authorities named in the Bill have been consulted.</P>
    <P>I cannot go into the merits of the proportion of contributions set out in the Bill, but it would appear to me, if I understood the Minister correctly, that the Galway City contribution is to be raised from 16 per cent. to 60 per cent., that the Mayo contribution is being reduced from 32 per cent. to 10 per cent., and that the Galway County Council contribution is being reduced from 52 per cent. to 30 per cent.  I am not in a position to enter into the merits of this arrangement, as I have no local knowledge on the subject, but I would seriously suggest to the Minister that it is a matter which we could perhaps thresh out on the Committee Stage when the local representatives would be present.</P>
    <P>It is clear from what the Minister has said that the Mayo County Council are reluctant to contribute anything to the expenses of the Corrib navigation, and it is also clear from Section 12 (2) that at any time the Minister may alter the contributions as set out in the Bill. For that reason, I think the House should not give the powers in Section 12 (2) without serious consideration.  As to the constitution of the board of trustees, the contributions are in the proportion of six, three, one, and I would suggest that the personnel of the board of trustees should be raised to ten and the membership fixed accordingly in the proportion of six, three, one.  It would seem to be a fairer arrangement, and to give the bodies interested a better chance of having their voices heard.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to go into the details of the Bill, but I should like to say as a representative of Galway that this is a matter on which very little public interest has been evinced in Galway.  As far as the trustees are concerned, apparently it has not been possible in recent years to bring them together.  The reason for that I have heard suggested as a fear of certain liabilities being revived.  Be that as it may, the fact is that the board of trustees was not an effective body and could not be brought together, and it seems that the introduction of the Bill has been inevitable.  I do not think it is a proper Bill on which to discuss the merits of the Drainage Act.  I have my own views about the working of that Act in various ways, but I should not like to obtrude them on the Minister for Industry and Commerce in connection with the Corrib Navigation Bill. I think that the Minister is really only seeking to remove an anomalous position, and to give those who may be interested in the matter an opportunity of tackling the question.  I think the introduction of the Bill was inevitable, and, as a Galway Deputy, I welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this Bill because it puts an end to the chaotic conditions which existed of late.  I would point out to the Minister that there is no navigation whatsoever of the Corrib, and that in regard to this Eglinton Canal &mdash; that is the canal leading from the river to the sea &mdash; its only function can be as a drainage canal. At present it is in a deplorable condition. If the local authority in Galway is to contribute 60 per cent. to the carrying out of the necessary works to put this river in any kind of order, with its canals and locks, it is going to be very costly.  The corporation's rate at the present time is 30/- in the £, and I do not see any hope that it will ever be reduced.  I would ask the Minister to put this question to himself: what benefit is Galway going to get out of this navigation board?  The bridges have to be maintained.  If they did not maintain them from the navigation point of view, they could put down the ordinary concrete bridges which would last for a number of years. <Col N="319" /> I think the county at large should contribute more, and so also should Mayo. I think the suggestion of a 60 per cent. contribution will be one of the big snags, and that the Minister should try to have the contributions more evenly divided between the county and the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated that the powers and functions of the board of trustees were not being altered.  That is quite correct.  I tried to make it clear that the constitution of the board of trustees was being altered.  That is one of the main purposes of the Bill. One of the alterations in the constitution of the board is the enactment of Section 5, which provides for the association of a county manager from one of the contribution counties in the management of the board's affairs.  I do not think there is any case to be made for maintaining a situation in which any alteration in the proportions on which the contributions are made from the local authorities to the expenses of this body could only be effected by legislation.  If any part of the navigation or works associated therewith is abandoned, if, as Deputy Lydon would appear to suggest, the whole navigation should be wound up and the various obligations resulting transferred to the local authorities concerned, then this power of variation by Ministerial Order should be there.  It is a simple procedure.  The whole of the navigation is now a comparatively unimportant matter.  The amounts involved are very small, and it would, I suggest, be ridiculous to maintain a position in which alterations of that kind could only be made by the enactment of a measure by the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed variation in the proportions on which contributions have to be made is based upon the expenditure of the money in the areas of the local authorities.  If we are asking Galway Corporation to contribute 60 per cent. of the total contribution, it is because 60 per cent. of the total expenditure will take place in Galway City.  In the same way, the contributions of the other contributing bodies are related to the expenditure that occurs in their areas.  If the Galway <Col N="320" /> Corporation want to raise the question of the abandonment of the navigation, the matter can be considered, provided arrangements are made for the maintenance, at the expense of the local authorities in whose areas they are located, of any works that are still necessary for drainage purposes or for the public convenience, such as the maintenance of bridges over the canal in the Galway City area.  This matter is not of very great importance.  It is, I think, quite possible that at some stage the whole of the works comprised in this navigation will be abandoned or transferred to one of the contributing local authorities or to a drainage authority.  The Bill facilitates that transition if the case for it should arise.  The Galway Corporation authorities need not feel that this Bill imposes any burden upon them or constitutes an injustice.  In fact, I should think that the bulk of the expenditure which the board of trustees will have to undertake in the future will be on the maintenance of works in the City of Galway which are of convenience to the citizens of Galway.</P>

    <Title>Censorship of Publications Bill &mdash; Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to effect certain changes in the machinery of censorship which experience of the working of the 1929 Act has shown to be desirable.  Under the 1929 Act prohibition Orders in respect of books and periodicals are made by the Minister for Justice on the advice of the Censorship of Publications Board.  The Act does not provide for any appeal against such Orders, but it does provide that the Minister, after consultation with the Board, may revoke or vary a prohibition Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Experience has shown that this procedure is unsatisfactory.  The Minister is the person authorised to make prohibition Orders, but it is impossible for him to read all the books, and even <Col N="321" /> when he does read a book, and doubts whether it should be prohibited, he is naturally reluctant to oppose his personal judgment to the considered opinion of a number of persons specially selected for their qualifications for this particular task.  Secondly experience has shown that some form of appeal against prohibition Orders is very desirable.  Under the 1929 Act it is of course open to the Minister to revoke a prohibition Order but this procedure is not satisfactory, as it makes the Minister a Court of Appeal from his own Orders.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides for two important changes in the procedure.  It provides that the Censorship of Publications Board will be empowered to make prohibition Orders themselves, and it provides for the establishment of an Appeal Board, to which appeals may be taken against prohibition Orders made by the Censorship Board.  The Bill proposes that the Appeal Board should consist of three members, and that the Chairman should be a Judge of the Supreme Court, High Court or Circuit Court, or a barrister or solicitor of seven years' standing.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for some other slight alterations in the law.  Most of these are consequential on the two main amendments to which I have referred, and I do not think it is necessary for me to go into them in detail at this stage.  A large portion of the text of the Bill is merely a re-statement of the existing law.  It was thought better to repeal all Part II. of the 1929 Act, and to re-enact it with the desired amendments, rather than to have a shorter amending Bill of a &ldquo;patchwork&rdquo; character.</P>
    <P>I take the opportunity to express my appreciation of the work done by the board.  On one side &mdash; periodical publications &mdash; there has been, I think, complete success, and no complaints; and it should be remembered that the main reason for setting up the board was to check the import of undesirable newspapers and other periodicals.  On the other side &mdash; books &mdash; there have been some complaints, but very few, when it is remembered that nearly 2,000 books have been prohibited.  In one <Col N="322" /> sense, it hardly seems worth while to interfere with a system which has worked so well, but I think that there is a good case for some form of appeal, and that however rarely the right of appeal may be exercised the mere existence of that right will provide an answer to such criticisms as have been made.  In any case, a change is necessary as regards the Minister's position. I have long felt that that position was unsatisfactory and unreal, and ought not to be allowed to continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not given us any indication, in his statement introducing the Bill, as to the probable cost of administering the new board and the Appeal Board.  In a country like ours, which is already heavily over-taxed, we, on these benches, do not approve of any additions to the already heavy army of civil servants that we have in this country.  Whilst, undoubtedly, it was a defect of the 1929 Act that the Minister was, in himself, the appeal authority and, if he chose to exercise his power, could revoke an Order, nevertheless we feel that some simpler system might be adopted when introducing extra machinery or extra civil servants for the enforcement of the censorship regulations.</P>
      <P>I should like to know from the Minister, later on, what is the present cost of enforcing the censorship of publications and what is likely to be the additional cost of the new machinery.  Looking at Section 5 of the Bill, it strikes me that the powers given to an officer of customs and excise to detain books should also be extended to detaining periodicals.  It seems to me that the section refers only to books.  The importation of prohibited periodicals is dealt with in Section 18, but it is not clear that, under Section 5, the power of detention applies to prohibited periodicals as well as to books, since Section 5 refers only to books.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the powers of the police: in sub-section (2) of Section 17 there seems to be a slight typographical error.  The sub-section says that a search warrant shall be expressed and <Col N="323" /> shall operate to authorise an officer of the Gárda Síochána, &ldquo;not below the rank of Superintendent, accompanied by such other member of the Gárda Síochána as such officer shall think proper....&rdquo;  In the old Act the word was &ldquo;members&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;member&rdquo;. However, I think that that is only a typographical error, and I am only directing attention to it at the moment.  Otherwise, Sir, I do not think there is any comment to be made by us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is to be congratulated on making this improvement in the machinery of censorship, which has been asked for by numerous individuals and bodies from time to time, but even though we join in congratulating him for making this improvement, I do not think there will be acceptance of the general principle of censorship.  I do not think that any of us like this principle of censorship in itself.  It is always a very difficult problem to deal with, both from the point of view of providing adequate machinery, so that it may be of real use, and of preventing the evils with which it proposes to deal.  Men and women who are healthy in body and mind do not require protection against the sort of thing that is proposed in this principle of censorship, and this Bill seems to be like many other Bills that are introduced in this House &mdash; merely a remedial Bill, confined to keeping down the abuses instead of getting at the root causes of these abuses.  Men and women, for instance, who are normally healthy are able to throw off the germs of any disease which may affect them, and the same applies here.  With regard to the type of people with whom we are concerned in this Bill, it would seem that we are contented with leaving as a breeding ground the very type of thing that we are trying to deal with under this measure.  While we waste time in dealing with the effects instead of getting at the root causes, I think we ought to realise that a great deal of this machinery will not be effective except to the extent of confining the abuses to some extent.  It has also its bad side in that it may <Col N="324" /> tend to spread this evil in many cases. However, I think we should congratulate the Minister in this endeavour to meet some of the wider effects of this evil and to heal some of the sore spots connected with this matter of censorship.</P>
      <P>There are one or two other points the Minister might deal with before the Committee Stage, so that, if necessary, we will have an opportunity of knowing what he has in mind.  Deputy Coogan referred to Section 5 and to the powers given to an officer of customs and excise to detain books, and contrasted that with the provision in Section 9.  I feel that the power given to customs officers will create difficulties, as I understand that the question of detaining books, as far as that comes under clause (b) of Section 7, would be a simple proposition, because it would be indicative of the type of book referred to.  When it is a question of a customs officer detaining books under clause (a) of Section 7, a whole lot of difficulties arise, and later in sub-section (6) of Section 16 he is required to exhibit a list of prohibited publications.  If anybody wants to look over the list of 2,000 books provided for inspection, or to read each one of them, it would be a very difficult proposition.  In that clause I think it might be sufficient to require the customs officer to take into consideration books coming under clause (b) of Section 7.  It is mainly books coming under clause (b) that the section intends to deal with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision is made in Section 8 for appeals to the Appeal Board.  The appeal may be made by the author or by five members of the Oireachtas, but it seems that if the author decides to appeal, no appeal may be made by members of the Oireachtas.  As books may be written by persons very far away, who are not familiar with local conditions, I think it should be possible for members of the Oireachtas to appeal, even in addition to the author, because of their local knowledge, and of better opportunities of estimating the effects of the release of a book for general consumption.  From the point <Col N="325" /> of view of the reading public, if an author in, say, New Zealand, South America or the East Indies formulated an appeal without any knowledge of local conditions, by that very fact there is a denial of what is more important, the right of citizens, especially members of the Oireachtas, having an appeal considered as public representatives.  I take it that as far as the present Bill proposes to continue prohibition Orders made under the Act of 1929, it also provides for an appeal under the provisions of the existing Act against these Orders.  However, that does not appear to be clear in the Bill.  Finally, I think that in Section 2 the Minister is given certain powers to terminate membership of the present board, on the ground that that person has become unfit.  That should be more clearly defined, and should say whether for physical or mental unfitness.  Generally, I think the Bill is to be welcomed.  As far as I know, from those interested in the matter, the Appeal Board is looked forward to as, possibly, removing certain sources of discontent, and it is hoped that it will work in a smooth way and meet the requirements of all parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last point raised by Deputy Larkin about removing a member of the board because a person is not fit to continue membership, that part is taken from the existing Act. Deputy Coogan wanted to know what the cost would be.  The present cost of censorship is about £1,000 a year and we do not expect any appreciable increase in the cost.  We do not know how many appeals there will be but as far as we can see, we do not anticipate anything like a big increase in cost. As to periodicals, there is the difference between a periodical and a book that a periodical is generally circulated immediately, coming out weekly or monthly, and if it were held up the circulation might be seriously interfered with.  For this reason the Bill does not authorise the customs authorities to detain periodicals for examination.  It provides that periodicals can be prohibited only on complaints being made by members of the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No, a number of issues of that kind.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, that particular part of the censorship machinery has worked well.  I do not think there have been any complaints.  Everybody who knows the position before the Censorship Act came into force will agree that there has been a big change.  I understand that some of the newspapers that came here, the weekly and the Sunday newspapers, have now Irish editions, because of the working of the Act, and, from that point of view, it has been a complete success.  I believe it is the same as regards books.  There may have been a few cases to which objection was taken.  I always had a personal objection to banning a book which I had not read.  I think anybody who went into the matter seriously, even though he had full confidence in the board, would agree with me in this. At the same time I did not feel like putting my opinion against the opinion of the board and accordingly I generally accepted their recommendations. As I pointed out, there was a kind of appeal to the Minister to revoke a prohibition Order, but it was like appealing against himself.</P>
      <P>I hope that the new scheme will work.  Like everything done by human beings, it is only by trial and experiment that we can arrive at anything like an approach to a perfect system.  With reference to Deputy Larkin's point about authors and public representatives having the right to appeal, I do not think there is anything in that.  I am satisfied that when there is an appeal, either by an author or by public representatives, the Appeal Board will treat each case on its merits.  Naturally, a board that is fair and competent will go into the merits of each case.  I do not think there is any point there.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill deals with the relaxation of abatements of military service pensions in respect of persons in receipt of any remuneration, pension or allowance payable out of public moneys whether provided by the Oireachtas or out of the Central Fund or by means of the poor rate or any other rate imposed by a local authority. About 18 months ago, I had the task of introducing a short Bill to make clear that a pension was subject to abatement not from the date it was granted but from the date from which it commenced. During the course of the debate on the Bill, many Deputies urged that the persons on the lower end of the abatement schedule should be relieved, and it was suggested by various members that there should not be any abatement at all below the figure of £250.  On the final stage of the Bill, I said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I will undertake to bring the remarks which Deputy MacEoin and <Col N="328" /> Deputy Connolly and others have made with respect to the lower ranks set out in the Schedule to the notice of the Government and to do whatever is possible in the matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later, in April, 1944, when dealing with the Army Pensions Estimate, I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have carried out my undertaking. I have brought it to the attention of the Government and the Government has set up a Sub-Committee of the Cabinet to examine the matter.  The matter is at present under discussion and will in due course be referred back to the Government for their attention.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The decision of the Government is now incorporated in Sections 2 and 4 of this Bill.  It abolishes all abatement of pension in respect of receipts from public moneys up to £250, and the ceiling for total abatement is raised from £550 to £1,000, all intervening receipts enjoying a proportionate reduction.</P>

    <P>The effect of this change in Schedules is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  In the category up to £250, 2,004 pensioners will no longer suffer any abatement and the cost to the State will be about £10,751.</P>
    <P>2.  In the category from £250 to £550, 843 will get a relaxation in the degree of abatement, and the cost here will be about £16,857.</P>
    <P>3.  In the category from £550 to £1,000, 141 persons hitherto suffering total abatement will now get a partial relaxation at a cost of £2,274.</P>
    <P>The annual cost of this revised Schedule of abatements will thus be about £30,000.</P>
    <P>Finally, another section of the Bill (Section 3) amends a drafting error. Section 2 (2) (a) of the 1934 Act deals with cases of deportation under various Acts and Regulations, but it fails to mention the Aliens Restriction Act of 1914.  A case has been found in which an injustice is being done to a <Col N="329" /> claimant through this drafting omission, and in this Bill we are seeking to remedy it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will, I think, be, on the whole, generally acceptable.  It will be regarded by most people as a step in the right direction but a very timid step.  The Minister gave us an outline of the Bill but he did not refer in any way to the circumstances surrounding the parent Bill, circumstances which demanded the penalising stoppages in respect of persons who went into the service of the State.  The parent Act was passed 22 years ago, just when this State had been born.  A very big army was being demobilised and small pensions were provided for those who had army and pre-Truce service.  It is clear to anybody who thinks back that virtually 90 per cent. of those with pre-Truce service would have been demanding State employment.  The scheme of stoppage of pension was designed &mdash; it was a very reasonable and sensible, if not essential, step at the time &mdash; to induce those men with pre-Truce service to seek a career in the industrial, professional, agricultural or commercial sphere rather than swell the number of those waiting for State employment.  That was 22 years ago.</P>
      <P>After the change of Government, an amending, or extending, Bill was brought in to give the same pension, on much the same grounds of service, to those who were excluded from the previous Act.  Naturally, in order to do equal justice, the penalties imposed upon those who went into the service of the State were continued in the second Bill.  At that time, you had the question of equality to consider. Now, we are reconsidering the whole question and we should not reconsider it in the light of whether those stoppages are reasonable or not.  A principle should be decided upon first. The question at issue is: &ldquo;Are we to place a penalty on those who serve the State &mdash; a penalty to continue throughout life?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point in discussing whether it is a 10 per cent., a 50 per cent., or a 100 per cent. deduction of pension.  The principle that has got to be decided in equity and justice is <Col N="330" /> whether it is sound to penalise those who elected to serve the State rather than serve other masters.  That is the principle that arises.  Let us take a concrete example.  We find a man earning £250 a year in State employment and a brother with similar pre-Truce service earning, we shall say, £5,000 a year in a position other than State employment.  Their services to the State pre-Truce were equal.  The man with £5,000 a year now gets 100 per cent. of his pension, but the poor brother, with a salary of £300 or £250 in the service of the State, suffers a deduction.  You can go up and down the scale and you will find that, irrespective of income, irrespective of wealth, the man with a fabulous income and fabulous wealth will get his full pension while the man in poorer circumstances who elected or was selected to serve the State has to remain under a disability, a continuing disability.  The thing to be remembered is that these officers and servants of the State, officers and servants of local authorities, have suffered under that financial disability for the best part of 21 years.  We are going to continue pointing the finger of scorn at, and imposing definite financial penalties on, anybody who helped to build the State, to make this country a free country and who afterwards continued to serve the State.  I think that any one of us examining it as a matter of State policy and inquiring into the principle of the matter will find that there is no justification whatever for it.</P>
    <P>My argument may be answered by saying that the cost will be so much higher.  That is scarcely an argument but the cost is nothing like the apparent cost because the higher the income of the individual who gets a pension, the greater share goes in income tax and the greater portion in indirect taxation.  Straight away, considerably more than a third will go in direct taxation and it is reasonable to assume that of the figures mentioned, one-half will go back to the State in one form or another.  The figures put up by the Minister, I am certain, make no allowance for direct and indirect taxation.  The picture painted is that <Col N="331" /> the State would be poorer by £30,000 if it does the limited amount of justice outlined in this Bill.  I think that is an entirely misleading figure.  The figure should be given less a reasonable estimate of how much will go back straight away into the State coffers. Be that as it may, I did not get on my feet to argue about figures.</P>
    <P>I got on my feet to ask that, after 21 years, ordinary justice be done to the people in receipt of these pensions. I think it is an unknown thing, except in our parent Act and in our amending Act, for a pension granted for service to be reduced on account of present service to the State while no reduction whatsoever is made if the income from employment outside State service reaches the limit.  The simple case to examine is the case of the person receiving X pounds in the service of the State as against a person not in the service of the State with 20 times that income.  The Minister has the responsibility of justifying the payment of full pension to the person outside the State service who has 20 times the income of the man in the State service, while reducing the latter's pension.  I do not think it is reasonable and I do not think it is defensible. I do not think for one moment that it would meet with the approval of this Assembly, granted a free vote.</P>
    <P>It is only a few weeks ago since we were honouring the memory of a great Irishman.  When we were honouring that particular patriot's memory, there was no arguing about pounds, shillings and pence.  Whatever the cost was, it was met freely and generously.  If there is one kink in our character, it is that we cannot honour anybody until he is sufficiently long dead to be forgotten by most.  Then a historian picks out the name and we all pay tribute.  We promptly pay tribute for glorious failures in the past, for heroic failures in the past.  Is it not about time that we started to pay a little tribute to heroic success in the present generation, that we made some little gesture of appreciation to the men who succeeded in establishing what generations before them had failed to establish &mdash; a free and independent State?  When it comes to recognition <Col N="332" /> of heroic success, then apparently we must meet it in a niggardly financial spirit, by trying to devise ways and means to deprive those in the service of the State of a reward to which they are justly entitled, but we give it with two hands to the wealthy person of unlimited income who is not in the service of the State.</P>
    <P>As far as I understand the make-up of modern States, there is a general drive throughout the world to get the best brains and the keenest intellects into State service.  Here we are apparently to continue for all time a financial disability and penalty on those who elect, or are selected, to go into the State service.  I would ask the Minister between this and the Committee Stage to reopen with the Executive Council, and particularly with the Department of Defence, the equity of this whole question &mdash; to consider whether it is good State policy to continue the injustice of placing financial penalties on those who have served the State irrespective of income, while full pension is paid to those outside the service of the State irrespective of income.  I would ask him to reconsider the question on the principle that there is no shred of justification for continuing these penalties, no matter how small.  It is not statesmanship to say: &ldquo;This is an injustice but we are reducing the injustice&rdquo;.  The only defence for this Bill at all is on the ground that you are reducing the injustice or minimising it. That is not statesmanship and it is not a correct lead to give inside or outside Parliament.  The responsibility is on the Minister and the Executive Council to decide whether a reduction in pension in these circumstances is or is not an injustice.  If it is not an injustice, there should be no amending Bill.  If it is an injustice, it is no defence to say: &ldquo;We are reducing the injustice&rdquo;.  These people, each in his own field, played their part in the last successful effort to establish this State.</P>
    <P>The officers in the Department of Finance and any other Department who want to continue a financial injustice in respect of their income would not have been in a position to do that <Col N="333" /> but for the efforts of the people whom we are continuing to penalise.  I urge very strongly that the principle be further considered as to whether there should be a continuance of penalties in the case of those in the service of the State as against those outside the State service, as to whether it is a just thing to give full pension to a man with £50,000 a year outside the State employment, and to continue to make deductions in the pension paid to even the very lowliest State employee. There is a big principle raised here. The principle should be decided first. Then, if it were viewed and examined as to whether this Bill is not merely a Bill to reduce an injustice but at the same time to continue it to a lesser extent, I think the Bill would come in as a simple amending Bill, wiping out the curtailment tables in the parent Bill.  Between this and Committee Stage, I would ask the Minister, very, very sincerely, to have it examined by the Government from that particular angle and I would invite the Minister, in private, to take the majority opinion of any Party in this House, and I think the majority opinion would be that it is now time to remit completely the financial disabilities placed on these old-timers in the last 21 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, one would think that the Party to which he belongs did nothing but justice to the men who fought for this country.  His Party were in office for a number of years and they excluded from the pensions code the majority of the members of the Independence movement.  There is one point that I wish to make in respect of this Bill.  I am in agreement with the scaling down of the abatements on military service pensions because I believe that the people who work for the State and receive money from State funds are absolutely entitled to their full military service pension.  When it comes to the calculation of a man's income under this code, I would ask the Minister to take into consideration the fact that a disability pension is also included in the calculation of the funds received by an individual from the State.  I do not think it fair that the State should <Col N="334" /> penalise an individual in respect of his disability pension.  A disability pension, to my mind, is something different from a service pension and the fact that a man is in receipt of a pension under the Army Pensions Acts is an admission by the State that the man has lost his physical ability to earn his living.  Therefore, such moneys should not be considered in the assessment of income for abatement under this code.  Personally, I would be satisfied if that point were met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather difficult to see what is the compelling reason for the introduction of this Bill at the moment.  I do not know that there has been any general demand or outcry from any section of the public for this revision.  Deputy Dr. O'Higgins says that it will partially remedy or reduce an injustice.  I suggest that it will perpetuate and accentuate an inequality. Comparing the proposals in this Bill with the Acts of 1924 and 1934, we find that men who were in receipt of £100 suffered a loss of 5 per cent. and upwards, whereas, under this Bill, until a man is in receipt of over £250 from public funds, he suffers no reduction whatever in pension, and it is proposed that a man in receipt of £550 per annum may receive 50 per cent. of his pension.  That seems to be very generous treatment to those concerned.  Contrast that with the men of the Old I.R.A. in receipt of pensions from 10/- a week to 25/- a week and who are employed, for instance, as road workers, ushers, bank porters, or in any menial position. They will benefit to the extent of 30/- a year under the proposals in this Bill, whereas those in high positions, in receipt of high salaries or big pensions from public funds will be entitled to get 50 per cent. of their pension. I think the inequalities that have been evident in the two previous Acts are accentuated in the present measure. If there was any necessity for a revision, it should have been done on the basis of bridging, to some extent, the inequalities that have caused a good deal of friction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, coming at this stage, is, to my mind, an anti-climax to another <Col N="335" /> Bill that was introduced early this year by the Government, and it gives room for suspicion that, having excluded those people in whom the Government were not interested, they were going to be extra generous with the favoured few.  It would appear to anyone who made a study of the tables that those who have got the goose will get another goose and that those who have not got the goose are completely and rigidly excluded, that those on the ground floor will remain there and those in the higher positions will have their positions immensely improved.</P>
    <P>It is unnecessary for me to go into detail as to the type of people concerned with the higher scales, but I do think that if the Minister gives the matter careful and impartial scrutiny he will agree that the Bill will create a good deal of friction and unrest in the minds of the lower paid pensioners who are not getting an equitable deal under this Bill.  If the position had been left as it was, there would have been something to be said for it, but this Bill will improve the lot of the top dog and will not improve, except to the extent of about 30/- a year, the position of men on very low wages who are in receipt of small I.R.A. pensions. If the Bill is to justify itself at all, I think that matter would call for the Minister's serious attention.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister when replying to give some information on the following points.  I should like to know the number of persons in receipt of salary, remuneration or pension from public funds not exceeding £100, who will be affected by this Bill, the number of persons in receipt of over £100 and less than £150, and so on up to £250 to £300, who will be affected by this Bill, and then I should like to know the number of persons in receipt of £1,000 who will be affected by the Bill.  These are really the interesting and salient points I am concerned with. I would be glad if the Minister would give some information as to the numbers concerned.  I should also like the Minister to state the sums allotted to the different grades of pension and the total sum which is represented by <Col N="336" /> this Bill.  If that figure is disclosed, it would be interesting, in the light of my previous remark, to know where it is to be allocated and what number will benefit by that sum of money.  I suggest, following the statement of Deputy O'Higgins, that you are reducing an injustice, but I repeat that you are perpetuating and accentuating an inequality in the present proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Deputy Keyes you would come to the conclusion that he did not understand the principle of the Acts at all.  It is obvious from his remarks that he scarcely understands what he is talking about.  I am sure that if he had consulted the Leader of his Party, who is very anxious that such a Bill as this should be introduced, he would understand much better than he does what this Bill proposes to do.  He talked about the men with small pensions and said that there was an injustice being done to them under this Bill.  That is not so.  The men with a small pension got the pension on the basis of the 1924 and 1934 Acts, according to the years of service they had.  Whether they were earning 5/- per day or £5 per day, they got the pension originally on the basis of their service.  That must be understood, because it is the basis of the whole thing.  There may be men in highly-paid positions who have very small pensions.  A man may be earning £1,000 a year and only have a pension of 5/- per week.  Men with lowly-paid jobs, such as scavengers, or others with small salaries from local authorities are not the only men who have small pensions.  I know a number of men who are in lowly-paid jobs who have large pensions and vice versa. There are men earning £1,000 a year who have very small pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill certainly will serve a very useful purpose.  I have in mind a large number of men in the employment of local authorities with wages of from £2 to £3 a week who will benefit very much by this Bill.  Then there is the Old I.R.A. man with a small pension, who probably had to apply for unemployment assistance occasionally, and even the small pension he was receiving was taken into consideration in <Col N="337" /> assessing his means in connection with unemployment assistance.  That was the greatest injustice that took place under the original Acts.  Such men as these will be very much benefited by this Bill.  No injustice is being done to men who have small pensions.  As I said, they were given pensions on the basis of their service irrespective of their income at the time from any outside source.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy O'Higgins, I am sorry that the Minister did not go further in this matter.  I am one of those who believe that men who served this country in critical times and who made possible the setting up of this State and this House should be given the full pension to which they are entitled.  A man in civilian life, even if he has a salary of £10,000 a year, can get his full pension but not a man who is in the service of the State or of a local authority.  I cannot understand why in that case his pension should be cut down.  Deputy O'Higgins is not quite accurate when he said that this was introduced originally because so many people were trying to get into the State service in 1924.  I think this principle came down from the British, because they cut their army pensions or other pensions on the same basis when people enter the State service.  I think that is how it originated.  It is wrong that men who served the State in the Army should not be given their full pensions when the State sees fits to award them a pension for service in the Army.  This Bill is a step in the right direction.  It is probable that by other steps we will get to the stage to which we would like to get.</P>
    <P>This is an amendment of the 1924 and 1934 Pensions Acts.  I suggest to the Minister that he should have introduced a further amendment on the lines of the provision which has been made for the 1916 men who are unable to earn a livelihood.  If those affected by this Bill are unable to earn a livelihood, they should be provided with pensions on the same generous scale as those provided for the 1916 men.  I hope that will be done and I suggest to the Minister that this is an opportune time to do it.  A great number of those who served this country from <Col N="338" /> 1916 onwards are dropping out every day and their number is getting smaller day by day.  A good number of them, although just beyond middle age, are unable to earn a livelihood.  I hope the Minister will bring proposals before the Government to amend the law further and provide for those who are unable to earn their livelihood on the same basis as the 1916 men.  I welcome this Bill as a step in the right direction and I have no doubt that it will be passed by this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of Deputy Allen's severe strictures on my friend Deputy Keyes, one requires some courage to raise any matter in regard to the interpretation of this Bill.  There is one small matter, however, in regard to which I would like some clarification from the Minister.  I understand that the abatements in pensions provided for in this Bill are based on the gross remuneration of the persons affected, the gross salary and allowances and so forth.  On the face of it, it seems to me that there would be an inequality or injustice involved in that method of calculating the abatements, because it is obvious that one civil servant's gross income might be very little in advance of his net income.  One particular civil servant might have very little out-of-pocket expenses in carrying out the duties of his office, whereas another officer might have very big expenses. Thus the man who would have very big out-of-pocket expenses would derive much less benefit from these abatements than the person who would have no expenses or very small expenses. There seems to be an inequality there, as between those two types of official, and if we want to be strictly fair &mdash; as I am sure the Minister is trying to be &mdash; the abatements should be based on net income and not on gross income. I am not quoting a very popular type of official when I quote the example of an income-tax collector, who has very high out-of-pocket expenses in carrying out the functions of his office, since he has considerable travelling to do and possibly has office rent to pay as well. If that man's abatement were based upon his gross income, it would be a very small abatement when brought down to his net income.  On the other <Col N="339" /> hand, there may be another type of official in a salaried position, who would have very little overhead or out-of-pocket expenses and who would get the full benefit of the abatement.  I would like the Minister to explain why it was decided to base these abatements on gross rather than on net income.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the contention put forward by Deputy O'Higgins.  There is a strong objection in principle to the method of abatement employed under the 1924 and 1934 Acts and in this particular measure.  It is tantamount to imposing a means test on those who, by accident or otherwise, happen to have been employed in the State service after they had rendered military service in the forces of the State; whereas no such means test is imposed on recipients of pensions who go into business or other employment.  A man may go into business and become a John D. Rockefeller or a Croesus and he can enjoy his full pension.  A man may go into the State service and get a miserable salary, but he has to suffer an abatement in consequence of his being a State employee.  In that respect, the principle is unsound and there is a good case for reviewing the whole measure in the light of what Deputy O'Higgins has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it, abatement was introduced in 1924, largely for the purposes of discouraging officers and men who were being discharged from the Army from looking to the State for future employment and to encourage them to go into business, into farming or the professions.  No such condition of things exists to-day and I cannot see that there is any justification for a continuance of the system of abatement which was peculiar to the conditions obtaining in 1924.  Since then the cost of living has gone up; the purchasing power of the £ to-day is certainly not half of what it was in 1924 and there is no analogy between a man in receipt of a pension of £200 in 1924 and the same man to-day.  For that reason, I would seriously suggest that, if the Minister cannot accept the <Col N="340" /> principle that there should not be any abatement, he should raise the ceiling to a higher level than that given in the Schedule to the Bill, in view of the cost of living having increased so considerably in recent years.  The maximum which is free from abatement is £250, but that sum may be composed of salary, bonus and, perhaps, pension.  I do not think it is at all equitable to impose any reduction in the case of a gross income of under £500 per annum, in view of the existing conditions and the high cost of living.</P>
    <P>I would like to support Deputy Hilliard on the point he made as regards disability pensions.  It is entirely unfair that a man should have his military service pension abated because of the fact that he is in receipt of a disability pension.  That should not be included within the definition of pension for the purposes of abatement. It is a matter which we can thrash out on the Committee Stage and there is a good deal to be said for it. There are many cases of hardship where men in receipt of small incomes are in receipt of both pensions.  Anything which they earned should be left to them.  As Deputy Allen has said, these pensions were awarded on the basis of service and sacrifices made in the fight for freedom and they should be granted irrespective of the income of the person.  It seems to me to be contrary to the principle of rewarding these men for national service that we should pay this money into their pockets and proceed forthwith to take it out again because they happen to be in the employment of the State.</P>
    <P>Another matter which should be considered, and which may be raised on the Committee Stage, is as to whether the pension should not be based on the basic pay rather than on the gross pay. On reading the Schedule it would seem that the Department of Finance can take into consideration remuneration, pension or allowances of any kind. They can take into consideration the bonus, the basic pay or any rent or other allowance.  I do not know what the word &ldquo;allowance&rdquo; covers, but it is a matter which will have to be <Col N="341" /> clarified at a later stage.  It might be better if the Schedule were restricted to the basic pay only of the recipient.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this Bill.  I know he has taken a great personal interest in this matter for some time past and that, if he had a free hand, this Bill might have been introduced a considerable time ago.  I welcome the Bill particularly as it does a measure of justice to the lower-paid classes of State persons, inasmuch as it removes the abatement in the case of salaries up to £250.  We take that as an admission that, in those cases, it is wrong to make any abatement of pensions.  The same principle should apply to all salaries and I can see no reason why the abatement should not be removed altogether.  I have a feeling that that is what the Minister would like to do.  The word that appeals to me most in this Schedule is the word &ldquo;Nil&rdquo; and I suggest that if that word were repeated right to the end, we would be doing justice all round.  There seems to be no reason why a man employed in the State service should have abated the pension given to him for his service to his country.</P>
      <P>I would recommend the Minister to clear up the point regarding the word &ldquo;allowance&rdquo; and to make clear what is meant by it.  A civil servant may get travelling expenses, which might be taken into account in determining the abatement of his pension.  The suggestion that the remuneration should be calculated by reference to the basic salary seems to be a good one and I think the Minister might consider it on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill also, from the point of view of the men with a 3/6 pension, who will benefit. I knew cases where men had 6/- as unemployment assistance and when they got 6/- as an I.R.A. pension they were debarred from signing for the assistance.  The Bill is long overdue. There may be some people who are in very privileged positions and who never will suffer, such as members of the Dáil.  They can draw their pensions <Col N="342" /> and salaries or allowances and are safe, but the workman who has a small pension for his service to the country and then a means test put against him is being wronged.  That test should never have been introduced by any Government, when we hear so much talk about the fight for freedom and the sacrifices that were made. Workers took a prominent part in the fight for freedom and I would be inclined to think the workers suffered the most.  When compensation is being paid, the claims of these men should get first consideration because they were the first to suffer.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, but I believe the Minister could go further.  I am of the opinion that there should be no means test in cases where men are receiving small pensions.  These are the men who need everything they can get, because they have small wages as well as small pensions.  We should give every consideration to the cases of men who have not received pensions although they served the country well.  They were turned down by the Government as being persons to whom the Act did not apply.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the case put forward by Deputy Coogan when he suggested that there should not be a means test in cases where men are in receipt of small pensions. I earnestly appeal to the Minister to remove the means test in these cases. There are men who are receiving small pensions and they are debarred from receiving unemployment assistance.  I have in mind the case of one man who gave good national service.  He is drawing a certain salary, out of which £250 should be allowed in respect of income-tax and travelling expenses, but in the Army authorities' reckoning for abatement purposes they do not allow him that £250.  They charge him on the gross amount and they thus deprive him of getting a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister should make every effort to remove such anomalies. Various suggestions have been put forward by Deputies and he should accept them.  If not, I can see that as time goes on we will still have <Col N="343" /> grievances in connection with Army pensions.  I suggest that the time is now opportune to remove the grievances and anomalies that have existed through the years and the Minister should endeavour to give those who rendered service to the country the benefits to which they are entitled.</P>

      <P>A number of Deputies who have spoken on this Bill have spoken in the usual rather generous manner to which we are accustomed. Deputy O'Higgins, in the course of his speech, said that if it were left to a free vote of the House, Deputies would undoubtedly agree to a complete list of abatements rather than a restricted one.  I daresay that is perfectly true. The House, in my experience, is always prepared to be generous in respect of the handing out of money just as, on the other hand, it is always prepared to criticise what has sometimes been described as spendthrift expenditure. We cannot have it both ways and we should try to consider when these suggestions are being made that there are two sides to all these questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that I have met this case very fairly; in fact, I think I have gone as far as I was asked to go by the United Conference of the old I.R.A. organisations.  But Deputies, apparently, are not satisfied with what these associations have put up to me as something that they would regard as reasonable.  I think I can say without exaggeration that I have been even a little more generous than the United Conference asked me to be.  That being so, I do not think that the House can grumble very much in respect of the measure which I am introducing.  If my memory serves me correctly, I think I would be right in saying that when these appeals were made to me some 18 months ago no one suggested the complete wiping out of this Schedule, I will not be dogmatic in that connection, but I believe that that <Col N="344" /> was the general opinion &mdash; that we should bring some form of relief to the lower-paid pensioners.  I believe I have acceded to that request and I can assure the House that this measure which I have introduced is the limit to which the Government is prepared to go.</P>
    <P>I do not see that it is necessary for me to discuss this measure at any great length.  I shall endeavour to answer as far as I possibly can the questions that were put to me.  Deputy O'Higgins talked about equity and justice.  I would like to remind the Deputy that equity and justice existed from 1924 to 1934, just as it exists now, and I am not aware that Deputy O'Higgins or any of his colleagues expended any very great energy in attempting to bring relief such as I am bringing now.  Why he stresses that equity and justice demand that this should be done now and it should not have been done before, rather surprises me.</P>
    <P>As regards disability pensions, it is true to say that they are not abated, but if the individual who is in receipt of a disability pension is also in receipt of a military service pension, the military pension is abated in some small measure in conformity with the Schedule.  It was the House decided that&mdash;I did not decide it; the House passed that, it is the law, and I have to administer it as such.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keyes was anxious to know something about the numbers of people who would be involved in the abatements. There are 25 cases of people with over £1,000 a year who will not be affected.  The total number of persons who will benefit by complete abatement is 2,004 and these will benefit to the extent of £10,751.  There are then varying figures: 316 cases who will benefit at the lower scale, 10 per cent.; 197, 15 per cent.; 114 20 per cent.; 107, 25 per cent.; 58, 30 per cent.; and 51 at 40 per cent.  The assessments are based on the total amount.  I think Deputy Coogan was anxious to know this.  It is on the cheque received by the individual that the abatement is made, and out-of-pocket expenses are not taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="345" /> Deputy Allen said he would like something to be done in respect of those men who are not benefiting in the same manner as the 1916 men.  At present, as the House is aware, 1916 men &mdash; those who are incapacitated and unable to earn a living &mdash; are receiving certain sums of money to the amount of, I think, £78 or £98 a year, with some allowances for children.  I hope in the near future to be able to bring about a similar state of affairs in respect of the men of the later period, that is, men who would be referred to as having taken part in the Black and Tan campaign.  The matter referred to by Deputy Everett is one he should take up with the Minister for Industry and Commerce rather than with me.</P>

      <P>This is one of my dreams which I hope will become a reality.  Having been reared in the heart of Tipperary, but having lived for a long time in this city, I did not know the drudgery which lack of water meant, and if there was one thing more than another which drove me into public life it was this question of a water supply.  The need for water is pretty well known.  I suppose air is the first essential, but men on hunger strike have lived on water for months, so I suppose water is the second essential. You cannot live without air and water certainly comes next.</P>
      <P>Every Deputy here will approach this matter from a national point of view, but each of them will naturally relate it to the area he knows best, his native county.  We in Tipperary have more water than any county in Ireland. We have more counties around us than any other county, and if you make this water survey a regional matter, it will defeat itself, because county boundaries will enter into it and make it unworkable.  I therefore suggest a national survey, although regional schemes are certainly very good.  It seems that in Tipperary, as in many parts of Ireland, we are pretty much like the ancient mariner whom Coleridge described.  We have water everywhere and never a drop to drink.</P>
      <P>Water is supplied principally from the mountains but a good deal comes from the plains.  We have a good number of mountains in Tipperary &mdash; the Galtees, the Knockmealdowns, Slievenamon, Slieve Bloom and Keeper Hill.  We have as much water in Tipperary as would supply almost the seven neighbouring counties as well as our own and those neighbouring counties have perhaps streams equally as good.  In the wilds of the forest, the first thing an animal bearing young or becoming sick does is to go where water is available, and you will find the same thing on farms.  We are blessed with both plains and mountains in Tipperary and we have the best water in Ireland in Tiobraid Árainn, from which all-Ireland hurling winners came thrice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Between Cahir and Cashel we have <Col N="347" /> 100 well springs or streams.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows well the new road in that area between Cahir and Rockwell.  The people travel a distance of five miles to get drinking water at these wells.  The water from the streams flows into the River Suir, into what I may describe as a stink pot.  I hope that my national survey will help to remove that.  You have a population of 5,000 people in Thurles. The first thing that strikes your eye there is that, into the River Suir, which rises in the Slieve Bloom mountains, you have the sewerage of the beet factory flowing.  The river wends its way southwards towards the village of Golden which is also very badly off for water.  The same is true of Cahir, with a population of 1,500 people, as well as of Ardfinnan.  In Clonmel, with a population of 5,000, you have the sewerage of the fever hospital going into the Suir.  In view of that, is it not terrible to think that the people in Thurles and Clonmel have to depend on the Suir for their drinking water?  I suggest that the rivers of Ireland were never meant to be sewers for towns.  The way that I would put it is, that the water from our mountain streams and rivers was meant, first of all, to be conserved for the use of human beings, and, secondly, for animals, but not to be used as sewers for towns.  The cities of Sheffield and Birmingham have a population of approximately 2,000,000 each.  I believe there is a small river, the Don, near Sheffield.  I suppose that 200 or 300 years ago both cities were mere hamlets, with perhaps 6,000 or 8,000 people in each.  Sheffield, through the development of the cutlery industry, and Birmingham, with its iron industries, have now populations of 2,000,000 each.  In the two cities you have as many people as we have in the whole of Ireland.  Both have the finest high-pressure water supplies in the world, developed from the Welsh mountains.</P>
    <P>In my native area we have water everywhere, and yet there is no pure drinking water available between Cahir and Clogheen, except that provided privately through the benevolence of a <Col N="348" /> local magnate.  It is not unusual to see ten or 15 cars at day-break waiting to get a supply from this private source for domestic use.  They come there at an early hour in the morning to fill their barrels.  About five miles from Clogheen, which is mentioned in the Life of St. Declan, there is a supply of pure water for about 200 families. It appears that when the son of the pagan chief there accepted the Faith, the saint struck a rock and since then there has been a supply of water available, so that he did more than baptise the son of the chief.  The people, however, have to travel five miles to avail of that supply.  Not far away, we have two streams running down the mountainside, but by the time the water has passed through the first farm it has become polluted, due to the fact that cattle have access to it.  By the time it reaches the valley it is anything but pure.  On one of these streams you have 25 families living.  About 300 yards from the central town in the valley you have a school which is attended by about 80 pupils.  A sample of that water was taken about 31 years ago and sent to the late Sir Charles Cameron for analysis.  He certified that it was not fit for human consumption.  We have a natural stream supplying the town of Cahir.  The water there is not fit for human consumption.  Because of that I venture to suggest that during the last 25 years many of the residents have contracted disease and died.  I suggest it is time that we took control of our rivers and wells.  The artificial stream that was put down by three landlords near Thomastown Castle, where Father Mathew was born, serves a very good purpose.  When the land was bought from them by the Land Commission, these landlords left £60 a year to have the stream looked after. I admit that these artificial streams serve a very good purpose, but a supply of piped water would be very much better and safer.  The present Gárda barracks, as well as the old R.I.C. barracks between Cahir and Clogheen, get their supply of water from St. Kieran's well which is situated about four miles away.  The water is brought there by a contractor.  That contract was made at the time that the R.I.C. <Col N="349" /> was established by Sir Robert Peel. Some better method than that should be devised for supplying the people with a pure supply of water.</P>
    <P>Since this matter was first mooted in this House, about two years ago, it was taken up in England by Lord Beaverbrook, the powerful newspaper magnate, and the Labour Party there.  That was long before the Labour Party had any notion that they would become the Government in that country.  Thanks, however, to the driving power which Lord Beaverbrook was able to exercise through his widespread chain of newspapers, a survey was made as a result of which it is now estimated that an expenditure of £25,500,000 would put water into every rural home in England, Wales and Scotland.  The estimate for England and Wales was £18,000,000 and £7,500,000 for Scotland. In area, Scotland would more closely resemble this country than either of the other two.  I used to be fairly good at mathematics when I was at school, and if we take it that a round sum of £8,000,000 would supply every rural home in Ireland with a pure water supply, the annual cost of the scheme, at 5 per cent. on that capital expenditude, would be £400,000 a year.  Assuming that we have 400,000 farm houses in Ireland, the annual charge on each would be £1 a year.  That is what I estimate it would cost to provide them with a pure water supply.  These are the sort of figures that appeal to me.</P>
    <P>I remember during a little campaign about last March 12 months I was going around South Tipperary, and in about 12 miles of country I counted 12 water barrels on their way to and from the river.  They were all bringing filth out of the River Suir for animals to drink.  The drudgery of it is fearful. Take an agricultural labourer's wage &mdash; £104 a year.  It is nothing to write home to mother about, but if he spends a quarter of a day drawing water, that amounts to £26 a year.  If you take the wear and tear of the horse and cart and the harness and barrel &mdash; again quoting figures, like scripture, to suit my purpose &mdash; I think £26 a year would be a very small amount to calculate. That is £52 a year or £1 a week.  That is a very long way in advance of the £1 <Col N="350" /> a year that I suggested to the Minister. There is quite a big margin.  However, as the showman says: &ldquo;You pays your money and you takes your choice&rdquo;, but that there is great room for a remarkable saving there is beyond yea or nay and the need for it is undoubted. May I quote from a debate we had here in May, 1945?  This is a kind of foundling, a pet child of mine.  The Minister, Dr. Ryan, hauled me over the coals and said I claimed great credit for it.  Speaking at that time in May, 1945 &mdash; I was not in the House at the time; I was on my way to Tipperary on the night mail as there was a little election on there in which I was interested &mdash; the Minister, Dr. Ryan, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is another matter about which we should be clear.  There is no use in any Deputy saying that he advocated water, electricity, and so on, being brought into the farmers' houses, and claiming credit when that is being accomplished.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Not guilty, my lord.  The Minister continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is not a question of who first advocated such schemes.  I am sure we all agree that the farmers should have the same amenities as the townsmen, and it does not matter who first asked for these amenities. We are aiming at the provision of water for the farms, but the first step towards that is rural electrification. When electricity is brought to every farmer's house, then the water will follow, because where a farmer has not got water at present he will then have the electric power to bring the water to his farm, and after that, naturally, will follow proper sanitation.  At the same time, I do not see why we should not try to do something about putting in proper stoves, cooking facilities, and so on, in farmers' houses.  We should aim &mdash; and I am sure that every Deputy of any Party in this House will agree &mdash;at having the country house just as well equipped as the city house, so that the farmer will have proper lighting, heating, hot and cold water, proper sanitation and so on&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="351" /> Now here is the snag:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash; so that if a girl has to make a choice between marrying a farmer and settling down in the country, or settling down in the city, she shall at least have the same amenities in the country as in the town or city.  Naturally, it will take a long time to achieve that, but I know we should be able to reach the point.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Our women folk are the finest in the world.  They are second to none.  I am sure you will all agree with me that they are glorious.  I may be a bit of a romanticist; and all I have to do is to look in the mirror to know that no girl would bother about me, but if I took a fancy to a girl I would marry her, if she would have me, before a princess on her throne.  But some of the modern girls have become gold diggers.  Last week an interview with a young lady who had got a windfall of about £25,000 was published.  She was from the Minister's country.  She had all the attributes that I mentioned to you.  She was modest &mdash; a lovely girl. She remained three weeks in her position in England; the Sweep did not turn her head.  Then she came home to help her family.  Was not that grand?  She would do everything she could for them.  When asked by the local scribe: &ldquo;What are your ideas on matrimony&rdquo;?  she said: &ldquo;Well, I will not marry a farmer anyway.&rdquo;  God save Ireland; the Jews can look after themselves.  I will make no comment on that.  I quite agree with the Minister that we should try to make the amenities equal.  It is a pity we did not take her down Jones's Road to see our lads from Tipperary playing Kilkenny in the hurling final, or perhaps if she saw Roscommon playing Cavan she might change her mind.  I will leave it at that.</P>
    <P>I forgot to mention that the sewage of those cities, Sheffield and Birmingham, is treated with septic tanks.  I see Deputy Loughman here smiling.  He should appreciate what I say.  He is not one of the city fathers in Clonmel, but he is a very eminent citizen.  I think I am right in saying that our corporation in Clonmel, as well as our <Col N="352" /> county council, are very advanced.  I hope I am not boastful.  They have applied for a scheme costing £30,000 when this emergency is over, with a view to putting the river right, because building is extending to the southern part of the town and the river is glutted with filth and dirt.  At the lower end of the town on a hot summer's day it is not very nice.  They have the idea of the septic tanks.  Our county council are behind this water scheme with us, and they have sent around what is popularly known as a snowball resolution.  It was sent to the various county councils, and I think a good number of them replied in favour of it.  When I first proposed this at the county council in Clonmel I brought a hornet's nest around my ears.  I had a fan mail that a film star would envy.  I suppose I had hundreds of letters in regard to that particular thing, simple as it seemed.  The purport of the letters was: &ldquo;We are doing very well as we are and everything is lovely in the garden.&rdquo;  I made inquiries and I found that each of them had a very decent supply of water and that some of them had pumps in the yard.  I do not think that money can be obtained to sink pumps at the moment.  If proper catchments or reservoirs were made at the source &mdash; these streams of the Suir must have about half a dozen tributaries which rise in the mountains &mdash; they would serve a great many people. Piped water supplies could be laid from them and artificial streams might be made here and there to serve other families.  Without a piped water supply, you will not have water fit for human consumption.  Pumps are another means by which water could be supplied but I do not think that the Land Commission give grants for the erection of pumps at present.  Pump sinking is more than an adventure.  There are parts of my county in which a fair number of persons have pumps at 20 feet but I have known others who had to sink to 300 feet.  I have no geological or hydraulic knowledge but I think that if you were to go 60 feet or 70 feet you would get water in most cases.  If one had to sink to 300 feet, it would ruin him.  Where a gravitation supply could not be arranged, pumps <Col N="353" /> might be provided and water obtained at a depth representing the average of the figures which I have quoted.</P>
    <P>The repair of pumps is left to the county council, which has 80 or 100 pumps to attend to.  The pump service should be nationalised in the same way as the telegraph service.  Brinsley MacNamara in the <i>Valley of the Squinting Windows</i> is somewhat sarcastic on the subject of pumps.  When the son of a farmer made an improvident marriage, his relatives got themselves elected as guardians and obtained for him the task of sinking a pump which gave anything but water. He never looked back after that, according to the book.  I do not subscribe to that but I do know that pumps in my area are relics of hydraulic inefficiency.  However, revolutions were hatched in the country over those pumps, so they served a purpose.  About five miles from where I live, a man asked me to go down a bit of a road with him.  I went down about 30 yards and was then within 100 yards of the Suir at Mooncoin.  He pumped and pumped and the water came out yellow.  Then, it turned blue and green and when he had about 5 barrels pumped it became crystal.  He was working for 25 minutes by my watch and he brought that water home for domestic use.  The Parliamentary Secretary has had a great deal to say about tuberculosis.  He has done his job well but I think that impure water is one of the causes of tuberculosis. On one occasion the Parliamentary Secretary pulled me up over a statement which I made.  When arguing with a professional man, the odds are against one.  We have a great medical officer of health in Clonmel, Dr. Naughton.  His report contains many references to petitions for the erection of pumps.  He says &ldquo;a number of petitions for the erection of public pumps were received and investigated during the year.  Suitable recommendations for the erection of pumps were made where it was considered that such were necessary, having regard to the existing water supply, population of areas, etc.  In addition, recommendations were made regarding repairs to a number of existing <Col N="354" /> public pumps.  These repairs were carried out in all cases.&rdquo;  I have my doubts about that.  There are quite a number of them idle and they are, as I have said, relics of hydraulic inefficiency. They were erected by the guardians and the science of hydraulics must have advanced a great deal since then.</P>

      <P>From the report of Dr. Naughton, medical officer for Tipperary South Riding.  The towns and villages here are given most attention. A Deputy who is medical officer of health referred to sporadic outbreaks of diphtheria in his county. Whether those would be due to bad water, it is not for me to say.  In my area, a young bull which would have made £400, a first prizewinner in a three-county show, made only 40 guineas because he would not pass the tuberculosis test.  He had been drinking from a foetid stream.  There was not a drop of pure water on the farm of the man who owned him and he had to go two miles for water.  I am not a philanthropist but I have a gravitation water supply which about 20 families avail themselves of.  When the pipes became corroded some time ago, they did not say that they would subscribe to the cost of repair.  However, the custom was an old one and one must do as those who went before him did.  I know people have to travel a mile and cross five ditches with their buckets in order to obtain a supply of water.  I have seen them working up to 10 o'clock at night at a threshing and then driving their cattle a mile off to give them a drink.  With all the earnestness at my command I commend this motion to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  It is universally admitted that a pure water supply is essential in every part of the country.  During the past few years we have been extending water supplies over large areas.  There are very few villages which have not an efficient supply, but places that have been overlooked have to be catered for in the post-war period.  They are earmarked <Col N="355" /> for development in schemes that have been prepared by local authorities.  In many rural areas, however, practically nothing has been done in this regard by the State.  Speaking for farmers I can say that they provide a water supply by sinking wells.  Very little has been done for them in that way by the State.  Attempts have been made by local authorities to provide water in housing schemes for cottage dwellers in rural areas.  Most of these attempts consist of the erection of public pumps, and anybody who has the misfortune to be a member of an elected body knows what a source of worry they are.  There is never a meeting of a board of health without a list of &ldquo;sick&rdquo; pumps that require attention. It seems to be a problem that cannot be solved to get these public pumps to function satisfactorily.  I do not think that public pumps erected to serve a number of houses have given satisfaction, because these pumps are never attended to.  They are everybody's property and are probably ill-used. That may be the main reason why they prove defective.</P>
      <P>In urban areas we have endeavoured to provide facilities for bringing water into the houses of everybody who is prepared to avail of it, and in a position to pay for it.  I do not think anybody would advocate that the State should install water in all houses in rural areas, but it should, at least, go so far as to bring the water into the yards or adjacent to dwelling houses. It is not easy to estimate what a scheme of the kind would cost.  Every rural dweller would not need a supply, as some places are more seriously affected by a shortage of water than others.  I represent a constituency in which we have apparently adequate supplies of water.  There is not a county in Ireland where more streams and rivers rush down from the mountains than in County Wicklow. Nevertheless, there are hundreds of rural dwellers, even in County Wicklow, who have to travel long distances to obtain water for domestic use and for their live stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was intrigued by the reference made by the proposer of the motion to <Col N="356" /> the method adopted by Saint Patrick to provide water.  Apparently the saint secured water by dividing a rock.  I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary is long enough in public life to have developed sufficient sanctity to be able to repeat that miracle.  He is, therefore, up against a big problem, but one which will have to be faced.  Great Britain is facing up to it in a businesslike way.  When considering the question of the cost, we have to take into account the cost of the existing methods.  There is the time and labour involved in carting water in barrels. There is the loss of live stock through lack of water, because there is always a shortage during a drought.  The most serious point of all, of course, is the injury to the health of the people.  It is not only essential that the State should take steps to provide water in rural areas, but should also take steps to ensure that it is pure, and does not convey any disease.  I think it is necessary that the mineral content of water should be examined.  In certain districts we know that, due to minerals in water, there are some ailments and diseases prevalent amongst the human population.  Goitre, for example, and others, are frequently attributed to such causes.  I do not know whether disease is caused by the mineral content or by a deficiency of minerals but it is due to the kind of water available in some districts.  I saw it suggested in the House of Lords, in connection with the development of water supplies in Great Britain, that the utilisation of what is known as spring water or subterranean water should not be developed as intensely as was the case in the past.  The case made was that that supply would be exhausted. I never thought that could happen.  I was under the impression that spring water percolates from the surface in some way.  I may have been wrong. The problem is a big one but the Parliamentary Secretary should tackle it.  We are developing electrification and seeking to bring to rural dwellers the amenities provided for people in the towns, such as light and power. We are linking that up under a national scheme.  We know that it would cost more to link up rural <Col N="357" /> dwellers and to provide them with electric current than in towns, but we should also undertake the important work of arterial drainage, which must be linked up closely with water supplies. In a big drainage scheme we must provide water for an entire area. It would be impossible to do that, or to carry out arterial drainage without considering the position of the catchment areas.</P>
    <P>In this connection also, I may mention that very important work is being carried out in my constituency, and particularly in the adjoining constituency of Kildare, in regard to the Liffey Reservoir. There we have a provision made for power development on an immense scale and also for the provision of water to the City of Dublin, but linked up with that we find that the local authorities in Kildare are developing a local water supply for a portion of the rural dwellers in North Kildare.  That is a very desirable thing.  It is very important and desirable that in connection with national works such as that, they should be linked up with local schemes with a view to getting the best results from them.  It is very desirable that there should be some sort of co-ordination of that kind in connection with the various national schemes.  I know that at the present time the Department of Local Government and Public Health are making a big effort to induce the local authorities to abandon what is known as local charges for rates for such schemes as water supply, and so on, and to make them county-at-large charges in every county. I also know that a number of counties are fighting against that on the ground that it would impose upon the rural dwellers the cost of providing amenities for the cities and towns, but I think there would be no objection whatever to making those local charges county-at-large charges, if all the rural dwellers were to derive this advantage in regard to a water supply.</P>
    <P>Now, as I say, there are many counties in which we have a considerable water supply of various kinds for rural dwellers &mdash; there are wells, and so on, on a great many farms, or very <Col N="358" /> convenient to them.  Deputy O'Donnell referred to the fact that some counties did not support the motion proposed by Tipperary for a national water supply for rural areas.  Well, I happen to know why some counties did not support it.  I know that in regard to one particular county it had been raining for six weeks before the motion came on, and the natural anxiety there was to prevent an extra water supply. Those things, of course, will happen, but I think that nobody will disagree with the contention that it is a great hardship on rural dwellers, and particularly the women in rural districts, to have to carry water for long distances. References have been made to areas where one has to carry water a very long distance &mdash; sometimes two or three miles &mdash; along the roads.  I should think that such cases would be rare, but in most counties there is a number of farmers' houses where the water has to be carried 200 or 300 yards from the nearest well.  That, undoubtedly, is a hardship, and something should be done to mitigate it.  I am quite sure that the people who would benefit from this would be quite willing to contribute their share of the cost, but they will expect the State to contribute its share also.  I might also say that in connection with various other schemes, such as arterial drainage, electrical power, water supply, and so on, we would expect that the capital expenditure required &mdash; whether it be £6,000,000 or £7,000,000 &mdash; would be raised at a nominal rate of interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHeskin" hpid="Mr. Heskin Mr. Heskin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting this motion, I agree that everything possible should be done to provide an adequate water supply for our community, and I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary, as well as every Deputy in the House, will agree that an adequate water supply is very necessary, not alone from the point of view of household needs, but from the point of view of the health of our people and for agricultural production. From the viewpoint of our people's health, I think that every effort should be made by the Department of Local <Col N="359" /> Government and Public Health to see that an adequate water supply is provided. In the area where I lived up to a few months ago we enjoyed a public water supply, and it was only when I left that area that I realised the difficulties people had to encounter in order to provide a sufficient supply of water for their households and for production, generally, on the land.  In the particular area where I am at the moment &mdash; Deerpark, Lismore &mdash; I know of cases where people have to travel over two miles to get a supply of water, and the poor in that locality, such as farm labourers, have to depend on the farmers, generally, to cart the water from one to two miles for ordinary household uses.  In cases of that kind I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that a general survey should be made by each county. I am sure that the cost of such a survey would not be too much, in view of the fact that you have an engineering staff attached to each board of health, and these officials could make the survey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be the duty of the Minister, in cases where supplies of water are not available, to make every effort to provide a supply of water. We, who are members of local bodies, have deputations coming before us from time to time, seeking for a water supply, and we make every effort to make recommendations, but, at the present moment, nothing can be done, particularly in view of the scarcity of adequate material for the conveyance of water, and so on.  We have promised, in many cases, to give such schemes prior consideration after the emergency, but the question of the cost of financing such schemes may arise.  I would suggest that in such cases, where local authorities are prepared to undertake schemes of that kind, the Minister should make a substantial contribution, and also that where loans are made to local authorities they will be at a very low rate of interest so that the cost to the ratepayers of a water supply will not be too high.  I know of areas where they would be prepared to pay any amount of money in order to get an adequate water supply, but if loans <Col N="360" /> are to be made, then, as I have said, they should be at a very low rate of interest.</P>
    <P>At the present moment you have public health authorities trying to cope with tuberculosis, and in that connection an adequate supply of pure water is very essential.  We know that very many diseases are due to bad water supplies, and we also know that applications have been made to local authorities to sink even small wells. In country districts where cattle and horses have access to such places, it is very injurious to the public health generally.  I think that the Local Government Department should take steps to provide proper protection for such water supplies to ensure that they are kept pure for human consumption.</P>
    <P>It would also help towards the provision of adequate water supplies for farmers if the Minister for Agriculture were to agree that the erection of pumps could be included in farm improvements schemes.  I discussed this matter with the Minister some time ago and he told me that the difficulty at the time was to ascertain costings in regard to the sinking of pumps.  The provision of adequate water supplies is most essential to all forms of agricultural production &mdash; the production of milk and dairy produce and the rearing of live stock generally. It would be a great asset to the agricultural community if adequate supplies of water for animal and human consumption were provided throughout the length and breadth of the country.  I suggest, therefore, that a survey should be made of the country for this purpose and that an honest attempt would be made to cope with the situation.  If such attempts were made it would meet with the demand put forward in this motion and would eventually lead to the provision of adequate water supplies throughout the whole of rural Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is one, I am sure, with which every Deputy in the House can agree in principle.  There is no doubt that adequate supplies of pure water are essential for the health of the people, apart from anything else.  It would appear from what we <Col N="361" /> heard from Deputy O'Donnell that Tipperary of all counties in Ireland is an unfortunate exception.  It would strike one, listening to the Deputy, that the local authorities in that county have not done their duty in the past or Tipperary would not be in the position in which we are told it is at the moment.  I think it was announced 12 or 18 months ago that it would be part of the Government's post-war policy of reconstruction to provide rural dwellers, not alone with electricity, but also with adequate water supplies.  The Government announced that quite a long time ago. I speak subject to correction but I think it was announced here in this House.  That is a good sound scheme and I thoroughly agree with it.  Anyone living in a rural area knows what a good water supply means to farmers and rural dwellers generally.  The people living in towns and large villages, who were fortunate enough to have water supplies provided for them at the public expense in the past, scarcely appreciate what a great boon they enjoy.  I know some villages and towns where such supplies were provided and where the people struck against the payments of a nominal rent of 10/- or 15/- for the water supplied to them.  They refused to pay 10/- or 15/- a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also know that local authorities had it in their power in the past &mdash; they have it in their power at the moment also &mdash; to provide rural areas with water supplies whether that involved the erection of a pump, the sinking of an enclosed well or the provision of a pipe supply.  Many local authorities throughout the country have spent large sums of money in that way. Deputy Heskin suggested that the State should contribute towards the cost of these schemes.  I can tell him that the State did contribute as much as 40 per cent. towards the provision of supplies, whether for rural or urban areas.  There were, however, many local authorities who did not take advantage of the help that was offered to them.  I am associated with a local authority and I am sure that we have as many as 500 pumps in our area.  We have also a large number of pipe schemes.  We did not wait until this <Col N="362" /> hour of the day to think of these schemes; we made a great effort for the last 25 years.  We have been progressively providing water supplies in rural areas wherever there was need for them and have put through a large number of pipe water schemes too. They are working quite satisfactorily under a system of county-at-large charges.  As I say, we did not wait until this hour of the day.  We have had them in operation for the last 15 or 25 years.  Every public water supply in the area is a county-at-large charge; there is no such thing as district charges.  We may not be any more progressive than local authorities in other counties but such improvements have been consistently carried out for at least the last 15 years and the cost is levied as a county-at-large charge, just in the same way as housing.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell complains that things are very bad in Tipperary.  I suppose they are or he would not so frequently complain of them, but the local authority there have it in their own hands to improve matters.  There is no use in blaming the Minister or the Government for something the local authority neglected to carry out. I hope the day is not far distant when the State will assist local authorities by providing portion of the funds necessary to have pipe supplies all over the country, but it is a big job &mdash; a much bigger job even than the provision of an electricity supply.  It is something to aim at anyhow, something at which we hope the Government will aim, but it is going to cost the ratepayers a huge amount of money.  Many local authorities could have taken more energetic steps in the past when grants were available.</P>
    <P>I think the Farm Improvements Scheme does make provision for the labour content in the sinking of a pump.  Actually I know a case where a farmer got a grant under the scheme for the sinking of a pump, but the labour content in such work is generally small.  The big cost of the sinking of a pump is represented by the capital charge of providing the pump and the linings.  I admit that the grant is not adequate where it is necessary to have deep boring and <Col N="363" /> where one may encounter rock.  The ideal solution would be pipe lines to supply big areas in all parts of the country, but even in the pre-emergency days such a scheme would cost a huge amount of money.  It would run into millions to carry out such a scheme all over the country.  A scheme of that kind is not going to come in a hurry but, in the interval, local authorities could do far more than they have been doing in providing water supplies.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary will agree in principle with this motion and that he will tell us that it will be his policy in future to encourage local authorities to provide the people with adequate water supplies. That has always been the policy of the Department; they did not need any encouragement in that direction. The Minister has been impressing on local authorities over many years the importance of providing such supplies. The county health authorities, the county medical officers of health in their reports, have, every one of them, year in, year out, drawn attention to the necessity for proper water supplies because, as they pointed out, most of the fever epidemics that take place all over the country can be traced to impure water.  Farmers and people living in rural areas have just as much need of proper water supplies as people living in towns.  I am sure more water is available in this country, whether in rivers, lakes or springs scattered here and there, than in any country in the world.  This country is more favoured in that respect than any other country in Europe.  It is a matter of utilising the resources at our disposal.  Local authorities in certain counties are providing for the needs of the majority of rural dwellers, for whom they have built cottages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>In a general way I agree with Deputy O'Donnell's motion, but I do not quite see the necessity for the national survey that he has suggested because I imagine the public health officials could supply all the information required about the water requirements of every area in their particular counties.  I imagine, also, <Col N="364" /> that the county engineers have already made surveys of the water resources of the areas in their counties most in need of water.  Everybody, of course, will agree that a pure water supply is indispensable to good health and good living in any community.  We all realise perfectly that there are areas in this country that are very badly handicapped by not having a supply of pure water, especially during the summer. I know that in Sligo &mdash; and the same is true of many other counties &mdash; farmers, both large and small, have to draw water many miles during the whole of the summer and the greater part of the autumn.  Admittedly, the public health authorities have done a great deal in the provision of water supplies. They have certainly provided a good deal of money for that purpose, but much of that money has been squandered because very often the procedure they followed was to engage a water diviner who would proceed to the district where there was an inadequate supply and would there try to locate a spring.  The water diviner would decide on a certain point and the county engineer would satisfy himself in his own way that water might be obtained in that particular place and would start boring operations.  I know of many cases where, notwithstanding that borings were carried out to a great depth, the supply of water obtained was almost negligible.  I read recently in some scientific magazine that during the war some more modern and more scientific method has been discovered of locating water.  If that is so, I hope that method will be resorted to in this country so as to obviate a great deal of the extravagance and waste that take place in trying to locate spring wells and water supplies in various counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also suggest to the Minister that some regulation should be made about the protection of wells, especially spring wells.  It is quite a usual thing to see the walls surrounding a well broken down and the refuse from the adjoining roadway or adjoining field flowing freely into the well.  In some cases there may be no protecting walls around the well; the surface of the well <Col N="365" /> may be level with the road and the refuse from the road and from the adjoining field flows freely into it. That certainly cannot be healthy and there is danger that it will cause disease.</P>
    <P>I notice from the reports of many county medical officers of health that stress is laid on the fact that there is an increase in the incidence of diphtheria in certain counties.  I do not know whether that is general or not but I know that it is true of many counties.  I do not know whether the absence of a good water supply in some areas has anything to do with it or not but I would imagine that a pure water supply would help in counteracting diphtheria and other diseases.</P>
    <P>The provision of a water supply in every county should be a matter for the local authority assisted, in a suitable financial way, by the Department of Local Government.  Conditions vary in counties and the local people know their own counties and know where the need for a water supply is greatest.  I think the present arrangements are working out in a reasonably satisfactory way and I believe they would work out more satisfactorily if more encouragement were given by the Department of Local Government.  I would not be prepared to agree with Deputy O'Donnell that the provision of water should be taken over and controlled by the Government.  The Government, probably, is controlling far too much already and I would not like to hand over the water, as well as the land, of this country to the Government.  I think it would be much more sensible to encourage local authorities to devote more time, at all events, to the provision of a water supply in the areas over which they have control.  It is absolutely essential that that should be done because, judging from one's own experience, there are certain types of disease that are more prevalent in areas where there is not an adequate supply of suitable water than in areas where there is an adequate supply.</P>

      <P>I hope that is not general.  That may happen in Tipperary but I thought the Deputy said that they are a very happy people in Tipperary who live happily together. In any event, I still think that the problem of the supply of pure drinking water, for man and beast, is a matter mainly for the local authorities, with the active assistance and co-operation of the Department of Local Government. I think much more could be done in that matter if the Department of Local Government were prepared to give much more financial assistance than they have given in the past.</P>
      <P>I would suggest, therefore, to the Minister that new rules and regulations should be made for the purpose of protecting spring wells in various parts of the country because I imagine that some of these wells are in a very unhealthy condition at the present time which makes them a source of disease.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there will be general agreement with the object of the motion, as indicated by Deputy O'Donnell.  While I agree with Deputy Allen that progress has been made and that there has been a very praiseworthy effort on the part of local authorities to improve a deplorable condition, much leeway still remains to be made up.  Tipperary is not the only county that would appear to be suffering from lack of pure water and I would hope that, with the characteristic generosity of the Tipperary people, when their position has improved, they will allow some of their surplus water to flow into County Limerick.  I am sure Deputy O'Donnell will see to that, so that County Limerick will not be left without a pure water supply.  While the scheme contemplated would be a colossal one, I think the general survey suggested would be the most economic approach to it, if it should be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good deal has been done by the local authorities but their methods have been spasmodic.  If they had the advantage of a general survey they could conduct their water schemes for various villages and small towns on more economic lines.  I have seen cases where wells were tapped which, after a short period, failed to yield the amount <Col N="367" /> of water expected and other wells had to be tapped to supplement the supply. Quite recently, there have been recurring outbreaks of typhoid in Patrick's Well, County Limerick, which should be as healthy as any spot in Ireland. For several years past there has been a great outcry that there is no water supply.  The local authority did all they possibly could.  They tapped a particular place only to find that the water was not of a suitable character and, in the meantime, the villagers are waiting for a supply, in constant dread of a recurrence of an epidemic.  The county manager and the local county council are at their wits' end and they do not know whether or not they will have to go to a river some miles away to provide water for the village in the absence of a suitable well in the vicinity.  I know another place in the same county adjacent to Tipperary where seven or eight families have to travel, not a couple of hundred yards, but considerably over half a mile and cross the main railway line from Dublin to Cork to get water, which they can get only in a well through the grace and good will of a farmer who allows them to trespass on his land. That ought to be remedied by the sinking of a pump but, for what reason I do not know, the county council have not up to this sunk a pump for these people or given them any sort of water supply.  I could give other instances in that area in the Golden Vale around Knocklong where people are very badly handicapped for want of a water supply.</P>
    <P>We are all agreed that a pure water supply is essential for the health and convenience of the rural population. If it is to be provided and the efforts which are being made are to be speeded up, I think a survey of the type suggested in the motion would be an incentive to the local authorities and a spur from the Local Government Department to urge them to greater efforts.  Whatever co-operation could be given by the Local Government Department should be given to speed up the realisation of this ideal.  As Deputy Allen pointed out, there is abundant water available in the country and, if a proper survey were <Col N="368" /> made, it would be a great help to local authorities in dealing with the matter. Up to now there have been only spasmodic efforts made.  If a village makes a clamant demand for a water supply it gets it, while another village may be left without it.  I think it is a national question that ought to be dealt with. I think the motion is not untimely and that a start should be made.</P>
    <P>It will be a long time before you have the necessary materials to carry out a scheme of the magnitude contemplated, but I think a survey ought to be undertaken by the engineers of the Local Government Department in conjunction with the engineers of the local authorities.  Between them, a scheme could be hammered out on a coordinated basis which would ensure, when the materials would be available, that an adequate water supply will be provided.  The finance will have to be provided from somewhere.  It would be costly, but it would be spread over very large areas.  We will have to pay something to put electricity into rural dwellings, which will be a great boon, and whatever the cost of this would be, the people are of opinion that we ought to have a pure water supply.  I think we ought to take the initial steps in any case by having a survey made and see what is the most economic way of approaching it; whether we ought to tap rivers or mountain lakes, and what is the biggest area that can be served by a particular reservoir.  That would be more economic in the long run than having each public authority trying to deal with their own little problems as they arise from time to time, which would eventually cost more and give less satisfaction to the people as a whole.</P>

    <P>When lands and estates are divided, if the Land Commission would group together the houses of the people who are allotted the land it would go a long way to deal with this question of water supply and electricity.  Under the system of farming we have here, the <Col N="369" /> farm houses are all a distance apart. Where houses exist already on homesteads, I suggest that the sinking of wells and pumps should be included in the farm improvement grants.  That would be one way of dealing with the question.  These grants might be supplemented by a small grant from the county council.  I have known roads to be made by a combination of farmers under a farm improvement grant.  The same thing could be done so far as the water supply is concerned. These are the two suggestions I make on this motion: that the houses should be grouped together so far as possible when estates are divided and that the farm improvement grants should be made available for schemes for the provision of fresh water.</P>

      <P>Few of the speeches that have been made on this motion have, in fact, been very closely related to it.  The motion is:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Eireann is of opinion that immediate steps should be taken by the Government to obtain a survey of the water resources of Éire with a view to the provision of an adequate supply of pure water to every rural dwelling in the country.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Many Deputies talked about the desirability of having a survey of our water resources, but the motion does not end there.  If we are to have a survey, that survey is to be &ldquo;with a view to the provision of an adequate supply of pure water to every rural dwelling in the country.&rdquo;  That ideal, in Deputy O'Donnell's own words, has been the dream of his life.  Speaking quite honestly to the House and to the Deputy who is particularly interested in this matter, I believe it must remain a dream.  I do not think it is possible to provide an adequate supply of pure water to every rural dwelling in the country.  I do not think it is physically possible; I do not think that it is financially possible; and I am pretty sure that an adequate water supply to every dwelling in rural Ireland is not immediately available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cogan, I think, realised that the full terms of this motion did <Col N="370" /> not represent practical politics, because he reminded the House that a water supply was not required for every rural dwelling.  Of course it is not.  For a very big proportion of rural dwellings it is not required, for the simple reason that they have got an adequate water supply already, not a piped water supply, but an adequate supply of wholesome water.  I think there will be no disagreement as to the purity and wholesomeness of spring water; and, indeed, the purity of the water supply that is available in many dwellings in rural Ireland is of a much higher standard than the purity of the water supply that is available in urban areas and in larger centres of population.  Unfortunately, all rural dwellings were not built with particular advertence to the need for a pure and adequate water supply.  If there is not water within the reach of the house, Deputy O'Donnell in his dream hopes that we may be able at some time to supply it by a piped system.  Now, water will not flow up a hill, and, if the house is up the side of a mountain, how are we going to get the water up to it?  As Deputy Kennedy has pointed out, our houses in rural Ireland have been scattered over the countryside, some of them up near the top of the hill, some of them half-way up and some of them at the back of it, and however desirable it may be, and however attractive the dream may be &mdash; and I should like to see it come true, if it were possible &mdash; I think we may as well face the reality of the situation and admit that a piped water supply to every rural dwelling in this country is not a feasible proposition.</P>

      <P>In our consideration of this question, we should also advert to the progress that has been made in the past 20 years.  Excluding the smaller schemes, the pumps and small supplies that cost under £1,000, 475 piped water supplies have been provided since 1922.  It is true that the position was very primitive prior to 1922 and I need not take up the time of the House in dwelling on the historical reasons for that position.  As to <Col N="371" /> the expenditure on the provision of water and sewerage in the past 23 years, between 1922 and 1932, £1,800,000 was expended, and between 1932 and 1945 £3,970,140 was expended, making a total of £5,770,140 expended on water supplies since our institutions of government were set up in this country.  It is a very big sum and it represents a serious effort to deal with this matter, the importance of which is not questioned by anybody and the particular importance of which, from the point of view of public health, has a special appeal for me. The figures I have quoted excluded small schemes under £1,000.  If we included them, the expenditure on water schemes would amount to approximately £6,000,000.</P>
      <P>I will be told, I presume, that these schemes have operated, in the main, in the bigger centres of population. That is so.  The problem is more urgent in our urban centres, in our towns and villages, than it is in rural Ireland.  Consequently, the policy is as far as possible to provide proper water and sewerage systems in our towns and villages and, when we have done that, if we live to see the day &mdash; and I hope we shall &mdash; to extend as far as it is feasible into the rural parts.</P>
      <P>There are many considerations on which I need not dwell in any detail that govern the provision of a water supply, whether it be in rural Ireland or in our towns.  The geological formation, the incidence of rivers and springs and the locations of dwellings are matters which will operate, taken together, to preclude the possibility of reaching the ideal Deputy O'Donnell has in mind.  It would be reasonable to assume that, if and when cheap electrical power becomes available in Ireland, it will be within our reach to supply water to some rural dwellers, if the source of an adequate supply is available &mdash; but that is a long distance ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much could be done by giving more attention to our springs and sources of supply, and to the proper protection of our wells.  The Deputies who talked about the contamination of wells &mdash; I think Deputy Martin Roddy <Col N="372" /> was one of them &mdash; were getting close to realities.  Our wells in rural Ireland, though the source of supply may be good, though the spring itself may be pure, are undoubtedly subject to contamination through the carelessness of the owners.  But again, as Deputy Allen and other Deputies have pointed out, the local authority is already armed with adequate power to deal with that situation.  In fact, if we have not made more headway in the provision of satisfactory water supplies in rural Ireland, I think a share of the criticism ought to be levelled at the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, I want to tell the House &mdash; and especially to convey to Deputy O'Donnell, who is so interested in this matter &mdash; that the Department has been fully alive to the need for a survey of resources.  As Deputies will appreciate, such a survey cannot be carried out in a year or two, but must extend over a considerable period, when gaugings have to be taken in very dry seasons, when the water is at its lowest, and in very wet seasons when it is at its highest.  As far back as 30th May, 1944, the following letter was issued to each county engineer and each county health engineer, and a similar letter was issued to each town surveyor.  The letter is dated 30th May, 1944, and headed &ldquo;Water Supplies&rdquo;, and is as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A number of schemes for the water supply to towns, villages and districts in your area have been submitted to the Minister in the form of preliminary reports and estimates. In many cases, alternative supply sources are mentioned.  There are also a certain number of schemes in a very advanced stage of preparation which have been held up through lack of constructional material.  It is essential that reliable information regarding the quantity of water available at each source should be obtained before any of these proposals can be approved.  The lack of information regarding the yield of springs, streams and rivers in very dry periods has been deplored frequently in the past in connection with water supply proposals and <Col N="373" /> many cases examined have had to be delayed until reliable low-flow figures had been obtained.  This year has been very dry so far and, if existing conditions continue, all sources of supply will be tested very severely. The chance of obtaining minimum yields should not be missed.  Will you please make the necessary arrangements as soon as possible to establish gauges on each source of supply?  These gauges should be read frequently and regularly, until there is no doubt whatever that wet weather conditions prevail again. Such gauging stations should be established on all sources proposed as possible supply sources or possibly to be used in the future as supply sources for towns, etc., not included so far in any list of proposals submitted to the Minister.  It would also be desirable to obtain the gaugings for existing sources of supply, whenever possible.  It is realised that many of you are extremely busy on turf production, but it is felt that the importance of this matter merits the time you will have to give to it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think the House will agree that, so far as the question of gauging supplies and carrying out a survey is concerned, we are not losing any time in dealing with it, as far as it is possible to deal with it.  As I have said, we all would be very happy to see a piped water supply to every rural dwelling in this country, or failing a piped water supply, to ensure that each rural dwelling has a good spring water supply within a very short distance of it &mdash; which would probably be the next best solution. We would be glad to see that, but I do not think we can achieve a piped water supply.  However, as far as it is possible, by encouraging the local authorities, we shall endeavour to secure at any rate that the wells are better looked after, and, where there are spring wells, that they are properly protected, and that every effort will be made to ensure that this essential commodity for the maintenance of health will be available to the people.</P>

I could not accept the implications of that, because it is not possible to achieve it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points with which I should like to deal; the Parliamentary Secretary and those who spoke to the motion reminded me of them.  You have three schemes before you.  You have the arterial drainage scheme, which is a very laudable thing.  You have the rural electrification scheme, which is equally needed.  Then there is the need for a pure water supply.  I think these schemes are as indissolubly bound as the Siamese Twins.  If you take a vote among the farmers at the moment &mdash; the farmers who have not a supply of water &mdash; I believe they would vote for water as against electricity. I studied your Rural Electrification Act &mdash; that comes under your control.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but under the Parliamentary Secretary's.  I think it is on page 60 of the Rural Electrification Act that you could pump your water from the nearest well, which might be four or five miles away.  I <Col N="375" /> believe that if it came to a vote, the farmers would vote for the dip candle and paraffin oil as against any electricity scheme.  Give the farmers water; they do not want electricity. The three schemes should go together hand-in-hand.  Go on with your Rural Electrification Act.  I remember 20 years ago, when the Shannon scheme was put forward.  It came in for strictures and was referred to as a white elephant.  I thought it was a white elephant at the time, but I now take off my hat to the man who initiated the Shannon scheme, because it saved this country; we would be bankrupt only for it.</P>
      <P>At the same time, I believe that if we continue to harness the rivers of Ireland in order to generate electricity, and keep the farmers without a supply of pure water, posterity will have something to say to it.  It was Boyle Roche who asked: &ldquo;What has posterity done for us?&rdquo; I will not be here to hear what posterity will have to say to us.  You will get your water supply from the catchment areas, from the wells and the lowlands, at the foot of the mountains.  If you harness the rivers for the purpose of electrification schemes you will be doing a sorry day's work, because you will leave the farmers without an adequate water supply.  That is my version.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These schemes are bound together and if you go on with one without testing the others it will be like cutting off a leg to cure a corn.  It will be a false move to harness the rivers.  I was not here when the Minister made a statement, but he did not seem to me to put it clearly &mdash; I read it in the Debates afterwards.  He said that when we use the rivers for the purpose of generating electricity they are not eating up the water.  My suggestion is that if you use the rivers in that way you will not have an adequate supply of pure water for the farmers. <Col N="376" /> I suggest that the three schemes should be examined.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has been very sympathetic and I am grateful to him.  You are making a survey in some places.  The two other schemes are passed.  You are not doing a good day's work, because the three schemes should go hand in hand. Here is a Deputy with two years' experience suggesting that the Government has done wrong by passing two Acts, the Rural Electrification Act and the Arterial Drainage Act.  The water you are taking away under the arterial drainage scheme will interfere with the springs and reservoirs that should be used in order to supply the farmers with pure water.  It is a case of young men, a young Government, in a hurry. Have a survey made and let the three schemes go together.</P>
