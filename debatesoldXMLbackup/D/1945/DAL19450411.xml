      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware that considerable confusion exists by reason of the fact that the portion of Ireland under the jurisdiction of the Oireachtas is known by the same title as the entire national territory; and, if so, if he will introduce legislation amending the Constitution to give this portion of Ireland a distinctive title.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that confusion exists by reason of the terms of Article 4 of the Constitution relating to the name of the State.</P>
      <P>The provisions of this Article were adopted after careful consideration in Dáil Éireann and, in fact, are the result of an amendment of the original text of the draft Constitution.  I am not prepared to introduce legislation with a view to amending the Constitution in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that it is quite obvious that to describe one portion of Ireland by the same name as the entire State does make for confusion?  Would it not suggest itself to the Taoiseach that one way out of the difficulty would be to revert to the original name of the Twenty-Six Counties, the Irish Free State?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he is aware that, since the introduction of the new income-tax code in Britain (known as the &ldquo;pay-as-you-earn income-tax&rdquo;), considerable hardship has been inflicted on Irish migratory labourers because they are assessed under this code, and many of them have a large part of their money deducted from them; and, if so, if he will state what is the position of these workers in relation to the 1926 agreement entered into between the Government of the Irish Free State and the British Government; and if he will consider attaching to the permits of such migrants an explanatory form setting out their position with regard to income-tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that, under the British Pay-as-You-Earn Income-Tax Scheme, which came into operation on the 6th April, 1944, employers in Great Britain are bound to deduct British income-tax from the wages of all workers who are in receipt of earnings exceeding the exemption limit, but that, generally, if an Irish worker is in Great Britain or the Six Counties for less than six months in a particular financial year, he is entitled, under the Residence Agreement of 1926, to claim repayment of the whole of the British income-tax deducted from his wages for that year.</P>
      <P>The position in this regard is explained in a leaflet given by the British authorities to workers going to Great Britain for employment.  It is not regarded as necessary, therefore, to incorporate the same information in the explanatory leaflets that we ourselves distribute when issuing and renewing Travel Permit Cards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware of the very acute shortage of woollen thread in County Mayo; that many retailers are having their quota of wool converted into machine-made goods (e.g., socks and pullovers) and selling them at an exorbitant price, thereby depriving the housewife of the means of making home-made woollen goods; and that it is impossible to purchase any white wool, which is causing great anxiety to expectant mothers; and, if so, if he will state what measures he intends to take to ensure reasonable supplies through out the county.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there is a general shortage of hand-knitting yarn though I have no information which would indicate that the shortage is more acute in Mayo than it is elsewhere.  Production of white and coloured yarns has been substantially increased and the shortage is due mainly to the exceptionally heavy demand.  A further increase in the supply could be obtained only at the expense of cloth and hosiery production in factories and workshops, but I do not consider it would be in the public interest to adopt this means of increasing the output of hand-knitting yarn.  No complaint has previously been made to me that traders are <Col N="1771" /> using supplies of yarn to have them converted into made-up garments for sale at excessive prices.  The matter will, however, be fully investigated if the Deputy will furnish sufficient particulars to enable an investigation to be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy's question relates to the British Lodging Allowance Scheme.</P>
      <P>Under this scheme lodging allowances are paid to workers in Great Britain who have been transferred from their home area to employment in certain industries, provided that the workers establish to the satisfaction of the British Ministry of Labour and National Service that, prior to their transfer, they were the main support of their homes and continue to maintain their homes in the area from which they were transferred.  In December, 1941, the British authorities agreed to extend the benefits of this scheme to Irish citizens who went to employment in Great Britain since June, 1940, on the same basis as applicable to British workers.  To enable this decision to be implemented, the British Ministry of Labour and National Service sought the assistance of my Department in the matter of the transmission of certain particulars supplied by dependents here in support of our workers' claims for these allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1772" /> The co-operation of the Gárdaí is sought by my Department as a matter of convenience in establishing the position of dependency claims where the claimant's home is too great a distance from the local office to warrant direct clearance.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the shortage of skilled agricultural labour is due partly to emigration; and, if so, if he will take steps to prevent emigration by the unified development of all our natural resources and secure full employment at adequate family wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The information available to me does not indicate that there is a general shortage of skilled agricultural labour.  The emigration of experienced agricultural and turf workers resident or normally resident in the tillage areas has been prohibited since early in 1942 and this restriction was extended in June last to all remaining rural areas.  Under the harvest labour scheme, which was introduced last year for the purpose of providing from the congested or scheduled areas of the western counties an adequate supply of labour to meet any shortage of local labour for harvesting in the tillage areas, from a pool of some 1,650 experienced agricultural workers who volunteered, a total of 391 only was asked for by farmers throughout the country; 3 farmers in the whole of County Galway applied for a total of 3 men under the scheme.</P>
      <P>I am not clear what the Deputy means by the unified development of natural resources.  The Government does not contemplate any departure from the present system of individual ownership of agricultural land.  The development of national resources and productive potentialities is and always has been a main aim of Government policy.</P>

Compensation for loss of effects and wages is normally a matter for settlement between the crew and the owners of the vessel.  According to my information, the ship was owned by <Col N="1774" /> the Green Isle Shipping Company, 9 Lower O'Connell Street, Dublin, and at the time of the stranding she carried a crew of seven (including the master).  Any question of guarantee is one for arrangement at the time of engagement between the master, on behalf of the owners, and the crew.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimated average daily consumption of milk in the area referred to is 44,000 gallons.  The supply comes mainly from registered producers and the average quantity supplied by such producers is approximately 39,000 gallons per day.  A certain quantity of milk is obtained from creameries all the year round and from other creameries specially licensed during the winter periods when the supply in the production area falls. The average daily quantity supplied by creameries is nearly 5,000 gallons.  All the milk obtained from the creameries is pasteurised locally.  No experiments have actually been carried out in this country to test the nutritional value of pasteurised milk as compared with whole milk, but from the evidence available of the results of such experiments in other countries there is no significant difference in nutritive value between the two types of milk.  In some cases the advantage is shown to <Col N="1779" /> rest with raw milk and in others with pasteurised milk.  Any differences in results of tests were, however, of no statistical significance.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that the average consumption of milk at a half-pint per head constitutes a danger to national health; that experiments have proved that an adequate milk diet for growing children has effected a great increase in height and weight, and in the case of both children and adults an increased resistance to disease; if he is further aware that tuberculosis publicity over-emphasising the prevalence of tuberculosis in cattle, and the danger of drinking milk except from tuberculin-tested cows has created such uneasiness that milk is now regarded not as a complete food but as a potential poison; and, if so, if he will consider safeguarding the health of the people by ensuring that every growing child will receive a quart and every adult a pint of milk daily; and if he will issue a public statement that tuberculosis of the udder in cows is so low that the danger of infection is infinitesimal compared with the real danger of the inadequate consumption of milk, especially among the poorer classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Recognising the great value of milk in human dietary, the Government in recent years provided special grants for the supply of milk. An annual grant of £90,000 is available for the distribution of free milk by local bodies to necessitous children. There is also provision to the extent of about £240,000 for free milk under the food allowances scheme administered by the Department of Industry and Commerce which covers recipients of unemployment assistance with dependents, persons in receipt of widows' and orphans' pensions, old age pensions and pensions for the blind in urban areas.  Milk also forms part of the school meals in urban areas, and school meals in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1780" /> Under the free milk scheme, the daily allowance is generally 1 pint per child, or 1½ pints for two children, or 2 pints for three children: Great value is derived by the children from the milk supplied under this scheme. Under the food allowances scheme, the provision of milk for dependents is at the rate of 3½ pints a week.</P>
    <P>As regards the latter part of the question in which reference is made to the danger of drinking milk except from tuberculin-tested cows, I would point out that it is estimated that only a small proportion of cattle, which are infected with tuberculosis, excrete tubercle bacilli with their milk, and it is an offence under the Milk and Dairies Act, 1935, and the Bovine Tuberculosis Order, 1926, to sell such milk.  The average risk of infection from such milk is not very great where the milk from an individual cow or small herd is concerned but the risk is greatly increased where the milk of several herds is mixed together.  Efficient pasteurisation or sterilisation is necessary to render infected milk safe for human consumption.  If milk is not pasteurised it can be rendered absolutely safe by being brought to boiling point and all ordinary milk used for human consumption and as a children's food should be so treated.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to advert to the responsibility of the producer in this matter.  It should be the aim of every producer to comply with the requirements of the Milk and Dairies Act, 1935, and regulations thereunder in relation to the production of clean and wholesome milk and to take all reasonable steps to eradicate tuberculosis from his herd.</P>

      <P>The estate of Neal, Longmore and Dering, County Galway, was vested in the Congested Districts Board on 25th March, 1915.  It is a big estate, <Col N="1787" /> comprising over 11,000 acres, situated in a large number of townlands.  A substantial portion of the estate was revested in the tenants many years ago.  The residue taken over by the Land Commission on the dissolution of the board in 1923 (including the townland of Cloonen) has reached the stage of having been scheduled for resale to the tenants&mdash;that is to say, the necessary improvement works thereon have been completed.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy will be good enough to let the Land Commission have specific particulars of the bog roads, passages and drains he mentions as still requiring attention, inquiries will be made.  Without such particulars it is not practicable to identify the matters in question. Every effort is now being made to complete the resale of this and other old estates of the former Congested Districts Board.</P>

I am also aware that it was the policy of the Government and of the Minister's Department that when these holdings became vacant&mdash;there is no heir to them&mdash;they should be divided amongst the tenants in the local area. Now the Department is allowing them to be purchased, and in that way is helping to maintain congestion in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The reason for this Bill is to be found in the fact that a Presidential election is due to take place this year, and this election should be completed not later than June 24th next.  The Constitution provides that the process of electing a new President shall not be initiated before the 60th day prior to the date upon which the current Presidential term expires.  The Constitution also provides that the election of the President shall be regulated by law and the statute by which this is done is the Presidential Elections Act, 1937.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1792" /> Under Section 6 of that Act the Minister for Local Government is bound to make an Order appointing, among other things, the last day for receiving nominations, the last day upon which a candidate who has been nominated may withdraw his candidature, and the day upon which a poll, should such be necessary, must be taken.</P>
    <P>Should it be necessary to have a poll in order to elect the successor to our present President, then, for reasons to which I shall refer later, we must, I think, as a matter of prudence, fix the day for taking it not later than June 20th.</P>
    <P>Now, it happens that in accordance with the existing law the elections for the local authorities must take place this year, and under Sections 5 and 6 of the Local Elections Act, 1927, it is provided that these elections shall take place not earlier than the 23rd June and not later than the 1st day of July.</P>
    <P>This, accordingly, is the position. The poll for the Presidential election must take place over the whole country on a day not later than June 20th.  On the other hand, except in one or two districts where special circumstances may obtain, the local elections are due to take place throughout the country in the period between the 22nd June and the 2nd July, that is, within a very few days of the date upon which the Presidential poll may have to be taken.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows that elections in general do occasion some dislocation of the ordinary life of the community. It may be that sort of dislocation which by reason of the excitement and public interest which elections engender is not unwelcome, and is certainly not unhealthy.  But most people would say that elections, whether welcome or not, because of this dislocation, should be avoided and should not be permitted to recur at too frequent intervals.  Accordingly, when we have the Presidential election and the local elections falling within such a short interval of time as, perhaps, three to ten days, most people would say that the reasonable and sensible thing to do would be to arrange that these elections would take place on the <Col N="1793" /> same day.  It is to meet that point of view, a point of view which I am sure will be that of the ordinary, practical businessman and citizen, that this Bill is introduced.</P>
    <P>It may not, of course, be necessary to avail of the powers which the Bill proposes to confer.  That will depend on whether or not more than one candidate having been nominated more than one still remains in nomination when the time fixed for withdrawals has expired.  Should only one candidate remain nominated, it will not be necessary to invoke the powers which the Bill provides for, Part II of the Act will not come into operation, and the local elections will be held, in the normal way, on such dates between the 22nd June and July 2nd, as may be fixed by the appropriate local authorities under Sections 5 and 6 of the Local Elections Act, 1927. On the other hand should more than one candidate remain in nomination when the time for withdrawals has elapsed, then it will become necessary to take a poll for the election to the Presidency under Sections 12 and 20 of the Presidential Elections Act, 1937. In that case Part II of the measure will come into operation and under Section 5 thereof the polling at the local elections will take place on the same day as the poll for the Presidential election.  It will be seen, therefore, that in these circumstances the date of the local elections will be determined by the date fixed for the Presidential poll.</P>
    <P>We, accordingly, come to examine what considerations must be taken into account in fixing the day for the Presidential poll.  The primary conditions governing an election to the office of President are laid down in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Under sub-section 3º of Section 3 of Article 12 it is prescribed that an election to the office of President shall not be held earlier than the 60th day before the expiration of the term of office of the President.  As our present President's term of office will not in the normal course expire until midnight on June 24th of this year, an election for the Presidential office <Col N="1794" /> cannot be held on a date earlier than the 25th April.</P>
    <P>The process of electing a President begins when the days for fulfilling the various essential steps in the procedure are appointed.  These days are the days for receiving nominations for the office, for withdrawing such nominations, and for taking a poll, should such be necessary.  Such days are appointed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health by an Order made under sub-section (1) of Section 6 of the Presidential Elections Act, 1937.</P>
    <P>In conformity with this provision of the Constitution, sub-section (3) of the same section of the Act of 1937 provides that the Order in question &ldquo;shall be made on or as soon as conveniently may be after the 60th day before the expiration of the term of office of the outgoing President&rdquo;, that is, in the present instance, on or as soon as may be after the 26th April, 1945.</P>
    <P>Before that date the Minister can do nothing, whether under the Constitution or under the Presidential Elections Act, to set the process of election in motion.</P>
    <P>The next provision of the Constitution which must be adverted to by the Minister when appointing the specified days is Section 7 of Article 12.  This section prescribes that the new &ldquo;President shall enter upon his office on the day following the expiration of the term of office of his predecessor or as soon as may be thereafter&rdquo;.  It is obvious from this that, in appointing the day for the taking of a poll, should such be necessary, at a Presidential election, the Minister must endeavour to ensure, while taking all relevant circumstances into consideration, that the counting of the votes will be completed, and the result of the Presidential election announced, in due time to allow the new President to comply with the spirit of the Constitution, by entering upon his office on the day following the expiration of the term of office of the outgoing President.</P>
    <P>With this consideration in mind my opinion is that in the event of a simple election, that is one in which there <Col N="1795" /> would not be more than two candidates, June 20th is the latest date that in prudence might be fixed for the taking of a poll.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if there are likely to be more than two candidates, then, so as to be on the safe side, it would be wise to advance the date of the poll by some days to June 15th.  These dates, June 20th and June 15th, represent the very latest dates which, in the circumstances I have mentioned, could, with advertence to the requirements of the Constitution, be fixed for polling.</P>
    <P>There is, however, another consideration which would suggest that the date should be as late in June as may be.  We all wish the elections, whether Presidential or local, to be held on the new register which will come into force on the 1st June.  It is desirable that those who may be engaged in the elections, or concerned with the conduct of them, should have as long a period as may be after that date to take whatever action may be required of them, or whatever steps they may think necessary or desirable to advance the particular interests which they have in view.</P>
    <P>Therefore the day of the poll should be fixed as soon as possible to the limiting dates I have given.  I have every reason to believe that the new register will be available to all concerned at the usual time in every area. In Dublin, indeed, I have caused inquiries to be made which indicates that the work of preparing it is well in advance of schedule.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, while admittedly the last possible day should be appointed for the elections, I have no reason to believe that any interest will suffer if the date of the local elections is advanced from within the last week to within the last fortnight or so, in June.  Therefore, I cannot see that the public interest or public convenience is going to suffer if, instead of holding local elections as they might be held, on June 23rd, we arrange to have them held on June 20th or June 15th.</P>
    <P>When we have decided what day is <Col N="1796" /> to be appointed for taking the Presidential poll, should such be necessary, the appointment of the other days is a comparatively simple matter.</P>
    <P>For reasons which I think I need not state, because I am sure they will occur to everybody, it is desirable to allow more time between the final settlement of the nominations for the Presidential election and the taking of the poll therefor, than is customary in the case of a Parliamentary or local election.</P>
    <P>It is likewise desirable to allow a longer period to a person who has been nominated as a candidate for Presidency to consider whether he will persevere in his candidature or not. And it is finally desirable to give as ample notice as possible of the appointed days.</P>
    <P>Accordingly I think I should say now that the necessary.  Order appointing these days is likely to be made on the 26th of this month; that the last day for receiving nominations will be one of the days from 12th to 15th May inclusive: that the last day for withdrawals will be from the 17th to 20th May inclusive; and that polling, if necessary, will be fixed for either June 15th or June 20th, probably the former, unless I have very strong reasons to believe that there will not be more than two candidates.</P>
    <P>To come now to the several provisions in the Bill.  Sections 1 and 2 require no comment.  Section 3 I have already referred to.  It specifies the circumstances under which Part II, which embodies the remaining ten sections of the Bill, comes into operation. Section 4 declares that the Act will apply only to the elections in 1945.  In the normal course the Presidential and local elections will not come to be held within the same month in any year until 21 years hence.  Furthermore, we have no reason to believe that certain difficulties such, for instance, as paragraph (f) of Section 13 is intended to provide against, would arise at a future date and necessitate some of the provisions which are embodied in this Bill.  Therefore, I do not think it advisable to make this Bill a permanent measure to apply to any other <Col N="1797" /> elections, except those held this year. Twenty years from now the circumstances may be quite different.  The method of electing local authorities and of electing the President may be then quite different, so that I do not think it is necessary for us to pretend to such foresight as would cover whatever circumstances might exist at that date.  Section 5 modifies the Local Elections Act, 1927, by fixing the poll at a local election to be the day for the poll at the Presidential election instead of the day appointed by the county council, between the 23rd June and the 1st July.  Section 6 adapts Section 20 of the Presidential Elections Act, 1937, by making the administrative county or county borough, instead of the Dáil constituency, for the purpose of the Presidential election. As the House is aware the Presidential Election Act provides that the poll for the election of the President shall be taken by constituencies.  This Bill proposes to make the whole administrative area of a county council or county borough the constituency for the purpose of conducting the Presidential poll.</P>
    <P>Under Section 5 also the county registrar or under-sheriff, as the case may be, is appointed the local returning officer for the purposes of the Presidential election.  The House no doubt is aware that, under the Act of 1937, the returning officer for the purpose of the Presidential election is appointed under the Act, but that all the county registrars and those functionaries who act as returning officers in the case of Parliamentary elections would act as local returning officers responsible to the returning officer for the proper conduct of the Presidential election in their constituencies.  Under this section it is proposed to make those who would normally be the returning officers in the case of the Presidential election returning officers, not only for the purpose of the Presidential election, but also returning officers for the purpose of conducting the poll in the case of the local authority elections.  Now the reason for this is that it is essential that the constituency be the same for each election in order to <Col N="1798" /> avoid confusion in the arrangements for the poll and in the collection of the ballot boxes and the counting of the votes.  This adaptation also involves the preparation of a postal voters' list, arranged according to each local electoral area, and the necessary provisions to that end will be found in sub-section (2) of Section 6.</P>
    <P>Section 7 authorises the issue to a member of the L.S.F. of a certificate enabling him to vote at a different place in the county electoral area from that at which he would otherwise vote if he were not engaged on duties connected with the election.  The House is aware of the provision under which persons who are engaged in the conduct of elections, like presiding officers, poll clerks and so on, may vote in the place in which they are officiating.  It was found at the Elections of 1943 and 1944 that members of the L.S.F. were on duty in places other than those in which they would normally vote and thus did not have an opportunity to vote at all.  This section is intended to give them an opportunity of voting at this election.</P>
    <P>Section 8 extends the obligation to preserve the secrecy of the voting to all agents present at the polling or counting, whether on behalf of the Presidential or the local election candidates. It is assumed that it may be necessary in certain areas to conduct the poll for the Presidential and the local elections within the one booth and therefore every person present inside that booth must be bound to secrecy, whether he is there on behalf of a candidate for the Presidency or there on behalf of a candidate for the local authority.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides that if separate ballot boxes are provided a ballot paper will not be invalidated by being placed in the wrong ballot box.  It is the intention, if possible, to provide separate ballot boxes, but owing to stringency in the supply of materials, materials which may be required for another purpose, it may not be possible to provide seperate boxes in every area.  Therefore, it may be necessary to allow all the papers to be inserted in the one box.  On the other hand, if separate ballot boxes are provided <Col N="1799" /> within the same booth for the purpose of conducting the Presidential and the local election, then this section provides that, if by any mischance a ballot paper finds its way into the wrong box, the vote will not be invalid because of that fact.</P>
    <P>Section 10 places the polls for both the Presidential election and the local elections under the sole jurisdiction of the local Presidential returning officer. The duties of a returning officer in relation to the poll are such that a division of authority between two or three officers would be impracticable, but at the same time it may be assumed that there will be a complete co-operation between the returning officers concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 11 authorises the expenses incurred in taking the joint poll to be charged and paid as part of the expenses incurred in the conduct of the Presidential election.  In so far, however, as these charges include expenses which would otherwise be paid by the local authority, the charges will be apportioned.  A similar provision I may say was made in former days where county and rural district councillors were elected on the same day.</P>
    <P>Section 12 is consequential on Section 11.  The scale to be prescribed under this section for the local government elections will not include the expense of taking the poll since that expense will be paid and recovered under the provisions of Section 11.</P>
    <P>Section 13 confers on the Minister for Local Government and Public Health power to make such regulations as may be necessary to give effect to the Act, including the issue of a polling card in respect of the Presidential election to each Dáil elector, and the other matters mentioned in the succeeding paragraphs.</P>
    <P>That is the purport and these are the general provisions of the measure now before the House.  The issue which is really involved in this is whether, should a poll fall to be taken in relation to the election for the Presidency, bearing in mind that that poll must be taken within a very few days of the period prescribed by the statute within which the local elections <Col N="1800" /> must be held, we shall make such provision as will enable these elections to take place on the one day and whether that would be to the general convenience of the public and whether it would be in the public interest.  I submit that it would be to the general convenience of the public and that there is nothing contrary to the public interest in holding these elections on the one day.  I submit, therefore, that it is only a rational and reasonable thing to make provision and to ask for the powers that are contemplated in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the normal way we would not see anything incongruous in having the election for the local bodies and the election for the Uachtarán on the same day.  The election for the local authorities would normally mean the election of local citizens, undertaken in the democratic spirit on which our Constitution is founded, to act as representatives for the people, to look after their local problems, and to devote their energies, intelligence and co-operation with one another to dealing with these matters. The office of Uachtarán, as we understand it, though very little was said about it when the Constitution was being put through and the office being created, suggests as it were a noble spire to the general edifice of citizenship in this country.  In normal circumstances, therefore, I would see nothing incongruous in the elections taking place on the same day.  Furthermore, in the emergency period, when there is a shortage of material, there would be nothing incongruous in putting the voting papers into the same box.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there is an aspect of these elections that requires further and wider comment.  We happen to be holding an election for the Presidency and an election for local authorities at a time when, if we read the events in Europe and in the world generally, the cloud of war is likely soon to be passing away from us.  During the emergency period, there was a danger to our food supply on the one hand and to our security on the other hand.  Our people, one and all, were appealed to by all Parties to do their best to secure <Col N="1801" /> the necessary supplies of food in the country; every man and every woman in a position to do so was asked to step in and do the best possible to provide food.  From every party, every class, and every creed, the young men and young women were brought together, by a joint appeal from all Parties in this House in 1940, to provide the necessary defence forces and rescue services, to enable us either to ward off any military danger that might threaten us or to deal with any casualties that might arise as a result of the was reaching us here.</P>
    <P>In the spirit of our Constitution and in the natural state of things, this sovereign and independent State had to have its work done by the ordinary men and the ordinary women.  Those who came together to do that work, by providing those services, had an opportunity to see how necessary it was to have a fine spirit of citizenship. In creating a machinery to defend their sovereign and independent country, they developed that spirit of citizenship.  They were looking forward to the day when the war clouds would pass and when the work of standing together in military defence and of doing military training for that defence would be over so that they might then devote themselves, in the spirit of new-found citizenship, to the carrying on of the ordinary work of the country.</P>
    <P>It is at that particular moment that, in circumstances that normally might be happy ones, our country is facing this election, and we have to look after our local election on the one hand and, on the other hand, to elect to the position of Uachtarán a person who will represent citizenship here. But our great national mistake-makers could not let another opportunity pass of making a great national mistake.  They are following the tradition which we might have hoped would have been broken and dropped, as a result of their experiences here and particularly seeing what can happen in other countries when the purely Party spirit is allowed to aggrandise itself into calling itself the nation.  Not learning from that, it has now been declared that the Government <Col N="1802" /> Party intends to use all the power and force it has, to see that nothing shall be recognised as national in offering itself to do a citizen's duty, unless it bears the Fianna Fáil label.</P>

      <P>I intend to keep to the things which it is appropriate to discuss on this measure.  I feel in rather a difficulty when you, Sir, say that we may not discuss Government policy in regard to local elections. However, I shall leave the question of the local elections for the moment, and turn to the Presidential election.  The Minister has indicated that part of his trouble in telling the House certain things in regard to specific dates for the Presidential election is that he does not know whether there are going to be two, three or more candidates&mdash; that he does not know what will be the number of candidates.  Well, now, the Government's line, apparently, is to endeavour to exclude anybody except a Fianna Fáil Party nominee being nominated for the Presidential election.</P>

      <P>I suggest to the Minister that whether this kind of thing is due to his insolence or his incompetence, he ought to allow this House to do its business without imposing one or the other upon it.  We are dealing with serious matters here. We are dealing with matters that may very easily effect the whole trend of our people's fortunes in this country. We are dealing with a deliberate attempt to establish a one-Party State here and to make use of the coming Presidential election and the local elections in order to endeavour to secure that.  We have a Government here that has a very strong Party majority in the House.  There is no legislation which the Government may wish to pass here that it has not the power to pass or that it will not have power to pass next year or the year after.  It can extend the parliamentary life of this House up to, I think, the year 1951.  It has the Emergency Powers Act, which it can probably hold in being, through its Party majority in this House, until the end of the life of the present Parliament. Under these powers it can stifle the expression of opinion in the country; it can suppress statements of fact in the Press; it can suppress statements of opinion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit, Sir, that this is an attempt to confuse the people by running the local elections and the Presidential election on the same date and, by doing so, to infuse into the whole atmosphere of these elections a narrow, Party, pseudonationalistic spirit, in order to prevent the mind of the people working in a proper way and giving us the type of councils which this country wants.  I want to expose the attitude of the Government in connection with that.  I want to see that this House is given an opportunity of expressing its mind on that, and that if it cannot satisfy itself that the Government are not chargeable with what I suggest they are chargeable with, they will at any rate divide the Presidential election from the local elections.  Our local authorities have very important work to do at the present moment. Their constructive work is six years behind-hand.  Such works as drainage, sanitation, housing, and many other types of work, which our local authorities have to undertake, are six years behind-hand as a result of the outbreak of this war.  Even before the war, they were under serious difficulties enough owing to the expenditure forced upon them as a result of the Government's policy since 1932. Their expenditure rose, year after year, from 1932, until it was a couple of million pounds higher at the outbreak of the war than it was in 1932. Accordingly, the difficulties under which they were labouring in 1939 were bad enough without having put down on top of them the arrears of work which have piled up on them <Col N="1807" /> during the six years of war, not to speak of the increased cost which has fallen on them during those six years.</P>
      <P>We want the best, the keenest, and the most public-spirited brains in the country in our local authorities at the present time, and the intention of the Government, apart altogether from their expressed intentions from platforms throughout the country, in associating the Presidential election with these local elections is, as I say, to introduce a narrow, bitter, pseudonationalistic spirit, labelled Fianna Fáil, in the hope that they may be able to blind the people and influence them to put the wrong type of people into local bodies simply because the edict goes forward that nobody can be national unless he bears the Fianna Fáil label.  We stand, absolutely and strongly, against the introduction of purely Party politics into local administration.  Unless the ordinary spirit of citizenship in this country is given an opportunity to grow and to thrive&mdash;and it can only grow and thrive by being allowed to work without getting fussed or without being faced with a <i>nihil obstat</i> from the Fianna Fáil headquarters or a Fianna Fáil Minister or a Fianna Fáil organisation, and without having to hang a label round its neck&mdash;unless we can get a free spirit of citizenship in this country, our country will inevitably be destroyed as definitely and as brutally as if we were being invaded by an invading army.  We want to appeal, over the threats and misrepresentations of the Government, to every Party in this House and to every section of the people outside the House&mdash;both the older people who have given good service in our local administration and the young people in whom the spirit of citizenship has been newly awakened&mdash;to come into the arena of public administration and public work, to go up for the local elections and to take their place in carrying on local administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill does not provide for the holding of local elections.  The elections would be held in any event.  It merely provides for <Col N="1808" /> the holding of the Presidential election and the local elections on the same day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>And it proposes to do that in order to drag the local elections into the purely political atmosphere which the Government are weaving around the Presidential election. The theory is being propounded that, unless the Government's nominee gets into Arus an Uachtarain, our prestige in the eyes of the world will be lowered and our economic and political interest, from the international point of view, will be jeopardised.  This Bill proposed to place the local elections in a wholly political atmosphere, with an international spirit moving around in a peculiar kind of way.  We ask both old workers on local bodies and young people to go forward for election, irrespective of the particular kind of recipe the Government may have for either nationalism or citizenship.  I ask those people not to be frightened off by anything that will be said from the Government platforms, or anything that will be implied as to what the Government may do by the exercise of its power.  I ask them to stand up courageously against that, and, in cooperation with their neighbours, of whatever Party, creed or class, to come forward to do constructive work for the country.  If such work were not there to be done, they would not have been asked to come into the Defence Forces in the past.  We stand against the introduction of Party politics into local administration.  We will support the type of person who has shown in the past that he can give faithful and public-spirited service to local bodies. It is our intention to support the people of any Party or of any class in the coming elections who show that that is the spirit in which they approach the matter.  The Government has very considerable power, and the very fact that they have that power, and that they parade it in the way in which they do, is being used to depress the spirit of citizenship and prevent people from coming forward to give public service who, in the ordinary way, would be prepared to come forward. They run the risk either of being abused or being prejudiced by <Col N="1809" /> Government power from doing their duty as citizens.  I do not know whether or not there is any use in appealing to the Government to change their whole attitude in regard to this matter.  But I do appeal to them in this way: they feel that they have got a mandate from the people; they are in a position in which they can give their decisions effect.  I suggest that they have a majority in this House which makes them perfectly secure, and that they can keep this Parliament in being and under their control up to 1951.  They can keep the Emergency Act in operation and retain the powers they have, which enable them to control so many things&mdash;the Press, public opinion, licences, and the direction of business.  They have full power to do anything they might reasonably want to do, without stretching out and attempting in an insidious way to annul the efforts of our people in connection with local administration. Without those efforts this country cannot prosper, cannot be free, and cannot develop its spirit of citizenship.</P>
      <P>As regards the Presidential election, the President occupies an office which was established a few short years ago. Our experience up to the present has not made clear what exactly that office can do but the people have ideas about it.</P>

In connection with that, I wish to mention that the President has important functions in relation to the constitutional rights of our people.  He can refuse to sign certain Bills.  He can send certain Bills to the Supreme Court for decision as to whether they are constitutional or not.</P>

If the occupant of the office had no powers or functions, we should probably have no candidate.  I am merely mentioning in the simplest way that he has functions and that they are important functions.  That will have an effect in deciding whether there will be three, four or five candidates.  If the Government says that they are going to put a Party man into Arus an Uachtarain, then there should, at least, be two candidates.</P>

Surely in this Parliament of the people, where the people's rights and interests have to be safeguarded, so far as we can, we can spare a few moments to clear away, if possible, such doubts and fears.</P>

      <P>If so, the Minister ought to endeavour to be a little more helpful when in rather trying, difficult and, thanks to the Government, obscure circumstances, we are trying to discuss something about the Presidential election with a view, if possible, to securing that the election will be carried out in a spirit in keeping with the dignity that the office should be allowed to have and with results that would be beneficial to that office as an office that should be held in affection in the hearts and minds of the people, on the one hand, and that should be an institution of use to the State on the other.  I think that it would be a disastrous thing at the present time from the point of view of the spirit of pure citizenship in the country, if a purely Party person were elected to the position of President in this election.  Secondly, I think it would be a disastrous thing if the Fianna Fáil Party could go any further distance along the road either of persuading the people into believing, or of cowing the people into accepting, that we can have a one-Party State set up in this country.  I called the Government great national mistake makers and they are now preparing to see that they will not avoid making another great mistake.  At a time when the Party spirit which identifies itself with the nation is going down in the world in the ruin of its own mistakes we do not want to have it tried in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do appeal to the members of the Labour Party, the members of the Farmers' Party, and every section of the people that if a Government Party man is being nominated for the office of President, in the joint discharge of <Col N="1813" /> our duties to the people, we should endeavour to find some worthy person to be nominated with our support, and I suggest that we should oppose, in a spirit of pure, unadulterated citizenship, the attempt behind such an act on the part of the Government to propagate the idea of the one-Party State or Government in this country. I can appreciate the difficulties men have in circumstances when the public mind is so confused, so tired out, so frightened, when it finds in circumstances such as the present that the State becomes more important and more influential in the lives of the people, and after we have had a Party, such as we have here, tasting the totalitarian powers given them by the Emergency Powers Acts, and Emergency Orders.</P>
    <P>They have tasted the kind of power over people's lives that they always dreamed of.  I could understand people being cowed if they may have to spend five or six years more under a Government such as that, years of great difficulty for the ordinary trader, manufacturer and worker, but it is surely up to people who have accepted the duties of being public representatives to shake the people out of their carelessness and out of their lack of courage, and to join together to find some worthy person who could be supported by the votes of the people as a whole and put in there just to show that this country did not get through centuries of struggle in a democratic spirit in order to lie down under an idea that has raised its head and spent itself and destroyed itself and destroyed a lot of others with it throughout the world.  I know there are difficulties in the matter.  There is the difficulty of appearing to subordinate yourself to some one Party or another.  There may be a difficulty of finance.  There may be all kinds of difficulties.  But we would not be here to-day and we would not have written in our Constitution that Ireland is a sovereign independent democratic State if our people in the past did not stand up against difficulties.  We read here in the Constitution that all powers of government, legislative, executive and judicial, derive under <Col N="1814" /> God from the people, whose right it is to designate the rulers of the State. Do we believe in that?  Someone has said: &ldquo;Who would do aught for the glory of God must not be over wise nor act only after the measure of his means.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>We would not be here to-day if our people in the past were overwise with regard to their personal interests or with regard to their lives, or if they had acted only after the measure of their own means. We would not be here to-day if the people had not joined together from various parties and given their lives, knowing that the democratic spirit which maintained our people in the past would live after them.  If ever a faith was justified it was that faith of the people who, in our own days, joined together from various parties and gave their lives so that this country might make itself secure and independent. We have our difficulties here, but look at the difficulties facing other countries.  We may have had losses here, and losses by our own mistakes, but look at the losses other countries have had through their own mistakes I want to appeal to every Party in this House, and I want to declare that we are prepared to go any distance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I got up here to estimate the Government's attitude, and to say simply and plainly what it appeared to me to be, that is, that they wanted to get a complete totalitarian grip over every bit of public amenity and over <Col N="1815" /> every bit of public power in the country.</P>

      <P>I will not try either your patience or the Minister's any longer except to say this: We were simply playing as children in building up the Defence Forces since 1940 if we do not face the doing of our <Col N="1816" /> work properly to-morrow, and we were simply doing something that was outrageous if we asked the young men and women to risk their lives in defence work during the last four years if it was not to secure for them in the days that are to come the capacity and the sense to feel that they are free citizens of this country, that they have work to do, that they will have a place to do that work, and will be helped by Government action to join together effectively and fully, ignoring party and creed and class, in doing that work for the country as they were doing it in the Defence Forces.  We are threatened by the Government's action with the breaking down of citizenship in this country.  We are threatened with the complete domination of our people by that kind of cowardice which the Fianna Fáil Party knows so well how to engender in people, and if we allow it, we will drift into a position in which we will have repeated in this country all the disappointments, social, economic and spiritual, that have come to some of the countries in Europe.  It is the responsibility of anybody who knows anything of how our people in the past brought themselves to the position of being sovereign and independent and safe to-day to leave nothing undone to challenge that spirit in the country. Therefore, I ask that we, the other Parties in this House, with the assistance of anybody else outside, will come together and will see if there is any worthy person who will stand in the gap to-day and with our assistance be a non-Party opponent of the purely Government Party candidate for Arus an Uachtaráin, so that in the difficult days that lie ahead of us we will have as the internal head of our State a person who is a citizen, a citizen pure and simple.  Let us resurrect there a sign of courage, a sign of hope to our people that we can in this country rule our citizens in a spirit of citizenship and for the good of the citizens as a whole.  I ask that in connection with the Presidential election.  I ask that the same spirit dominate our work in approaching the election of persons who will rule our councils.  There, again, in the new days dawning on the world, we might have expected to <Col N="1817" /> learn something from the horrible lessons we have had before us.  We might have expected to look forward to a time when, with a pure spirit of citizenship, we might fill our councils with men and women who would devote all their life work to local problems. It is the doing of the local work and the solving of the local problems that will tend to strengthen the efficiency of this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems <Col N="1818" /> to be very troubled about what the Constitution provides.  Apparently, it is on account of certain things that the Constitution provides that this Bill has been introduced.  First and foremost, as regards local elections, we are shortening the term of office.  If I do not make a mistake, they are not three years in power, and I should like to make a comparison with the election that took place in 1934.  In 1937 the period of office was extended, and local elections did not take place until 1942.  It is our view that in 1934 you fought the elections on a political issue. In 1942 you pretended you did not, but really you did.  All the same, you did not get good results out of it.  Of course, you will do it now.</P>
      <P>In our opinion the reason why you want both elections to be held on the one day is in order to save the political machine the trouble of doing its work on two separate days.  We hear a lot about what the Constitution provides, but the Constitution also provides that the salary and the upkeep of the establishment shall amount to over £22,000&mdash;at least, if it is not the Constitution that provides that amount, our legislation provides it.  I assure you that, as far as we are concerned, that is our main consideration.  I think, as regards the Presidential election, that is the thing that is troubling the people of this country most at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a few occasions I asked the Government to allow time for the consideration of a certain motion on the Order Paper, but that has been refused.  I was told that the motion must wait its turn.  Until such time as that motion comes before the House and is decided on&mdash;that is, the motion for the reduction of the President's salary and the upkeep of his establishment&mdash;our Party will not have anything to do or say as regards who will be the incoming President.  If the Government will allow that motion to come before the House, we will take our part with the Fianna Fáil Party, the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party in standing together for the selection of a man who is not a Party man.  Until such time as you allow that motion to come before the House, <Col N="1819" /> we will not have hand, act or part in this matter.</P>
    <P>As regards the number of candidates, the Minister seems to be very troubled. There may be two, three, or four.  It is my opinion that the number of candidates will depend on the salary. Deputy Mulcahy spoke about the great responsibility on the man in the Park, the President.  He talked of the great functions of the office and the great work he had to perform.  I may give it as my opinion&mdash;and I believe it is the opinion of the vast majority of the people of this country&mdash;that he is only a rubber stamp and the coming man will be more than ever that if he is to be branded with the Party brush.</P>
    <P>I will not keep the House any longer.  Perhaps I have gone outside the terms of the Bill, but the Deputy who spoke before me was allowed to go outside its provisions also.  I suggest that our motion should be allowed to come before the House.  I appeal to other Parties, the Government Party included, to make some attempt to save the people from the expense of a Presidential election.  I believe the various Parties should come together to select a man who will be above Party, who will accept a reasonable salary and whose establishment will involve only a reasonable expenditure. You will then be doing something that the people of the country will consider satisfactory&mdash;something better than could be provided by a Bill of this type.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I do not see in this Bill the profound issues Deputy Mulcahy has been able to discover in it.  I do not mind saying that off-hand I could name a hundred different and more vital issues affecting the people which could more usefully form the subject of legislation than the subject-matter of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country has many economic and social difficulties confronting it.  These economic and social issues are the vital concern of our people, and it is the solution of these issues and not machinery Bills of this character that interests our people.  We have a situation to-day in which tens of thousands <Col N="1820" /> of our people, because they cannot get employment here, are being driven elsewhere to earn a livelihood.  We have another problem which takes the form of hundreds of thousands of our people having to live below the bare subsistence level because of our high cost of living.  We have a Governmental wage policy which takes the form of grinding down the level of remuneration of the vast masses of our workers whilst at the same time permitting the prices of commodities to rise, apparently without challenge.  It is to these issues the House ought to be directing its attention and not to the type of pettifogging issues which are raised in a Bill of this character.</P>
    <P>I agree it is a most undesirable situation to have a Presidential and a local election held on the same day. If there is all the majesty that is alleged to be associated with the Presidential office in this country, then I think a Presidential election ought to be endowed with the honour of a separate poll.  The people ought to go to the polls only to elect their President, if they are interested in electing a President, and local elections ought not to be directly associated with, or held on the same day as, a Presidential election.</P>
    <P>The Government might very well have foreseen such a position and have arranged that, in a year in which the Presidential election and local elections were due to be held, the elections would be held on separate days, or that, in respect of the particular year, the period of office of the local authorities would be a statutory four years instead of the present statutory three years.  Now we have a situation in which one has to go into a polling booth and elect a town commissioner and on the same day elect the President of the country.  One can only hope that some person standing for election as a town commissioner will not discover, when the votes are counted, that he has been elected President in the mêlée which apparently is going to take place in the polling booths.</P>
    <P>It is a very undesirable situation to have a ballot-box in a polling booth into which people have to put their <Col N="1821" /> votes for three entirely different sets of candidates.  We may have a person voting for the Presidential candidates, a person voting for members of a corporation, urban council or town commissioners and a person voting for county councillors.  Let us say that an elector sets out one morning in County Kildare or County Wexford, knowing that on that day he has to vote for a President, for certain members of a corporation or urban council and for county councillors.  He has to keep the names in his head of the particular folk he wishes to vote for, and if there are separate ballot-boxes he must be sure to put the appropriate ballot paper into the appropriate box.  If the Minister wants to mess up things completely, he is going a pretty good way about it by having the election held in such circumstances and I think it is rather a burlesque of the Presidential office, if I may say so, to have people voting for President and for town commissioners on the same day.</P>
    <P>The Government might easily have avoided such an occurrence, but the fact that they did not take steps to prevent such a situation developing brings us up against very practical difficulties.  There is the difficulty of whether the local elections are to be postponed to some other day and so give the Presidential election a fair field.  That, of course, involves carrying the local elections over to a later period of the year and creates the undesirable practice of having two elections in one year&mdash;a situation which, I think, might easily have been avoided by a little forethought on the part of the Government and the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>I notice from the papers during the past few days that the Minister, or rather his private secretary, is apparently engaged in a <i>fracas</i> with the editor of the <i>Independent,</i> and I was interested to read the views of the Minister and likewise the views of the Editor of the <i>Irish Independent.</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to that in a moment.  The editor of the <Col N="1822" /><i>Independent</i> says that the Minister's game and the Fianna Fáil game is to rally all the boys who go out to vote in the local elections to vote for Mr. Seán T.O Ceallaigh for the Presidency. I think the editor of the <i>Independent</i> is wrong and that the reverse is the game, that is, to get Mr. Seán T.O Ceallaigh, the Government candidate for the Presidency, to work up all the popular enthusiasm he can for the Government Party.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the real purpose is not what the editor of the <i>Independent</i> says, that is, to rally the boys who vote in the local elections to vote for Mr. Seán T. O Ceallaigh as a candidate for the Presidency, but the opposite, that is, to get the boys who vote for Mr. Seán T. O Ceallaigh as a Fianna Fáil President to vote for the Fianna Fáil candidates at the local elections, so that the situation, so much desired by the Minister for Supplies, will be created whereby the local authorities will be packed full of Fianna Fáil nominees, of folk who will do whatever the Government in Dublin tells them to do, who will not question what is done by the Department of Local Government and who will pass any resolutions sent down to them by Fianna Fáil headquarters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may laugh if he likes, but he is the Minister's candidate.  That is the real strategy behind the Government's proposal&mdash; to try to get people out to vote for the President, and when they are out to say to them: &ldquo;Look, lads, before you <Col N="1823" /> go home, you might also vote for candidates for the local authorities and vote in the Fianna Fáil nominees. Having voted for our candidate for the Presidency, you ought to complete a good day's work by voting for the Fianna Fáil candidates in the local elections, and, having packed the local authorities sufficiently with Fianna Fáil nominees, we will be able to get them to accept unquestioningly any instructions we send down, whether from Fianna Fáil headquarters or the Local Government Department, controlled by a Fianna Fáil Minister&rdquo;.  As I said, while the viewpoint which the Editor of the <i>Independent</i> has expressed is one which in ordinary circumstances would secure general approval, namely, that it is desirable to separate the election of the President from the election of members of local authorities, I think that on this occasion he has really gone wide of the mark.</P>
      <P>On the question of the viewpoint of the Editor of the <i>Independent</i> vis-a-vis the viewpoint of the Minister for Local Government, I think the Minister, when he does get into a row with the editor of a newspaper, ought to sign the letters himself.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy was permitted by the Chair to discuss the general question of citizenship in relation to the election of local authorities, the interest of the citizen in local administration, and the desirability of encouraging the citizen to manifest the maximum possible interest in local administration.  I think it is in the machinery of local government, and not in the cloisters in the Park, that real democracy can manifest itself.  I think it is much more important to have democracy on the local authorities than to worry about some rubber stamp activities of the President whom people do not see and who rarely touches the lives of the ordinary people.  It is because I believe that real democracy in local government is much more important than the other issues which I regretted to see Deputy Mulcahy raise on this Bill, that I think it is desirable that a stand should be made, and that every opportunity should be availed of to insist on local authorities being given the maximum amount of power to govern in the sphere of local administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy said that he did not agree with politics being introduced into the local elections.  I can see <Col N="1827" /> nothing wrong in politics being introduced into the local elections.  I think that every good citizen is interested in politics, whether these politics be national politics or local politics.  I think that good citizens ought to have a municipal policy just as they ought to have a national policy, the policy being one of endeavouring to convert the people to the acceptance of whatever appears to the people to be the most progressive municipal policy.  I hope I did not misunderstand Deputy Mulcahy when he said that the Fine Gael Party had not contested the local elections on a political basis.  I went through one very stormy local election which the Fine Gael did, in fact, contest on a political basis.  That was in 1934.  It was not just a nice drawing-room party.</P>

      <P>I think that a clean local government election is a healthy national aim, and that it helps to quicken the interest of the citizens in public affairs.  That, surely, is a desirable thing in a democracy which is not the most brilliant in the world from the point of view of its knowledge of political, social, and economic questions.  It seems to me, therefore, that any consideration of the holding of local elections, the fixation of the date for local elections, or the arrangements for the conduct of local elections ought to take cognizance of this fact&mdash; that the main purpose of local elections ought to be to induce the citizens to take the maximum possible interest in these elections.  You can do that best if the citizens who stand for election, and those who vote for them can be induced to realise that the local authority has wide powers of implementing a municipal policy which is calculated to appeal to those who are municipal electors.  But, of course, thanks to the passing of the County Management Act, which, unfortunately, <Col N="1828" /> was supported both by the Fine Gael Party and the Fianna Fáil Party, we now have the situation in which it is difficult to induce people to stand for election to local authorities. I think it will be still more difficult to induce people to vote at local elections because of the widespread and growing belief that the local authorities have no very effective powers, and that, consequently, there is no justification for the former interest that was taken in the local elections.</P>
      <P>We have the situation now in which there is a county manager functioning in each area.  He functions not as the manager for a county council, but as the manager of the county council. It has been shown in many places, in this city and elsewhere, that these county managers have arbitrary powers, and that they can set at defiance any attempt by the members of the local authorities to secure the adoption of a particular line of policy, if that line of policy is not personally approved of by the county or city manager.  I suggest to the Government, therefore, that what they ought to do in connection with this Bill is to assure the House that what is meant is to introduce complementary legislation, part of which ought to be to give back to the local authorities some of the powers which they previously had, and to make the county manager not the manager of the council, but the manager for the council, and to leave to the representatives of the local electors the main responsibility of shaping local policy.</P>
      <P>If we are to maintain democracy here and preserve our conceptions of democracy we can best do that by giving the widest possible powers to the local authorities.  It will not be done by holding local elections in an atmosphere in which local interest has been largely chloroformed by denying to local authorities the democratic rights which formerly they wielded and, generally speaking, wielded well and wisely, and with considerable local approval.</P>

      <P>There is one aspect of the results which will flow from this Bill which will not be for the <Col N="1829" /> public convenience but which will lead to a good deal of confusion.  If the Bill becomes law, in certain areas, for intance, in urban areas, there will be no less than three separate ballot papers presented to the electorate.  Those of us who have experience of local elections where there were only two separate ballot papers have some idea of the confusion that arose and the number of ballot papers that were spoiled.  If we are going to have three separate ballot papers to be marked by each voter I doubt very much that it will be possible to have the poll completed within the normal hours. There may be in an urban district a number of illiterate voters.  We know the extent to which an illiterate voter can delay the poll, even when there is only one ballot paper, but if the presiding officer has to read and explain to the voter three different papers, we can imagine the confusion of the voter and we can imagine the delay that will take place.  The same will apply in the case of the ordinary old man or woman who goes to the poll and who is perhaps barely able to read and barely able to mark the paper.  That poor old person will be presented with three ballot papers containing different names or perhaps the same names. That aspect of the Bill apparently has not occurred to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, of course, both in the Dáil and in his controversy with the newspaper to which Deputy Norton has referred, has tried to create the impression that this rush is unavoidable, that no provision could possibly have been made before the present moment.  That is all nonsense, of course.  If I may say so, I was rather disappointed with the direction the debate took after the opening given by Deputy Mulcahy.  If we had any doubts as to the mentality of the people who sit opposite and who are the Government of this country, we saw it again displayed by the Minister for Local Government.  The Minister shows himself as a dictator.  He has refused consistently in this House to accept the decision of the Chair. He has on innumerable occasions attempted to intimidate the Chair by challenging every point in every ruling. That is not surprising to those of us <Col N="1830" /> who have been watching him for a number of years, both inside and outside this House.  Recently, we saw, in relation to a distinguished churchman, the same insolence displayed as is displayed here.  Deputy Mulcahy set out his objections to this Bill because, as he said, it was going to put the coping stone on what is sought to be erected here by the Fianna Fáil Government, that is, the totalitarian State.  The Government are in an all-powerful position to-day.  They can put what they like through this House.  The Seanad has very little, if any, powers but in so far as it has powers they are controlled by the Government there. There is a censorship, the abuse of which can control the expressions of opinion of people either inside or outside this House, can either suppress them or distort them.  We are now going to have a Fianna Fáil President in the Park and, finally, this attempt to choke the last place in which criticism might be offered to what is being done, namely, the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister said, by way of interjection, that the Government had not expressed any opinion about local authorities.  Apparently he does not read his colleague, Deputy Lemass.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the slightest objection.  I always do refer to the Minister as the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or the Minister for Supplies, as the case may be. On this occasion, when he was speaking to a Fianna Fáil club, I assume he was speaking not as Minister but as Mr. Lemass&mdash;a member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  However, that is a small point, and if you like I will refer to him as the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  In any case, he has sent forth a challenge that every <Col N="1831" /> effort is to be made, and every link is to be strained by Fianna Fáil to capture a complete and absolute majority upon every local authority in this country.  Then we have the Dáil, the Seanad, the Park, the censorship and the local authority.  When Deputy Mulcahy spoke about the one-Party State, he was not exaggerating in the slightest.  The analogy between what is happening here and what it is being sought to bring about here, and what has happened in certain countries on the continent, with the results to which Deputy Mulcahy referred, is very close, even to the dictators.  The idea of the Minister being shocked that a prominent churchman should dare to have an opinion other than the opinion shared by the Minister makes the analogy much closer.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether or not Deputies see the matter as clearly as some of us think we see it.  The fact is that, no matter how closely the cloak of democracy may have been wrapped around them, we have had a dictatorship of a sort in this country for a number of years.  We now have the position when that dictatorship is going to stand forth naked unless the people of this country come to their senses before it is too late.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add to what Deputy Morrissey has said about the confusion that is going to prevail if the Presidential election and the local elections are held on the same day.  On the last occasion, three years ago, when the Postponement of Elections Bill was being discussed, I referred the Minister to the confusion that is always created in urban areas. I am very familiar with the position in the town of Wexford.  At the last election the number of members to be elected to the corporation was 12; there were 36 candidates.  Wexford County Council area elected six; there were 21 candidates.  There were 37 people before the electorate.  Now we are going to have a Presidential election in addition to that.  This Bill should be called the Confusion of Electors Bill, because that is the state of affairs it will bring about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1832" /> Of course, the Ministers at the present moment are not a bit concerned about local electors.  They are not a bit concerned about local authorities. Local authorities have so little power now that it is hardly worth while holding elections at all.  It would appear from the Bill as at present before the House that the Minister recognises that.  Deputy Donnellan has pointed out that the local authorities will not be three years in office until August next.  If the Presidential position is as important as the Minister would have us believe, surely there should be a separate day set aside for the Presidential election.  The Minister has gone so far as to say that there may not be sufficient ballot-boxes to carry out three elections at one time, and the ballot papers are going to be thrown everywhere, in any box that is available.  If the position of President is the dignified office that the Minister would have us believe, that is not the way in which to carry out an election.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Morrissey when they say that this Government is heading direct for a dictatorship.  We have had dictatorship through the medium of Emergency Powers Orders during the period of the war and, now, as Deputy Morrissey stated, it has come out into the open, and unless the people assert themselves we are going to have established here a system which brought ruin and degradation in its wake in other parts of the world.  I suggest to the Minister that the Presidential election is of sufficient importance to warrant being held on a separate day, as it is absolutely impossible to carry out elections properly if there are to be three elections held on the same day.  As Deputy Morrissey pointed out, a considerable amount of time is taken up with illiterate voters.  On the occasion of the last election I know that some people in Wexford lost votes because there was a rush at the end of the day, and some illiterate voters occupied so much time in the booths that other electors were prevented from registering their votes.  If that happened on the last occasion, I suggest that the position is going to be infinitely worse <Col N="1833" /> this time.  If an illiterate person is handed three ballot papers, one containing from 30 to 40 names, another containing from 20 to 30 names, and then a Presidential ballot-paper, and if some of the names on these papers are similar, that will create confusion.</P>
    <P>Apparently the Government are not concerned about that.  They are not concerned, I submit, about getting through the ballot boxes a true reflection as far as local elections are concerned of what is the people's mind.  It is hard to know whether they are more concerned about the Presidential election or the local elections, but, in consequence of the fact that they are bent on putting one of their own Front Bench members in as President, they have apparently no respect whatever for the dignity of the position. I am not referring to the personality of any candidate, but he has to be a politician, and I say that that is no place for a politician.  On the occasion of the previous election of a President there was agreement.  Probably there is a chance of agreement now on some other prominent Irishman. I am not suggesting that that is the wisest policy, but it would be a better policy than having a political President, who will do everything he is asked to do by the Fianna Fáil Government and who will be as has been suggested by many people, merely a rubber stamp.  A rubber stamp that costs £20,000 a year is a very dear commodity.</P>

      <P>Whether this is a Bill to provide that there shall be local elections on the same day as the election for President, or whether it is one to provide that the elections shall be on the same day for the President and for local authorities, does not seem to matter a whole lot.  From some of the remarks made by the Minister it would seem that there is a distinction to be made.  What does matter is confined to the purpose behind this measure.  It was stated in the debate, and we all know that there have been utterances by prominent members of the Government, that the Presidential election must be fought on a political basis; that there must be a nominee <Col N="1834" /> of a political Party put forward.  We have also had utterances from members of the Government to the effect that it is desirable and essential that local elections should be fought on political issues.  Of course we know that it has been the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party for many years to fight local elections on political issues.</P>
      <P>When we find these statements made from authoritative sources, and know that the Presidential election is going to be fought on a political issue; when we know that there is going to be a political nominee for the office; and when we find that there is going to be a contest on political lines in local elections, and have a Bill providing that both elections shall be held on the same day, then we wonder if we cannot draw the obvious inference, that Fianna Fáil wants the President to be a nominee of theirs and that they also want a majority of the local authorities to be their nominees.  Is that a principle that commends itself to the House?  That appears to me to be the principle behind this Bill.  This Bill is not designed to save the taxpayers' money by having two elections on the same day, and it is not designed, having regard to the matters I referred to, to save the electors trouble.  The Bill is not designed to minimise the number of elections that are being inflicted on the country by the Fianna Fáil Government and Party, but is designed for the sole purpose of carrying out the policy of this Government, which is that every piece of State machinery shall be directed and maintained for the purpose of further advancing, if possible, the aims of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The leader of the Opposition and Deputy Morrissey pointed out that the whole aim is to get control of all the activities of the public and municipal life of this country in the interests of a Party.  The aim of this Administration has been to control quasi-Government bodies and companies so that the whole structure and administration of this State is directed in the interests of a political Party.  As Deputy Morrissey stated, this country is being governed in the interests of a political Party, tending towards the creation of <Col N="1835" /> a one-Party dictatorship.  That is the principle behind this Bill; that is what we object to.  The more innocuous a measure of this kind appears to be the more carefully have we to examine it.  On its face this would be a Bill to save the electorate trouble and to save the taxpayers expense, but, having regard to the facts which cannot be controverted, the only aim of this measure is to create a one-Party dictatorship.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear the views expressed by Deputy Norton on the proper attitude of political Parties towards municipal and local elections. In this Party we always had the view that as a Party we should take our proper place in municipal and local affairs.  That is entirely different from saying that we should fight local elections on a purely political basis or on political issues.  We have announced, as we always did, our intention to take part in local elections in collaboration with other Parties who come forward with proper municipal policies, and to do the best that we can, and to give the greatest possible beneficial contribution that we can as a Party, with our nominees in the local bodies, towards local purposes and municipal objects.  We want to keep that so far as is possible from national issues and Party issues.</P>
    <P>The Government policy of fighting local elections on a political basis is not in order that Fianna Fáil should have a municipal policy on the question at all, but that those people who are on the local bodies will work in close co-operation and collaboration with the Party cumainn and the bosses and the Party in this House, so that they shall have a unified effort behind the Government in keeping the present Party in power and in furthering the political objects of that Party.  That is what we object to, and that is what we mean when we say that we do not want to have the local elections conducted on a Party basis.  We are prepared to work in municipal and local affairs with other Parties for the advancement and for the benefit of local communities.  We will fight these elections in places which we think fit on a proper municipal policy.  This <Col N="1836" /> Bill, innocuous as it appears on its face to be, is in fact a sinister measure, as sinister as many of the measures and many of the administrative policies and actions of the present Government have been in recent years.  We accordingly intend to vote against the Bill.</P>

      <P>I should say at the outset that this debate has developed on lines which, to me at any rate, are totally unexpected.  I do not know whether to laugh or to cry at the observations of the Fine Gael Party in regard to this Bill.  I might laugh, because I cannot help feeling that this accusation, that the Government, supported by the Fianna Fáil Party, are tending towards totalitarianism, is ludicrous beyond belief I feel almost like weeping because the observations of the Opposition would prevent for another period the development of what is always useful to a Government&mdash;a live, vigorous, and respected Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great part of Deputy Mulcahy's speech was nothing more than unmitigated abuse of the Irish people.  It was the Irish people that put the Fianna Fáil Party into office and thus enabled the present Administration to continue.  It was the Irish people who, in their wisdom, decided that the Fianna Fáil Party should be in a majority in the State and the suggestion that our majority might in some way be extended as a result of this Bill so as to lead to dictatorship is merely an accusation that the Irish people themselves are capable of losing their own powers of self-government through some ill-advised and unwise attitude either in the local government or the Presidential election.  I cannot help feeling that these observations are nothing but the last pitiful excuse of a defeated Party.  Because Fianna Fáil has been successful, because a Fianna Fáil Administration has again taken office, automatically it must be considered totalitarian.  Because there may or may not be candidates with <Col N="1837" /> some political flavour attached to them in either of these elections, we are therefore pursuing a policy destined to remove from the Irish people all the powers they have secured for themselves by their struggle in the last 20 years.  Because we have a majority we believe in depriving the people of the power through which we secured office. I cannot help feeling that when tomorrow morning's papers are read the vast majority of the people will laugh at the statements made in the House to-night.</P>
    <P>Through reading a good many periodicals which emanate from the United States of America I recall the comments made about the Presidential election in that country.  There they have a very rigid Party system which goes much further than it does in this country under which many offices, election to which in this country is on an impartial basis and without regard to politics, are the reward of Party politicians.  It was a very fierce election.  It was an election in which nothing was spared in the way even of personal abuse of the two principal candidates.  But, whatever abuse there was, I did not find that in the United States the Opposition Party thought fit to castigate the Party in office on the ground that, because they held a majority and intended to obtain a majority again, they were proposing to throw aside ordinary democratic government.  In that country, where the election was fought on a basis of greater political abuse than here, at least that observation was not made, evidently because in that country the Opposition Party could hardly imagine that such an accusation would be taken seriously.</P>
    <P>The very use of the word &ldquo;totalitarian&rdquo; in connection with the whole issue of this Bill is ludicrous.  A totalitarian regime implies the complete suppression of all speeches of a hostile character made in connection with the prevailing Government.  It implies secret expenditure of Government funds for the sake of securing and maintaining a majority.  It implies, at least more often than not, the maintenance of a semi-private army.  It implies that the Party desiring to <Col N="1838" /> maintain power makes use of the weapon of insinuating the idea that in some way democracy is associated with corruption in public life.  So far as that is concerned, if I remember rightly, the last election was fought principally on the basis that at least certain members of the Government had lent themselves to corruption.  To that extent it was the Opposition which was lending flavour to the idea of dictatorship.</P>
    <P>The present Government, as the House knows, believe in a broad national policy of reconstruction.  We neither claim to be conservative nor <i>laissez faire</i> on the one hand, or to have any extreme views with regard to the influence of the State on the life of the community on the other.  I would welcome a more vigorous opposition in this country.  I think that, in the long run, it might be better for the country if for the next five years we had to fight every step of the way. But, as I said, at the moment we have an overwhelming majority in this Dáil and we will continue our broad national policy of development.  I cannot see that our determination to do that, and the success we have achieved in the last six months have any relation to the possibility, now or in the future, of a totalitarian regime in this country.  I could continue in this vein for a very long time.  I could give the House the history of the totalitarian Governments in Europe and show how completely they differ in every respect from the philosophy and opinions of members of the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party.  I should say that there is a very large number of members of this Party who, if they are prepared to lay down their lives in defence of the country, aside from external invasion, it would be for the preservation of democracy above all else, and above all other considerations, and I say that with absolute sincerity.</P>
    <P>I think there is no need even at this juncture to labour too much this absurd accusation that we are trying to institute a dictatorship.  We are discussing a Bill dealing with machinery to bring about the Presidential and <Col N="1839" /> local elections on the same day.  It is quite obvious to anyone that arguments could be evinced for holding the elections separately.  In asking the people to exercise the franchise and carry out their duties as citizens, we must not ask too much of them in relation to the issues at stake.  If we can secure orderly thought, a reasonable viewpoint, reasonable consideration of the issues, both in the Presidential election and the local government election, by having the polling days coincidental, and if the advantages of doing that are as obvious as are the disadvantages of holding separate elections, with the possible lack of interest being shown in the second of the elections, then there is justification for this Bill passing through the House. The Government believe that, taking it large and wide, it is better on the present occasion to have the elections on the same day.</P>
    <P>We have considered most carefully all the matters which have been raised, all the difficulties mentioned by Deputy Norton, Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Corish, in regard to the confusion that might arise.  We will take every step to secure that, in connection with the polling arrangements, the electors will not be confused.  As far as possible, there will be separate polling compartments, separate places, even if in the same building, for voting in the different elections.  We are taking every step to ensure that there will be no confusion in regard to the appearance of the different forms of ballot paper.  Deputy Morrissey suggested that, on the occasion of a former local government election, there were many spoiled papers in places where there were only two elections&mdash;for, say, an urban authority and a county council.  On investigation, I find that the spoiled papers in local government elections have been definitely less than I per cent.</P>
    <P>The main confusion that could arise or would be likely to arise seems to be between the elections in respect of the two local authorities.  In other words, possibly part of that percentage of spoilt papers may have been due to <Col N="1840" /> lack of understanding on the part of a certain type of elector, when presented with two papers, one for an urban council and one for a local authority.</P>
    <P>If the elector can overcome any difficulty he may face in separating in his mind these two elections, the simple act of recording his preference in respect of one, two or even three Presidential candidates will not be a difficult or complicated matter.  In other words, the addition of a third election, in which the issue is very simple, the candidates very few in number, the paper of a different description, is not likely to add materially to the number of spoilt votes.  Therefore, we can say that no abuse is likely to arise as a result of there being three elections occurring in certain areas.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we will take every step to avoid confusion and make sure that the elections will take place on an orderly basis.  Looking back at the past, since 1932, in the administration of both local government and Dáil Éireann elections, I think I can say without exaggeration that the administration has been excellent.  In fact, there have been amazingly few complaints. We have introduced a number of novelties, such as the taking of the plebiscite for the Constitution, and on every occasion the officers concerned, both in the Department of Local Government and Public Health and under the local authorities, advised and directed by the Minister, the duties have been performed efficiently and well.  I do not believe that difficulties are likely to arise on the present occasion and I think I speak for the Government in saying that we hope the electors will exercise the franchise wisely and well.</P>
    <P>I would like to make one more comment in connection with some of the remarks of the Opposition.  There seems to be almost petty contempt in the idea that a person who has taken part in the political life of this country is necessarily unsuited to be President. I would like members of the House to think over this statement. Regardless of what the Government do, regardless of our decision, regardless of <Col N="1841" /> the type of person nominated to be President, the implication behind the statement of the Opposition is quite clearly that a person who has taken part in political life becomes almost automatically excluded from the Presidency. It is stated that a person who has taken part in political life, no matter what his character or attainments may be, cannot when he becomes President, be capable of that impartial attitude and wide exercise of his powers which would be expected of him.  I think that statement is ludicrous.</P>
    <P>People rise to prominence in various ways&mdash;some through their political activities, some through their commercial success, some through the exercise of some cultural power; but one of the most notable ways in which people come to prominence in this country is through taking an interest in public life.  If they take a large interest in public life, if they become known to the vast majority of the people, if they enter into such a position in the life of this country that their candidature becomes of interest to the ordinary citizen in exercising the franchise for the first time in regard to the Presidency, it is more than likely that they will have, in fact, expressed their views on political matters.  It is not only insulting to this House but insulting to the members of the Government and even insulting to the members of the Opposition Front Bench, of which Deputy Mulcahy is a member, who might be described as the shadow bench of Ministers, to suggest that it is impossible for a person to be either on this Bench or on that Bench to become President and then not be able to remove himself from the Party sphere of things and exercise his powers wisely and well.  The idea is an absurd one. I can think of a number of persons sitting in this House and in different Parties who would be quite capable of exercising the powers of the President well and of acting as the person we would like to have in office here as a symbol of good citizenship.  We would be creating a very serious precedent if we were to admit that, in future, no matter how the President <Col N="1842" /> may be elected, whether we continue the present procedure under the Constitution or change it, in some way we must debar persons who have taken part in public and political life.</P>
    <P>There are very many issues on which the President can take a lead, in making speeches and in presiding on occasions of importance, where what he has to say can have no relation to Party politics.  They are issues in which we ask for a greater sense of citizenship throughout the country, regardless of political views held by the persons concerned.  There are issues where we ask for loyalty in regard to economic measures which would have the support of every Party in the House.  There are issues in regard to the defence of the country, to the economic efficiency of the country, to the cultural advancement of the country, in which there need be no question of narrow Party politics.</P>
    <P>I trust that the country will not follow the lead given to them by the Opposition here to-day.  It may be many years before we have advanced sufficiently in self-government to be able to find a person who had been so prominent in the life of the community that he was, naturally, a good candidate for the Presidency and yet who, perhaps for very good reasons, had divorced himself so entirely from politics that no one could attach a political label to him.  There is hardly a person in the professional life of this country, no matter if he never spoke on any political platform, who could not be labelled with a Party label of one kind or another.  I challenge members of the professions in this House, whether members of the Bar or of any other profession, to name any person with sufficient prominence to warrant his being nominated for the Presidency and who, even if he never spoke on political matters, could not be labelled as belonging to or believing in one political Party or another, and I suggest that it is very unlikely that we could conduct either local government elections or a Presidential election in which the political issue might not arise.</P>
    <P>I think, Sir, that I have said sufficient on the Second Stage of this Bill to convince the House that this is <Col N="1843" /> nothing but a machinery measure and that we are not engaged in a subtle plot to overthrow democracy: that we are not proposing, when the President is elected or when the local government elections have been held, to suppress the newspapers, to suppress freedom of speech, to start a private army, to suppress the trades unions, or to do any of the things that are usually ascribed to totalitarian governments, and I trust that in future discussions on this Bill it will not be necessary to refer again to the farcical views put forward by the Opposition to-day.  I trust that on the Committee Stage we can get down to studying the technical aspects of the Bill, and I am sure that any suggestions on the technical aspects of the Bill that are put forward by members of the Opposition will be very carefully examined by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 6, before Section 10, line 44, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>10. (1)  The Board may from time to time appoint such and so many committees as it thinks proper.</P>
      <P>(2)  The board may delegate to a committee of the board any of its functions, powers and duties which, in its opinion, can be better or more conveniently exercised or performed by a committee, and may regulate the procedure of any such committee.</P>
      <P>(3)  A committee of the board shall consist of such number of members as the board thinks proper and may, at the discretion of the board, consist exclusively of persons who are members of the board or partly of persons who are members of the board and partly of persons who are officers of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1844" /> (4)  The acts of a committee of the board shall be subject to confirmation by the board save where the board dispenses with the necessity for such confirmation.</P>
    <P>This amendment arises out of a discussion that we had on the last occasion. As Deputies will remember, I accepted, on the last occasion, an amendment to make the number of the quorum five.  Now, I think that Deputies will agree, on thinking over the matter, that five is rather a large quorum in a committee of 11, especially if, as is possible, the residences of the members, or of a number of them, at any rate, in this case, are scattered all over the country and where it might frequently be very difficult to get them together.  Accordingly, I think it is necessary and desirable that the board should have power to delegate its duties to committees or, perhaps, to sub-committees&mdash;committees are mentioned in the amendment&mdash;and that these committees should consist of such a number as the board itself might, from time to time, think proper, and that they might be members of the board with, perhaps, a chief official or two chief officials of the board, acting with the members of the board on that committee.  I think that such a delegation of power is absolutely necessary, especially where meetings may be required for purely routine business and where it might be difficult to get members together.  Accordingly, I think there should be no serious objection to a delegation of power in that way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister's amendment is absolutely necessary, but I should like to ask him if he would not consider it wise and necessary to put in a provision for appointing people who might not be members of the board.  There might be a case where specialised knowledge would be required, and it might be possible that none of the members of the board had that particular specialised knowledge. In such a case, I suggest that it might be desirable or even necessary to have a man of that kind on the committee.  Under sub-section (4) the ratification of the board is required for the acts of a committee of the <Col N="1845" /> board, and I think it would be a useful provision, although it might not be necessary, to allow for persons with specialised knowledge to be appointed on such committees, since the acts of the committees are subject to confirmation by the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Hughes's suggestion.  I think that this amendment is desirable because it is possible that the limitation that the quorum of the board should be not less than five, as proposed on a previous occasion, came about because people did not properly read the section.  The section, as originally worded, was &ldquo;not less than three&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of people were under the impression that three members could hold a meeting at any time, irrespective of the wishes of the other members of the board, and there arrogate to themselves all the powers of the board, without consultation with the other members.  There was nothing in the section to prevent the board itself fixing the quorum&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I think it is desirable that the board should be forced to function, either with the quorum or with such larger number as they find necessary, and this amendment enables the board to delegate functions, some of which might be purely routine, or others of which might require specialised knowledge which the ordinary members of the board do not have, to a smaller committee&mdash;things which, quite possibly, could be done more effectively by a smaller committee.  Deputy Hughes suggests that the board should have power to nominate to a sub-committee an individual or individuals who are not members of the board, and I think that that is a desirable and very useful suggestion.  It is quite likely that for a particular function or functions an individual whom the board might not have as an employee but who would have, say, interests or other functions connected with racing, could <Col N="1846" /> be of great service on such a committee, and I think it is desirable that the board should have power to nominate such an individual.  It is equally likely that, when racing is resumed on a normal scale, two meetings may be held on the same day in different parts of the country.  It is rare to have more than two meetings on the same day but there might be, under normal conditions, two meetings on the same day and it might be desirable to extend the provisions of the Bill in this way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree with the amendment and with the observations which have just been made, I wonder if the net is not being cast too far in the opposite direction.  It will now be possible for the board to set up a committee to deal with any function.  No limitation is placed on that except such as the board may impose.  Some people thought that the board might be careless if a quorum of three were fixed. That could now be brought about by the board's appointing a committee of three.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>If the board be careless, the Minister or the racing fraternity will cause it to be removed. If the board does not take its duties reasonably seriously, there is no future for this legislation.  In the course of ordinary legislation, a committee like this would, I think, be useful&mdash;almost essential.  I do not know what particular decisions would come within the functions of the board, but it can only function at a particular race meeting if five members are present.  If two members were sick you would not have a quorum of the board.  Under this amendment, they could delegate their functions to a committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like the principle involved in this amendment. Under the Bill, we give certain statutory <Col N="1847" /> functions to the officials of the board, and by this amendment we are proposing to constitute those functionaries members of the board, as it were.  We felt that it was necessary to have a quorum of five for the proper conduct of the business of the board, and so as to prevent snap decisions being taken by a minority, but a committee might be set up by the board consisting of any number&mdash;one, two or three.  The acts of that committee are to be subject to confirmation by the board, &ldquo;save where the board dispenses with the necessity for such confirmation&rdquo;. I felt that, in this regard, we were giving very drastic powers to the board.  We tried to curb those powers, but did not succeed.  Now, it is proposed to enable this board to function through a number of committees. There is no limit to the numerical composition of the committees, and no limit to the number of committees.  These committees may consist, in the majority, of officials who are charged with certain statutory duties under the Act, and who will be in a position, as it were, to supervise themselves.  I feel that the principle is bad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BridgetMRedmond" hpid="Mrs. Redmond Mrs. Redmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in absolute agreement with those who have spoken against the amendment.  A few weeks ago, when we were discussing this Bill, I had down amendments to increase the number of members of the board.  I did not specify the number and I was told that the proposal was rather vague.  It was also argued that 11 members were quite sufficient to deal with the business. Now, we are proposing to give power for the creation of committees.  The <Col N="1848" /> committees' decisions will, I understand, be subject to confirmation by the board.  Nevertheless, I think that, having settled the membership of the board, we should leave it to that body to carry out its business.  I think that they should be quite capable of doing what they will, by acceptance of office, undertake to do under this measure. I do not think that any committee is necessary.  We are outstepping ourselves and we shall not know who will be in eventual control.  There will be crowds of people trying to get on the various committees.  It is quite sufficient to have 11 persons responsible to the Dáil, as I understand they will be, and, if they fail in their duty, they can be brought to book here. These committees might also be used to relieve the board of some unpleasant duty which it was not anxious to discharge.  I think that, if we have too many people, the business may not be done in a businesslike way, and that we should leave matters as they are.  The last lines of this amendment should, certainly, be deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not quite clear throughout the whole of this Bill that the board is the body in whom we are vesting very wide authority and the Dáil will, naturally, look to the board to ensure that that authority be wisely and justly used?  That board should never be in a position to come back to Dáil Eireann, in the event of a bookmaker or other person engaged in horse racing feeling that he was victimised, and say that the board was not responsible, that the injustice was done by one of its committees and consummated without the knowledge of the board.  If we pass this amendment as it stands, that situation could easily arise.  A committee of the board which had been exonerated under sub-section (4) of this amendment from the necessity of seeking confirmation from the whole board for its acts might do something which seriously prejudiced some individual or group of individuals.  Unless that action were brought to the notice of the board, that individual or group of individuals would have no remedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be argued that the aggrieved party could write to the board protesting <Col N="1849" /> that the committee had done them an injustice, but the Minister will agree with me that, where boards delegate certain duties to a committee and give that committee final powers in the instrument of delegation, they are extremely reluctant to hear complaints from outsiders as to the manner in which that subsidiary committee has carried out its duties, on the ground that, if they entertained such representations in one case, every decision of the committee would be challenged with the board in the hope that there would be a reversal.  If, on the other hand, every decision of the committee must come before the board for formal ratification, then, where representations have been made to a member that injustice has been done, that individual point of the sub-committee's general report can be discussed, and if anything requires to be rectified, rectification can be made before the committee's report is sanctioned and adopted by the board as a whole.</P>
    <P>I cannot envisage a situation in which this board in which we have vested such wide power, will be inclined to delegate many of its powers to committees.  I do not think that the Minister intends that the board should become a figurehead, doing all its executive work through committees which the Minister thought properly should be done by the board itself. Therefore, we may assume that the committees envisaged by the section will be few and that the labour of confirming or reviewing the decisions of those committees would not place an undue burden on the board as a whole. I think the House would feel easier in its mind if it were satisfied that the discretion, which a great many of us have reposed in this board with some reluctance, is not going to be further passed on to other parties, of the constitution of which we have no knowledge. I think if the proposal made by Deputy Coogan, that the words in sub-section (4) of this amendment&mdash;&ldquo;save where the board dispenses with the necessity for such confirmation&rdquo;&mdash;is adopted, a great deal of the objections to the amendment will fall to the ground.  I cannot imagine that this is <Col N="1850" /> a matter of principle upon which the Minister will feel inclined rigidly to stand.  It cannot certainly do any serious harm and it will with equal certainty relieve the minds of many of us who would have considerable apprehension were the amendment to be adopted in its present form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>With the exception of what I might call principles, without whose presence the Bill would be useless, this is a Bill on the contents of which I should like the guidance of the House.  I came forward with this amendment because I thought that the Bill would not be practicable and would not work with a quorum of five obligatory on a board of 11, especially having regard to the fact that as Deputy Cosgrave reminded us, there might be a necessity for having two meetings on the one day in different parts of the country, if it were possible for the board to translate itself from one part of the country to another. Two quorums would be necessary for such meetings.  The position as it stood after the last day's discussion was that we should have a quorum of five rather than a minimum attendance of three members.  The quorum being five, I think it is essential that there should be power to delegate to committees. I do not think the board could operate without that power.  I think the board as a body of experienced, sensible and responsible men, as I hope they will be, will delegate only minor powers generally to any committee they are likely to set up.  There are certain important duties and responsibilities imposed by the Bill on the members of the board.  I cannot imagine the members of the board trying to rid themselves of the responsibilities attaching to membership or accepting membership of the board and endeavouring to slide out of responsibility by putting it on to some committee. I do not think that will happen; I do not see it happening.</P>
      <P>I think that where a committee is appointed it will be necessary that the board should see to it that the reports of these committees are submitted to the board and that they will keep full control of the working of the committees down to the smallest detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1851" /> I think that it is quite possible, as Deputy Hughes suggested, that it might be advisable to get some specialist from time to time put on a committee.  It did not occur to me before but I see the force of Deputy Hughes's suggestion.  There may be people with special knowledge which will not be available to the board we shall appoint.  The board may like to have that knowledge and experience available and put such a person on a committee to advise them.</P>
    <P>I think it is a reasonable suggestion, and if Deputy Hughes would agree, I would consider it for an amendment when we come to the Seanad.  I should like to consider the matter further, but it does strike me as a useful and practical suggestion that might be of value to the work of the board.  I do not see the board working without the power to set up committees.  It is a board of 11 with a quorum of five, and I think the committees are necessary.  I have had experience in this House of putting through Bills giving very important powers to boards, and I have asked the House before to allow such boards to set up committees and the House agreed.  One case I have in mind is the Central Bank.  We gave them instructions practically to set up committees.  I think the setting up of different committees in this case is a necessity.  I do not think that anything that the Deputy from Donegal suggested in the way of a want of responsibility on the part of members, or of their handing over their responsibility lightly to sub-committees is likely to happen, not if the type of people I have in mind&mdash;men, first of all, with a knowledge of racing, a knowledge of the various things that go to make up a successful race meeting, the breeding of horses, and the matters that are mentioned in the various sections of the Bill&mdash;are on the board.</P>
    <P>As to the type of person whom I have in mind and hope to get, there will probably be a fairly wide field to select from, and I hope to get 11 men who will be knowledgeable in this business, responsible and, above all, common sense people.  They will be <Col N="1852" /> appointed for five year periods, and if they do any of the things that Deputy Mrs. Redmond thinks they might do, the matter can come up here for review when the accounts are annually laid before the House, as they must be under the terms of the Bill.  With regard to the suggestion that the words &ldquo;save where the board dispenses with the necessity for such confirmation&rdquo; be dropped from the amendment, I think that their retention will not do any harm, and it would give the board power to dispense with a lot of routine work that will otherwise have to be faced by the board, perhaps over a long period.  They can in advance make up their mind what they will ask a certain committee to do.  That committee can do the work, and need not bother reporting to them.</P>
    <P>Suppose they set up a committee to inspect the licences of a number of bookmakers at a particular race meeting, they need not, unless the committee think well of it, report back. They are not obliged to report back. If they think well of it, or if they come across people acting who have not got a licence, then they will report back. But I think it is possible that we might be tying the hands of the board if we did not leave them power to delegate routine jobs of that kind to a committee.  That is a matter, as Deputy Dillon properly said, of business and routine.  It is not a matter of principle.  It is a matter on which we are all entitled to our views as to what is practical and sensible.  If the House as a whole thinks that the board would work better and would have a greater sense of responsibility attached to it if these words were left out, then I am quite in the hands of the House.</P>

What is the use of discussing its administration if the board says: &ldquo;Oh, we did not do that at all.  Some fools on the committee made a mess of it at Tramore&rdquo;?  We can say: &ldquo;Well, do not appoint any fools on your committee again.&rdquo;  The board can defend itself to us in Dáil Eireann by saying: &ldquo;It is not our fault; we made a mistake in choosing the committee.&rdquo;  I want the board to come forward and explain to the House why they did wrong.  The Minister says he may adopt Deputy Hughes's proposal and bring on to those committees persons who are not on the board at all.</P>

      <P>God help the poor bookmakers. Everybody seems to be kicking them about the place, but if we are to put their lives and being in the hands of this board, and then announce that the board can delegate them to a sub-committee, and then go further and announce that you can put all and sundry on the sub-committee and that the sub-committee need never refer back to the board, although there is <Col N="1854" /> only one member of the board or one official of the board on the sub-committee, surely that is going too far? We in this House are trustees of the rights of those decent, respectable men who, so far as I know, are doing nothing but earning their living in a legitimate way.  The only bookmakers I ever met were men like Dick Power and John Keenan, decent, respectable men, who never wanted subsidy or help from anybody, but only to be let stand up under their umbrella and do their business.  As the Minister knows, it was their presence and their personalities that drew a very large part of the patrons of racing to the racecourse.  I think the Minister will agree with me that 50 per cent. of the people who go to racecourses know very little about horse-flesh or form or anything of that kind, but they like to hear the bookmakers shouting the odds, and to see the green, white and yellow umbrellas, and so forth.  If we are going to put all those people absolutely in the power of the board, and the board may delegate its duties in relation to them to a sub-committee, and, if Deputy Hughes's proposal is adopted, the sub-committee may consist of one official of the board and a group of extern persons of whom we know nothing, surely it is not unreasonable to say that those sub-committees will be required to refer back their findings to the board, which is the only body responsible to this House.</P>
      <P>I do not want to use trenchant or extreme language, but if any extremity of language would impress on the Minister the emphasis with which I am asking to have those words removed, I am prepared to use it.  I am asking the Minister to assume that I have resorted to as trenchant a series of observations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have as good a memory as anybody else in this House, I think, and I know all the things connected with those items to which the Deputy refers.  I am not going to follow him, but I do say that no Minister dare come into this House and say that he is not responsible for such and such a board or committee that he appointed.  Every Minister is held responsible here every day in the week for anybody he appoints, and in the same way this board will have to answer to this House for every committee and every individual that it appoints.  We have no right to ask committees appointed by this board or any other board to be responsible to this House.  The Minister and the Government will hold the board responsible, and the House will hold the Minister responsible for the acts of every individual appointed by that board, so there is no use in suggesting that those committees can get away with something, or that when the board appoints those committees the responsibility of the board ends there. It does not.  The responsibility of the board carries right through to the furthest unimportant individual official or non-official that the board appoints. They have to accept responsibility for their acts.  I think it would be unfair to the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand there is quite a considerable amount of routine work in that one item, the Totalisator.  In the ordinary business of winding up the day's proceedings in connection with the Totalisator there is a good deal of routine business that need not be reported back to the board.  That is one item, and there may be others. There are all sorts of documents to be signed and it takes a considerable amount of the time&mdash;it did in the past <Col N="1857" />&mdash;of members of the board to look after the Totalisator.</P>
    <P>I said it before, and I would like to repeat it, that I as Minister for Finance have been grateful to the members of the board for the splendid work they did in making such a success of the Totalisator.  This new body has to take over that responsibility and there is a lot of routine work in connection with it.  I am told&mdash;I have no personal knowledge&mdash;that sometimes there have been hours of labour in connection with the winding up of the day's work in respect of that one item alone and I do not think it would be fair to the board that reports on matters of a routine character, business which, though important and necessary, is still routine, should have to be made to the members of the board.  It would not be fair to the board, certainly in the initial stages, to have these items coming back day after day with, perhaps, other items, important in themselves, but purely of a routine nature.  It would take up time that could be more usefully employed with other aspects connected with work of the Racing Board.</P>

The Minister will appoint the board, but the board can appoint any sub-committee it likes to deal with matters affecting racing on the racecourses, be it bookmakers or any other matter, and they can say: &ldquo;The results of your work need not be confirmed by this board&rdquo;. That is very unfair.  Any sub-committees that are appointed by the board should be subject to confirmation by that board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 9, Section 23, before sub-section (3), line 26, to insert the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  Whenever the board, in the exercise of its powers under this section, refuses to grant a course-betting permit to a licensed bookmaker or suspends or revokes a course-betting permit held by a licensed bookmaker, the following provisions shall have effect&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the board shall inform the licensed bookmaker in writing of such refusal, suspension or revocation,</P>
      <P>(b)  the licensed bookmaker may, within seven days after being so informed, request the board to afford him an opportunity of making to the board, in relation to such refusal, suspension or revocation, representations, oral or written, and the board shall grant any such request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arose out of the discussion on the Second Stage and the Committee Stage of the Bill.  It was the view of a number of Deputies that there should be some way open to persons who were refused a permit to make bets on a racecourse to have their complaints brought before the board for further examination.  I hesitate to take away to any degree the absolute power that I sought to give the board to decide, without an appeal to any court, who should or should not <Col N="1859" /> have permits to make bets on the course.</P>
    <P>Deputies on all sides of the House expressed strong views that the persons aggrieved should have some way of bringing their cases to the notice of the board with a view to having further consideration of their grievances. It is for that reason I propose amendment No. 2.  It does not go as far as the amendment sent in by Deputy Breen, but I think it goes a long piece of the road to meet the views that he and others expressed, and to meet the perhaps not unreasonable claim that the person refused a permit, or whose permit was suspended or revoked, should have notice in writing to that effect, and should be enabled to write to the board or appear before it and orally state his case against the refusal of the permit and in favour of its being continued.  I do not think I can go any further in that matter, desirous as I am of making the board the final arbiters as to what persons may or may not have permits to make bets on racecourses.</P>

      <P>In paragraph (a) of the proposed new sub-section to delete the words &ldquo;inform the licensed bookmaker in writing&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;send to the licensed bookmaker a statement in writing of the grounds&rdquo;, and in paragraph (b) to delete the words &ldquo;after being so informed&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;after having received such statement&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reason for putting down an amendment to the Minister's amendment is to bring to the notice of the Minister an important point which I fear he may have overlooked.  That is the desirability of giving a bookmaker a right to be re-heard, giving him some form of appeal board.  On the Committee Stage the Minister refused to accept an <Col N="1860" /> amendment in which we asked that there should be an appeal back to the Minister.  I quite agree that it may not be a good thing to go back over the board to the Minister, but I now suggest that it should go back to the board as a whole or, perhaps, to more than half of the board.  Take a case where a bookmaker is refused a licence, say, by a board of five members.  Three of the five members may decide to withdraw his licence, and that is binding. Why not have another board of, say, the remaining members, who would confirm or reject that decision? I put down this amendment in the hope that the Minister will give further consideration to the matter.  I think that all people who hold licences from the Government are entitled to have some board to appeal to where there is injustice.</P>

      <P>(b)  the licensed bookmaker may, within seven days after being so informed, request the board to afford him an opportunity of making ... representations ...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Will the Minister include such words as &ldquo;pending the hearing of his representations, whether they be oral or written, the bookmaker shall be allowed to carry on&rdquo;?  I suggest that until such time as the matter is decided the bookmaker shall be allowed to carry on.</P>

Then the difficulty of the seven days arises.  The man may be absent from home and if the notice is sent by post he may not get it within seven days.  I think the amendment is incomplete in that respect and I believe it is necessary that the Minister should consider the matter again. The Minister will have to make some provision for serving the notice of revocation in order to ensure that the person concerned will have the necessary seven days in order to make his request to the board.</P>

What I should like to know is why has Dáil Éireann suddenly appeared to accept the proposition that all bookmakers in this country are rogues and vagabonds? Any bookmaker I ever knew was a decent, respectable man.  Some of them are neighbours of mine in Ballaghaderreen. There are others in Waterford and Dublin and, indeed, in every other part of the country.  I make no apology for naming some of them.  I knew Dick Duggan, I know Dick Power and I know John Keenan, and the idea that these men and others like them must be hunted and harried and restricted and made liable to their livelihoods being swept away without any right of appeal except to the persons constituting this board, seems to me to be an outrage.  Why should not a man who has reared a decent family <Col N="1862" /> and who has a perfectly legitimate business have a right to go to the courts if he believes that a statutory board has unjustly taken away his means of living?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking about the Minister's amendment.  There is a great fuss being made about giving an appeal and there are Deputies who say it would not be reasonable to ask the Minister to give an appeal to a judge. Why?  Have not these men got as much rights as we have?  We have got into the habit in this House of talking <i>in vacuo</i> as if we were remote from the people for whom we are legislating and cannot consider individual cases. I am considering individual cases.  If we are to come to individual cases and if we are to count up percentages in order to find out how many rogues and vagabonds there are among the bookmakers, as opposed to the rogues and vagabonds among the horse owners, we might get a very rude shock.  If we are to start counting heads, I would be very glad to count heads on behalf of the bookmakers and I will match every rogue and vagabond that the board can find among the bookmakers with two rogues and vagabonds among the gentlemen who own the horses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I object most strenuously to the general atmosphere that seems to have grown up that our purpose should be to eliminate bookmakers, that they are a damn nuisance and that we should have a nice clean Tote run by this board.  I do not give a fiddle-de-dee what the board does.  I am not a racing man, but I like to go to a race meeting occasionally and when I go there I like to see the bookmakers, because they provide a certain atmosphere by their personalities and an interest for the occasion.  Why then do we announce it as a great concession if, when a board of 11 members steps in and tells a man of Jack Keenan's or Dick Power's standing that he will not be allowed to put up his umbrella or earn his living, that he must get out <Col N="1863" /> of business, that man has no recourse to a judge of this State?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that they are inadequate and am I not entitled to say that?  I am not one bit grateful to the Minister for what he describes as a concession.  I say the amendment is inadequate and it creates a grave injustice, and the reason I make that case is because the House is inclined to accept sympathetically the Minister's amendment.  They are not thinking of individuals, but of a class.  I am thinking of the individual citizen of standing who may be told to-morrow that his livelihood is gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why does the House take up the position that it is utterly unreasonable <Col N="1864" /> to give that man access to the courts? If a licensed trader is deprived of his licence by a district justice, does anyone challenge his right to go to the Circuit Court and appeal against the deprivation of his licence?  So far as I know, members of the House will agree that that would only be fair and just.  Here a perfectly respectable man is brought before a board, every member of which is interested in the trade in which he himself is operating.</P>
    <P>Prominent individuals in the racing world in this country have on more than one occasion been deeply beholden to bookmakers.  Will anyone in this House challenge that allegation?  Suppose a bookmaker found himself in the position of having one member or a couple of members of the board up to their elbows in his book&mdash;and it is not impossible.  That bookmaker may think: &ldquo;I am having the screws put on me because I am threatening to bring this fellow before the Conyngham Club for failing to pay his bets, and if I do not give him a clear receipt for his bets, maybe the screws will pinch tighter and tighter still.&rdquo;  He is sitting among 11 friends and that bookmaker may be constrained to think: &ldquo;There is not one of the 11 I have not salted in my day, and they will be all glad to have a rattle at me for it.&rdquo; He makes up his mind that, perhaps, it would be better to take so-and-so's name out of his book.</P>
    <P>Why does he make up his mind to do that?  Because he knows that if the board, the 11 friends, combine to put him out of business, or if a majority of them, six out of the 11, combine to put him out of business, he has no appeal; he has no tribunal in the world to make the case to that they put him out unjustly, that they had made paupers of himself, his wife and children. He must go out, a man in middle age who has never known how to do anything but pick up some ticktack man's messages quickly.  He has to learn a new trade and become, possibly, a carpenter or a plumber, and all because he would not let X. off the debts he owed him.</P>
    <P>That is not my idea of justice.  I deliberately bring in the names of outstanding men in the profession of <Col N="1865" /> bookmakers, because it is very hard to assess an injustice unless you can picture somebody you know as its victim. Why should a man of Dick Power's standing, a man of John Keenan's standing, men who do not pretend to be aristocrats or powers in the land, who pretend to be nothing more than common, ordinary citizens earning their livings in an honest way, be deprived of the right of going to the courts if they feel themselves aggrieved? Everybody in this country has the right to go to the courts if his means of livelihood are threatened.</P>

      <P>We are discussing here the Minister's amendment No. 2.  I suggest that it is utterly inadequate, and I do not think the House should accept it as being in any way sufficient. I suggest that, unless the Minister is prepared to give an undertaking to restore to bookmakers the ordinary rights enjoyed by the humblest citizen of this State, this Bill will be of such a character as to deserve rejection on the Fifth Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Some people may imagine that under these amendments a concession is being made to the bookmakers. Actually, they are only being given the right of appeal to somebody. On the last occasion I suggested that the Minister should give the bookmaker who felt he had a grievance the right to go to court.  He would not accept the amendment on those lines.  It is a very serious matter to deprive a bookmaker of his means of livelihood. How are his wife, his family and himself to eke out an existence if such a thing happens?  Such a bookmaker may be carrying on a large business or a small one.  These bookmakers are honourable men, and ought to be entitled to carry an appeal against a decision of the board.  At the moment we do not know how this board will be composed.  The members of it may not be as angelic as we are led to believe they will be.  I am quite sure the Minister will endeavour to pick the best men he can get.  At the same time, it is not easy to find people of the character described to us by the Minister. That may be so sometimes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Minister is not prepared to give the right of appeal to the courts, perhaps he would give the right of appeal to the Minister himself. His would be an independent mind.  It would not be blackened against these particular men as the minds of the members of the board may be.  What I mean is, that if they once turn down a man they are not likely, later, to see any new points in his favour and grant him a licence.  I think it would be more satisfactory if there was the <Col N="1867" /> right of appeal to the Minister rather than to the board.  If the board turns down a man once, they are not likely to reverse their decision.</P>

      <P>In case the Minister should be persuaded by the eloquence of Deputy Dillon and Deputy Mrs. Redmond, I would like to say that, in my opinion, the Minister's amendment is quite sufficient.  No member of the House is more ready than I am to pay a tribute to the bookmakers of this country.  I did that on the Second Reading of the Bill.  I do not think there is any more honourable body of men in the country than the bookmakers. I can truthfully give them that character as one who, perhaps, has had more transactions with them over many years than any other member of the House.  As I said on the Second Reading, the bookmakers may have grievances under this Bill, but we must remember other sections of the racing public may also feel that they are aggrieved by it.  If the Minister is not prepared to give a general concession, and I am not at all sure that it would be a wise thing for him to do so, I do not see why he should pick out one class and give a special advantage to it.  There are other people besides bookmakers who, possibly, may feel that they are being victimised&mdash;men with families.  Tribute has been paid to the bookmakers, a tribute in which I have joined myself.  I would also like to pay a little tribute to the jockeys who sometimes are accused, though it may not be their fault at all since none of us can envisage the mind of a horse&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The jockey will feel <Col N="1868" /> aggrieved if he is not given the right of appeal.  The same thing may apply in the case of an owner.</P>

I think you will probably find more delinquents among other classes than you will among bookmakers.  I would like to see fair play all round. Hitherto, racing has been conducted as a sportsman's business.  The penalties inflicted in the past by the stewards of the Turf Club and by the National Hunt Steeplechase Committee have been accepted by everybody. We hope that the new board will carry on as the old racing authorities did.  Anything that would tend to shake the confidence of the public in the racing authority would be a bad thing.  I do not anticipate that anything of the kind will occur when this new board starts to function.  I am sure the members of the board will be an honourable body of men and will dispense justice fairly.  I do not see why one class connected with racing should get a favour that is not given to other classes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>My difficulty in accepting amendment No. 2 is that it goes back to amendment No. 1, under which the board may delegate to a committee any of its functions, powers and duties.  It is quite conceivable that the board might find it a rather tall order to go into the details of every bookmaker's licence and might delegate these powers to a committee. It is for that reason I see considerable danger in this for the bookmaker. This matter was discussed on Committee Stage, and I do not want to go into it in detail now.  The bookmaker is denied the right of appeal to the court and the only concession is that he may make written representation to the board and the board may receive such written representation.  It does not get him very much farther.  Therefore, the Minister should make it clear in the Bill that this is a function that <Col N="1869" /> should not be delegated to a committee, and that pending the hearing of an appeal the bookmaker should be allowed to continue in business.  If he holds a course betting permit I do not see any great objection to allowing him to continue until a decision is reached by the board.  The State has licensed him as a bookmaker, has given him a certificate as a bookmaker, and the right to a place on the course, and it is doubtful if he is not entitled to assert that right up to a point even against the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I would suggest that the Minister should add after clause (b) of amendment No. 2, the latter portion of the amendment submitted by Deputy Breen, that is, that, pending the decision, the bookmaker would be in a position to carry on his business.  I do not see that that would mean very much.  It might possibly be a month or two and in that time he might not get to many race meetings but, as we have debarred him of any right of appeal to the court, I think it is only reasonable to give him as much latitude in these provisions as we can.</P>
      <P>I would again impress upon the Minister that this should not be one of the functions that the board should delegate to a committee.  The board should accept full responsibility for this.  It would be very unfair to the bookmaking profession if they were to be put in a position that they could be vetted, as it were, by a committee, perhaps, of three persons, only one of whom might be a member of the board proper, the other two being officers of the board.  Deputy Dillon has painted the picture in rather colourful language. I believe that the bookmaker is no worse and no better than any other people who are making their livelihood out of racing and I think he is entitled to all the reasonable safeguards that this House can provide for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are giving very drastic powers to an outside body that has no responsibility to this House, good, bad or indifferent. It may make an annual report; it may present its accounts here but, beyond that, I do not see that we can interfere with it in any way other than by new legislation.  The board is appointed for a period of five years. <Col N="1870" /> There is no right of removal.  If the board acts in an arbitrary fashion towards the bookmaking profession and if it decides arbitrarily that it will reduce the number of course betting bookmakers to half the present number, there is no right of redress and the Minister has no powers by which he can interfere with the discretion or the decisions of the board in these matters.  Therefore, I think it is only reasonable for the Minister to accept the amendment put forward by Deputy Breen.</P>

We are restricted now to what is in the Bill and what is proposed in the amendment.  I regard it as a considerable concession to introduce the amendment that I moved here to-day. I have not a word to say against any of the bookmakers.  I have not the privilege of the acquaintance of any one of them.  As Minister I have met half a dozen bookmakers twice, on deputations. That is the extent of my knowledge of them.  I am sure that as a body they are just as honourable citizens as any other class of people.</P>

I think we have gone a considerable part of the road to meet the views put forward by a number of people who spoke here, some of whom said that they spoke with authority on behalf of bookmakers.</P>

      <P>I do not know them, but I give them credit for being as honourable citizens as any other class of the community.  I do not see <Col N="1871" /> many of them getting into trouble with this board or, if they want to carry on their profession so far as racecourses are concerned, I do not see why any of them should get into trouble with the board.  There is one thing which may be a source of irritation in the beginning to the bookmakers, that is the levy.  That will irritate them, undoubtedly, and it will be a troublesome, bothersome business.  They would like to get out of it, and around it and under and over it, and some of them might like to defeat it if they could&mdash; not the responsible members of the profession.  Once the law is passed, the responsible members of the profession will say: &ldquo;We will obey the law; we will carry out what is required.&rdquo;  But the board must have power to see that the levy is collected.  That is the only trouble that I see is likely to arise between bookmakers and the board.  The board must be in a position to say authoritatively to these people: &ldquo;If you will not collect the levy, you will have no permit from us.&rdquo;  That is the only time that they will come down with a strong hand, so far as I can see. I think it is necessary to give them the power to say that the levy is to be collected in the way the Bill sets out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to protest again in the most emphatic way against the manner in which this Bill enshrines the views (1) that the bookmakers are rogues and vagabonds, and (2) that it is a desirable thing to chase them off <Col N="1872" /> the racecourses of this country as soon as conveniently may be.  I deprecate both these views most strongly.  I have had an opportunity of explaining, on the Report Stage of the amendment put forward by the Minister, my view as to the propriety of depriving citizens of this State of access to the courts and I make no apology for returning to that again and again and again.  It is becoming the fashion in this country to deride anybody and to jeer at anybody who claims his right to seek protection of the courts.  That is all very well so long as you are depriving your neighbour of that right but any Deputy who lost his access to the courts would regret the loss very bitterly.  A practice has grown up in this country and other countries of setting up statutory bodies and giving these bodies which, remember, hold office by a tenure of office far different from that of a judge, the right to dispose of the livelihoods of individual citizens.  If you go to a middle-aged man and destroy his trade or profession you might as well put him in jail.</P>
      <P>Can this House ever ask itself: why give judges in the courts a special kind of tenure of office?  We did it in order to ensure that the humblest citizen would have a tribunal to which he could go in the knowledge that the judge presiding over it was immune from all kinds of influence.  Is not that so?  Therefore, if a man was charged by the most powerful citizen in the State, or if he was sued by a wealthy corporation, or if his antagonist in law was the most influential individual in the State, he knew that there was sitting upon the bench a judge before whom his case would be tried, who held office by a tenure that made him immune from any kind of influence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was that assurance that guaranteed liberty to every citizen of this State.  Remove that influence and you make the courts of law of this country impossible for the humblest citizen.  If a citizen is charged at the Central Criminal Court, or at the District Court, he stands liable to a sentence of six months in jail.  Is that a heavier penalty than for a middle-aged man to be told that he will not be allowed to practise his trade as a <Col N="1873" /> bookmaker?  Take the position of a bookmaker with a wife and family of six or seven children and a decent home.  If he is suspended he has no right of appeal to that kind of tribunal where the Minister wants to go, and where I want to go if charged by the State with committing any crime, or if sued by a wealthy antagonist in a civil suit.  I wish I could make Deputies realise the gravity of the position.  In the United States of America men are ruined every day because they are liable to be attacked by wealthy corporations.  If they go to courts of a certain character, municipally elected courts, these people know they cannot get justice, because the judges being elected depend on influence to get their jobs back at the end of their term.</P>
    <P>This board depends on the goodwill of the Minister to get its job back at the end of five years.  The Minister in determining whether the board shall be elected or not must depend on his expert advisers on racing.  He stated himself, and I suppose his successors will say the same, that he knows nothing about racing, that he must depend on those who know the business acting in good faith and with good will.  The bookmaker knows that, and he knows that in fact this board and the men on it will advise the Minister as to the constitution of the next board.  He knows that if he quarrels with this board he will quarrel with all boards, and that he has no means of getting what he conceived to be justice.  From the very beginning his prosecutor is his judge.  Is there any such state of affairs in this State, where you ask a man to go to be tried by the same body that makes the charge against him? Is it not the officers of the board that bring the charge against the bookmaker? The Minister assents to that.</P>
    <P>Can Deputies conceive a charge being made by a Gárda Síochána and a person being brought to the Gárda station and tried by the sergeant who signed the charge, and then being told that there was no right of appeal? The accursed practice of considering this matter <i>in vacuo</i> is developing in this House.  The bookmaker becomes a sort of worm.  I am thinking of the <Col N="1874" /> individual who earns his living harder than I earn mine, who works as hard at his trade as I do in my shop.  He earns a living just as independently as I do, who never got subsidy or State assistance, and who pays his taxes and reared and educated a family.  The idea that they are by Statute going to be placed in the position of being prosecuted and charged by the same person&mdash;the board in this Bill&mdash;without having an opportunity of going to the courts seems to me so brutally unjust as to be inconceivable.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that he does not believe that any bookmaker will ever get into trouble with the board.  It might not happen in a decade.  All I ask is that once every ten years an opportunity should be given to one man to decide whether he was not wise in going to the Circuit Court and having his affairs discussed in public before the whole country.  We assume that nine out of ten bookmakers will be guilty of such flagrant offences that unless they are mad they would not go and have the details of the offences published in the Circuit Court.  My application boils down to this, that once in a century one bookmaker will go to the Circuit Court to question the decision of the board established under this Act.  The knowledge that that right is there will prevent many injustices. Thousands of crimes would be committed only that criminals know that there is a Gárda Síochána and a Criminal Court that is able to do their duty.  Thousands of injustices are not done because those who would do them if they dared fear to face the impartial administration of the civil courts.  It may be that if we give bookmakers a right of appeal to the Circuit Court against decisions depriving them of the right to practise their trade that such an appeal will never arise, that the board will forbear victimising any bookmaker unless the case is so clear that there can be no question about it.</P>
    <P>I claim the right of every citizen to have access to impartial judges who hold office by judicial tenure, before being deprived of the right to a living. I make no apology to Deputy Bennett, or to anybody, for claiming that right for bookmakers.  I claim it for chimney <Col N="1875" /> sweeps and crossing sweepers just as I claim it for what is at stake in this case.  I claim it for bookmakers now.  I do not claim it as a concession. I claim it as a right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know very little about horses.  I do not pretend to know the methods by which jockeys or trainers are controlled.  I am not speaking as an expert at all.  I am speaking as one concerned for liberty and for the right of simple men who live their lives in peace and in security.  I should add that I have never discussed this Bill with a bookmaker.</P>
      <P>The other thing in this Bill which I want to object to is that it is a thoroughly rotten Treasury principle to authorise bodies by statute to collect levies to finance themselves.  If taxes are to be levied on the public, they should be levied and paid into the Exchequer and let the Exchequer pay out what it pleases or what the Dáil thinks it right to pay out to statutory bodies, such as the Racing Board, or any other board.  I do not believe it is a sound principle to be earmarking certain parts of the revenue for certain services.  The origin of this two-and-a-half per cent. or five per cent. which is to be levied on course betting was the ordinary betting tax put on as an ordinary revenue-raiser, taxation on all bets on horses, and that went into the Treasury in the past.  Then, because it was extremely difficult to collect, and because the bookmakers made a case that it made the practice of their business on the racecourse almost impossible, I think it was waived on racecourse bets and maintained on betting office bets for the benefit of the Treasury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we are to have a situation in which the tax levied on the office bet is to go to the Treasury, and the tax levied on the course bet is to go into the coffers of the Racing Board under the Bill.  I think that is a rotten principle, and a very dangerous one, because if you establish statutory bodies and earmark certain blocks of revenue, and give them the right to raise <Col N="1876" /> revenue and to levy a tax, you are embarking upon a course of action which I think the Department of Finance will have very grave reason to regret in time to come.  I do not think it is necessary to elaborate that to any Minister for Finance; his own officers will explain to him the dangers of that procedure more adequately and effectively than I can.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the finance view of it, I understand the Minister some five or six or ten years ago heard bookmakers on the difficulty of collecting a levy on the racecourse.  We all know that if we put on half-a-crown with a &ldquo;bookie&rdquo; and the horse wins at 5 to 1, we expect to get 12/6 and our own half-crown back.  The Minister is a mathematical man.  What is 2½ per cent. on 12/6?  Reckon up that.  Reckon it up with 25 fellows roaring like bulls to get paid, and 35 fellows standing on the outside of them roaring like bulls to get bets on for the next race, and the poor fellow who is standing beside you trying to make that sum up and trying to keep your book right so that your money will not be flittered away. Is that a reasonable burden to put on the bookmaker?  How much is it expected to get out of this tax?</P>

    <P>Is there anyone in this House who is in business and who has experience of inspectors?  With two friends, I went down to Connemara, to the Gaeltacht, a couple of days ago.  We went to visit an old lady friend of ours whose house stood about 100 yards up from the road.  I went there with some <Col N="1877" /> people who were experts in the Irish language, to see how the language was getting on in what was the FíorGaeltacht, if there was any such thing in Ireland.  We got out of the car on the road.  There were 100 yards of road up to the woman's house.  I could see her looking over the half-door when we got out of the car.  When she saw us climbing the fence to go up the road she clapped out the door and ran in.  My friend said to me: &ldquo;Is dóigh léi gur cigirí sinn&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;She thinks we are inspectors.&rdquo;  Up we went to the house.  She was an old friend, but she could not recognise us 100 yards down the road.  We stood for several minutes at the door before she would open it.  When she did, there was a light of battle in her eyes which I had not seen there for over 20 years.  She said: &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; My friend said: &ldquo;An aithníonn tú mé?&rdquo;&ldquo;Ní aithním,&rdquo; said she.  Then he made himself known to her in Irish, and she looked at him and said: &ldquo;Ba dhóigh liom gur cigire a bhí ann.&rdquo;  I said to him as we came away: &ldquo;The whole of this country is hag-ridden by cigiri.  We cannot eat our breakfast, or put a lump of coal or a sod of turf on the fire or open or shut our shops or sell our goods or plough our lands or offer crops for sale without the ubiquitous cigire.&rdquo;  The ubiquity of the cigire is bad enough, but the universal dishonesty that his arrival has precipitated throughout the land is infinitely worse.  The whole country is in a conspiracy to best the cigire.  Lies, fraud or any other remedy that will put down an inspector is now considered legitimate throughout the length and breadth of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Sections 28 and 29 of this Bill swarm with cigirí and they start out on their career with clear notice that they will have to contend with fraud, misrepresentation, falsification of books, and every other recourse which can be had in order to mislead them as to the true liability of a bookmaker whose books they are sent to inspect.  Do you think the cigirí will be able to get round the misrepresentation which will take place as to the true liability of each individual bookmaker if the bookmakers made up their minds to get the <Col N="1878" /> best of the cigirí?  They will not.  You will turn every bookmaker in the country, in his own defence, into a bester and a fraud.  If he keeps true books, in his heart he will feel that he was the only bookmaker in Ireland who did.  He will say to himself: &ldquo;Why should I pay 100 per cent. of my tax when all the other fellows can get away with 50 per cent. by adapting their accounts a little?&rdquo; Deputies need not be shocked.  We are all familiar with the process of filling up income-tax forms.  I venture to say that if I went round to every Deputy who has paid income-tax in his day and asked him to put his hand on a Bible and swear that he never made an ambiguous entry on an income-tax form, he would take his hand off the Bible.  This tax will be as heavy a burden on the average bookmaker as income-tax is on the average income-tax payer.  Great difficulties will arise in the collection of the tax and it will make the work of the bookmaker standing under his umbrella on the course almost impossible.  At the back of this Bill and in the minds of those who were advising the Minister when he drafted it, is the belief that the Bill will ultimately mean the end of the bookmakers on the racecourses of Ireland.  I believe that the purpose of those promoting this Bill is to drive the bookmakers off the racecourses. I would issue this warning&mdash;the gentlemen who are concerned to do that are failing to see the wood for the trees.</P>
    <P>Racing in this country depends on the men and women who go to races for a day's outing.  If you restrict the crowds attending race meetings to those interested in horse flesh in a scientific way and in form and the like, race meetings will be very sparsely attended.  The average individual going out for an evening's sport is not going out in the hope of making a living out of it, he is not going out professing to be a critic of horse flesh but in the hope of finding some fellow with a good tip, who will give him the tip before the bookmaker hears of it. Painful experience has taught him that, even then, it will be damn little good unless he can catch a poor gom of a bookmaker before the bookmaker knows as much as he knows.  He very <Col N="1879" /> rarely succeeds, but he gets a bit of a thrill out of it and comes home a sadder and a wiser man as a general rule&mdash;unless the favourite falls and, providentially, it sometimes does.</P>
    <P>If you put the bookmaker off the course, by removing all that excitement and colour from the racecourses, a very large percentage&mdash;more than 50 per cent.&mdash;of those who attend race meetings will cease to attend them.  It will no longer be a day out.  If that happens, I do not care what prices you have, what race boards you have, what amenities for horses, trainers and jockeys you have, racing will die in this country and, if racing dies, the horse-breeding industry here will die, too.  In the last analysis, the horse-breeding industry depends on the mug, the person who attends the race meeting for the fun of it.  The hub of that fun is the bookmaker's umbrella. I am convinced that this Bill is designed to wipe out the umbrella. These gentlemen think that it is better policy to run racing on the <i>parimutuel</i> system, as it is easier to collect the race board's revenue out of the Tote than it is from the bookmaker.  I believe they have sold that idea to a great many people in this country who ought to know better, people who have been racing all their lives, who believe themselves to be deeply concerned with the horse-breeding industry and the success of the export trade.</P>
    <P>I do not want to over-state my case, but very often what sounds a paradox is, in fact, the truth&mdash;the horse-breeding industry ultimately depends on the bookmaker's umbrella.  Destroy the picturesque character of racing as a sport and you will reduce its supporters to such meagre dimensions that the sport will die.  Mind you, sports have died out in this world because the picturesque surroundings associated with them vanished and the bare execution of the sport ceased to attract &mdash;or, at least, ceased to attract a sufficient section of the community to justify the maintenance of the sport. Racing as a sport might or might not be a social loss, but the horse-breeding industry would be a very severe economic loss to this country if it <Col N="1880" /> should be injured.  It depends on racing for its successful maintenance; racing is its shop window&mdash;racing and international horse jumping are the two shop windows, the twin branches of the breeding industry.</P>
    <P>Suppose you had the International Horse Jumping Competitions conducted in a fifty-acre field, with none of the trappings of the Royal Dublin Society about it, how many people would come to those jumping competitions? What makes that crowded function a success?  What makes the horse shows in New York and other places crowded fashionable functions, to which everybody goes, and which creates the market for the class of horse, the jumper or the hunter, which is displayed there?  Is it not the pageantry associated with them?  Do not misunderstand me.  I know that people who use these horses and buy them are the &ldquo;huntin' men,&rdquo; the &ldquo;huntin', shootin' and fishin' men,&rdquo; but the people who want to sell that class of horse bring those men to their stables and their studs by the publicity that they get at the shows.  They make of the shows the biggest parade that they possibly can.  It is the picturesqueness of the whole business which makes the shop window of the show-ground effective for the hunting class of horse; it is the picturesqueness of the racecourse which draws the crowds to see the racehorses and gives the publicity requisite to the breeder of racehorses to secure the custom from all over the world that we had in the past.</P>
    <P>Let not the efficient experts of this country, the five-year planners, embark upon their plans without having carefully considered every aspect of this matter.  They may know much more about horse flesh and pedigrees and training secrets and the practice of the course, but they do not know half as much as I know of the mentality of the ordinary racegoer, who would not know one end of a horse from another.  Let them beware lest, in their desire for success, they destroy what they seek to strengthen.  I want to make racing a prominent, legitimate and agreeable amusement for the people of this country, partly for their <Col N="1881" /> legitimate entertainment but mainly so that we may have a good shop window wherein to sell our bloodstock to the world.  I go so far as to affirm the paradox: the racehorse-breeding industry ultimately depends on the bookmaker's umbrella. Close one and, sooner or later, you will close the other.  Pursue the policies laid down in this Bill and you will close the bookmaker's umbrella and it may be then too late to save the horse-breeding industry in this country.</P>

      <P>I can find myself in agreement with many of the things Deputy Dillon has dealt with, so far as important principles are concerned. In regard to the individual's right of appeal to the court, I can appreciate the Minister's difficulty.  In this particular case, we are constituting bookmakers tax collectors and; when they are appointed to that work, the people who make the appointment and issue a permit to stand up and make a book on a racecourse, obviously must have some power to compel them to carry out that duty.  If they had not the power to cancel or revoke a permit, the only source of revenue the board would have would largely disappear.  I think that is the Minister's difficulty and we all appreciate it.  Deputy Dillon was not quite fair in his approach to this matter, when he compared the proposals here with what obtained a few years ago, when the bets tax was for revenue.  The vast majority of the people who attend race meetings will be satisfied to pay tax, when they know and appreciate that it is to be used for the purpose of improving horse breeding in the country generally. Furthermore, the people interested in the horse-breeding industry will not hesitate and will not be critical of the proposals here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must appreciate that the big punters in this country are the people who are interested in the horse-breeding industry, and they are the people who will make the biggest contribution so far as this proposal is concerned. I merely want to make this point: I think that this piece of legislation can be and, I hope, will be very useful and very advantageous so far as the horse-racing and horse-breeding <Col N="1882" /> industry is concerned, and I think that the success or otherwise of this piece of legislation will depend to a very great extent on the Minister since the Minister has power, under the Bill, to select the board.  In my opinion, the personnel of the board will make all the difference between success and failure.  If you get a good board, then I think that the House may look forward to a board that will operate successfully in the interests of this very important industry.  I merely want to stress that point and to urge that, so far as the Minister is concerned, he will spare no effort to ensure that he gets the right personnel on the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BridgetMRedmond" hpid="Mrs. Redmond Mrs. Redmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say a few words about the board on this last Stage of the Bill.  I was anxious to put it again to the Minister that the public, generally, are not enthusiastic about the Bill, and we have to study the public, so far as racing is concerned, because it is the public who make the race-meetings possible. However, I shall not labour that point since a lot has been said about it already this evening, but we must remember the public in connection with the personnel of this board and make sure to have on it people who have a general knowledge of racing and who understand the racing and horse-breeding industry: people who own horses and who understand the various expenses which have to be borne.  We do not want to have on the board people who, in their own minds, may consider themselves expert, but who never had any real knowledge of the industry and who now may be put in the position of being able to dictate to the general public and the racing community what is good for them or not.  I would appeal to the Minister, when he is selecting this board, to select people who have a practical knowledge of racing in all spheres&mdash;not merely people who have owned a horse or two for the last two or three years, but people who have had a long, general knowledge and experience of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have in mind a person who has that knowledge and experience <Col N="1883" /> within his bones, so to speak, and who, although he may not wish to show off his knowledge, can have complete confidence in his own judgment and can stand up against the opinions of anyone, either in this country or in any other country, in the matter of horseflesh: one who, from his experience, thoroughly understands the question, knows what he is talking about, and is capable of putting racing on a better footing than it has been in this country for a number of years now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this Bill will do a lot of good for racing in general, but I am concerned with the question of the board.  As a small owner myself, I feel that the small owner will not get a fair crack of the whip.  The tendency lately is to have no small race meetings in the Midlands or the West of Ireland.  I remember when, about 15 years ago, you could start off with your racehorse at Mullingar and go down to Sligo and all the small towns in the West of Ireland and find plenty of race meetings.  Even before this emergency the tendency was to cut off the small meetings because they could not carry on on account of the expenses of the officials coming down from Dublin.  The result was that one meeting after another in the West of Ireland was discontinued, and we, the small owners, had no place to go with our horses and had to sell them, unless we were to come up to the metropolitan races in and around Dublin, where, of course, we would be competing with the big, moneyed people.  We were not in the position at that time to go into competition with these big people and, accordingly, were compelled to sell our horses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that what should really concern the Minister in appointing the board under this Bill is to get on the board people who will represent the small farmer-owner, because the small farmer-owner is the backbone of racing, and without him you cannot carry on racing or horse breeding in this country.  Take Westmeath alone: ten or 15 years ago every farmer there, practically, bred a horse, brought him up and ran him in a race at Mullingar, but for the last few years there has <Col N="1884" /> been no racing in Mullingar, Athlone, and from that down to Galway, and we are all cut off from racing.  Our only hope is that if some of our children are keen to ride, as many of them are, we can compete at the local gymkhanas, and that type of meeting is thriving in our part of the country and in the West.  You have a local gymkhana in almost every parish.  If we had those small race meetings, we could train our horses at home, and not have to send them to the Curragh or the big meetings, and our own boys could ride them at home, as used to be the case in our young days.  I want the Minister to try to put on the board genuine farmer-owners who will represent that type of meeting.  It would appear that at the present time the South of Ireland and all that part of Ireland seems to have grasped the whole of racing whereas, in the Midlands and in the West, down to Galway, we have no race meetings, because they were killed by overhead expenses and the expenses of officials from Dublin.</P>
    <P>In case the Minister has not had that in mind, I want to stress it strongly. He should bear in mind that a large part of our country is without race meetings at present, and if you want to encourage horse breeding, you should go back to the genuine farmer and get back to the old system of the small farmer-owner's horse, and put the small farmer-owner in the position where he will not be competing against millionaires.  What made the Irish horse in the old days was that you had these small meetings in almost every parish, where the owners could compete without having to undergo heavy expenses.  I would urge on the Minister to try to have such representation on the board.  I agree with the Bill in general, and I agree that the present Turf Club and the Irish National Hunt Club have kept racing clean all through, and I admire them for that reason.  Twenty years ago or so, I heard a lot of criticism, but it appears to me that they have always stuck to the straight thing, and I am glad to say that they have resisted temptation and that their record is a clean one.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Dillon, and I <Col N="1885" /> must say, as an owner myself, that I think the jizz and the jazz of race meetings will go if the bookmaker goes.  If, as an owner, I go to a race meeting, I like to have a bet of £4 or £5 with a bookmaker because, if I win, I have some chance of paying my expenses, whereas, so far as the Tote is concerned, I have no chance of paying expenses.  When I put my little &ldquo;fiver&rdquo; on at, say, ten to one with a bookmaker, I have a chance of winning £50, but in the other case everybody gets on to it and I have just the same chance as everybody else.  I think that the owner is entitled to have a small bet at a long price if he wants to do so.  Therefore, he wants to have the bookmaker there.  It may be necessary for him to have a little bet to clear his expenses because, heretofore, the stakes did not permit of his clearing expenses.  With the Tote, he might have no such chance.  If the bookmakers are done away with, it will be a bad day for racing.  I am glad that this Bill has been introduced because it will help the breeder, who is the backbone of racing.  However, I am afraid that a number of professionals who have got into racing lately may be put on the board.  There are very few Irish names amongst those. If you put representatives of the farmer-owners on the board, you will get racing in a clean state.  That is not to say anything against the Turf Board or the N.H.S.C.  I have always admired the way they ran racing and the manner in which they kept it straight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not claim to interpret the public view of this Bill any more than any other Deputy.  Certain Deputies arrogated to themselves the right to interpret public opinion so far as this measure was concerned.  I do not know whether or not they have succeeded in estimating with accuracy the general view of the measure.  So far as I can see, the majority of people who attend race meetings have taken little or no interest in the Bill.  They have read whatever portions of the debate appeared in the papers and have taken their opinions from those.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real reason why they have no very definite opinions for or against the <Col N="1886" /> measure is that they have not had the advantage of reading the Bill or have not understood it.  Lest the opinion should go abroad that the House is unfavourable to the measure, due to the fact that the opponents of the Bill have been more vocal than its supporters, I should like to say that, so far as I understand the measure, and so far as the majority of Deputies are concerned, it is desirable and would be necessary, if racing were to revert to the condition in which it was prior to the boom which it is now enjoying.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with certain definite aspects of racing and horse breeding. I do not propose to recapitulate the provisions of the Bill with which we dealt on Second Reading.  If it is contended that the Bill abolishes, or will tend to abolish, bookmakers, or tend to mitigate or lessen their rights, then, surely, the same provisions referring to owners, breeders and jockeys must limit the rights and privileges of these parties.  While I am firmly in favour of retaining bookmakers, I do not concede that bookmakers should be allowed any further right of appeal to the Minister or to the courts than the jockey or trainer if he comes under the strictures of the board or is warned off the course.  It is perfectly ludicrous to make the case that bookmakers are entitled to more advantageous treatment than jockeys, trainers or owners. All these sections are necessary for the well-being and progress of racing. Each one of them has its own function to fulfil.  It was never intended&mdash;I should certainly oppose it if it had been&mdash;that their rights or privileges or sphere of operations should be limited, more than they are at present, after the enactment of this measure. It has been contended here that one or other section is the backbone of racing and that, if such a section were to cease to exist, racing would come to an end.  The truth is that all these interests and sections, which have been referred to as the backbone of racing, are essential.  Any one of them will, I think, admit that the others are essential. If some people have deduced from certain observations made here that bookmakers will be abolished under this Bill or that their spheres of <Col N="1887" /> activities will be limited, then I should like to disestablish that opinion.</P>
    <P>The proposed levy differs from ordinary taxation.  The tax formerly in operation in respect of course bets went into the Central Fund.  The levy which it is proposed to impose under this Bill will go back into racing. Deputy Fagan has rightly told the House that the cessation of small meetings has meant that the opportunities for small owners and farmer-owners to run horses have become very limited.  In the next breath, he told the House that the small meetings were not sufficient, and that the only method by which an owner could improve his financial position or maintain a horse in training was to secure a bet at a fairly long price.  This Bill is designed to put an end, if possible, to the necessity for a small owner making a bet larger, perhaps, than he may be able to afford.  It is designed to increase the stakes at small meetings, and at all meetings, if the fund is sufficient, so that owners, whether small or large, will have sufficient for which to race.  Most Deputies who have any knowledge of racing or horse-breeding will remember that, a few years ago, a commission was set up to inquire into the horse-breeding industry.  One of the first recommendations of that committee was that stakes should be increased and better provision made for trainers and owners.  So far as they could see, the future maintenance of racing at the level at which it then was was dependent on adequate stakes.  If that be so, surely a measure of this kind, which has as its prime object the betterment of stakes and the further advancement of the home and export trade in horses&mdash;the trade is mostly export&mdash;has many features to commend it.  A number of Deputies, particularly Deputy Hughes, put their fingers on the kernel of the problem.  Deputy Fagan referred to it from another angle.  A board of proper personnel is the most necessary portion of the scheme envisaged by this Bill.  There should be on the board people who are experienced in racing.  I may as well add that it is not essential for membership of the board that a person <Col N="1888" /> should be either a large owner or a small owner.  A person may have expert knowledge, although he never owned a horse, provided he has sufficient experience.</P>
    <P>It might easily be that a person would be better equipped to be a member of the board because of the fact that he was not directly interested in either sphere of activity, so far as racing is concerned, but in order that adequate representation of all interests may be given, the section of the Bill which deals with the personnel of the board provides that certain characteristics are essential, such as that a person has practical experience in the management of racehorses or the ownership or breeding of racehorses, or is connected with bookmaking or other like pursuits.  On the personnel of the board the success of the measure depends primarily, and secondly on the public receiving a proper and true perspective of the functions of the measure, free from all distortions, either of exaggeration or of other injurious suggestions, concerned with the functions of the board and the provisions of the Bill.  I cannot prophesy what effect the Bill may have, but we all hope sincerely that the enactment of this measure may result in the creation of a proper, effective and efficient board which, I may say, will not receive any remuneration for its services.  So far as I am concerned, I have no fear for the future of racing as a result of this measure.  On the contrary, I look forward to a more prosperous era when racing resumes its normal course, when the money which is now so freely distributed and the large owners who have come here from elsewhere may disappear. When these normal times return, stakes will of necessity require financial assistance from some source, and the alternative to the fund proposed to be created under the board is subsidisation by the State.  I am quite sure that equal objection, possibly far more vigorous objection, would be made to direct subsidisation from the Exchequer.  However, we need not go into that now.  I hope the Minister will give consideration to the various interests connected with racing before deciding on the personnel of the <Col N="1889" /> board and, if he does, I am quite confident that the board and the Bill will be a success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The sole purpose of the Bill is to improve racing in the country.  If it does not succeed in that, then the Bill will have been a failure. It is agreed, generally, I think that racing has been having on the whole a fairly prosperous time in recent years though, as Deputy Fagan pointed out, there are many parts of the country where no meetings have been held. Nevertheless, I think it is agreed by those who are in a position to know that racing, on the whole, is enjoying a prosperity now that it had not enjoyed for a long period.  There was a time not so long ago when racing was not prosperous, when not alone small meetings but a number of the more important meetings in the country were though held&mdash;perhaps not held as often as before&mdash;regarded as failures because of the lack of horses and the small attendance of the public.  It is quite possible that at some period after the war, racing may not know the prosperity it is enjoying at present. It is to try to provide for the rainy day, the day that will not be so prosperous which may come on racing again, that this Bill is brought before the House and that we are asking the House to pass it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is some advantage in the fact that a person like myself, ignorant of racing, was put in charge of this Bill, though some may hold that it might be more profitable if others who are familiar with racing or with the science or art, whichever it be, connected with racing&mdash;and there are people in the Government who have knowledge of these matters &mdash;were put in charge of the Bill.  On the other hand, it might be said that people with a good knowledge of racing might have strong prejudices one way or another.  I have none; I have no knowledge of the subject except what I have obtained since I started to study the Bill.  I have not consulted any special interests; any information I have got, I got from my official advisers and nobody else.  I have no prejudices against bookmakers, <Col N="1890" /> none at all.  I have read reports of meetings of bodies, experts on racing, who recommended that, in the interests of racing and stock-breeding, bookmakers should be abolished.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with them.  I am wholly in agreement, though not knowing much of the subject admittedly, with the description given by Deputy Dillon as to the attractiveness given to race meetings by the presence of bookmakers.  I believe that is correct though I do not agree&mdash;I think it was a grossly exaggerated suggestion&mdash; that if the bookmakers were to disappear, the racehorse would disappear along with him.  That is a gross exaggeration to my mind.  It is quite possible that Deputy Dillon is right in saying that 20 per cent. of the people attending race meetings go there because of the attractiveness of bookmakers. That may be; whether it be true or not, there is no suggestion, nor was it in my mind or in the minds of those who are my advisers, that bookmakers should be abolished.  There is no suggestion of that type in the Bill or at the back of my mind.</P>
    <P>I do not regard bookmakers as rogues or vagabonds which Deputy Dillon said was the interpretation to be put on the sections of the Bill dealing with bookmakers.  They are a class as decent and honest as any other class in the community and there is nothing in the Bill that will hurt them if they obey the law.  As I said earlier, the only thing that may cause them annoyance or irritation is the collection of the levy.  I frankly admit that the bookmakers will dislike the trouble of collecting the levy though if they look to their own interests, I respectfully suggest to them they will put up with the bother, whatever it is, of collecting the levy in the hope&mdash;I go further, in the belief&mdash;that if this Bill is a success and if it improves racing, it is going to improve their own profession.  It is going to increase largely the numbers who will go to races.  It will increase the prizes provided for successful horses at race meetings and, therefore, make race meetings more attractive for the breeder, the owner, the jockey and the trainer, and also, as <Col N="1891" /> I contend, for the bookmaker eventually, if the Bill is a success, as I hope it will be.</P>
    <P>The case that Deputy Dillon made about special privileges for bookmakers with regard to appeals in certain types of cases was properly and efficiently answered by Deputy Cosgrave. He pointed out that they are in no worse position than a variety of other people who are connected in one way or another with racing.  The same may be said of people connected with a variety of other sports as well. Where the ruling authority on those sports gives a decision, there is no appeal, and usually the decision is accepted without appeal by the generality of the people concerned.</P>
    <P>There is not much else I have to say, except that I will do my best to get as representative a board as I can get, remembering that there are to be only 11 members on that board to represent all aspects of racing and horse breeding.  I will try to get as wide a representation as possible within the limits of that number, also bearing in mind that a majority of the members of the board&mdash;that is, six out of 11&mdash; must be selected from two recognised societies connected with racing.  Within those limits, as objectively as one human being can, without prejudice of any kind&mdash;I have no friends in the business that I know of; I have nobody that I could regard as a great friend, who has any influence with me to push me in one direction or the other as far as that board is concerned&mdash;I will try, with the help of my official advisers, to select as representative a board as possible.  I know it will not satisfy everybody.  I do not think anybody in my position could hope to satisfy all the interests concerned, but I will do the best I can to get a board that will represent all important sections of the industry, the small and the large breeder, if possible, and others connected in any way with making racing in this country the success which it has been in the past and which I hope it will be in the future.  I cannot add any more to that.  I will disabuse my mind of all prejudice, and get down to looking at the list of those who are <Col N="1892" /> in the racing calendar and who are members of the different societies; for the other five I will try to make as representative a selection as I can.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.

The whole of the law, with the exception of the Constitution, is contained in the English language only, and numerous words and phrases used in the law have been given technical meanings, as distinct from the ordinary meanings, by statutes and judicial decisions.  It is necessary to have corresponding technical terms in Irish, in order that Irish may be used for legal purposes. There is no difficulty about finding Irish translations for technical terms, but, on account of the very nature of technical terms, a dispute may arise as to whether any particular translation conveys the technical meaning assigned to the original English term. No doubt, if people used Irish extensively for legal purposes, a standard vocabulary of Irish technical legal terms would be established in course of time as a result of judicial decisions. That process would take a very long time, however, and people are unlikely to use Irish extensively for legal purposes until an authoritative vocabulary of technical terms is available.</P>
      <P>I do not think I have any more to say.  The Bill is self-explanatory.  If anything, it is overdue.</P>

      <P>I have not got very much to say on this Bill.  It may possibly do some good, and I do not think it will do any harm.  That is about all I can say either in favour of or against the Bill.  It is desirable that technical terms should have a fixed, recognised, official, Irish equivalent. It is not desirable that different people who want to use the Irish language should use different words to express technical terms in common use, and to which over the years a particular definition and connotation have been given by usage or judicial decision.</P>
      <P>I want to warn the Minister and whomever his advisers are going to be in this direction that this will not be an easy job.  It will be an extremely difficult thing to find just the type of man who will have a good knowledge of Irish, and at the same time be in a position to appreciate the finesse of legal phraseology.  I take the view that it is better in the public interest that people who are practitioners, whether at the Bar or in the solicitor's profession, should be good lawyers rather than good Irish scholars.  It is much more in the public interest.  The law affects people's property and rights and liberties, and there should not be any confusion about it.  Occasionally in our practice, we have come across people who, not from patriotic motives, but from a desire to avoid a rigid cross-examination by a particular man who, they think, does not know Irish, resort to the use of the Irish language.  I have had that experience myself, but fortunately in the particular case where the gentleman resorted to the Irish language I had a very efficient junior, who was efficient in the Irish language, and an efficient cross-examiner, so the thing did not come off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One possible useful result of this may be that unfortunate law students who are harassed at the moment in trying to pass the examinations required by the Legal Practitioners Qualification Act may have some sort of standard to guide them in their effort to pass their Irish examination. It is well known that the examination that has to be passed by solicitors' apprentices is of an extremely stiff <Col N="1894" /> character.  It may be some consolation to them to have some sort of dictionary or standard work of some kind which they can &ldquo;swot up&rdquo; for this particular examination.  At the present moment, there is no doubt that the effort which has to be put in by solicitors' apprentices to learn the Irish language in order to pass the necessary examination before they become qualified as solicitors is affecting their efficiency as law students and subsequently as practitioners. They have to give so much time and attention to the study of the Irish language for the passing of the final examination that it is undoubtedly affecting the standard of their legal qualification.  That is not merely an idle criticism; it is a fact.  To those who have the desire to see the Irish language in common use, who have the ideal, shall we say, even to envisage in the distant future the Irish language being the common language in the courts of justice in this country, I say that the effect on young students of having to spend so much time in doing what is at best the very dry work of learning law, and who in addition have to learn law in Irish, and also how to conduct cases through the medium of Irish, is that their one desire, having got that over them, is to leave the whole thing behind them.  If this is forced too far, so far from having the effect desired, of spreading the use of the Irish language in legal affairs, it will have the effect of completely killing it.</P>
    <P>I do not know from a perusal of the text of the Bill what functions this committee which it is proposed to set up will have.  It appears to be merely an ornamental body, so far as I can see from the provisions of the Bill. There are to be joint secretaries who would appear to be the real force on the committee.  These joint secretaries consist of a member of the Oireachtas Translation Staff nominated by the Government and a person nominated from time to time as occasion requires by the Government.  The phrasing would appear to give the impression that it is a representative legal body, but when it comes to the actual job of work that has to be done, we find that the only section which gives any light at all as to the functions, <Col N="1895" /> powers or authority of that committee is Section 3, whereby</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the Minister may by order declare that the equivalent in the Irish language of any specified term shall be such word or words as he thinks fit and specifies in the order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Before making that order, the Minister shall cause a draft to be prepared by the joint secretaries and shall then request the committee to consider and report on the draft.  The committee having considered and reported on the draft, the Minister may do anything he likes.  That appears to me to be the sole effect of this Bill.  The Minister may do anything he likes&mdash;he may ignore completely the suggestions of the judge of the Supreme Court, High Court or Circuit Court, the justice of the District Court, the barrister appointed by the Bar Council or the solicitor appointed by the Incorporated Law Society.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt whatever that there cannot be a precise legal equivalent for an English technical term, unless there is behind the work which goes into the framing of the Irish equivalent very rigid and experienced technical advice.  I assume that the idea will be to appoint some judge, barrister or solicitor to this committee who knows the Irish language.  I am not at all sure that it is desirable, and I am certainly quite sure that it is not necessary, that these legal gentlemen, whether judicial personages, or ordinary practising members of the Bar or the solicitors' profession, should know the Irish language or should have a very detailed knowledge of it. The real essential is that where a technical term is about to be translated into Irish somebody with a complete technical knowledge of the precise significance of that term, a competent Irish scholar if possible, one with legal knowledge and training should give advice as to what is required.</P>
    <P>I do not know whom the Minister intends to employ as the Irish scholars to get the equivalent Irish expression for a particular legal term.  There is no indication in the Bill as to the <Col N="1896" /> person by whom that will be done. One of the joint secretaries is to be a member of the Oireachtas Translation Staff, and presumably he has experience in matters of this kind, but we do not know who the other person may be.  I think it highly undesirable that the very difficult task proposed by this Bill should be carried out entirely by these two gentlemen, whoever they may be.  I do not know who is to do the job, and there is no indication in the Bill as to the person by whom it is to be done.</P>
    <P>I want to draw attention finally to the provision in sub-section (2) of Section 2, which sets out that one of the members of the committee shall be a judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court, nominated from time to time as occasion requires by the Government.  I think it undesirable that that provision should be in the Bill.  The nomination should rest with the head of the judiciary, the Chief Justice.  I do not know why it should rest with the Government.  The judiciary is independent of the Government and must be apart from it, and the Chief Justice appointed to that very high and very responsible position may be trusted to select the person who he thinks is the best to do the work to be done on this committee. The same vicious notion, if the Minister will pardon me for stressing the point perhaps too much, is carried into the other provisions of the sub-section in relation to the appointment of a judge of the Circuit Court and justice of the District Court.  In other words, the judicial representative on this committee is to be appointed by the Government.</P>
    <P>I submit that the proper method of appointment as regards the Supreme Court or the High Court would be appointment by the Chief Justice, and as regards the Circuit Court, by decision of the Circuit Court bench; and similarly with regard to the District Court; that is, that any judicial appointment to this committee should be made by the judicial body concerned and not by the Government. The Minister can be sure that he will get the best person, and the bad principle which lies behind the interference, or what might appear to be <Col N="1897" /> the interference, of the Government in a matter of this kind should certainly be avoided, if at all possible.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether everybody will accept the principle stated in some books of jurisprudence which we learned, or tried to learn, as students, that it is better for the law to be certain than to be just.  If this Bill brings any measure of certainty into the use of legal terms in Irish in connection with the administration of justice, it may do some good.  I hope it will not bring a further degree of uncertainty and I also hope we will not have that curious mixture of the Irish and English languages which is so characteristic of official documents&mdash;&ldquo;mise le mcas&rdquo; and &ldquo;a chara&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may rest assured that there will be certainty when the list of these terms is drawn up and the Minister gives his certificate. As to the membership of the committee, I do not see anything vicious in the Government having the right to appoint the members of the committee.  Naturally, they will not do it without consulting the judges. They would not dream of doing that, but the alternative would be for the judges themselves to appoint in each case and I do not see any particular merit in that.  I cannot imagine the Minister picking a man without consulting the Chief Justice when it comes to the Supreme Court appointment and similarly with regard to the High Court and the Circuit Court.  Neither do I see anything vicious or wrong in the Government, having got that advice, appointing the person whom they think best.  They would only regard him as the best person on the basis of the advice they had got.  I do not see any necessity to put that in the Bill because no Minister with any sense will appoint a man without finding out whether he is the most suitable man for the purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the last two members&mdash;one will be a member of the Oireachtas Translation Staff.  He will be a man with a competent knowledge of Irish.  Probably you will not get in the country any people with a better knowledge of legal terms than members of the Oireachtas Translation Staff.  That is <Col N="1898" /> the kind of work they have been doing for years.  The other person will be a person with legal knowledge, and a good knowledge of Irish also.  The idea is that these two will draw up a list of words, phrases and terms and submit them to the advisory committee. The committee will then present them to the Minister.  I may say that in almost every case the Minister will accept them.  There may be occasions when he may have some doubts, or there may be differences of opinion, and it might be necessary that he should have the right to decide, without having unanimity on the committee.</P>
    <P>On the whole, I do not see any reason why the procedure laid down here should not work satisfactorily.  I believe it will be a great help to students to have these terms presented in this form.  There may be certain differences of opinion.  For instance, one member of the committee might prefer one phrase and another member of the committee might prefer another phrase, but once the certificate is given that will remove all objections.  There are certain dispositions in different parts of the country.  For example, a Donegal man may use one expression, a Kerry man may use another expression, and a Connemara man might use a totally different expression.  If the committee makes a recommendation that, for a particular English word, the equivalent shall be a particular Irish word, and a certificate is given to that effect, that settles the matter, and the legal people will know where they stand, whereas at the present time they do not.</P>
    <P>I believe this procedure will work very well.  If anything, it is overdue. I admit it will not be an easy matter to get suitable people.  It will be easy enough to get a good man from the Oireachtas Translation Staff, but to get a legal man with a good knowledge of Irish may be difficult.  I assure the House that we will do our best to get a thoroughly competent member of the legal profession with a sound knowledge of the Irish language to assist a member of the translation staff in drawing up a list of terms and phrases.</P>
