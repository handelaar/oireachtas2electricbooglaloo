      <P>The answer is in the negative.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied that the position is yet sufficiently clear to warrant my asking the Dáil to come to a decision in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>No useful purpose would be served by adding animal feeding stuffs to the priority list as the demand for covered wagons for grain, <Col N="1540" /> fertilisers and essential foodstuffs is, at present, greater than the supply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state if the contribution by building operatives for wet time was reduced owing to the accumulation of funds; and if he is aware that many painters working on lamp posts, railings and petrol tanks are not now paid wet time benefit, although a weekly contribution is deducted from their pay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, I reduced by regulations, as from 8th October last, the contributions payable under the Insurance (Intermittent Unemployment) Act, 1942.  In the conditions prevailing, I consider that the reserve which the fund has accumulated should prove sufficient to justify the reduction of contributions.</P>
      <P>Men engaged in the painting and decoration of lamp posts, some types of railings and petrol tanks are not regarded as coming within the scope of the Act.  Whilst so engaged contributions are not payable by them and they are not entitled to benefit. Men who are engaged on the painting and decoration of buildings do come within its scope but the contributions they pay whilst so engaged are not available for benefit in respect of wet time occurring on work which is not insurable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state whether distributors of subsidised footwear for children have been advised that it is permissible for them to sell this footwear without contribution from local authorities to <Col N="1545" /> persons desirous of paying full price for it; and, if so, whether he is aware that this procedure cuts across the whole basis of price fixation for footwear settled officially with the boot and shoe trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Distributors of footwear under the Public Assistance Footwear Scheme have been advised by advertisement in the public Press and otherwise that it is not permissible for them to exchange such footwear otherwise than in return for vouchers issued by a public assistance authority. Vouchers authorising the holder to obtain footwear may be in one of the three following forms: (1) at the cost of the public assistance authority; (2) at less than the controlled price, the difference being paid by the public assistance authority, and (3) at the full controlled price.  Vouchers in the terms of from (1) may be issued in respect of the children of persons in receipt of home assistance, where the circumstances of the recipients would not warrant a contribution towards the cost being sought from them.  It is the duty of the public assistance authority to provide first for the most necessitous cases and claims for vouchers in the terms of form (1) would accordingly receive priority over those in the terms of form (2). No vouchers in the terms of form (3) would be issued until the requirements of the classes covered by forms (1) and (2) had been met.  The scheme is limited to the needs of persons (including persons permitted to purchase at the full controlled rate) who are eligible for public assistance by reason of the fact that they are unable to provide the full cost of footwear for their dependent children at current shop prices.  A local authority would, therefore, be exceeding its functions if it were to issue vouchers to any person who was able and willing to pay the full price but who had not been deemed eligible for the assistance involved in the supply of the footwear at the controlled rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the Deputy's question is in the negative. As indicated by my predecessor on the 28th June, 1944, in the debate on the Estimate for the Office of the Minister for Finance, consideration of the question of granting establishment to unestablished civil servants must await the completion of the actuarial investigation into Civil Service superannuation.  With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, I would refer him to the reply of the 20th September, 1944, to a somewhat similar question put by him on that date.  Officers who entered the service of Dáil Eireann after the 11th July, 1921, have already been afforded opportunities of establishment, where appropriate, by means of limited competitive examinations held on various occasions since 1922 and I am not prepared to consider making any further special provision for their cases: Particulars of any officers who were appointed to the staff of Dáil Eireann during the period from 11th July, 1921, but before the 6th December, 1921, are not available.</P>

      <P>May I inquire from the <Col N="1548" /> Parliamentary Secretary, in this connection, whether soldiers who are discharged from the armed forces and are in receipt of only nominal pensions will be debarred from employment on the schemes, inasmuch as the nominal pension would exclude them from the right to apply for unemployment assistance?  Will such persons be allowed to enrol for employment on such schemes, without regard to their claims for unemployment assistance, whether they have a small pension or not?</P>

      <P>Yes, but the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that, if an ex-soldier has a very small pension&mdash; say 15/- a week&mdash;he cannot apply for unemployment assistance.  Under the existing regulations, a person who has not applied for unemployment assistance cannot be called from the labour exchange to work on schemes of this character.  I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary if he will ensure that a fellow who served in the army and who has only a very small pension as a result of the short term of his service will not be excluded thereby from an opportunity to enrol for the purpose of being called to work, even though he is not entitled to unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>Dr. Mahr was appointed the official Irish representative to the Sixth International Congress of Archaeology to be held in Berlin in August, 1939, and he left Ireland in the preceding month to attend that congress, bringing his family with him to spend a holiday in his native home in Austria.  When war became imminent, he tried to return to Dublin but was unable to do so, owing to the delay in <Col N="1550" /> bringing his family from Austria.  He then reported to the Irish Chargé d'Affaires, with a view to getting a &ldquo;safe conduct&rdquo; to return to Ireland, but it was not possible to have this done and he was granted leave of absence without pay until circumstances permitted him to resume his position.

The Government may come to a decision in the matter.  No decision has been come to so far.  As I have said, the position has not been declared vacant and the question of appointing a successor does not arise. I do not think the House would expect me to answer the statement that Deputy Dillon has made, nor do I consider it within my province.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Bill has two objects: first, it enables Post Office Savings Bank funds to be invested in local stocks, that is, of a county, borough, or urban district; and, secondly, it enables a local authority to be put in funds, out of the Local Loans Fund, to enable it to exercise an option to redeem a stock issue after the first redemption date.  These provisions are contained in Sections 2 and 3.</P>
      <P>As the law stands, the range of investments open to the funds of the Post Office Savings Bank is rather limited, being confined to (a) our own Parliamentary stocks and public funds, (b) British Parliamentary stocks and public funds, and (c) securities guaranteed as to both principal and interest by our own Government.  It is desirable that the savings in the Post Office Savings Bank should be made available for investment, as and when thought fit, in the stocks of local authorities and Section 2 of the Bill provides the requisite statutory cover.  In sub-section (2), however, it is proposed to limit the additional power of investment to local stocks having trustee status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of Section 3 is to enable a temporary advance to be made out of the Local Loans Funds to a local <Col N="1559" /> authority to enable it to redeem a stock issue after the first redemption date fixed for the stock.  Under the law as it stands, an advance cannot be made out of the Local Loans Fund to a local authority for the purpose of repaying an existing loan, and while this provision is reasonable as general rule, I consider it may sometimes be desirable that the Government should be in a position to come to the aid of a local authority, if needs be, in order to facilitate it in a funding operation.  It is proposed in this Bill to take powers to utilise the Local Loans Fund for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The terms on which any advance would be made, including the interest and repayment period, would fall to be determined in accordance with the general statutory powers governing issues out of the fund.  Ordinarily, it would be the intention to make advances only on a short-term basis to tide a local authority over the interval that might necessarily elapse between the date of repayment of the stock and the flotation of a new stock, the issue of which, for one reason or another, might have to be postponed.</P>
    <P>As many Deputies, and particularly Dublin Deputies, are aware, the Dublin Corporation gave six months notice to the holders of approximately £794,000 worth of 5 per cent. stock falling due for redemption that they propose to redeem this stock on the 1st January, 1946.  The necessity for bringing forward this Bill at the present time is to enable me to co-operate with the Dublin Corporation in the redemption of this stock. For some time past the finance committee of the corporation have been engaged in preliminary discussions regarding the issue of new stock to enable it to convert this 5 per cent. stock into stock with a much lower rate of interest.</P>
    <P>These discussions were unduly protracted owing to the anxiety of the Minister for Local Government and myself that the terms upon which the new stock would be issued would be in keeping with present-day interest yields and the strong financial position <Col N="1560" /> of the corporation.  As it would be undesirable for the corporation to float a long-term loan between now and Christmas, I will be able, if this Bill is passed, and if the corporation has not raised the necessary funds from other sources, to make a short-term loan to the corporation on the 1st January, to enable them to redeem the 5 per cent. stock on that date and to postpone the floating of a long-term loan for a few months.  When the long-term loan is floated the Minister for Finance would be enabled, if Clause 2 is passed, to invest part of the funds of the Post Office Savings Bank in it, if such a course is then considered desirable.</P>
    <P>The existing position, in which the Post Office Savings Bank Fund, which has grown from £10,000,000 in 1939 to £32,000,000, cannot be invested in trustee stocks of a public authority is unnecessarily restrictive and completely out of date.</P>
    <P>Owing to the strong financial position of the State the security behind stock issued by the State and by local authorities is very high compared with that of many countries.  As Deputies are aware, very large capital developments have been planned by the State and by local authorities in order to increase the standard of life of our people.  In order that this capital development may take place on a basis which will throw the smallest possible burden on taxpayers and ratepayers, it is essential that the rates of interest on loans by the State and by local authorities should reflect our fundamentally strong position.  The amendments in the law which I propose are designed to assist the policy of reducing interest rates on new loans to the appropriate level.  Our dead-weight debt, as is well known, is only a small fraction of our annual national income although the service of debt in terms of taxation is substantial.  Our position, however, compares favourably with other countries in which the dead-weight debt is many times the annual national income.  The Government is determined that nothing will be left undone to secure that post-war capital development by the State and by local authorities will be based on a rate of <Col N="1561" /> interest which is in keeping with our relatively favourable financial position.</P>
    <P>I feel confident that I will have the support of the Dáil for the amendments in the law which this Bill seeks to effect.  But in order to enable me, if necessary, to co-operate with the corporation on January 1st next, I would be grateful if Deputies would assist me in passing the Bill to-day so that the Seanad may have sufficient time to consider it.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister explain one point that would be of interest to Deputies who support this Bill?  At what rate is it proposed to lend money to the Dublin Corporation in order to enable them to redeem the outstanding 5 per cent. bonds?  Will it be at 5 per cent. or 5½ per cent? There is no meaning in the proposal until we know what are the advantages of the Bill.  Or is the money to be lent at 3 per cent. or 3½ per cent.?</P>

      <P>Dublin Corporation wants about £794,000 next year to redeem the 5 per cent. stock.  We are prohibited at the moment from advancing any money out of the Local Loans Fund for the redemption of stock.  We propose, however, if they do not receive funds elsewhere, on the 1st January to put them in funds in order to pay off about £800,000.  The terms are still to be fixed between the corporation and myself, in consultation with the Minister for Local Government. They will not be 5 per cent. It is a short-term loan and we will make it as reasonable as we can.  We are not compelling the corporation to accept it.  If the corporation can put themselves in funds from other sources we shall be glad.  This is to enable <Col N="1562" /> them to postpone the floating of a public loan.  We want to put them in funds on 1st January to redeem the stock.  If it is necessary to issue the loan it will be a short term one.</P>

      <P>The Minister has dealt with something that we know of for a long time, that the Dublin Corporation is looking for money, and he implies now that the corporation intends to float a general public loan. Apparently the corporation is going to go before the Government are going to the public for a loan.  In these circumstances, it is a pity the Minister cannot be more explicit than he has been in his statement, because the corporation are not only looking for money to redeem loans, but they are also looking rather urgently for, approximately £1,250,000 for housing. There has been some public discussion about that.  In so far as it has been discussed here, particularly by the Minister for Local Government, anything that was said by that Minister would increase the difficulties of the Dublin Corporation in getting money at a reasonable rate of interest, according to the modern outlook. <Col N="1563" /> Perhaps it is no harm, if the corporation has to go for a loan, if they have to get some assistance, to allow them to bide their time until the public get over the misconception created in their minds by a statement made by the Minister for Local Government on 18th October, when discussing a motion of mine in relation to the amount of money the corporation are looking for.  On that date I moved the following motion:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that it is contrary to the public interest that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health should sanction an arrangement under which the Bank of Ireland will charge the Dublin Corporation and the Dublin Corporation will pay to the Bank of Ireland interest at as high a rate as 3¼ per cent. on a loan intended for the provision of houses under the Housing Acts.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his reply characterised the motion as &ldquo;a rash and foolhardy attempt&rdquo; on the part of Deputy Mulcahy to overthrow what has been the accepted policy, that lenders would be free to lend, and that people who have private property would be free to dispose of it in their own interest, having regard to the particular circumstances.  There was no question of the freedom of people to lend, but there was a question of sanction by a Minister of the State, and a public authority being forced by circumstances of any kind to pay as high as 3¼ per cent. for money for housing in present circumstances.  I should like to ask the Minister whether the corporation has been refused sanction to borrow at 3¼ per cent.  The Minister for Local Government declared in relation to my motion.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... that there never was a motion submitted to this House which had less justification on any ground&mdash; whether on the ground of expediency, whether on the ground of legality, or whether on the ground of public interest...&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I would <Col N="1564" /> remind the Deputy that a motion disposed of in this House cannot be raised again for six months.  It looks as if the Deputy is raising it.  Further more, it concerns the Minister for Local Government and Public Health who has nothing to do with the measure now before the House.  This is not a Bill for housing and neither is it a Bill dealing explicitly with the rates of interest charged to bodies engaged in housing.  This is a Bill of very limited scope, and I fail to see what the reply of the Minister for Local Government to a debate, supposed to have been closed in October, has to do with this measure.</P>

      <P>It has this to do, that the Dublin Corporation is looking for money.  The Banks' Standing Committee, by their action some years ago, prejudiced the credit of the Dublin Corporation by declining to subscribe to underwrite a particular loan.  They then stepped in and took up a very large quantity of the loan which the public, because of the action of the Banks' Standing Committee, had refused to take up, and by their action made substantial profits out of the transaction.  The Dublin ratepayers, on the one hand, and workers dwelling in Dublin, on the other, are likely to suffer by reason of the attitude taken up by the Minister for Local Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill may be of very limited scope.  The Bill, I hope, represents action taken by the Government in its general policy, to reverse the policy pursued up to recently by taking a more modern stand on the rates of interest that should be paid by the Government and by local authorities for loans required for public purposes.  The Minister indicated so much in the latter part of his speech.  I submit that it is most desirable on a Bill brought before the House, however limited the immediate purpose for which it is required, that we should consider the uses it may have <Col N="1565" /> in general directions as well as the general purpose for which it is intended.  I take it that the Minister is now going to make use of the moneys that are in the Post Office Savings Bank to come to the assistance of local authorities that may, require money for housing.  I hope that is his policy in connection with this Bill: that his policy is, as he has stated, to help in the general movement of bringing the rates of interest that are paid for for public purposes down to a more modern level so as to protect both the taxpayer and the ratepayer from the demands that may be made on them by the general holders of capital in this country, and to demand increasing services for the use of their capital in ways in which higher rates of interest would not be warranted.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Corporation, as well as requiring money for the redemption of certain stocks, require money urgently for the purposes of housing.  They have asked for sanction to borrow at 3¼ per cent.  Has that sanction been refused? Is it the intention of the Minister for Finance, under the powers that he is taking in Section 2, to make a loan to the Dublin Corporation to enable them to get out of their immediate difficulties with regard to housing, to finance them, even in a temporary way, until such time as they have gone in for the bigger loan which, he suggests, they are likely to go in for at the present time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to support the question put by Deputy Norton to the Minister, namely, the price at which he is going to lend moneys out of the Local Loans Fund.  The British Government have given substantial sums of money out of their Local Loans Fund to local authorities for the purpose of enabling them to fund certain debts.  They have given a very substantial amount of money.  I think that the rate of interest at which the British Government have lent these moneys to local authorities is 3 per cent. I would like to ask the Minister whether he can give us up-to-date information on these lines with regard to the position in Great Britain, and whether he can confirm what I say, that a substantial number of million pounds have been <Col N="1566" /> granted from the Local Loans Fund in Great Britain to local authorities there for the redemption of certain stocks, and that a higher price has not been charged by the British Government to these local authorities than 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that a substantial amount of Post Office Savings Bank moneys is invested in British Government securities.  I would like to ask him, what is the general rate of income from these securities to the Post Office Savings Bank?  I have already pointed out that about £28,000,000 of British Government securities, held by the Central Bank of Ireland, bring in an income of just 1.59 per cent.  Is the income obtainable by the Post Office Savings Bank on its British Government securities higher than the income that the Central Bank is receiving on its investments?  Can he tell us, in regard to the moneys that are being lent by the Post Office Savings Bank to the Dublin Corporation for housing purposes, even in a temporary way, the rate he intends to charge the Dublin Corporation for the loan of these moneys?  Can he also tell me how many local authorities can be served by the Minister for Finance under this Bill, and how many of them are stocks that come within the meaning of Section 2?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This particular subject is governed by two Departments, one the Department of Finance and the other the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  So far as I know anything about the subject, the Department vitally concerned in this particular matter&mdash;the Department of Local Government and Public Health&mdash;is in the background.  So far as the Minister for Finance is concerned, one finds it hard to quarrel with his presentation of his case if the main purpose of his introductory speech is to be taken as an indication that he is prepared to assist the Dublin Corporation.  The statement, however, carries a deeper significance than that since, as Minister for Finance, he has referred to the question of a long-term loan.  In regard to that, I would like to ascertain from the Minister if he has taken <Col N="1567" /> any steps in connection with the proposed long-term loan by way of showing that it can be deferred from the particular date intended.  In the course of his statement, he said that it was not proposed to undertake that loan for a period of a couple of months. I want to say something that I feel may have reactions outside.  I feel that I should speak on this with a certain amount of restraint because of what is contemplated and in view of what has now transpired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is known now, since the Minister has referred to it, that the corporation propose to float an extensive loan.  This Bill, mark you, is intended to assist the corporation in regard to portion of that loan, but the first intimation which the authority concerned has received in regard to that was contained in the statement the Minister made a few moments ago on the introduction of this Bill.  I happen to be chairman of the finance committee of the Dublin Corporation.  For a considerable time past I have been engaged in the negotiation in connection with that loan.  The last stage in these negotiations was reached about three weeks ago.  They were then, I understood, heading for a particular operation.  I will not be positive about this, but I believe the position to be that the authority concerned had no information whatever with regard to the steps taken as between the period of three weeks ago and the introduction of this Bill.  I mention that to illustrate the lack of co-operation there is between the Department concerned and an important body like the Dublin Corporation. This, to my mind, is exceedingly serious.  It is serious from the point of view that the proposed loan is intended to cover the question of the £800,000 required for conversion and that the proposed loan was to be at a certain figure which it was felt would meet with the approval of the Minister and certainly was satisfactory from the point of view of the corporation. It is at this stage that the question raised by Deputy Norton has importance.  He asked at what rate the accommodation would lie as <Col N="1568" /> between the Minister and the corporation for the temporary advance.  I say that is important in view of the arrangements the corporation had made on a definite figure so far as they were concerned.  Unless the Minister is prepared to ensure that the corporation will get this temporary advance from the Local Loans Fund at the same rate, then the public authority is going to suffer and it is going to suffer because of arrangements over which that authority has no control and, further, despite the fact that it has taken every step, as far as I know, to ensure the contrary.</P>
    <P>There are vital principles, therefore, at stake in this simple Bill.  I cannot quarrel with the Minister for Finance inasmuch as he does not seem to be the principal in the case but I should like to ascertain from him if he has intimated to the Minister for Local Government that the proposed loan to the corporation is to be deferred, and why, and to what date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I approach this Bill from a somewhat different point of view from those who have just spoken on it.  Deputy Mulcahy appears to approach this Bill mainly from the point of view of the Dublin Corporation and its requirements in the way of cheap money.  It is obvious that the corporation must get money as cheaply as possible and, when it does get cheap money, the loan must be subsidised, as in the case of housing. For many years I have been pressing, both in this House and outside, for a new view with regard to the Post Office Savings Bank.  The amount of deposits accumulated in the Post Office Savings Bank has increased enormously as year followed year.  If the Minister would give the figures which he has, I am sure the House would be satisfied that when we speak of deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank to-day we are speaking of very many millions of pounds and not, as we would have spoken, say, 20 years ago, of a few million pounds.</P>

First of all, the interest rate given to the depositor is 2½ per cent.  The only other deposit rate of interest that I know of in the city is the rate of 1 per cent. in the ordinary banks, that is, where you can get your money out without notice, on demand.</P>

      <P>It is on demand.  I am not talking of long-term arrangements. You have to give seven days' notice in the Post Office also.  We all know that if you go into a bank with £500,000 you have to make certain arrangements about its withdrawal but if you deposit a couple of thousand pounds in the bank you get a deposit receipt and can withdraw forthwith.  In connection with the Post Office, there is this consideration: individuals are limited to deposits of not more than £2,000 and certain classes of depositors are prohibited. For instance, business houses are prohibited from having money on deposit in the Post Office.  I welcome this Bill from this point of view.  For the first time, the Minister is bringing the Post Office Savings Bank up-to-date so that it can be used in the best interests of the community and will not be hidebound, as it has been, by antiquated Acts specifically setting out how the money deposited in the Post Office should be treated and withholding it from public use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In welcoming this new departure, I want to suggest to the Minister&mdash;I do not know whether I am out of order or not but the Chair is looking at me very gravely&mdash;that he should consider removing the limit of £2,000 and amending the regulations so that sums <Col N="1570" /> in excess of £2,000 can be deposited in the Post Office Savings Bank, provided it is deposited at a lower rate of interest and, also, for fixed periods, so that the old argument that has always been used in connection with the Post Office, namely, that if the Post Office were to take in unlimited amounts of money which could be withdrawn on demand, and which would result in the Post Office being closed up the next day, would not apply Arrangements could be easily made whereby people desiring to deposit larger amounts could do so at a lower rate of deposit interest and on the condition that the money, should be left there for fixed periods.  Now we come to the Bill proper and what it proposes to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I had to preface my remarks on the Bill by that statement. I want to see the Post Office Savings Bank attracting large sums of money so that large sums of money will be made available to local authorities at cheap rates.  The only way in which this Bill can help to make the Post Office Savings Bank a success in this connection is to provide that the money will be available in sufficient quantities.  I quite agree with Deputy Norton.  The first thing that strikes one here is that although the Minister says the corporation is free to go where it likes to shop for cheap money, nevertheless, the idea behind this Bill, is that if the corporation, choose to issue stock, the Bill would empower the Minister to invest Post Office money in such trustee stock, but the corporation, of course, would have to know how much it was going to be charged by way of interest.  At the present time we in the corporation have been seriously considering, working together, how best we can bring the rate of interest from its present high rate to a reasonably low rate.  We were offered facilities which we had never been offered before by the banks, by a particular bank, by way <Col N="1571" /> of a loan of money at what we thought was a very big reduction.  We were in a very strong position&mdash;I think Deputy Alderman O'Sullivan will confirm what I say&mdash;where we could borrow money by way of overdraft. We could choose to say we will postpone issuing stock until we are satisfied that we are getting the money at the rate we want to pay for it.  The position here, naturally, will tend somewhat to stop things.  It is quite true that we need £800,000 immediately to redeem certain loans that have been granted to us at the high rate of 5 per cent.  We were in a position, as far as I know, subject to the sanction of another Department, to raise that money at something like 3¼ per cent. and we could have raised it on short-term if we liked.  I do not know what charge the Post Office is going to make to a local authority for the service it will now render in lending to such local authority the money it has on deposit from the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do know that the cost of that money to the State, by way of interest-charge, is 2½ per cent.  Then, there is the cost of management, which is in the neighbourhood of £76,000.  The sum of the 2½ per cent. and the £76,000 charged on the amount of money that the corporation or any such authority of equal standing would require would, probably, mean that the money could not be given to the corporation at less than 4 per cent. or 4¼ per cent.  Therefore, this Bill is not going to meet the situation.  I welcome this new departure and hope that the Bill will go through all its stages to-day because it is a break with the past and provides a new orientation so far as the Post Office Savings Bank is concerned. But I suggest to the Minister that he should give consideration to the suggestions I have made.  Those suggestions are not new.  In 1932, and once every year since, I advocated that the public should be enabled to put at the disposal of the community, through State institutions, a large sum of money at a slightly higher rate of depository interest than they receive from the banks.  The Act governing the Post Office Savings Bank should <Col N="1572" /> be amended so as to provide a higher ceiling in respect of the deposits.  Then, commercial houses and institutions with substantial cash balances could put their money into the Post Office Savings Bank at a slightly higher rate of interest than that paid by the banks.  There would then be competition by money dealers to give to safe borrowers, like the corporation and the Government, money at low rates of interest for public purposes.  We should then be able to make some progress in building up the country in the way we have in mind.  Consequently, with these suggestions, I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that this Bill, particularly having regard to the words used by the Minister who introduced it, raises very broad issues.  This Bill is designed to secure that Dublin Corporation and other local authorities will not be constrained by force of circumstances to pay a rate for money in excess of what appears to be just and equitable, having regard to the rates paid by local authorities for financial accommodation in circumstances similar to those that obtain in this country. On these matters, I have an open mind. When I find myself at variance with established authority, I am instinctively reluctant to found my theory and practice on my own ideas rather than on those that have been hallowed by long acceptance.  But there comes a time in every man's life when he has to make his choice as to whether he will accept certain hypotheses, without understanding them, or whether he will call them in question, even though he does so alone.  I can recall, as you, a Chinn Comhairle, can, listening as a child to the fable by Hans Andersen which dealt with a Chinese emperor who hired three tailors to make him a suit.  They were not tailors at all but they gave the idea to the emperor that they were.  They made flourishes with their scissors and they danced around him with their needles and the emperor told his courtiers that they were the three finest tailors he had ever seen and would make him a suit the like of which they had never seen before.  In those days, it was very dangerous to question the sagacity of a Chinese <Col N="1573" /> emperor.  The tailors went to work but they had no cloth and, in fact, made no suit.  However, they went through the motions of making a suit and, finally, they purported to fit out the emperor.  They told him that he was now fitted out for the State procession while the man was as naked as the day he was born.  He believed the tailors and pretended to see the clothes.  He went out naked and the courtiers saw that he was naked but they did not think it safe to question the emperor. The emperor said: &ldquo;Did you ever see such an exquisite costume,&rdquo; and they said they never had, although the poor man had not a stitch on him.  Some of the spectators went so far as to finger the material.  Everybody greatly admired his raiment and said it was the finest thing in the world.  A woman held up her four-year-old child and asked if he ever saw anything more lovely than the emperor's garb.  His comment was: &ldquo;He has not a stitch on him.&rdquo;  They could not very well cut the head off a four-year-old-child but one commenced to inquire from the other: &ldquo;Does it look like that to you?&rdquo; Eventually, the emperor borrowed a bag and ran like a red-shank back to the palace where he cut the heads off the tailors.</P>
      <P>Not infrequently, the circumstances surrounding the fable of the Chinese Emperor affect our own lives.  Anybody who dares to suggest that credit is not the exclusive prerogative of the joint stock bank directors is regarded as a red revolutionary, threatening to tear down the foundations of the State and release ruin on the people.  I am obliged to say&mdash;I am open to conviction&mdash;that that appears to me to be the greatest confidence trick ever put over the universe.  Why the Dublin Corporation, representing the citizens of this city, should pay to a group of eminently respectable gentlemen, whose offices are situate in or about College Green, an annual toll because they want to build houses for the citizens, nobody has ever explained to me.</P>

Why should the corporation pay a toll to anybody for doing a job which everybody wants done and the materials for which, the labour for which and the capacity to purchase which are abundantly available, given time.  If the corporation starts out to-morrow with nothing but the will to build, they can get building materials, labour, sites, ratepayers to say that they will contribute so much a year to the purchase price of those particular commodities and tenants to say that they will reside in the houses and make up the difference between what the ratepayers are paying and the total cost of the raw materials, labour and the sites.  In that situation, why should a group of respectable private individuals intervene and say, &ldquo;Between the time this work is put in hand and the time the tenants and ratepayers effect payment of the amount due, we who have had nothing to do with the labour, raw materials, sites or tenants are going to collect annually 1½, 2½, 3½, 4½ or 5 per cent. from the corporation?  I am &ldquo;blowed&rdquo; if I understand it.</P>

This Bill seems to suggest that not only does the House sanction and approve that procedure but that we are going to take a hand and are going to facilitate the collection of this toll from the local body because if the joint stock bank collects this toll, why should not the Post Office Savings Bank collect the toll?  I do not want to appear irrational or revolutionary, and if anyone can explain it to me, I am quite prepared to sit down for a long time to learn where I have gone wrong, or if anyone can refer me to appropriate literature on the matter, I am prepared to study it.  I have studied it as far as I have got it and I have failed to find anywhere&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I have got up to tell the Deputy.  I know the Deputy will not think that I am making him a smart Alec answer if I refer to the way moneylenders work. As I understand it, when moneylenders make loans, they use their own money. They pay out the loans in coin, gold or notes to anybody who wishes to borrow from them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is different.  The moneylender works on a different system from the banks.  The bank never lends its own cash or rather only a minute fraction of its total loans is represented by cash.  When a moneylender gets in £1,000 into his desk, the limit of his lending is £1,000. When he has lent the last pound of his £1,000 to the last person who wants to get a loan, he must call in some of the money he has already lent to other borrowers and then he proceeds to let it out on loan again.  Not so with the joint stock banks.  The joint stock banks acquire £1,000 and the following morning they proceed on the basis that they are in a position to lend&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that he is ready to lend £700,000 to the Dublin Corporation until such time as they have floated a loan in which he proposes to invest.  I warn the House against this procedure.  I think this is a fundamental matter. It is a matter that should be thoroughly discussed before we make up our minds on a Bill of this character.  At this moment the British Government have discovered the secret.  They have made up their minds that this thing can be no longer kept a secret.  They are at present operating a device which I want to suggest to the House and which avoids the whole procedure envisaged by the Minister, that is, the device of Treasury deposit receipts.  One of the great charges made against the general lines of my suggestion is that whereas the Minister's proposals envisaged by the Bill are designed to <Col N="1577" /> avoid inflation, the lines on which I am travelling are highly inflationary. I am going to submit that nothing is further from the truth and that that is a bugbear that has been devised by the banks in order to prevent the community having access to the wealth which the banks ordinarily use for the profit of their own shareholders.</P>
      <P>If a bank gets in £1,000 it feels free to lend £10,000.  That has been safe joint stock banking practice over the years.  In England, banks are lending up to £1,200 instead of £1,000 for every £100 that comes in.  In Ireland, the banks have a very much larger ratio and do not lend £10 for every £ of cash that comes in.  They lend only about £7 for every £ of cash they have on hands, but note this fact, that when a banker gets in £100,000 in cash he feels himself free to lend £1,000,000. But he may not find a customer willing to borrow £1,000,000.  Does that deter the banker from employing the full limit of the bank's credit available to him as a result of the deposit of £100,000 in cash?  It does not.  What does he do with it?  Now, I shall make clear how relevant I am.  A customer comes in on the following morning and borrows £200,000 of the £1,000,000 credit now available based on the £100,000 cash deposited.  That leaves £800,000 of a credit, and I can assure you that in the minutes of evidence of the MacMillan Report you will find that bank manager after bank manager came up and said: &ldquo;The moment that we have satisfied the demand of borrowers who come into the bank and find ourselves left with a surplus credit, we at once go out to buy municipal stocks&mdash;Dublin Corporation stocks&rdquo;.  Now, if it is sound banking practice for a joint stock bank in London when they find themselves in possession of surplus fictitious credit, which exists only in the bank's ledgers, and as a result of that, bankers knowing that in practice their customers do not ask for the delivery by the bank of all their deposits and all their various overdrafts on the one day, that in practice, only 10 per cent. ask&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that if there were a run on the banks of this country, every bank in Dublin would close its doors promptly and the Minister would declare a moratorium and make available a Government guarantee of such cash resources as it was necessary for them to have.  Once the public saw that the claims that they had on the bank could be supplied by suitable securities, carrying the full guarantee of the Irish Government, which the Minister has said is one of the most solvent in the world, the run would stop, or if it did not, the banks would be temporarily authorised to satisfy the demands made upon them by Government guaranteed securities.  If that course is not open to them, the cash is not there.  The position is that it never is there, never was there and that it never will be there to pay all the claims that could be made in this or in any other country, if every person who had a claim against these banks were to make a claim on the same day and at the same hour.  If anything else were a fact, the whole joint stock banking system would not be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Providentially, the theory of credit has been worked out, empirically, and purely empirically, by the merchant bankers of the world.  Signs on, this great adaptable volume of lubricant, which brings labour, raw materials, and wants into constructive activation, <Col N="1579" /> is available to humanity.  All I am objecting to is that that lubricant, which is the by-product of the stability begotten of the law-abiding character of the citizens, and of the justice and general equity of its laws, should become the preserve of a group of bank shareholders, and that all the rest of the community should be paying to them a toll for its use.  Note well that were we to allow that joint stock banking system to function on its present credit ratio, and to superimpose upon that an entirely new volume of credit created for public works and matters of that character by the Government in a time of shortage and of full employment, there is no question whatever it would have a dangerously inflationary effect.  You might precipitate a situation where prices begin to spiral, followed by wages, followed by prices, until the money in circulation in the country became virtually valueless.  But note well that the ten to one ratio in Great Britain or the seven or eight to one ratio operating in Ireland is not a theory of economists.  It is not book learning.  It is an empirical fact that has been worked out in 300 years of banking practice.  I do not want to read the whole of the MacMillan report, but I think anyone who will read the evidence&mdash;and it is not very long&mdash;of the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh days, when the managers of the great joint stock banks came before that commission, will find confirmation for every world I am saying.  Note this, that we must carefully avoid the temptation to superimpose on the existing bank credit structure a completely new and elastic volume of credit, lest we precipitate the danger with which bankers are perpetually threatening us&mdash;a never-ending spiral of inflation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But note that the orthodox British Government, confronted with a war situation in which money had to be got somewhere, confronted with a situation packed with the dynamite of potential inflation, resolved to absorb every penny of surplus credit before a pound was added to the fiduciary issue of the Bank of England&mdash;unquestionably, an inflationary step&mdash;resolved that they could not leave loose the full volume of that ten to one ratio of bank credit, and at the same time engaged in the financial operations and expenditures which the war made it obligatory for them to undertake.  Here again, I speak subject to correction, but I believe that the treasury deposit, receipt procedure resorted to by the British Government was designed to mop up the surplus bank credit which was being created under the Joint Stock Bank system in England as a result of the perennial increase of the fiduciary issue and the available cash, which was the inevitable consequence of war-time expenditure in Britain.  What they did was this, as I understand it: if a bank had £1,000,000 in cash, and therefore was in a position to make advances up to £10,000,000, and had commercial or other customers of a normal character willing to take £6,000,000 in the ordinary course of business, the British Government presented those banks with treasury deposit receipts bearing interest at the rate of, I think, about 1 per cent. or <Col N="1581" /> less, and absorbed the remaining £4,000,000 for the public services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the House this simple question.  Bear in mind that what I have envisaged up to this moment is that the surplus bank credit available in this country is a bank credit existing on, I believe, a seven or eight to one ratio.  I should say that they require in this country approximately 15 per cent. cash, whereas in Great Britain on window-dressing days they have 10 per cent. cash and between window-dressing days they have, in fact, between 7 and 8 per cent. cash.  I am inquiring as to why the shareholders and directors of the joint stock banks should be entitled to levy tolls on the community for the user of that fictitious money? If they can use that money without imperilling the economic structure of the State in any way, why is it that the State may not use it for the purpose of carrying out works, the economic nature of which is manifest and guaranteed? I think that you have got to make an immense distinction between the two things.  Let us face the fact that if the State had the right to issue credit there would be the danger of somebody coming in here on the eve of a general election and proposing that we should make a grant of £10 for everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>What about £5?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I shall make no reference to payments of £1,200 a year or the jobs attached thereto, although I do not think there will be any necessity to do that in the case of Fianna Fáil after their experience in South Mayo; but&mdash;and this is the kernel of the whole matter&mdash;suppose that the State could be depended upon to use this power to create, or to appropriate, <Col N="1583" /> credit for no purpose other than what we shall call a terminable scheme, typified by a plan for the building of 100 houses, each house to cost £1,000, and that the ratepayers and the tenants between them undertook to repay that £100,000 spread over a period of 100 years.  Let us suppose that they were prepared to put up the money for that, plus a sum, not as interest; but a sum equal to what would be required to administer the actual bookkeeping of the scheme&mdash; that would amount to about 1 per cent., or less&mdash;my suggestion is that that should be the only payment in respect of capital which should be asked for by the public authority, or whatever authority which made itself responsible for the repayment of the credit so created.  What is there inferior in that plan to the plan of going to a joint stock bank in this State and borrowing £100,000 from them and paying interest at the rate of 4½ per cent.?  Remember, that represents £4,500 per annum, or £45 per annum on each £1,000 borrowed, for the whole duration of the loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On each £100,000, at that rate there is £4,500 interest.  I admit that that is only for the first year, and that as the loan is diminished, the interest charged diminished also, but on each £1,000 borrowed, that amount of £45 has to be paid, so long as that £1,000 is outstanding.  Possibly, I may be wrong in my conclusions, but if I have overlooked some vital factor, then let somebody tell me what it is. However, I do not think that the emperor is wearing a cloth of gold any longer.  I think that he is now naked in the eyes of the world and is hoping that poor &ldquo;goms&rdquo; like us will put the purple raiment or the cloth of gold on him.  Now, in that connection, does anybody who has any acquaintance with towns in the rural Ireland remember a case of any bank manager being poor?  If you go into any town in rural Ireland, who has the best residence there?  Is it not the bank manager? Now, if it were only a question of <Col N="1584" /> providing credit, I think that the joint stock banks are doing their job very well.  They keep their books very well, and the managers of their banks, their clerks and other officials are able to live in very good circumstances.  In fact, working for a joint stock bank seems to be a very lucrative occupation, and I can assure Deputies of this House that, in rural Ireland, at least, the smallest men about town are the bank clerks.  It may be that in the more aristocratic precincts of Dublin the bank clerks do not shine so brightly, but stars they certainly are in towns in rural Ireland such as that in which I live&mdash;and more luck to them: more luck to the banks if they are able to pay their servants well and generously, and I certainly do not begrudge them that.  However, if that can go on in that way and if, at the same time, a person in receipt of 45/- a week can get a room at 1/- a week less than at the present time, then more power to the bankers.  I do not doubt that if I were to canvass the managers of the joint stock banks of this country along that line, none would be more eager than they to do so.  I am sure that everybody in the House will agree with me that if, by careful, prudent, cautious and discreet management of credit in this country, it would be possible to reduce the rents of the houses of the people in this country, it would be a very good thing. I am sure that no Deputy would disagree with that, but possibly some of the Deputies who are not so sure about that may also not be so sure that the emperor has clothes on him or that, perhaps, after all, he is naked in the streets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I do not debar the possibility that in the argument I am putting forward I have fallen into an error, the nature of which I cannot discover, but I do claim that before the Bank Bill was before this House I did what I could to clarify my mind on this question, and the more I examined it the more convinced I was that we are being party to a most extraordinary illusion, which results in profits accruing to the shareholders and directors of the joint stock banks of this country&mdash;profits which properly belong to the community at large and <Col N="1585" /> which, had the community had control of them, would be used for the material relief of the poorest sections amongst us.  It is for those reasons that I somewhat demur to the provisions of this Bill.  It is not because I think that the Bill has an evil purpose behind it&mdash;I do not think that.  I think that the purpose of the Bill is to enable the Minister for Finance so to back up the corporation as to enable them not to have to pay too much interest because, in a very short time, there may be certain difficulties to be faced, and so far as that is so, it is good; but if the Minister is to lend the authority of the State to the idea that it is a legitimate and wise device to finance the building of houses in this country by the borrowing of money in the Post Office at 4½ per cent., or 4 per cent., 3½ per cent. 3 per cent., 2½ per cent., 2 per cent.&mdash;or anything more than 1½ per cent.&mdash;I think he is doing a disservice to this country.  I think that the financing of the building of houses, or the financing of anything else that is necessary to provide necessary amenities for the poorer sections of our community, should be done in such a way that there would be no charge other than that necessary to defray the expenses of maintaining the necessary records to ensure the ultimate liquidation of the original capital advanced.  There is my submission in a nutshell.</P>
    <P>I deprecate the payment of interest in any form&mdash;mark the word &ldquo;interest&rdquo; as distinguished from expenses&mdash; for money borrowed for such purposes, and I invite the House to look back to the old and, if I understand it, fundamental doctrine of the Catholic Church, that unsury was wrong, that payment of interest on money lent was immoral and wrong; that you had no right to take advantage of your neighbour's shortage of the wherewithal to realise the fullness of the potentialities of the gifts bestowed by God, to levy a tax upon him for the loan of money.  You are quite entitled to combine with a number of others, to pool your resources and jointly to venture them forth in a common effort, greatly to prosper or to be entirely lost. But you are not entitled to go to a <Col N="1586" /> person harassed by financial stringency and to offer to release him from that provided he hands to you an annual toll irrespective of the progress of his own fortunes.  I admit that to canvass the effects of that proposition would be going beyond the limits of relevance which this Bill permits, and I assert to the House that that proposition goes very much further than the case I am now making in respect of municipal credit.  But it all belongs to the same category.</P>
    <P>I do not want the House to imagine that I am advancing the proposition that there is anything morally wrong in the Bill brought forward by the Minister.  But I am saying that, if we accept the thesis that public bodies requiring financial accommodation should not be required to pay a toll of that kind provided the work for which the credit is required is praiseworthy and desirable, we are unquestionably setting out on a road the logical end of which is the abolition of the lending of money for interest.  When you realise that, you must call to mind that that final end is not incompatible with modern company finance or the mobilisation of finance into great units for the purpose of carrying out enterprises such as the Imperial Tobacco Company or Imperial Chemicals or any Irish industry seeking contributions towards of its capital structure here.  The only thing that that would preclude would be the issuing of debentures or preference stocks at rates of interest which did not purport to vary with the fortunes of the enterprise in which the money was invested.  Into that philosophical aspect of the question I do not propose to go, but I invite the Minister to tell us whether, within the limits of prudent, careful finance, he cannot see his way to make available to local authorities credit at the expense of administration free from the age-old toll of interest which heretofore they have been required to bear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On its face, I do not see anything harmful in this Bill.  My complaint against the Bill is somewhat similar to the complaint of Deputy Dillon, namely, that it does not go far enough to deal with the problem which is assuming growing significance in <Col N="1587" /> our national life from day to day.  One aspect of the Bill is rather puzzling to me.  The Minister told us that the purpose of the Bill was to enable him to help the Dublin Corporation to redeem, by a State advance from the Local Loans Fund, stock which is about to fall in and that he proposes, therefore, to lend money to the Dublin Corporation from the Local Loans Fund to discharge that obligation. The Minister, however, did not tell us whether the corporation asked him to do this and, if they did not ask him to do it, why is he doing it.  Has the corporation been consulted in the matter?  What are the considerations which have prevented the Dublin Corporation from going into the open market for money, seeing that, apparently, they have had discussions with the Minister's Department and, presumably, with the Local Government Department to get agreement on the terms on which the new corporation loan would be floated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan has averred that he is the Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Dublin Corporation, that he took an active part in all these negotiations, the last discussion with the Ministry being about three weeks ago, and that until the Minister spoke to-day he had no knowledge that the Government intended to come in to assist the corporation to repay the loan which is falling due, with a view to enabling the corporation in the course of a couple of months to float a fresh loan, the Minister being empowered in the meantime to take up the whole or portion of that loan by investing therein the funds which have accumulated in the Post Office Savings Bank.  I think the Minister ought to pull the curtain aside further and tell us how and in what circumstances he came into this matter, apparently, of asking the corporation to defer the floating of its loan.  If the corporation had made plans to float its loan, we ought to be told why it was prevented from doing so and, what considerations brought about the postponement of the floatation of the loan. The Minister has been particularly silent on that aspect of the matter and <Col N="1588" /> it is the only aspect of the matter which can be a justification for a Bill of this character.</P>
    <P>However, I am assuming that the Minister will have some explanation to make of that rather obscure position and that we will get some enlightenment from him when he replies.  But I should like to ask the Minister at what interest does he propose to lend the money to the corporation from the Local Loans Fund?  Is it intended to make an advance to the corporation for a period of a few months, then let the corporation go into the open market to float a loan and, when the loan is floated&mdash;assuming it is successfully floated&mdash;the money is to be repaid to the Local Loans Fund and, in the meantime, the Minister is to employ for investment purposes the moneys which have accumulated in the Post Office Savings Bank?</P>
    <P>I think in many respects it is a wise development to permit the Minister to utilise the accumulated funds of the Post Office Savings Bank for investment purposes so far as the local authorities are concerned.  Firstly, it gives the local authorities access to a market, perhaps at a rate of interest lower than the market that would be available to them if they were to raise money through the ordinary channels. But, here again, the Minister might give us some indication as to what the rate of interest is to be; whether he proposes only to invest the Post Office Savings Bank money when a local authority decides to float a loan; and whether he has power to lend to a local authority a sum of money at an agreed rate of interest without that local authority going through the formality of actually floating a loan? In other words, if the Minister hears, for instance, that the Naas Urban Council want a loan of £10,000, has it to float a loan of £10,000 in which the Minister may invest Post Office Savings Bank funds; or can the Minister, on hearing of the Nass Urban Council's desire&mdash;perhaps through the Minister for Local Government&mdash;say to the council: &ldquo;Look here, I will lend you that £10,000 at such-and-such a rate of interest&rdquo;?  Is that the manner <Col N="1589" /> in which the funds would be utilised, or can they be utilised only when there is a formal public flotation of a loan?</P>
    <P>Seeing that the Minister is proposing to take power now to invest the accumulated funds of the Post Office Savings Bank, I think he might go further and examine the possible extension of the use of that bank as a method to enable local authorities to transact their business through State agency and on terms which might be advantageous to the local authority and advantageous to the State as well. I do not know whether the Minister has any personal experience of the arrangements concerned, but I can tell him there is a scheme known as the postal-cheque system by which persons deposit money in the Post Office Savings Bank and can operate by means of cheques on that bank, in virtually the same way as a person operates on an ordinary joint stock bank account to-day.  There is this difference, that the transaction is carried out entirely through the Post Office and you can transact your business with every person who has a similar account.  The machinery is operated through the Post Office under State auspices, so that the security of the transactions has never been in question.</P>
    <P>In that way, the State has at its disposal very substantial sums of money which, placed at the disposal of joint stock banks, provide them with credit-creating facilities and bring those joint stock banks in very substantial sums of money, often because they lend to the Government of the country where those credits are available.  I think it might well repay the Minister to have that whole question of the postal-cheque system examined.  Having regard to the size of our local authorities, it appears to be a scheme which could very appropriately be applied as a method of enabling a municipal authority to transact its banking business through the medium of the State and operate it through the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  In that way, there would be greater facilities for co-operation between the State on the one hand, through the medium of its <Col N="1590" /> accumulated Post Office deposits, and the local authority on the other hand, than there would be in the rather detached scheme of organisation provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has gone through the labyrinthine paths of credits and credit-creating possibilities and the relationship of banking methods to the costs of providing ourselves with modern services.  For once, I find myself almost in complete agreement with Deputy Dillon on the matter. Like myself and many others &mdash; I thought at one stage that the Minister was in our camp as well&mdash;he is beginning to realise that this mysticism which surrounds the issue of money by banks for high rates of interest, for schemes the credit-worthy character of which cannot be questioned, is something which has enriched the banks substantially but has made the providers of State and private enterprise much the poorer, because of the relationship of the banks.</P>
    <P>We have had statements during the recent by-elections about the Government proposing to spend £100,000,000 on housing.  We have only to think of that sum to see the ransom which will be got for housing our people properly. If that £100,000,000 is not going to be put up by the State in the form of State bonds which will be extinguished when the rents come in for the houses which will be erected, then the nation is going to have the thrilling pleasure of paying £5,000,000 per year for a period of 35 years to those who lend the State that £100,000,000. The ordinary citizen wants to see our people decently housed and will be prepared to say that it should be done by the expenditure of £100,000,000.  At present that can be done only if all the citizens are prepared to tax themselves to the tune of £5,000,000 at 5 per cent. or £4,000,000 at 4 per cent. in a scheme for the provision of decent houses for our people.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Dillon very rightly points out, there is no danger or risk whatever in the State issuing the necessary moneys for the erection of houses. Every house erected to-day can be let or sold.  Its lifetime will be 50 to 80 <Col N="1591" /> years and it will be occupied during that time.  What difficulty is there in saying: &ldquo;Let us put up a house for £1,000; let us assume its life is 50, 60 or 80 years; and let us charge a rent sufficient to wipe out the State bond of £1,000 which was created in order to provide the necessary lubricant in the form of cash to finance the erection of the house&rdquo;.  Instead of doing that, the State apparently is satisfied to continue to pursue a policy which means that the citizens are held to ransom by those who live on selling money at the highest price.</P>
    <P>Sums of money in interest charges have an appalling effect on the rents charged on the houses occupied, in the main, by working-class families here. In 1924, Mr. John Wheatley, an Irishman from Waterford, and then British Minister for Health, introduced in Britain what was known as the Wheatley Housing Act, generally recognised to be the best Housing Act which ever found its way to the Statute Book in Britain or, indeed, elsewhere at that time.  Wheatley, in the course of his examination of housing finance, said clearly that, if the man who gave land for the erection of a house gave it for nothing, and if the slater, the carpenter, the plasterer and the tiler worked for nothing, and if all the elements which went to the erection of that house gave their labour free, it would not have the same effect in reducing the rent as if the lender of the money lent the money free.  That is to say, when you come to consider a single house erected on interest charges such as operated then, the position was that the person who lent the money got more for the house over the period of 35 years than the person, or the variety of persons, responsible for erecting the house, including the person from whom the land was purchased.</P>
    <P>If you go to the trouble of examining ordinary housing finance in this city or in rural areas, you find that, taking the economic rent of a house as the test, the rents to-day are almost 50 per cent. higher than they need be, because <Col N="1592" /> of the ransom which has to be paid in the form of interest charges.  Every poor person living in these new houses to-day&mdash;and particularly persons living under economic conditions which are not ideal, in the new areas which have been created in the vicinity of the City of Dublin&mdash;could to-day be living in those houses at approximately 50 per cent. of their present rents, were it not for the fact that rates of interest, which amounts almost to unsury in the circumstances, have to be paid for the loan of the money with which those houses were erected.</P>
    <P>It looked to me, while Deputy Dillon was speaking, that Deputy Cosgrave was inclined to doubt the basis on which the whole British banking system was operating.  If Deputy Cosgrave would care to read, as apparently Deputy Dillon did, the Macmillan Report, which was published as the result of a commission of inquiry set up by the British Government, he will realise that banker after banker testified to the stability of the British banking system, notwithstanding the fact that they admitted that the banks kept only 10 per cent. of their deposits as liquid assets and released 90 per cent. of the deposits for the purpose of loans to customers.  In other words, when the banks received a deposit of £1,000,000 they built a pyramid of credit on that worth £10,000,000.  It is in that direction that the banks make money; they make it, in the main, by lending it to people who are compelled to pay substantial rates of interest for such facilities, irrespective of how praiseworthy the schemes which they undertake may be in the national interest.</P>
    <P>I do not want to discuss interest charges at any length on this Bill.  My complaint is that the Bill does not go far enough.  If we are to have these large-scale schemes of public work such as we hear about at election times and such as we read about in the Press, then I think we must have a new approach to the question of interest charges.  It seems to be nothing short of a scandal and an insult to our intelligence when, every time a house is <Col N="1593" /> erected for a working man, 50 per cent. of the rent charged him, 50 per cent. of what is got in the form of rent from his low wages, must go to the people who lend the money for the erection of a piece of property of that kind which is there all the time as security for whatever body gave the necessary credit to erect that house in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister who, rumour has it, was a disciple of Major Douglas on one occasion, that he ought to examine the extent to which the State can help local authorities in the erection of houses and in the carrying out of various other schemes which make for the public weal.  If, for instance, local authorities are to spend £20,000,000 on houses, which £20,000,000 has to be paid by the tenants of these houses, ordinary persons depending on work when they can get it or unemployment insurance or unemployment assistance when they cannot get work &mdash;out of what they receive in that way they have to pay the rent for these houses&mdash;and if the State, because of their weak economic position, has to subsidise the erection of these houses, surely we ought to make sure, when the State throws in its resources and when the ordinary wage earner has to pay a high rent, that we will not permit any other element to swell the rents to such an extent as to impose hardship on tenants economically circumstanced as are the mass of the tenants who occupy labourers' cottages or artisans' dwellings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister ought to examine this whole question of interest charges and an effort should be made to scale down these interest charges to the lowest possible figure.  I should like to see this whole matter of State credits as a means of financing praiseworthy municipal and State schemes examined in such a way that we could evolve a scheme whereby the State would create credits, these credits to be utilised to carry out necessary public works which would repay out of their revenue the credits which they operated in the first instance.  The credits having been repaid, they would be automatically cancelled until such time as it was necessary to create fresh credits for similar commendable projects, in which case the machine could operate again.</P>
      <P>In a scheme of that kind we can get (1) these valuable public works undertaken; (2) we can provide the amenities which we desire for our people, and (3) we can do that without paying a financial ransom.  At the same time, we can make money available for finance schemes of that kind much more readily when there is economic depression and thus take up the lag in employment and we will be making a very valuable contribution to the relief of unemployment by measures which can be put into operation speedily.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister might tell us what the Government propose to do in respect of State credits to finance the considerable reconstruction work which we are told lies ahead.  If the Government will embark on a policy which will cut out those who live on high interest charges, and organise the commendably high credit resources of the State to finance projects of that kind, I think the Minister will find goodwill and enthusiastic support on all sides of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>This seems to <Col N="1595" /> be a very innocent little Bill, but I wonder is it just quite as innocent as some of us hope it is.  We heard Deputy O'Sullivan, who is chairman of the Corporation Finance Committee, talking about the corporation and their loans.  I should like to reiterate some of the points he made and bring out some others which he did not, perhaps, mention.</P>
      <P>This Bill, I take it, is to enable the Government to lend money to local authorities for the purpose of redeeming loans at a high rate of interest. Take the case of Dublin Corporation. They have got money out at 5 per cent. and that is to be converted into a lower rate of interest.  In the Dublin Corporation you have one of the finest securities in the country.  I do not think there is any better security. I think even the State loans are not essentially better security than the Dublin Corporation, because if the credit of the capital city of Ireland went, I believe the credit of the State in general would be in a pretty rocky condition, so that I cannot imagine Dublin Corporation credit being bad and the State's credit being very high. I believe the two are indissolubly linked together.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the Dublin Corporation could to-morrow morning raise a loan for any sum they require, certainly at 3 per cent. and very possibly under 3 per cent.  At the present moment there is plenty of money, and money is seeking somewhere to get a return.  That has had the inevitable effect of driving interest rates down, and Dublin Corporation, with its superb credit, is in a position to get a low rate of interest.  Do they need the assistance of this Bill to enable them to borrow?  They do not.  As I say, they could go out to-morrow and get the money.  Why is the Minister introducing this to facilitate the Dublin Corporation?  Dublin Corporation would be very glad to get facilities if it needed them, but I say it does not.  It can borrow within reason anything it wants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told us that there are £32,000,000 in the Post Office Savings <Col N="1596" /> Bank.  I am not certain about the rate of interest to depositors, but I think it is 2½ per cent.  That money is borrowed at 2½ per cent.  I would remind the House that the great reason for the existence of the Post Office Savings Bank is not to enable the Government to get cheap money, but to encourage thrift.  The Post Office Savings Bank is one of the more expensive methods of borrowing money. If money is borrowed on which a deposit interest rate of 2½ per cent. is paid, plus establishment charges in respect of such parts of the Post Office as have to do with the Savings Bank section, the cost of that money is higher than 2½ per cent.  How will that be cheap money?  The trustees of the saving bank are not going to lend money, even to Dublin Corporation, and still less to smaller councils and corporations throughout the country, at a loss to themselves.  They cannot afford to do it, and we in this Dáil should be mad to think they would do it.  They would not be allowed to do it.  They, in company with every other owner of capital, must administer their capital to the best of their ability.  Part of the administering of that capital to the best of their ability is placing it where it will get the best return, because they want to be able to pay their depositors 2½ per cent.  There is no good in the whole Post Office Savings Bank system being a loss to the State.  If anyone in the House thinks that, he is being very foolish.</P>
    <P>The money which it is proposed to lend under this Bill, then, starts off by being rather dear money, not at all cheap money.  How will that help local authorities?  It certainly will not help Dublin Corporation because it does not need it.  Is this just an effort to find a home for the £32,000,000 in the Post Office Savings Bank, or is it a genuine effort to facilitate the local authorities?  On the arithmetic of it, it will not be much help to the local authorities and I think it is primarily intended to provide for the £32,000,000. I have no objection to the interests of the Savings Bank being safeguarded. They must be, and, if the State accepts deposits at 2½ per cent., it must pay <Col N="1597" /> 2½ per cent. interest on them, but we are all aware that at present the market for investment is very tight and it is very difficult to find any safe place in which to put money.  Will local authorities find that great pressure will be brought on them to redeem or to accept loans to facilitate the Post Office Savings Bank, possibly to their own detriment?  That is an aspect of the Bill of which I am very much afraid and I ask the Minister to clear the matter up.  On the surface, it looks good that local authorities are to be facilitated, but I think I have shown clearly that Dublin Corporation certainly does not need that facility at the moment. Yet that is the reason put forward by the Minister for Section 3.</P>

      <P>This is a rather strange Bill and has given rise to a rather strange debate.  My only regret is that the Monetary Reform Party has not yet intervened.  I fear, in common with Deputy Dockrell, that the proposal to enable Post Office savings to be used for housing development is, in reality, a proposal to relieve the State of an irksome liability and to place that liability on the local authorities, and, to a great extent, upon the incoming tenants.  We all agree that it was good policy in the past to encourage saving.  It has been the national policy up to the present and it is a policy which is backed up by very sound principles.  First, it is good to encourage savings; and, secondly, the encouragement of saving by our people tends to prevent, to some extent, inflation, particularly in a time of emergency such as that through which we have passed; but, in our attempt to encourage saving, the State has incurred high liability to those who invest money in the Post Office Savings Bank, and I feel that the Government through this Bill is trying to shift some of that liability on to the local authorities and on to the people who are to benefit by housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said yesterday on the Housing Bill that there is no justification whatever for the State borrowing money for housing and paying interest on that borrowed money to private individuals. It is right and proper we will all agree, <Col N="1598" /> that if I lend £5 to my neighbour, I should be paid some interest on that money, the reason for that interest charge being that there is always a risk that my neighbour may get away and not repay the loan; but when the State borrows money from its citizens, the State cannot escape and cannot avoid repayment of the debt.  Therefore, there is no liability for an interest charge, and that is the whole flaw in the entire system of State finance up to the present&mdash;that we have the State paying interest on money, just the same as the private individual would, without any justification, particularly when we realise that the security behind the money borrowed is the security of the State itself, that it is really and truly the State's own which it is borrowing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon talked at length about the ratio which the banks have developed in connection with loans, that is, that they are able to lend £9 for every pound they have on deposit, but even the £1 they have on deposit, the £1 which is cash in the bank, is of no value if there were not behind it the security of the State, because paper currency rests solely upon the State's security.</P>
    <P>Our entire finance is built upon the security of the State, and we have in this Bill, as in other Bills, the State proposing to borrow money at a rate of interest to be decided later.  The rate of interest is not indicated in the Bill, but there is definitely an implication that interest will be paid, in view of the fact that it is intended to utilise Post Office savings.  I think it would be better if the Minister were to withdraw this Bill, and to reconsider the whole question in relation to the financial power of local authorities to financial housing development and other schemes of that kind.  It has been pointed out that we are embarking on a big national scheme of development, which will involve the expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds over the next few years, and that is no reason why the ordinary taxpayer and citizen should be saddled with high interest charges, which could be avoided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to follow Deputy Dillon's rather involved <Col N="1599" /> methods of manipulation of credit to the advantage of the State.  I do not think there is a fair analogy to be drawn between the position in this country and what has occurred in Great Britain, because Great Britain found herself in the throes of a mighty struggle, and had to make provision, no matter how desperate, to finance the war.  Britain had to resort to any and every means to do that.  It must be remembered that in that effort, there was a rapid increase in earning capacity, and a considerable amount of inflation, which caused an increase of profits for banks, while goods were not there for people who were earning large sums of money.  That increased the deposits in the banks.  As Deputy Dillon suggested, the British Government helped to finance their efforts by the issue of Treasury Notes against exhaustive credits, over the amount actually demanded in the ordinary way, and exhaustive credits resulted in the operation of the system Deputy Dillon explained, of a ten to one ratio in Great Britain and a seven to one ratio here.  The reason for the differentiation in the ratio between this country and Great Britain is that people here, generally, are small depositors, and more likely to look for their money at any time.  Because of that consideration, the ratio here was lower.  I wonder could that operation be sustained over a long period?  I am not so sure that it could.  We see Great Britain looking to America for dollars and for substantial advances in credit.  There is something pretty sound about utilising whatever credit has accumulated in the ordinary way so far as our people are concerned. The real credit of a country is not having so much money accumulated in the banks: the real wealth of a country is its capacity to produce, to provide decent standards for its people, proper homes and other amenities.  Surely it is good policy to utilise whatever accumulations of credit are there for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This subject has been discussed at length, and I merely want to say that the Minister was very guarded when referring to rates of interest, and the <Col N="1600" /> rate that was going to be charged Dublin Corporation.  I think accountancy charges, over and above the 2½ per cent. at which the money is invested in the Post Office, cannot be very high.  I believe the advance will be made under 3 per cent., and that, possibly, one quarter will cover accountancy charges, so that the rate will be about 2¾ per cent.  I welcome the new departure to utilise accumulated savings for the benefit of the people, but I want to be conservative, if you like, merely for the purpose of getting information that the House should have.  I want the Minister to be frank with the House in regard to the repayment of savings in the Post Office.  I understand that in the past certain restrictions were put on the type of investment that could be made from these funds; that they were limited to investments which could be immediately relisable, in order to ensure that if, at any time, people who had invested money wanted it, it could be paid back on short notice&mdash;seven days.</P>
    <P>Investments in the Post Office have rapidly accumulated during the war. That was a natural consequence of the war, and of the fact that we were not engaged in it, being a food-producing country.  These accumulated resources were made up of small investments by hard-working people, even more so than the type of money that is put into joint stock banks.  Supposing we struck a period of depression in three, four or five years' time, and that there was a substantial demand for repayment over that period, if the money were locked up in a long-term loan to the Dublin Corporation or to local authorities generally&mdash;while I do not profess to know much about the subject&mdash;I wonder is the ratio still going to apply?  Will the Post Office be safe in holding to the ratio of one-seventh of the total deposits to meet demands at any time, irrespective of what happens to the economy of the country? Would a one-seventh margin be safe in any circumstances, no matter what happens in the next few years, to meet any possible demand for repayment?</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that the difference we are going to make, as far as Post Office deposits are concerned, <Col N="1601" /> is that we are going to lock up a high percentage of them in long-term loans to local authorities, and the Minister has not informed us what that percentage will be.  He has not even gone to the trouble of telling the House how the money is being used at present, how far it is being used to finance Government effort through short-term loans, Treasury bills and so on, or how much of it is actually in readily-realisable investments.  It is generally held, I think, that moneys invested in British Government stocks are looked upon as more or less liquid, and that even big sums can be realised in an hour any morning on the London Stock Exchange.</P>
    <P>As regards these deposits, the Minister mentioned the sum of £32,000,000. Will he say what percentage of that it is proposed to release for long term investment?  One may say that we see in this Bill a departure from orthodox methods.  I think the House should be told what the expert view is in the event, say, of this country experiencing a period of depression over four, five or six years.  Nobody can tell what the future holds.  Our internal position must undoubtedly be influenced by world conditions, and by the conditions that obtain in Great Britain.  Inevitably, they would have their reactions and repercussions here. The House, I think, should be told what percentage of the total deposits the financial experts in the Department of Finance feel is a reasonable measure of security in the event of a period of depression setting in.  I am wondering whether the ratio of one-seventh, which the banks operate on, would be sufficient in that case.  Otherwise, I do not know whether there is very much in the point that was raised by Deputy Norton about the rate of interest for short-term loans.  I take it that the money would be required only for a short period&mdash;until there was a proper flotation by the Dublin Corporation. In that event, the rate of interest for a short-term loan, even if it went up to 4 per cent., would not make very much difference to the Dublin Corporation.  It is the rate for the long-term loans that matters.</P>
    <P>Suppose the corporation is advised <Col N="1602" /> by the Minister's Department to float a loan at 2½ per cent., if the public subscribe you get in the money directly, but if the loan is not fully subscribed, does the Minister propose to underwrite it and take it up out of the deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank?  We have got very little information from the Minister on that point, and for that reason I say that he has treated the House very unfairly.  This is a matter which, in my opinion, should be very fully discussed.  It represents a new departure.  I welcome it, and I think it is quite sound.  It means utilising the accumulated savings of the people for the benefit of the people.  If we can get money, which is the real key to our effort, to solve this and other pressing national problems, then in the long run we are going to ensure better standards and better conditions for the people, but governing all that effort will be the rate of interest that will have to be paid on the capital required to do the works undertaken.  All this is a matter that wants to be thoroughly examined. I do not know enough about the matter to express an opinion on the sort of manipulation&mdash;I do not think it can be described by any other name than the manipulation of money&mdash;which Deputy Dillon referred to.  We know, of course, that during the war period it was possible in Great Britain to build up a huge reserve out of the earning capacity of the people, but that was only for a short period.  It may be that they are approaching the end of that period now.  We may be doing the same.  However, I must say that this Bill represents a step in the right direction. I hope that the Minister, when replying, will give the House much more information than he gave in his opening speech.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister whether the lending of money to public bodies throughout the country would be regarded as investing it in a trustee security.  I know one Irish trade union, the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, which was prepared to advance, out of its reserves, considerable sums of money to public bodies at a very cheap rate of interest, much cheaper <Col N="1603" /> than the rate at which loans can be obtained from the banks or from the Local Loans Fund, for the purpose of enabling them to erect houses for the working classes, thereby enabling the tenants to get houses at lower rents than those prevailing to-day.  It was debarred from doing so because public bodies' stocks outside of Dublin and Cork, are not held to have a trustee status.  The Minister, in his opening statement, very rightly pointed out that the credit of the country is high, and that our public bodies offer a safe security for any loans made to them.  Can the Minister tell me whether this Bill will afford an opportunity to an Irish trade union to advance money to public bodies at probably a cheaper rate of interest than he can afford to give it for house-building, or will it be necessary to amend the Bill to enable that to be done?  I hope that the Minister will take steps to amend this Bill, or whatever piece of legislation is necessary, to enable that to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I would not be doing the Minister an injustice if I said that, in introducing this Bill, he did so with a certain amount of caution.  As I understand it, the Bill deals, in the main, with the affairs of the Dublin Corporation.  I assume that the Minister also proposes to bring within its ambit public bodies throughout the country.  The Minister, as I understood him, proposes to put the Dublin Corporation in the position of being able to redeem outstanding loans amounting to over £700,000.  He also proposes to make an issue to the corporation from the Local Loans Fund to cover the period of a few months until they have their preparations completed for the issue of a public loan. Under the terms of this Bill, the Minister proposes to place the moneys in the Post Office Savings Bank at the disposal of the Dublin Corporation, in connection with that loan, and if I understood him correctly, at the disposal of all other public bodies that wish to avail of these moneys.  There are some public bodies throughout the country that, I am sure, would like to redeem some of their outstanding loans on which they are paying interest <Col N="1604" /> charges up to 5 per cent.  Will the Minister tell me if he proposes to afford them the same facilities for the redemption of their stock as he intends to give to the Dublin Corporation? Will he also say what will be the rate of interest that will be charged if and when the moneys in the Post Office Savings Bank are made available? There, again, I think the Minister was rather cautious.  I think the time has arrived when some statement should be made dealing with the very big question that is involved in the financing of housing schemes, not only in the City of Dublin, but all over the country.</P>
      <P>Many peculiar views have been expressed by Deputies and members of the various public bodies in connection with the financing of housing. Great stress is laid upon the fact that were it not for the interest charges, varying from 5 to 4 per cent., it would be the simplest thing in the world to erect houses and to let them at a rent which the tenants could afford to pay. Nothing is farther from the realities of the situation because if to-morrow I or the banks or private individuals could build a house for £600&mdash;I suppose it would take that to build the average house at the moment&mdash;and charged no interest at all but simply asked the tenant who, possibly, would be in a very lowly position&mdash;an ordinary working man&mdash;to repay that principal in 30 years, it would take an average rent of 8/- a week for the 30 years merely to do that.  That example alone should convince those who magnify the effect of interest charges in connection with the financing of housing schemes.  The interest charge is merely one of the little things that raise the rent.  If the question of housing is to be settled in a way that will be satisfactory to the people who occupy the houses a great deal more will have to be done than simply to deal with the question of interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I simply do not follow some of the speakers who want a return on every pound invested.  Remember, one of the best investments in this or any other country, is the health of the people. Even if the interest is only one-half <Col N="1605" /> or one-third per cent., if the expenditure results in producing a healthy race, it has been well invested and will give a good return.  It is from that point of view that we must approach this whole question.  It is in that spirit that the Parliamentary Secretary is approaching the tuberculosis question. That scheme will not give a dividend of 5 per cent., but we have come to the conclusion that if this nation is to exist and if we are to arrest the ravages of that dreadful disease, we must invest money and the amount of money, so far as I understand, that will be invested before that disease is even curbed will be somewhere in the region of £5,000,000 to £6,000,000 and may possibly be £10,000,000 or £12,000,000.  Therefore, do not let us go to either one extreme or the other. Some people think that Deputy Dillon went to the extreme in a certain direction. If I understand him correctly, when he talked about giving money free of interest and using it, he was referring to the surplus money that existed in Great Britain during the war and I think he emphasised the fact that the British Government did not interfere with a pound deposited in the joint stock banks of Great Britain&mdash; which is rather different from going to the joint stock banks and taking the money out of the deposits or touching the surplus money that has been made as a result of the six years of war.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister did not make a more comprehensive statement or take the House more into his confidence so that we might understand exactly what is meant by this Bill and what would be the rate of interest charged to the local authority.  It does not take a great deal of study to see that, in so far as financing or assisting the Dublin Corporation is concerned, the provisions of this Bill are not going to make any material change.  I can see that the redemption of this £794,000, which is carrying 5 per cent., by money advanced by the Minister out of the local loans, would enable them to save possibly 1 per cent., which would amount to a sum in the region of £7,000 or £8,000, but the big question at issue is, what will be the rate per cent. that will be <Col N="1606" /> charged, not alone to the Dublin Corporation, but to the public bodies throughout the country?  The Dublin Corporation, although it represents the capital city, is not the whole country.  Local bodies are as vitally interested in the housing of the working classes as are the members of the Dublin Corporation and we are entitled to know, here and now, what the interest charges will be, if any, when this Bill becomes law, and what the Minister's attitude will be in regard to the financing of housing in general, not only in relation to interest charges but in relation to subsidies paid by the Government.  Everybody who has experience of building knows that costs have increased three or four times.  A house that some years ago cost £140 or £150, will cost about £700 to £800, owing to the high cost and shortage of essential materials.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think the time has arrived&mdash;I am sure the Minister would agree&mdash;to bring in a more comprehensive measure than this is because, as far as I know, this Bill simply allows the moneys that, I am glad to say, have accumulated in the Post Office, by the thrift of our people, to be utilised.  The deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank have increased, as I understand from the Minister, from about £10,000,000 to £32,000,000&mdash;an increase of 200 per cent.  That is a great tribute to the thrift of our people, mainly small depositors and working-class people.  These moneys could not be utilised before but this Bill will allow them to be utilised and lent to the public bodies of the country.  Without going too deeply into the matter, it would be interesting to know where that £32,000,000 is at the moment.  Is it invested wholly in this country or is it invested in part in Great Britain? What interest is it carrying at the present time?</P>
    <P>My main reason in speaking on this Bill is to tell the Minister that, in my opinion, as a member of a public body for a long number of years, the time has arrived when we must do something big in regard to the financing of house building.  If we want a healthy people and a people who will enjoy life, we <Col N="1607" /> must certainly build the houses that are necessary and let them at a rent which the tenants can afford to pay. That cannot be done at the present cost of materials.  I emphasise that even if the money were available free of interest the capital cost of a £660-house is so high that it would require a rent of from 8/- to 10/- a week to pay off the principal.  I am sure the Minister knows from experience that there are thousands of our people at present only partially employed, who could not continue to pay out of their present income a rent approaching 8/- to 9/- a week.  A fairly large proportion of them are living on the 5/- or 6/- a week which they receive from the St. Vincent de Paul Society.  I hope that the time is not far distant when the Minister for Finance will make a clear statement to the public bodies as to what financial assistance he proposes to give them in respect of the building of houses.  Most of the public bodies&mdash; I can speak on behalf of Dundalk Urban Council&mdash;are ready to proceed with their plans.  Their only difficulty, in addition to the question of materials, is that they have not a fixed idea as to how the schemes are to be financed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. H.M. Dockrell Mr. H.M. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise a couple of points on this Bill. It seems as if it was intended to be a comprehensive measure and to take its place in the permanent financial code. If that is so, some of its provisions ought to have been explained and, in some respects, its scope should have been extended.  The Minister, when introducing the Bill, spoke of the need for haste in passing it because there was an urgent need for a loan to the Dublin Corporation that they might be able to redeem a loan which would fall in early in the new year.  I should like to ask the Minister how many bodies are to be regarded as ranking&mdash;I shall not say equally&mdash;with the corporation&mdash;bodies which might be considered credit-worthy under this Bill.  I suppose the simplest way to put it is to say that these would be bodies whose stock should be added to the list of trustee securities.  Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council, <Col N="1608" /> the Port and Docks Board and, perhaps, the Borough Corporation of Dún Laoghaire might be regarded as coming within this category.  How many bodies are to be included in the list of those to whom loans may be granted under this scheme?</P>
      <P>My next point is that the Minister has taken power to control the range of investments of the Post Office Savings Bank.  If this is to be regarded as a comprehensive measure, why has the Minister left out the trustee savings banks?  It may be said that they have not as much money as the Post Office Savings Bank but they have some millions which could, presumably, be made available under this scheme if such a course were considered desirable. Why have they been left out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My next point is concerned with the machinery which is to be used for introducing the money of the savings bank to a borrower who is in need of it.  The acid test of the rate of interest which the borrower should pay would, presumably, be the rate at which he could borrow on the open market.  If you depart from that, you are either getting money too cheaply or charging other people too much.  Dublin Corporation was mentioned here and I use it as an illustration of a prospective borrower under this scheme.  Is it proposed that Dublin Corporation, or any other borrowers, should approach the Government and say that they want a loan of, say, £1,000,000, repayable in 50 years?  Will the Government then say that they think that the Post Office ought to charge 3 per cent. and, if that is acceptable to the borrower, will stock be issued by the borrower to the Post Office?  I do not see that you can deal with the matter in any other fashion than that. If the Post Office wanted subsequently to liquidate the loan, they could sell the stock in the open market.  Otherwise, some sort of scheme seems to be envisaged in which a Government Department would really become a sort of bank.  I should object very much if an account were to be created by the Government which would be loaded up with loans to local authorities.  I should object, no matter how trustworthy they might be.  I consider that even the <Col N="1609" /> Post Office should have to disclose where its savings are held.  I think there is only one precedent for investing the money of the State where you cannot get particulars of it.  I refer to the Credit Corporation.  It is most undesirable that they are not subject to the ordinary laws of joint stock companies. I hope that another precedent will not be created if funds are to be taken in either by a Government Department or by the Post Office trustees.  I look upon the Post Office as a place, in the first instance, where inhabitants of this country can deposit their moneys for a period knowing that they can get it again at any time they require it.  They know that system has a flexibility and that the accessibility and publicity attached to the account give them a certain guarantee.  From the way in which the accounts are kept it would be most undesirable&mdash;</P>

I personally think that if money invested in other ways can be made available for financing our own local issues, it is all to the good as long as we do not get into some sort of false paradise which might be occasioned by the fact that at the present time there is a very favourable market for people who want to borrow money.  We may later come to a time of financial stringency but so long as the position which I have referred to is safeguarded, I would be perfectly satisfied and would welcome this measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am frankly disappointed with this measure.  When I saw the long Title at first, and assumed that we were moving towards extending the range of investments for moneys in the Post Office, I thought that some forward step was being taken.  I now realise that is not the case.  The situation with regard to these Post Office Savings Bank's moneys has often been discussed in this House.  The Post Office Savings Bank differs from the ordinary commercial bank.  It takes in money on deposit and it is supposed to hold that money and be able to repay the exact amount deposited from time to time at a rate of interest which is limited to 2½ per cent. on ordinary deposits.  There is a special rate for other deposits which may be made.</P>
      <P>The situation for many years has been that these moneys, when received from the Post Office Savings Bank here, were promptly invested in British securities.  They were mainly intended to be at the disposal of the commissioners for the reduction of the national debt in London.  When they got these moneys, they were entitled to invest them in what they regarded as a proper type of investment for these funds in England.  One of these investments was the London Electrical Transport Organisation Fund.  At so late a period as 1938, some of the money borrowed from our Post Office Savings Bank&mdash;borrowed from depositors here&mdash;were invested in Russian bonds, Turkish bonds and in Greek bonds.  So that the farmer or the individual here who saved money and put it into the Post Office Savings Bank, probably believing that it was going to be invested in this country, if he could trace the money afterwards would find that at times it was being used for the purposes of the London Electrical Transport Organisation and at other times was being sent to Russia, Greece or Turkey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has long been a subject of anxiety and confusion to people who have looked into this matter that these funds could not be used as similar funds are used in other countries, for productive purposes at home.  The answer that occurs to the orthodox <Col N="1611" /> economist or the really conservative type of banker is that these deposits are made in a particular way, that they are a sort of trustee holding, that they must be held in some sort of trustee security and that they must be open to immediate repayment.  The money is there, and is supposed to be at call.  There are quite a number of funds that are supposed to be at call which are not used in that way.  Other countries have got over that difficulty in a rather simple fashion.  They simply take the money which comes from the Post Office Savings Bank and allow these funds to be used for ordinary productive purposes within the country, always putting on the Federal Reserve or the Central Bank in the country an obligation that they must meet the call if the call should come.  In fact, Central Banks in most countries have at this stage been authorised to extend credit by the circulation of so much currency notes or legal tender notes as to meet any abnormal call that might occur.  Of course, it is very seldom that there is an abnormal call.</P>
    <P>As far as this country is concerned, there is observable both as regards Post Office Savings Bank's deposits and other deposits, the fact that there is a well-known regularity with regard to payments in and payments out. The surplus payments in over any withdrawals that have from time to time occurred have shown a complete regularity.  They are always increasing and the funds are mounting up to the extent that now, I understand, this particular fund has reached £32,000,000.</P>

      <P>There is, therefore, a total of £32,000,000 at the disposal of the Trustee Savings Banks and the Post Office Savings Bank.  That money lies there, freely lent by people who <Col N="1612" /> are content to take a 2½ per cent. return on it.  The situation in this country is rather abnormal, and one gets a sense of frustration in trying to argue the thing clearly.  The country is completely under-developed.  There is no doubt that there is any number of fields in which the money could be usefully employed if people could get even 2½ per cent. interest on it.  There are certain kinds of fields for the employment of money where people would accept even 1 per cent. or 1½ per cent. That is the point to which the rate has been staggered in England.  Our situation appears to be that we have this money there, and that people are willing to be free lenders for the very low rate of 2½ per cent.  As far as Savings Certificates are concerned, the people have lent their money at a rate which works out, if one takes the exact amounts paid in interest, at a good deal less than 1½ per cent.  The actual interest payments, if one takes the period over which the money is left in before being reclaimed, do not work out at more than 1½ per cent.  Yet that money is not being used for productive purposes in this country.  People who want money for productive undertakings are forced to pay as high as 4 and 5 per cent.  Why cannot we make a junction between that need for cheap money and the abundance of cheap money?  Why cannot we make the junction between the cheap money and the demand for it, such as has been made in other countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background of the argument appears to be that the people who lend this money at these low rates require the money or may require the money immediately, and those who take it on the basis that the people who lend it may require the money immediately must have the money at hand.  My first answer to that is that they do not always have the money at hand.  It has to be used and is going to be used in some way or other, and the way in which the gap is bridged in most other countries is this: they have observed in those other countries, as has been observed here, that there is a definite regularity with regard to the excess of payments in over-withdrawals.  They have seen how those funds are mounting <Col N="1613" /> up from time to time, and they have said: &ldquo;We have people ready to put in money and demand only 2½ per cent. on it.  We will use that money productively, and we will give the people this guarantee that the State is always behind the matter.&rdquo;  It is done by, I think, a single clause in the Australian Federal Bank Act, in which the central bank is given power to underwrite, so to speak, those deposits. Nobody objects.  In fact there is a considerable advantage to be got by it, because the New Zealand Government ran a housing scheme almost entirely on the savings bank deposits, guaranteed in that way.  They lent money for housing at about 1¼ per cent., and they did that long before the impact of the war had forced interest rates down. They found that the depositors were still pouring money in.  They were not at all frightened because the State was using the money.  They were quite confident that, once the credit of the New Zealand State was behind the repayments, they were going to get those repayments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

      <P>What interest did they pay the depositors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what interest they paid the depositors, but it was whatever was the interest on Savings Certificates.  There may be a 3 per cent. rate nominally, but it works out, of course, at something different if one takes the time for which the money is put in.  The 3 per cent. on Savings Certificates here is reached only if the money is left in for eight or ten years, but the actual payment that is made here to those who invest in Savings Certificates&mdash;certainly in the last issue&mdash;does not work out on the average at as much as 1½ per cent. That money is lying there ready for use.  The Government finds itself in the position that it is congested with credit.  It is congested with money which people lend freely, not asking more than 2½ per cent.  Yet, the State cannot carry out any productive work unless it goes to the money market and borrows, guaranteeing to pay people a certain rate.  In the old days, the sort of sanctified rate was 5 per cent.  I cannot understand why we cannot get the junction that other countries <Col N="1614" /> have found it possible to get.  If people thought that their savings were to be used for speculative business, they might be inclined to say: &ldquo;That is not what we lent the money for.&rdquo; But supposing that all the money is to be used for some productive scheme, under the auspices of the Government, and supposing that the background of the whole thing is a guarantee by the State through the Central Bank that if the need arises they will give the amount of money which the depositors require&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Very well.  Let us then advance along the broad road. There is a State guarantee.  The depositor then need have no fear, whatever the money is used for, and the State has under its control money which it gets at 2½ per cent.  I cannot understand why that money is not used in productive works.  I take a diagram which I have here with regard to the surplus of deposits over withdrawals as far as the Post Office and other savings banks are concerned, and the sales less repayments in regard to Savings Certificates. In the period 1935 to 1939, which this chart covers, there are only two small periods in which the payments back exceeded the amounts paid in.  One was an abnormal period in May, 1938, at a time when there was a financial agreement loan being floated, and of course the people took their money out of 2½ per cent. securities in order to put it into a 5 per cent. loan. <Col N="1615" /> The other occasion was in December of one year, when there was a slight excess, which appeared to be due to withdrawals of money simply for Christmas purchases.  The money was more than paid back and the deficit more than made up by the following January.  In any event, the situation is that in any one year&mdash;or, it could be said, with possibly two or three exceptions in 10 or 20 years, in any one quarter of the year&mdash;the money paid in was more than the money taken out. Certainly it could be said that in any one year since this Post Office savings business came under our control the moneys paid in have been more than the moneys taken out, and so much more that two of those sums have now amounted to £32,000,000.  Why cannot we use that £32,000,000?  I have always been amazed at a matter which has been revealed publicly, and I could not understand the argument which was put up even in this House with regard to it: the Vice-Chairman of the Savings Certificates movement on one occasion addressed the public&mdash;Savings Certificates are not exactly under this Bill, but it is a corresponding type of fund&mdash;and said that they, who were doing volunteer work on propaganda in connection with Savings Certificates, found themselves called off by the Government.  They were told not to use their best efforts with regard to getting money into Savings Certificates. They were indeed at the end told not to do any propaganda with regard to it.  When I raised that matter here in the House, the Minister for Supplies who happened to be dealing with the particular Bill upon which I raised it, said: &ldquo;Of course, you know the reason.  The date is significant&rdquo;. When I asked him to relate the significance of the matter to the date about which I was speaking, he said: &ldquo;We were going for a loan at the time&rdquo;.  That seems to me to be the height of lunacy.  People want to lend money at 1½ or 1¾ per cent.&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Savings Certificates carry more than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The second issue carries nominally three per cent.  The <Col N="1616" /> nominal amount to be earned, if people leave the money in for, I think, eight years, is three per cent.  But the average period for which the deposit is left in is such that in fact the actual payment of interest on the deposit is about 1½ per cent.  It was not as much as two per cent. at the time when the loan was a five per cent. one.  It certainly is not as much as half of the nominal sum when the rate is three per cent.  Call it two per cent. if you like. I do not care if you call it three per cent.  Is it not the height of lunacy to stop people from lending to you at three per cent. in order to force on them five per cent?  Yet that is what was done.  The Government were going for a five per cent. loan, and they said: &ldquo;The best thing to do is to stop all this propaganda on the part of the volunteers who are trying to get money into the Savings Certificates movement. Then we will stem up a certain type of savings that was flowing into the three per cent.  Savings Certificates, and we want that because we are going to pay five per cent&rdquo;.  That was the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the loan before that?  Surely it was five per cent?  In any event, the vice-chairman of the Savings Certificates Committee said publicly: &ldquo;We have been told not to try too much to sell the certificates&mdash;to aim at keeping the new investments just level with the repayments&rdquo;. I am quoting from a speech which the reverend vice-chairman of the Savings Certificates Committee made publicly.  &ldquo;In other words,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the Government does not want any more of this cheap short-term money.  They are afraid of it&rdquo;.  He said: &ldquo;We could do an enormous amount for our farmers if we could re-lend.&rdquo; They could, he said, re-lend Savings Certificates money at about three per cent.&mdash;that is re-lend with the extra administrative costs.  The <Col N="1617" /> reverend chairman wound up by saying: &ldquo;The Government would not even condescend to receive deputations from us to see how savings could be made in the national economy&rdquo;.  Getting savings is one thing&mdash;the people here are saving&mdash;but the constructive use of those savings is another.  The argument apparently against using this type of money is that there is some technical point that the money is supposed to be at call; that it must be kept at call, and, therefore, cannot be used in any long-term investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, the way that that has been done in other countries is that the money is used&mdash;definitely used&mdash;and if the depositor wants any security about whether or not his money will be there at call, then the Government of the State concerned gives him a guarantee, either by way of a definite Government guarantee or through the Central or Federal Reserve Bank, to the effect that the money must be given to him if and when it is called for, and in those countries the Central or Federal Reserve Bank is provided with sufficient money to meet such demands in case there should be an abnormal call by depositors.  Now, many of these countries found themselves in the same position as we were in about 20 years ago.  New Zealand, for instance, found herself in the same rather absurd position, but in New Zealand they decided to deal with that situation in a certain way.  On examining the position, they found that all they would be likely to have to face at call would be about a couple of hundred thousand pounds, and it seems to me that the amount that any country would have to face at call would be about the same amount: that in or about £200,000 would be ample to meet any abnormal withdrawals, supposing that abnormal withdrawals, should occur.  Now, supposing that we had this money given to us freely, or at whatever the interest might be&mdash;we can find out afterwards what the average actual deposits payable to depositors in the Post Office Savings Bank would be&mdash;if it could be lent at 2½ per cent., then is there not a vast field for development here if the money could be got at 2 per cent.?  We all know that there is a vast field for <Col N="1618" /> the development of various types of productivity in this country, such as housing, farm improvements, and so on.  The last report of the Housing Committee takes a hypothesis, giving the pre-war cost of building materials, and also pre-war wages, and they make this calculation&mdash;I do not know exactly how it works out, as I have not the report with me at the moment, but I know the general trend of the argument&mdash;that even if the cost of building materials were doubled, or if the labour cost were doubled, it would only mean a small percentage increase in the general building cost; but if the rate of interest were doubled, it would mean something like 70 per cent. of an increase in the cost of the house.</P>
    <P>Now, let us take the reverse side of that.  Supposing that the cost of materials and the cost of wages go up and that you could offset that by reducing the rate of interest for the period concerned, you might find that even with higher wages and dearer building materials you could provide housing at less than the pre-war cost. The New Zealanders used their money for that purpose.  They used it for other purposes also.  I think that they used it in order to help their farmers to bridge the lag or gap in getting their crops ready for export.  There was a gap to be bridged in connection with getting the crops ready for export in the case of those who had such crops to sell, and the New Zealand Government used the money of the depositors in order to bridge that gap.  I suggest that we could also do that for purposes such as housing, the rebuilding or improvement of farm property, the provision of artificial manures for our farmers, and many other things that are crying aloud for development.  If these moneys could be provided for such purposes, I suggest that it would be of great benefit to our country, but it seems that all we can do is to permit the Post Office Savings moneys to be lodged in certain securities, known as trustee securities.  What will that mean?  How far will we be able to bring back the moneys invested abroad in trustee funds, and what is the rate of interest to be paid on these investments <Col N="1619" /> of a trustee type by a local authority?</P>
    <P>If we are to make a step at all in this direction&mdash;and this is a somewhat cautious and timid step&mdash;why not take the bolder step of using these moneys for purposes such as I have suggested? I admit that it might have to be done cautiously at the beginning, in case investors might get frightened and decide to put their moneys into some other fund, and I certainly would not like to see that happens, but I think that if some very definite type of productivity were selected such as house building&mdash;which is no longer a speculative matter, since houses have to be built and people have to live in them &mdash;that would be one of the best uses to which to put these moneys.  The houses have to be let at economic rents, and the State or the local authority is there to supply whatever deficiency there might be, and I suggest that some activity like that would form a good medium for the investment of these moneys that are at our disposal.  I propose to put down an amendment at a later stage to enable these funds to be embarked on selected types of production under State auspices, always provided that the people who invest their money would be guaranteed that they could get it at call, if they call for it.  If they do get that guarantee, I do not see any reason why the moneys of these depositors should not be used for such types of production.  I know, although I have not the book in front of me at the moment, that the Federal Reserve Fund has something along those lines to deal with such matters, and I propose to move an amendment to that effect at a later stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, Sir, that what Deputy McGilligan proposes to do is already the law.  The State&mdash;that is, the community as a whole&mdash;is the final guarantor to the depositors in the Savings Bank that they will get their money on demand and that they will get 2½ per cent. interest on that money so long as they leave it in the Post Office Savings Bank.  That guarantee has always been there, to supplement <Col N="1620" /> the guarantee that the depositors always have, that the moneys deposited by them have been invested in certain securities.  As Deputies know &mdash;this matter was raised by Deputy Dockrell&mdash;every year the Post Office Savings Bank publishes a list of the securities in which these moneys have been invested.  The final guarantee to the ordinary depositor that his money is safe is the guarantee of the State that, even in the event of these securities which have been published going by the board or depreciating in value, the State guarantees the depositor his money.  As a matter of fact, I think that on one or two occasions, under the British regime, before 1920, the securities in which the Post Office Savings Bank deposits were invested did not yield sufficient to pay the interest on the deposits and the State chipped in to do it.  Therefore I want to point out at the beginning that the guarantee which Deputy McGilligan wants to give to our depositors in relation to the safety of their deposits, if they are invested otherwise than they have been, already exists.  The second question which the Deputy raised was that we should try to assure that these small savings invested in the Post Office Savings Bank and trustee savings banks should be available for general capital development of a desirable kind, like house building and other municipal and county council developments.  The machinery for that also exists.</P>
      <P>This particular Bill is designed to extend the range of investments in which Post Office Savings Bank funds can be invested, but it does not take away the powers that existed previously for the investment of these funds.  One of the securities in which the Post Office Savings Bank funds could be invested is the Local Loans Fund and, as the Deputy and other Deputies, I am sure, are aware from the published return of the investments of the Post Office Savings Bank funds, an appreciable amount of these funds has been invested in the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to take this a step further. First of all, I want to say that the Post Office Savings Bank funds may be invested in the Local Loans Fund.  The <Col N="1621" /> Local Loans Fund is open to all local authorities and has been drawn upon by them for capital development in their areas.  There is no reason why that state of affairs should come to an end.  It is not proposed to bring it to an end under this Bill, and I hope, as time goes on, that local authorities will put up propositions for capital developments which will justify me in advancing to them moneys out of the Local Loans Fund to get on with the work.  Therefore, I want to repeat that the amendments which Deputy McGilligan proposes to move to this Bill at a later stage are unnecessary, first of all, because the State guarantee already exists that, in the event of the investments into which the Post Office Savings Banks funds are put depreciating, the Exchequer will come to the rescue, and, secondly, because all these Post Office Savings Bank funds are available for capital development of a desirable kind, for house building and for other such works, through the Local Loans Fund in which they may be invested.</P>
    <P>The Deputy was not here at the beginning of this debate when I explained the purposes of this Bill, which are rather narrow.  We had met with certain difficulties and we propose to deal with them by a rather small Bill. One of them was that we could not directly invest in the stock of a local authority moneys out of the Post Office Saving Bank funds.  I propose a slight amendment to enable me to invest these funds directly in the trustee stock of public authorities.  The amount of trustee stock available is rather small. Such stocks with the trustee status, have only been offered so far, at any rate, by the Dublin Corporation and the Cork Corporation.  It may be that, in the process of time, the law will be amended to bring stocks issued by other local authorities into the trustee status.  In that event, the Minister for Finance would be empowered, as trustee of the Post Office Savings Bank funds, to invest these funds directly in such stock.  I am quite prepared to admit to Deputy McGilligan that restricting the direct investment of Post Office Savings Bank funds to the trustee stock of local authorities is a <Col N="1622" /> cautious step; but, at any rate, it is a step that required to be taken.  There is no objection to it, however, and I recommend the Dáil to take it.  It does not in any way jeopardise the liquidity of or the security for the Post Office Savings Bank deposits and, in some cases, it will assist the flotation of loans on the public market by authorities like the Dublin Corporation and the Cork Corporation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it confined to trustee securities in order to give more confidence to the depositors?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If we wanted to engage in propaganda in regard to security of the Post Office Savings Bank deposits, I think it would be quite easy to convince the average depositor that a State guarantee is the best guarantee of all.  I am simply limiting the investments that can be made out of the Post Office Savings Bank to trustee stock at the moment, simply because it does all we require.</P>
      <P>There were some rather small points raised and I propose to deal with them. I do not propose to follow the rather broad issues of policy raised by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Norton, as it would take too long and is not strictly <i>ad rem.</i> Deputy Dillon described the activities of the three tailors who covered the emperor with imaginary clothes, but Deputies Dillon and Norton succeeded in covering my small Bill with a lot of big blankets, and I hope to dig it out and examine it before it is smothered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is confined to two purposes, which I explained in my opening speech.  It will enable me to invest directly Post Office Savings Bank funds in trustee stock issued by a local authority and it will enable me, under Section 3, to advance out of the Local Loans Fund moneys to a local authority for the purpose of enabling them to redeem an existing stock after the first day of redemption.  I pointed out that these two matters might be particularly convenient in relation to the financial operations of the Dublin Corporation. Somebody asked me what would be charged for an advance to the Dublin Corporation for that purpose.  If we make an advance out of the Local <Col N="1623" /> Loans Fund, it would be for a short term and would be a matter for arrangement between the Corporation and the Minister for Finance.  If the corporation can get accommodation elsewhere, if the trade union organisations want to advance money to them &mdash;as Deputy Everett said they did, as they were looking for investments&mdash;we would be delighted to see them going to the trade union funds rather than to the Local Loans Fund.  However, in the event of their not having raised the funds by the 1st January and requiring accommodation for a short time from the Local Loans Fund, I want to see that we are legally empowered to give them that accommodation until they wish to float a long-term loan.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe proposed that we should abolish the £2,000 limit which exists at the moment, preventing anybody depositing in the Post Office Savings Bank sums over that amount. Deputy McGilligan said that we could find out what percentage of cash we would need in hands to meet the normal requirements of depositors requiring their funds from time to time.  That could be found out easily, but a rather abnormal situation has crept into this fund of late.  The Savings Bank fund remained rather static over the first 40 years of its life, then it doubled in the next 20 years; but in the last five years it has gone up 200 per cent.  It would be rather difficult, on account of that extraordinary growth, to get a norm.  Notwithstanding the fact that a rather small percentage of the fund in a liquid condition would meet withdrawals, we cannot take too great a risk.</P>
    <P>The funds have been kept very liquid indeed, in that they have been invested only in stock that is readily saleable on the stock exchange.  The fact that a large percentage of these funds has been invested in British stock was conditioned by the fact that very little home stock was offering during these last few years.  I hope that, if there is capital development by the State and by local authorities and <Col N="1624" /> if loans are required, the Post Office Savings Bank fund can be invested, if necessary, in order to help those loans along.  To the extent that it is necessary to cash British securities in which the funds are now invested in order to give that assistance, that will be done. A very large percentage indeed could be invested or cashed before we came down to the same percentage of the total holdings which British securities represented in the period up to 1939.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe's suggestion of doing away with the ceiling was accompanied by the suggestion that we should lower the rate of interest and fix a time limit for withdrawals. There is no legal authority for paying anything less than 2½ per cent.  According to the law as it stands, the Savings Bank fund must give the depositors 2½ per cent. interest and must keep the money practically on demand.  If Deputy Briscoe's suggestion were adopted, it would require a change in the law.  That is a question which could be debated on another occasion &mdash;as to whether we should fix the maximum amount that could be held on current account so that sums over that would either draw a lower rate of interest or the same rate of interest but be payable not on demand but after some fixed period of years.  However, the law compels us to pay 2½ per cent. and to pay depositors on demand.</P>
    <P>I do not want to follow Deputy Dillon into his long disquisitions on credit.  It seems to me he has a wrong impression of what occurred in the matter of Treasury deposit receipts in England during the war.  I do not want to go into that at the moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton asked whether, after this Bill has passed through the Oireachtas, we could invest Post Office funds directly in stock issued by the Naas Urban Council.  We could not&mdash; not directly.  If the Naas Urban Council require £10,000 for the building of houses they have to proceed in the same way as heretofore and get the money from the Local Loans Fund. As I explained already, the Post Office Deposits Fund may be invested in the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1625" /> Deputy Norton also suggested an extension of the activities of the Post Office Savings Bank and to go as far as practically to make it into an institution somewhat similar to an ordinary joint stock commercial bank.  The Post Office Savings Bank is set up to fill a certain rôle and if Deputy Norton wants us to set up a State bank to act in the way commercial banks act, that would have to be done by means of a special Bill.  The Deputy will have noticed that, as regards other countries, even though they might have gone to the extent of nationalising central banks, very few of them, with the exception of France, took steps to nationalise any of the commercial banks.</P>
    <P>Deputy M.E. Dockrell suggested that what we were looking for in this Bill was to get a happy home for the Post Office Savings Bank Fund.  That is not the intention of the Bill at all and I think the Deputy realises that.  He endeavoured to raise a hare, but I do not propose to follow.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt with the question raised by Deputy Hughes.  He asked to what extent money was locked up and whether depositors could get it on demand.  Deputy Everett asked if local authorities can issue trustee securities.  According to the law, I think trustee securities can be issued only by the Dublin and Cork Corporations.  I do not think that Limerick would come into that class.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coburn seems to have a wrong impression as to the importance of a rate of interest on rents.  He seemed to think that it would make very little difference in the rent if the money was advanced either at no per cent. or at 5 per cent. interest.  I have a table here showing that if £600 were advanced to build a house, and the amount was repayable in 30 years, the difference in rent to cover the interest and sinking fund would be considerable. It would vary from 15/- a week in the case of money advanced at the rate of 5 per cent., repayable in 30 years, to 9/- a week if money were advanced at 1 per cent., or 1/11 a week if money were advanced at 3 per cent.</P>

      <P>I should have explained that that is the rate per £100, and it would be necessary to multiply by six. I will give the Deputy the figures in relation to £100 and he can make his own calculation.  As regards a rate of interest of 1 per cent., repayment period 30 years, the rent required to pay the interest and sinking fund on that £100 over the 30 years would be ? a week; at 2 per cent. it would be ? a week; at 3 per cent. it would be 1/11 a week; at 4 per cent.,2/2 ½ a week, and at 5 per cent., 2/6 a week. Of course, you can go on to a repayment period of 40 years.  If the loans were extended for 40 years, the difference would be more marked.  The repayment of £100 at 1 per cent. would mean ½ a week; at 2 per cent., ? a week; at 3 per cent., ? a week; at 4 per cent., 1/11 a week, and at 5 per cent., ? a week.</P>

      <P>Before you put the motion, Sir, might I draw the Minister's attention to a couple of questions which I addressed to him and which he does not seem to have covered in his reply?  My main interest in the subject was that the Dublin Corporation was specifically referred to in his opening remarks and, indeed, was given as the reason for the introduction of Section 3.  I should like him to ease our minds on one point.  In view of the fact that this assistance was not requested by the Dublin Corporation and that in fact it could have made, and was in process of making, alternative arrangements which in the ultimate would, perhaps, bear less <Col N="1628" /> heavily on them than the Minister's proposed arrangement, would be assure the House now, and particularly Deputies from the Dublin area, that the step taken in this Bill in relation to the redemption of stock by the Dublin Corporation in January next does not interfere in any way with the arrangements of the Dublin Corporation regarding its projected loan, either in regard to its terms or the date of its flotation?  The Minister will appreciate that there are matters in respect of which Ministerial assent is required and in respect of which that assent has been given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that the Minister for Local Government could only refuse sanction to a loan where it was issued at less than 95 or for an interest rate above 4 per cent.  The Dublin Corporation stock issue came within these limits so that the Minister for Local Government could not refuse his sanction.  If the Dublin Corporation want to go ahead, even with their first proposition, we cannot prevent them, but I think the ratepayers and taxpayers of the country are entitled to a better deal.  They are entitled to get money at as low a rate of interest from the public as any other public in the world are prepared to give money to their corporations and their governments, and also if they want bank accommodation, they are entitled to get it at a low rate, and, if the State wants it, the State is entitled to get it at as low a rate as any other government in the world.  If Dublin Corporation want to go ahead within the limits fixed by law, they can do so, but if they want my assistance, such assistance as I am able to give under the Bill, to ensure that they get money from the public on terms which are very favourable to the public&mdash;and I believe the public are prepared to pay&mdash;they are welcome to it.  If they want to go ahead, the Minister for Local Government cannot stand in their way unless they propose to exceed the limits set down.</P>

      <P>May I claim your indulgence, Sir, as the matter is extremely important and it is desirable that any misunderstandings on the <Col N="1629" /> subject should be cleared here and now?  There are two sets of transactions to which the Minister apparently referred.  One has been successfully cleared out of the way with the consent of the Minister concerned and the Corporation.  A second situation has arisen, and when I referred to &ldquo;assent&rdquo; by the Minister, I did not mean assent in the full sense of assent to a proposition or definite demand on the part of the Corporation.  I was referring to a rather helpful discussion as between the Finance Committee of the Corporation and the Minister, arising out of which there was a further approach by the Finance Committee to the Minister when what we proposed to do was stated, with a request for his assent, his co-operation, or, rather, his advice in the matter.  There is a wide difference between the assent of the Minister to a direct application with regard to a loan and his assent in the sense of advice to the committee before deciding on their figures.  Apparently the Minister has now made it clear that the Corporation can go ahead, but I hope I gather from him that we shall go ahead with the goodwill of the two Ministers concerned and that the necessary co-operation will be forthcoming from the appropriate Government Departments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the adjournment of the debate on this Bill I had an opportunity, on the Bill which has just received a Second Reading, of referring to some matters that I intended to refer to on this measure, so that I do not propose to repeat what I said then.  I understood the Minister in his statement to be more or less inclined to restrict the scope of this debate, as he stated that the Bill referred only to houses to be built in rural areas and by public utility societies.  The main reason for introducing this Bill was the provision of an extra room for the purpose of segregating tuberculosis patients from other members of a household.  I want to refer to one or two matters connected with housing as it affects people in rural areas, principally on the question of valuation.  Heretofore, people whose valuations were up to £25 were the only ones who received a grant of £40, but I think the Minister should follow the example of the Minister for Agriculture, who extended the figure after a little experience of the farm improvement scheme.  The Minister acted very wisely in removing the restriction as far as valuations are concerned, by bringing in others whose valuations varied from £40 to £70.  As a result there has been a considerable increase in the production of the land and by the extensive drainage that was carried out.  That scheme also gave a large amount of employment, and improved land held by labourers. The Minister should follow the example of the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="1632" /> by making the grant under this Bill available to people whose valuations are above those mentioned in previous Acts.</P>
      <P>On the question of providing an extra room where persons are suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, from the point of view of humanity alone, everybody agrees with anything and everything that can be done to help people who have the misfortune to be stricken with this disease, but I should like to be assured that it will be of real value.  I may be old-fashioned and peculiar, one who sometimes thinks of things that it might not be popular to say in public, but I believe, if a person thinks of something that he feels he should say, he should do so.  Sometimes I think that there is too much talk about consumption in this country; that we have it discussed at breakfast, dinner and tea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Possibly that may do good, but it could also do harm, especially amongst people coming from other countries. While it may be all right to do what we can to alleviate the sufferings of people who are affected, we should not magnify things, but should take precautions, without telling the world all about our business.  Sometimes it is dangerous to lavish too much praise on matters discussed in this House, just as it is dangerous to go to the other extreme, and to criticise them unduly. Accordingly, I propose to adopt the middle course when dealing with the proposal to provide an extra room.  If the local medical authority is convinced that it is necessary to build an extra room, then that authority will, in the ordinary course, notify the owner of the house, that the tenant or a member of the family occupying it is suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, and a room is built.  Under the usual conditions there is a grant of £100 or a two-thirds contributions from the local authority, whichever is the lesser. When the room is built, and if after a few months the tenant, and his family, change to a new residence, what effect is that going to have on the letting value of the house?  What effect is it going to have on other people who want a house?  What effect will it have when there is knowledge of the fact <Col N="1633" /> that, attached to the house is a room in which a person suffering from tuberculosis has been dwelling for 12 months or 2 years?  I do not see any safeguard in regard to that respect of the situation.</P>
    <P>It is laid down in the Bill that this extra room must be built in accordance with the specification of the people appointed to look after these things.  I take it they will be the engineers employed by the local authorities. There, again, I would ask the Minister and his Department to be extra careful as to the type of room built to fulfil this want which we all agree is necessary.  We must be realists about this.  We are not all saints and angels in this country, and we know the type of room that can be built in order to qualify for this grant.  We know that there could be a certain type of annex built to a house that would be nothing more than a block-house, an ordinary ice-house built of concrete walls, the walls erected from an inferior quality of sand, possibly sea sand or sand containing a big content of what is known as loan.  In the winter, a room of that kind would be weeping the whole time.  There would possibly, be no fire in it, so that for the patient the cure would be worse than the disease.  A person would be endangering his life by going to live in a room of that kind.  Therefore, I put it to the Minister that special care should be taken as to the type of room built under the operation of this measure.</P>
    <P>The Minister last night seemed to issue a challenge to Deputy Alfred Byrne to vote against this Bill. Candidly, it would not take a lot to persuade me to vote against it, and for various reasons, one or two of which I have given.  If I believe I am right, no matter how other members of the House may feel about a matter, then I am going to give expression to my opinions.  The opinion that I have in connection with this scheme is this&mdash;I may be wrong or I may be right&mdash;that it is more or less cutting across the comprehensive scheme propounded by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government.  There is the question that possibly too many cooks may spoil the broth.  We must <Col N="1634" /> remember that we cannot eradicate this dread disease overnight.  It is going to take years and years to do that.  It is essential that our plans should be well laid.  To do things in a hurry is not going to be of any avail in arresting the spread of the disease.  Its eradication is going to take a lot of money and a lot of time.  While giving the Minister credit for the best intentions, I have at the back of my mind the feeling that this sum of £100,000 which it is proposed to spend on 1,000 houses&mdash;an average of £100 per room&mdash; could possibly be better utilised if it were incorporated in the big scheme propounded by his Parliamentary Secretary.  That is only my opinion. I may be right or I may be wrong, and possibly time will tell.</P>
    <P>I feel, however, that the erection of these rooms can be a potential source of infection.  I have been led to believe, and so, I think, have most people in the country, especially those best qualified to judge, that so far as the wiping out of this disease is concerned, the first fundamental is complete isolation.  There is a general feeling amongest our people that that is fundamental to a successful campaign against the spread of T.B.  Will anybody in his sober senses tell me that, when you erect one of these rooms, a member of a family suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis is going to go into it, live there and not be visited by any other member of the family, and that there is going to be complete isolation?  It cannot and will not be done.  Possibly there will be other members of the family living in the same room.  It is questionable whether even the patient himself will stay in that room.  If you have 1,000 of these rooms spread all over the country, they can be a possible source of infection.  I would ask the Minister to bear these points in mind.  I can see his object in introducing this scheme&mdash;that he thinks it will be a great help to the general scheme already outlined by his Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>Again, I urge on him that careful supervision will be needed both in regard to the erection and the materials used in these rooms, because if they are not built in the right way <Col N="1635" /> to suit the patients going into them, it would be better not to have them at all.  One of the main reasons for the introduction of the Bill is that it prolongs the life of the section in the 1932 Act which makes provision for grants to houses erected in rural areas or by public utility societies.  While I would not vote against the Bill because of that section, I am still strongly of the opinion that the Minister is possibly on the wrong track in giving this £100 for the erection of these rooms.  I am of opinion that it would be better to leave this whole question to the Parliamentary Secretary and that section of his Department that is dealing exclusively with the arrest and cure of tuberculosis. Members of the House, irrespective of what Party they belong to, are prepared to give him hearty approval and all the co-operation that is essential in dealing with this disease.  No matter how we may disagree on other matters, we are all ready to do what we possibly can to help the people who have the misfortune to be afflicted with one of the worst diseases that could be found in this or any other country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. P. Burke Mr. P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great pleasure in complimenting the Minister for Local Government on the introduction of this Bill because, in my opinion, it is another intelligent step in the right direction.  Isolation is the one thing that is definitely necessary for anybody suffering from tuberculosis.  So far as the spread of the disease is concerned, it is true, as has been stated on numerous occasions here, that the disease is handed round and not handed down.  The Minister, in this measure, is trying to go a step further than the Sanatoria Act by making provision so that a man, woman or child, suffering from the disease can be isolated until such time as he or she can be removed to a sanatorium, and on returning from it can be provided with a separate room until a final cure is effected.  That is a definite advance in the right direction so far as the public health is concerned.  It is a most desirable advance.  I know families in my own constituency where a son or <Col N="1636" /> daughter, or a father or mother may be affected with tuberculosis.  It may be that an affected member of the family is sleeping in the same room or in the same bed as another member of the household.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in his wisdom, has foreseen these possibilities, and in this Bill is doing something that it is essential should be done.  I have heard certain criticisms of it even by the last Deputy, but I think that, as a public representative, he should welcome the Bill.  I would suggest that the Minister should go even further, if possible, to eradicate that disease. Surely Deputy Coburn does not think that £100 is too much to spend if it is to save a whole household from being wiped out by that disease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The only way the family can be saved is to isolate the patient.  No matter how healthy the family may be if they are living in one or two rooms and if the man, woman or child who becomes infected is not isolated on the advice of the medical officer and if all the precautions are not taken against the spread of the disease, the family will eventually become infected.  Any effort that the Minister makes will be welcomed by every intelligent man and woman in this country.  There is a feeling in the country about this disease and there is a tendency to cloak it.  I believe in discussing these things so that the people may take an intelligent view of them.  T.B. is a natural disease which should be tackled and not hidden.  We cannot advance in the treatment of T.B. unless there is an intelligent outlook in regard to it on the part of the people.</P>
      <P>I am sure that in the building of these rooms adequate steps will be taken by the responsible officers to ensure that they are suitable for the purpose for which they are provided. I wish again to compliment the Minister on his intelligent Bill, which I regard as a further advance in connection with public health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing about this Bill of which I am very much in favour, namely, that the administration of Section 3 is given to the local authority almost in its entirely.  The provision of extra rooms to houses is curtailed in so far as the amount of money voted in respect of the Bill is limited to £100,000 and also by reason of the provision in Section 3 that the county council medical officer of health must certify that the room is necessary and that the local authority must be satisfied that the room is necessary.  Listening to some Deputies, one would come to the conclusion that as a result of the passage of this Bill the country would become studded with houses having extra rooms built under this Bill.</P>
      <P>This Bill, to my mind, is a complement to the Tuberculosis (Establishment of Sanatoria) Bill which was passed some months ago.  I am sure the Minister for Local Government does not envisage a situation arising in which every person suffering from T.B. shall be accommodated with an extra room to his house.  The Bill provides for the erection of extra rooms. The county medical officer of health will say to the local authority, &ldquo;This room is absolutely necessary for the treatment of such-and-such a patient&rdquo; and the local authority will be satisfied that the room can be attached to the house and that it is necessary to have it attached to the house.  The individual patient is not prevented from having sanatorium treatment under this Bill.  To my mind this Bill will release beds in sanatoria and will enable sanatoria to admit patients for whom sanatorium treatment is absolutely essential.  Therefore, I am very much in favour of the Bill.  Listening to the debate I was almost forced to the conclusion that certain Deputies would make the suggestion that the Minister might use this Bill to have rooms built for the supporters of his Party.  In my opinion, the opposition to this Bill is not sincere.  I think that the House and the country can rest assured that the money voted for this measure will be spent wisely and well.  Therefore, I think the Bill deserves the full support of every section of opinion represented in the House.</P>

      <P>When I read Section 3 of this Bill I regarded it as something of a revolutionary character but I must admit that my reaction to it was wholly favourable.  There is, however, one point which I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister and, while he may not be able to give me a satisfactory answer now, I hope he will in any event, use his good offices to bring the point of view to the persons who will be immediately concerned with it.  Where the head of a household in which there is an infected person has an objection or in any event fails to apply for the facilities which this Bill provides, I should like to ensure that such a household will not be discriminated against if there is an application made for institutional treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that most families, particularly families of ordinary means, prefer to get their sick ones, those infected with tuberculosis, removed to a sanatorium.  I know at least one county medical officer of health who is very enthusiastic about a scheme of this kind.  I have often heard him express the opinion that something of this nature was overdue and, in fact, he thought it should have come even before the Tuberculosis (Establishment of Sanatoria) Bill which was recently passed.  In the case of a county medical officer of health with these views, there is a danger that, in his enthusiasm, he might lean against a person who would not apply to have these facilities provided in his own home.  I am sure the danger is not very great but at the same time it is not clear from the terms of the Bill that such an applicant cannot be discriminated against by a medical officer of health who is enthusiastic about it, such as the officer I have in mind.  I should like to endorse what the last speaker said about the provisions of this Bill being complementary to, rather than in conflict with, the Sanatorium Bill.  I have in mind poor families&mdash;and most of the families in the district I represent must, I am sorry to say, be classified as such.  The treatment of tuberculosis is oftentimes very prolonged.  If you visit a sanatorium, you will find that patients have been there 12 months or longer. <Col N="1639" /> A certain amount of nostalgia is bound to affect those people when they are so long from home and they often make application to be allowed home for festive seasons, such as Christmas and Easter.  The county medical officer of health must be influenced, in these circumstances, by his knowledge of the home conditions of the particular patient&mdash;the housing accomodation available as well as the competence of the household to provide the necessary nourishment while the patient is at home.</P>
    <P>In that way, I think that the facilities provided in this Bill should work in very nicely in providing a holiday at home for patients at a time of year when milk and eggs are fairly plentiful.  In the Connemara area, eggs and milk, particularly, are very scarce in the winter but they would be available to most families for the few months of summer.  I think that the extra room in a house would enable the tuberculosis authorities to arrange for a period of a month or two at home for patients at a time when milk and eggs could be found for them. For that reason, I think that the scheme makes the sanatorium scheme more complete than it otherwise would be.  In some cases, there may be a psychological objection because of the family being associated in local knowledge with tubercular affection, but I think that the fear that neighbours would become aware that the disease has affected a family is dying out and that people are only too glad to report to the authorities and clamour for institutional treatment.  If the Minister would assure me that there will not be any discrimination against parties who, for one reason or another, will not avail themselves of the facilities afforded by the Bill, I should not have to qualify my welcome to this Bill in the slightest way.</P>

      <P>On the first occasion upon which it was my duty to present Estimates for the Department of Local Government and Public Health to this House, we heard a great deal about the problem of tuberculosis.  Recalling that discussion <Col N="1640" /> and the apparent enthusiasm&mdash;perhaps &ldquo;impatience&rdquo; would be the better word&mdash;of members of the Opposition to have something effective done in order to lessen the incidence of that disease in our midst, I should have thought that a Bill of this sort would have received a universal welcome.</P>

      <P>Three years &mdash; a shorter time than that of the Deputy's, occupation of the office of Minister for Local Government and Public Health, during which he did nothing.  Instead, however, of its receiving a favourable reception, instead of its being criticised in a rational way, instead of an attempt being made to improve the Bill by constructive suggestions, I have seldom listened in this House to more eloquent nonsense in opposition to a Bill than it was my unlucky fate to have heard for the greater part of yesterday afternoon.  Members on the Opposition Benches got up and spoke at length against&mdash;there is no other word than that which would adequately describe their attitude&mdash;Sections 3 and 4 of this Bill.  It was clear from their speeches that they had not even read the Bill, and that they had not, in connection with it, adverted to the provisions of the Public Health Bill which my colleague in the Department of Local Government and Public Health had hoped to introduce to the House to-day, and that they had forgotten, even though I had reminded them at the beginning of my speech, that, at the instance of the Government, the Oireachtas had decided that three large sanatoria should be erected in suitable centres in order to make good, almost to the full extent, the existing deficiency of sanatorium accommodation here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose, in due course, to traverse the points which Deputies who are opposed to this Bill made in the course of their speeches.  But, before doing so, I should single out one Deputy who made a speech which offered a reasonable criticism, not of the proposals themselves, but of the fact that the provisions of Section 3 had been included in the measure.  I refer to the <Col N="1641" /> speech of Deputy Roddy, who opened the debate on behalf of the Opposition. I regard that speech as a reasonable one.  It raised certain aspects of this matter which, undoubtedly; from the point of view of the House, required to be dealt with, and it advanced them in a reasonable and moderate way which showed that the Deputy was concerned to discharge his proper responsibilities here and to render public service in a manner which is in very pleasant contrast to that of those members of his Party who followed him.  Deputy Roddy criticised the inclusion of Sections 3 and 4 in the measure, on the ground that he did not think that the provisions of those sections were proper to a Housing Bill at all.</P>
    <P>He adopted that attitude on the ground that these sections go further than any previous Act by bringing in the local authorities as well as the State.  He said that under the section the local authorities will be bound for the first time to make a grant towards the provision of this additional housing accommodation.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy made that point in good faith but he made it in error because if he had referred, when considering Section 2 of the Bill, to the Principal Act he would have seen that, under Section 5, sub-section (1), paragraph (i), provision is made for local authorities to make grants to public utility societies and if he had carried his researches further and consulted the Housing and Labourers Acts of 1937, he would have seen that once again local authorities are empowered to make grants to private individuals towards the repair of houses of which they are owners.  I think that these two sections demolish the point which Deputy Roddy has made, that we were going further with this Bill than we had ever gone before in requiring or empowering local authorities to make grants to private individuals for the purpose of providing additional housing accommodation.</P>
    <P>But even if we were going further than had been done previously, I do not think that that in itself would be a valid argument against the provisions of the section.  After all, we are a progressive State.  We are a progressive <Col N="1642" /> people and, whatever about the Opposition, we here in the Government are a progressive Party.  If it seems to us that a grave and serious problem of this sort, touching the welfare of the community as a whole, requires that we should go further than ever has been done before, in an attempt to provide suitable housing accommodation for our people, I think we should at least have the courage to make that progress which the circumstances warrant.</P>
    <P>The next point which Deputy Roddy made against the Bill was that the provisions of the new sections of the Bill should be included in a Public Health Act.  This Bill is concerned with housing, and what Section 3 proposes to do is to provide additional housing accommodation for people who require housing accommodation albeit of a special kind.  But whether the housing accommodation must be of a special kind or not, it constitutes a shelter and a habitation.  I think in those circumstances that the proper place for a provision of that sort is in a Housing Bill. We have heard here frequently when measures are being introduced here in this House, the Leader of the Opposition criticising on the grounds that we are doing nothing to codify or consolidate existing enactments.  In the case of the Local Government Bill of this year, which the House recently debated on Second Reading, the whole foundation of the attack launched on that Bill by the Leader of the Opposition was that we were doing nothing to consolidate local government law.  I ask the House to consider the terms in which Deputy Mulcahy would have criticised the measure if these sections, designed, remember, to provide additional housing accommodation, had been included in a public health measure.  We would have been told then&mdash;and I am certain that Deputy Roddy would have agreed with him&mdash;that these sections, properly housing sections, should have been included in a Housing Bill.</P>
    <P>The next ground on which Deputy Roddy criticised the Bill was that grants should be paid by the State and not by the local authorities.  I have often commented in debates here upon the foolish attitude which Deputies purporting <Col N="1643" /> to speak for local authorities, adopt in this House when measures come before it which impose additional responsibilities upon them.  I think that local authorities have a very important part to play in this community. I regard them as a very valuable training ground for our people.  The things which they do intimately concern our people.  If I were a member of a local authority, instead of trying to shirk the burden of the public weal I should endeavour to enlarge the scope of my activities and endeavour to make my local body play a more and more important part in the public life of this State.</P>
    <P>In doing that, I would realise that if I accepted responsibility I should have to accept it in every aspect, that if I were going to provide new services I should also have to provide the finances to maintain them.  That would be my attitude, and I think those Deputies who continually say: &ldquo;We must have the services; we must get all the credit for the operation of the services,&rdquo; while at the same time the State and the Central Exchequer bear all the burden, are rapidly reducing us to a position in which we shall have to consider whether, in fact, in the minds of these Deputies there is any real place for the local authorities in our system of administration and government.  It would be a sorry day if the country were driven to that, but quite obviously we cannot continue to administer the local public services if every member of the Opposition Party who is a member of a local authority gets up here and strikes the attitude of a gold-digger out for the night with a wealthy client and has nothing to say in this House on any measure to advance the public good except: &ldquo;Give me.  Give me.  Give me.&rdquo;  Those who want these things done, those who believe they ought to be done, must also take the responsibility of telling their people that, to the extent of the local resources, they must contribute to the cost of them as well.</P>
    <P>In relation to this particular aspect of the matter, the local authorities are charged with definite public health functions, and rightly charged with <Col N="1644" /> them, because there are no persons so much concerned to ensure that the public health will be maintained and preserved in a district as those who live within that district.  There are no persons, therefore, who can be more equitably called upon to bear their fair share of the cost of maintaining the public health, and the individual health of themselves and their neighbours, that those who will benefit by public health measures in the first degree.  In the case of tuberculosis, and in particular in relation to that degree of it with which this section is intended to deal, I think that the local communities are the people who are first concerned, because those who live in the neighbourhood of persons who may be infected persons, or who may tend to become infectious persons, should be concerned to ensure that everything they can do, out of their own resources, if necessary, to prevent the spread of the disease shall be done.</P>
    <P>That should be their general attitude in relation to measures to combat tuberculosis, for under the existing Tuberculosis Acts the local authorities are bound to take certain measures to prevent the spread of the disease.  They are bound to provide curative measures for it, and to take those measures on the understanding that if the State pays half the cost they will pay the other half.  In this Bill, we are treating the local authorities much more favourably in this matter than they have ever been treated before.  I do not want to dwell on it at length because I hope to get all the stages of this Bill this evening, but I say that under Section 3 of this Bill we are proposing to deal more generously with them as a housing authority than we have ever done before, and if I had time to analyse the whole situation I think I could convince the House of that fact.  For that reason, therefore, I think there is no substance in the argument advanced by Deputy Roddy that the State should bear the whole cost of providing this accommodation and that the local authorities should not contribute anything at all.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of this matter; those I have dealt with represent the basic or first principles.  There is <Col N="1645" /> another very striking consideration which we ought to bear in mind.  It is true, under one of the sections of the Bill, that where additional accommodation is provided the value of that accommodation as a habitation will not be taken into account for a definite period of years, but, after that period has elapsed, and when, as we hope, conditions in the afflicted household have returned to normal, this additional accommodation will be a source of revenue&mdash;and a continuing source of revenue&mdash;to the local authorities.  It will increase the value of the property, and the local authority will be entitled to levy rates upon it in the ordinary way.  I think in fact the position is that very shortly they would recover in the form of rates the cost to them of providing this additional revenue-producing asset.</P>
    <P>So much for the three points of criticism which Deputy Roddy advanced against the provisions of Section 3 of the Bill.  He had something to say in regard to Section 2, and in particular to the operation of the general administration of the Housing Acts.  First of all, let me refer to the fact that Deputy Roddy suggested that the administration of the housing section of my Department is not all it should be.  He stated that schemes submitted by the local authorities have been held up for months for no sound administrative reason.  I do not want the housing programme of the Government to be impeded in any way by reason of any defect in my administration.  I am concerned to ensure that houses will be built by the local authorities and by private individuals under the Act of 1932 as expeditiously as possible, and I want to convey to Deputy Roddy that I should be very grateful indeed if he would give me the cases which he had in mind when he made that statement, so that I might have them investigated.</P>
    <P>Now I come to Deputy Martin O'Sullivan. Deputy O'Sullivan stated that he was disappointed by my statement on tuberculosis.  I do not see why Deputy O'Sullivan should have experienced that disappointment.  As I have said before, this is a Housing Bill; it is not a Public Health Bill. In explaining the provisions of Section <Col N="1646" /> 3, and in justifying the need for those provisions, I did not intend to make a comprehensive survey of the tuberculosis problem in this State. That would not now be my function. The exercise of all my powers as Minister for Public Health have been delegated to my Parliamentary Secretary, Dr. Ward, who, I am certain, could explain or could expound much more effectively than I could what the policy of the Government and the programme of the Government in regard to tuberculosis is and is going to be.</P>
    <P>I referred to the reasons why we felt it would be advantageous to provide the separate accommodation which can be provided under Section 3 of the Bill.  In doing so, Sir, I happened to mention the fact that a considerable number of people in this country were suffering from tuberculosis, in its earlier stages, who did not require, for their cure, actual accommodation in a sanatorium, who, perhaps, would be very unwilling to go to a sanatorium, and in whose cases, perhaps, the family disruption, as Deputy Dillon described it, would be so great as practically to present an insurmountable obstacle to their going to a sanatorium as he suggested.  Accordingly, I do not see what justification Deputy Martin O'Sullivan, who professes to speak with a certain amount of objectiveness in these debates, has for the remarks he made.  I do not see why he should have been so concerned about this or why he should have professed so much disappointment&mdash;except for this reason: that this measure of ours, to assist in the campaign against tuberculosis, was very unwelcome to a member of a political party which has been endeavouring to cash in politically on the ravages which this scourge has wrought, not alone on our people but on people everywhere during the last three or four years.  In that connection, Sir, I shall have something further to say to other Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Martin O'Sullivan also went on to say that the House had been given to understand that provision would be made <Col N="1647" /> for a scale of allowances to dependents of tuberculosis patients, and that this has not been done.  He complained that it had not been done under this measure.  Well, the important and fortunate thing about Government administration is that if it is to be effective it has to be conducted in an orderly way, and one of the faculties which those who are members of an Administration have to have is that of being able to plan in a rational way. Apparently, however, Deputy Martin O'Sullivan's mind does not work in that sort of fashion: he wants everything jumbled together, higgledy-piggledy, like packets in a bran-barrel, but I should have thought that even in his mental confusion the Deputy might have adverted to the public health measure, which we ought to have been discussing to-day, and to the White Paper or Explanatory Memorandum which accompained it.</P>
      <P>I should have thought that if he was really concerned about this matter, and not concerned just to try to pick holes in the Bill, he would have seen from Section 34 of the Public Health Bill, that power is being taken there to deal with the very problem to which he referred, and that even if he had found the task of reading this Bill too heavy for his sloth, he could have contented himself with reading the Explanatory Memorandum.  I say, that if he had contented himself by reading that memorandum&mdash;if, in fact, he had done his ordinary duty as a Deputy, who is sent in here to discuss public matters&mdash;he would not have made the sort of speech which he did make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cogan, again, Sir, I must say, made a very reasonable and sensible speech on the Bill.  He did advance a suggestion which at this stage I am not prepared to accept: That we should increase the over-riding limit of valuation which governs the making of grants for reconstruction.  I do not want to discuss this at length&mdash;we may, perhaps, have another opportunity of dealing with it&mdash;but my general attitude towards the whole problem of housing is that the matter is under review in the Department and that <Col N="1648" /> these issues must be dealt with comprehensively and not piece-meal.  Therefore, until the situation has clarified itself and we are able to say with certainty what we propose to do and can do, I do not propose to vary any of the fundamental provisions of the Housing Act of 1932.  The Deputy also, in relation to Sections 3 and 4, asked would these apply to labourers' cottages: that is to say, I presume, to cottages which are the property of local authorities.  They will.  If the Deputy will refer to Section 3 of the Bill, he will see that the grant will be made to either the owner or occupier, and, of course, where the local authority happens to be the owner, it will be in the same position as a private owner would be, so far as the Government grant is concerned.</P>
    <P>I come now, Sir, to what I regard as one of the most disgraceful performances on this Bill&mdash;the speech of Deputy Dillon.  I defy any member of this House to read Deputy Dillon's speech and to show to me or to prove to or satisfy himself&mdash;because he certainly will not satisfy me&mdash;having read, the speech, that there was one thread of consistent argument in it from beginning to end.  Like Deputy Martin O'Sullivan, Deputy Dillon had not taken the trouble even to read the measure, and I know, Sir, that he was not in the House when I was introducing it.  He started off by adopting the attitude that the provisions of Section 3 were retrogressive because they implied that we were going to adopt as a policy the subterfuge&mdash;perhaps that is the best word&mdash;of confining, I think he actually said, people suffering from tuberculosis in single rooms in their own houses and that we were doing that because we were not prepared to face up to the problem of providing at the earliest possible moment sanatorium accommodation for those who require it.</P>
    <P>I was very careful to make it quite clear that, as I think Deputy Hilliard said&mdash;and I wish other people who have spoken against this measure had only the clarity of mind that he had&mdash; the provisions of these sections were complementary to the provisions of the Sanatoria Act.  I mentioned the fact <Col N="1649" /> that in January last the House had given us authority to proceed with the erection of these sanatoria.  I told the House that very satisfactory progress had been made in planning them. When I told Deputy Dillon that I had said that, the Deputy shifted his ground.  He said then that one of the principal grounds for his objection was that we were confining the operation of the Bill to pulmonary cases of tuberculosis and that we were doing nothing for the non-pulmonary cases.  He said, in fact, that there was no accommodation, or practically no accommodation, for sufferers from non-pulmonary tuberculosis and that we were doing nothing to provide it.  I do not know whether the matter will arise on the discussion of the Public Health Bill, but I can assure Deputy Dillon&mdash;and I think if he reads a letter over the name of a very near relative of his which appears in this month's <i>Medical Journal</i> he will be satisfied that what I am saying is true&mdash;that we are providing accommodation for non-pulmonary cases in those types of institutions where, I am informed, these difficult cases can be most adequately dealt with.</P>
    <P>Then, having been driven off that field, the Deputy made what I consider to have been one of the most disgraceful attacks I ever listened to in this House upon public servants. He condemned the Bill as imprudent. On what grounds?  That the county medical officers of health, upon whose certificate this accommodation is to be provided, were not to be trusted; that they were incompetent.  He asked me&mdash;<i>árgumentum ad hominem</i>&mdash;if I had any friend of mine suffering from tuberculosis would I entrust him to the tender mercies of these county medical officers of health who, he alleged, had no special qualifications for dealing with this disease.  What a compliment that was to Deputy Dr. O'Higgins and his colleagues in the medical profession. I can say that, in regard to tuberculosis, we have in the service of our local authorities as competent medical officers as are to be found anywhere in the world.  It has been the policy of the Department where men and women are being recruited to that <Col N="1650" /> service&mdash;generally in the position of assistant county medical officers of health&mdash;to ensure that they have had special experience in the treatment of this disease.  I am perfectly certain that no medical officer of health would permit a person to remain as a patient in his own home if his own well being and the well being of his family and of his neighbours required that he should be treated in a sanatorium.  It would be, in fact, unthinkable that these men, who belong to an honourable profession, who have made the care of their people their first concern, could be guilty of that dereliction of duty to which Deputy Dillon has alleged they would be prone.</P>
    <P>Deputy Everett asked that we should provide, if a grant has been given, that the rent will not be increased.  We have already covered that particular matter because, if the Deputy will look at Section 11 (3) of the Rent Restrictions Bill, which passed this House yesterday, he will see that: &ldquo;For the purposes of sub-section (2) of this section, the amount of any grant under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts 1932 to 1944, as amended or extended by any subsequent enactment&rdquo;&mdash;and in particular by this enactment&mdash;&ldquo;shall not be reckoned as part of any amount expended on any improvement, structural alteration or repairs to which that sub-section applies.&rdquo;  Accordingly, the increase in the value of the property which will arise by the provision of this accommodation cannot be availed of to raise the rent in the case of those dwellings, which are covered by the Rent Restrictions Act.</P>

      <P>Of course they can, if they are willing to increase the rates for the purpose of preventing an increase in the rent.  They cannot, however, have it both ways: they cannot prevent an increase in the rent and at the same time refuse to provide money to meet whatever deficiencies may arise.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connor asked that the position of a landlord with power under a lease to impose a penal rent where a building has been erected, where he might allege these buildings were erected in breach of the covenant, should be considered and that we should have power to prevent that.  I will look into that matter and, while I do not promise to bring an amendment in here, I may, if I feel the need for it, introduce an amendement in the Seanad; or, perhaps, we might see whether the need for such an amendment arises in practice.  The Deputy also expressed some fear that the operation of the Bill might be held up by the town planning authorities.  I think that is inconceivable, since the local authority and the town planning authority are the one and the same body.  I cannot see that the local authority with its right hand would be trying to implement this measure, and with its left hand trying to prevent that being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said something about the speech of Deputy Dillon.  I do not know what I could say that you would permit in this House in relation to the speech of Deputy Alfred Byrne.  Deputy Byrne said that, under this measure, the Minister is giving tuberculosis sufferers an empty room, but is not <Col N="1652" /> providing them with treatment.  I do not know whether the Deputy can read or not.  I suppose he can, as I have heard him read a number of self-advertising letters in this House from time to time, but if he can, he might, later in the evening, perhaps by his own fireside, read sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the Bill.  He will see there that the county medical officer of health must certify that the infected member of the household not only is suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis but is undergoing treatment for it.  The Deputy knows, of course, that if he is undergoing treatment for it, the treatment is being provided for him under the existing tuberculosis code.  The Deputy then went on to say&mdash;and I hope that having said it he will have the courage to call a division and in the Division Lobby place himself on record as against this Bill, because his speech was a speech against the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He said that this £100 per room could be better spent by giving it to the hospitals.  If I had brought in a Bill to give to the hospitals the grant of £100,000 which the implementation of this Bill will cost, Deputy Byrne would have wanted me to do something else with it.  He then went on to say: &ldquo;This £100 per room is going to condemn a patient to stay in that room without nursing facilities&rdquo;. Now, the Bill provides that the person concerned must be undergoing treatment and part of the treatment will include, of course, such attention as may be required by a nurse.  Without medical attention, how can the medical officer of health certify the person as undergoing treatment?</P>

      <P>The Deputy also said the patient was being left without food. The Deputy is a member of the Dublin Corporation.  He knows that, under a scheme introduced in this House about 18 months ago, the corporation have been enabled to make to people suffering from tuberculosis grants to buy the protective foods which they require.  The Deputy said they were going to be compelled to stay in those empty rooms without beds or bedding. He knows well that that is not true.  I do not know how one can stigmatise a person who says something which he knows is not true.  You cannot call a man a liar if he says something which may not be accurate but, nevertheless, which he believed to be true.  I do not know how in this House I can fitly and properly describe, with due respect to the Chair, a Deputy who says something which he knows to be untrue; and I do not intend to try to do so.</P>

      <P>The Deputy complained bitterly of a shortage of beds. He wept here in public: he is an adept at shedding public tears.  Yet he boasted that for nine years he was Lord Mayor of this city, supported by a majority of the corporation.  During that period, as long as he was supported by that majority, he had all the resources of this city at his disposal. He was Lord Mayor in time of peace; supplies were plentiful; taxation was not anything like as heavy as it is now, neither was the cost of living as high. The margin available to him to carry through public health measures was very much larger than the margin available to his successors.  If he had <Col N="1654" /> wanted to provide these sanatorium beds, about which he complains so bitterly now, then for every 6d. he would spend on them, for every 1/- of the ratepayers' money that he would spend on them, the Government would have given him generous assistance, a generous subvention, and yet in the whole course of the nine years what did this Deputy, who is so hostile to this Government that he opposes everything they try to do for the benefit of the people, do?</P>
      <P>He comes here harping and carping, naggling and niggling, weeping and wailing and moaning.  What did he do during the whole of that period for those poor people about whom he talked so glibly last night?  Nothing.  That is the true position.  This Deputy, whose heart is breaking, who suffers intensely from internal haemorrhages when he thinks of the mothers and daughters who come to him weeping, during the whole of that period did nothing, and I think he ought to have the virtue, if not to keep silent, at least not to do anything he can, not to do everything he can, to hamper us and misrepresent us in all the steps we are taking to try to improve the lot of these people.</P>
      <P>If, during the last five years, we had been able to get to the root of this matter and build the houses for the people; if, during the last six years we had been able to provide sanatorium accommodation, it would have been done.  The Dublin Corporation is not a local authority the majority of the members of which are supporters of this Government.  On the contrary, there are sitting as members of the Dublin Corporation some of the most obstinate and some of the bitterest political opponents we have.  They control the Dublin Corporation and they have controlled that body since it was reconstituted under the Dublin City Management Act.  Deputy Byrne was for nine years Lord Mayor.</P>

      <P>Very little was done to meet the situation by providing hospital or sanatorium accommodation, or the housing accommodation which was so urgently needed.  In fact, the position became so bad that we had to take that responsibility out of the hands of this hostile body and come in here less than 12 months ago to get the powers which it was necessary for us to have if a really sincere and earnest attempt was to be made to tackle the problem of tuberculosis in our midst. We had to do that for one reason, and the reason was this, that Deputies like the Deputy whose speech I am referring to found in this problem and in this scourge and in this evil a source, shall I say, of political affluence.  They could, by telling the sufferers that the Government would do nothing, when they were making certain that so far as they could ensure it the Government could do nothing&mdash;they could, while telling them the Government would do nothing, profess the sympathy for these unfortunate people which, though professing <Col N="1656" /> it, they did not feel strongly enough to make them act.</P>
      <P>With regard to what Deputy Coburn said, again I think the Deputy has not read the Bill.  It is unfortunate that this Bill has been discussed by so many Deputies on the Opposition Benches who have not even read it.  I have a great respect for Deputy Coburn's opinion in these matters.  He often talks a great deal of common sense and he has, I would say, a great deal of moral courage.  If he had looked at paragraphs (d) and (e) of Section 3 (1) he would have seen that it is provided that the grant cannot be made unless and until it is certified that the house is suitable for being provided with an extra room and, secondly, that the grant cannot be paid unless and until this certificate has been furnished that the extra room has been provided in a proper and workmanlike manner.</P>
      <P>With regard to what Deputy Bartley said, if any county medical officer of health were to discriminate in the way he fears against any particular individual, I am certain that very serious notice would be taken of it, and that it would not occur on more than one occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister for Finance to-day if he proposed at an <Col N="1658" /> early date to sponsor employment schemes so that thousands of citizens now unemployed and those being demobilised from the Defence Forces will be enabled to find remunerative employment. To that question the Parliamentary Secretary replied:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A sum of £1,250,000 has been provided in the Vote for employment in emergency schemes.  Many of the works are now in hands and the remainder are likely to be so at an early date.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I failed to get any satisfactory indication as to what the Minister proposes to do for the thousands on the unemployed list at the moment&mdash;the 62,527 men and 71,000 women, boys and girls who are unemployed&mdash;for those who will be sent back to Eire from Northern Ireland and those who will be leaving England because the work which 100,000 of our men went over to do has now been completed.  Fearing a big inrush of unemployed into the country, and especially into this city, and knowing that the House is about to go on holidays for three months&mdash; holidays with pay&mdash;I thought I could induce the Minister to give some hope to those who have nothing to sell but their labour.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister for Defence to-day if he would state to what use it is intended to put the overcoats of members of the Army who have been, or are about to be demobilised, and if he would state the number to be disposed of.  The Minister replied:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;At present there are about 6,000 Army great coats classed as unserviceable in Army stores and it is estimated&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Minister told me that, as well as the 6,000 soldiers already demobilised, a further 25,000 to 30,000 will be demobilised in the near future.  Their overcoats will be offered for sale to some scrap merchant or may be given away.  These 30,000 soldiers have to be added to the list of 62,000 men now unemployed.  A further 30,000 will be demobilised, as I say, in a few weeks, and I wanted to show that the Government, public authorities and industrialists will have to get ready to deal with these 30,000 men, as well as the very large number of men who found refuge and safety in England for the past five years when they could not get a livelihood in their own country, and who will be returning from England.  They are not people who speculate in gold or in other commodities fetching big prices; they have nothing to sell but their labour, and I want to know where is the market for their labour and how will these men be provided with something to do.</P>
      <P>A number of these men will be demobilised with small pensions of about 18/- per week, and, according to certain regulations which are in operation &mdash;I do not know whether the Minister proposes to alter them or not&mdash;that sum of 18/- will be sufficient to debar these men from being sent by the employment exchange to work on schemes subsidised out of Government grants. No man will be sent to a local authority scheme unless he is in receipt of £1 per week from the employment exchange. Deputies will see the cleverness of the system.  When the man with £1 per week is sent out on a relief scheme, that £1 is taken from him, while the unfortunate man who is not drawing £1 per week from the employment exchange gets nothing.</P>

      <P>I referred casually to the venomous attack he made on me, but I will get away from it.  I say that unemployment means hardship, no wages, and no nourishment for the children or the wife, so that eventually our sanatoria are filled with ill-nourished people.  The Parliamentary Secretary has put into operation some reasonably good schemes, but what good is a sum of £1,250,000 to all these people who are looking to him for help?  My question was a simple quesion&mdash;I want something done for those who are unemployed to-day, for those about to be unemployed, and for those who will come home from England and who will be, and are being, sent home from Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason why I put down, these questions which irritate the Government so much, and make them attack me, is that these matters are brought to my notice every hour of the day. <Col N="1661" /> Every Dublin T.D., and every member of the corporation coming to this House to-day, met a dozen men outside the gates.  I saw Deputies being stopped and canvassed, and being asked by these men where they were to get work, and asking them to help them to do so.  I was stopped twice to-day by young men that any country would be proud of, asking me to get passports to go to England.  I had to tell them that men who went to a certain area in England recently looking for work, found that the Englishmen refused to work with them, because they had their own unemployed in the area. I do not intend to get excited over this matter, but, having listened to what has been said, I thought I might make a reference to any Minister who might attack me.</P>

      <P>At a meeting of the Dublin Corporation on last Monday night I asked the City Manager to indicate how many men were employed in the city on various schemes, and the return he made showed that 270 were so engaged.  In my fairly long experience in the city council I have no hesitation in saying that is a record low figure for this time of the year and for that type of scheme.  The Parliamentary Secretary will appreciate the significance of the number, 270, when placed alongside the thousands that are seeking work in Dublin city.  I understand that the Parliamentary <Col N="1662" /> Secretary is not responsible for schemes connected with the City of Dublin, but I ask him to convey to the Department concerned an intimation, which would ensure that all schemes submitted for sanction by Dublin Corporation are expedited, and that those which have been the subject of negotiation should also receive immediate attention.

      <P>I was in the House when the Parliamentary Secretary replied to the question which now forms the subject of this discussion, when he indicated that over £1,000,000 had been allocated for the purpose of working these schemes.  Dublin City forms portion of the country as a whole, and it is my duty to convey to the Parliamentary Secretary what the Deputy who raised the question had in mind, seeing that it is of importance. I have no other means of conveying intimation to the Department concerned, seeing that the Minister concerned is not in the House.</P>

      <P>Surely I am in order in making the suggestion.  The Parliamentary Secretary who is in the <Col N="1663" /> House is associated with works of this type, and I ask him to agree with me, that the time has now arrived when the restraints placed upon the carrying out of employment schemes should be removed, as well as limitations on the period of unemployment, and the number of days' work per week that men are allowed to work.  I suggest that the time has arrived for doing so, more especially as local authorities have made strong representations to that effect.</P>

      <P>It is a pity that Deputy Byrne, having felt justified in raising this matter on the Adjournment, found it impossible to remain to hear the reply and to get the information which he claimed that he was seeking.  Deputy Byrne asked a number of questions which had no bearing whatever on this subject and raised a number of points for which I have no responsibility whatever.  The Deputy talked about the numbers of men likely to be demobilised from the Army, about their great coats, boots and their socks.  He wanted to know what was to become of the great coats and boots.  That is not a matter on which I could give Deputy Byrne or any other Deputy information.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle has pointed out that these things have no relation to the question which appeared on the Order Paper.  I was anxious that Deputy Byrne should remain to hear what I have to say.  He has shown his concern for the unemployed, and claims that he has always showed concern for that class.  He asked me to indicate our proposals for dealing with the unemployment problem as it still exists, and as it may exist in a few months' time.  The funny thing about all this is that while Deputy Byrne has shown such wonderful concern for the unemployed in Dublin, he has been a member of the Dublin Corporation, not for 12 months, but for many years, and apparently is not aware of the fact that there are four fairly major schemes approved by us since 1944-45, that have not yet been started by the Dublin Corporation, schemes that were sanctioned <Col N="1664" /> by us for the relief of unemployment in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Of course it is all very well to come into the House and, if you like, use these unfortunate people, at 9 o'clock at night for the purpose of getting a little kudos, a little bit of publicity, and irritating the occupant of the Chair, when he has to tell the Deputy to sit down or he will have to remove himself from the House.</P>
      <P>All these things, of course, get the headlines in the newspapers on the following morning.  I was anxious that Deputy Byrne should remain in order that I would tell this member of the Dublin Corporation who has shown such concern for the unemployed and is so anxious to obtain information from me as to what we propose to do about those people, that I have four schemes here which were sanctioned in the year 1944-45, the total cost of which is estimated at £40,000, and that the Dublin Corporation, for one reason or another, and I suppose they had some reason, have not been able to start. Would not one think that Deputy Byrne would first go to the city council, of which he is a member, and raise this matter: that he would find out what schemes had been approved, what schemes had been started, what schemes have been completed, and ascertain the amount of the carry-over from 1944-45 to 1945-46 before coming into this House to start protesting and talking in the manner in which he has been speaking here to-night?</P>
      <P>I want to tell him again, as I did to-day, the amount of money provided this year to meet this unemployment situation.  I told him to-day that, while the unemployment figure was fairly substantial this year, it was lower this year and last year than it has been for any year since 1934.  I told him that, of the £1,250,000 that had already been provided in the Estimates, a large portion of that had already been sanctioned, and that the remaining schemes were under way.  I had no further information to give him, nor have I any further information to give him now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were to discuss this whole matter of unemployment and the number <Col N="1665" /> of 62,000 whose names appear on the unemployed register, if I were to tell the House and the country all that I have come to know about what that number means&mdash;if I had the time at my disposal to do so&mdash;that number of 62,000 would present to this House and to the public a very different picture from the one that it does present.</P>
    <P>I have instances in my office where schemes have been approved for small towns and villages in which, according to the unemployed register, a sufficient number of people were located to warrant the sanction of a grant, that immediately on that grant being approved and the county surveyor, whose responsibility it was to carry out the scheme and supervise the work, being notified, and immediately on his approach to the local labour exchange to recruit the men who were suitable for the work and were signing the register on the ground that they were unemployed, that they were seeking work, that they were able and willing to work; that on his approach to a number of those labour exchanges to implement the schemes that we had approved, he found 24, 25, 26, or 30 individuals registered there all making the claims that I have described, he discovered that these numbers had evaporated, and that, instead of 26 or 30 individuals, maybe two or three or four turned up for the work.  I am not denying the fact that there is an unemployment problem, but I am denying and, as a matter of fact I could prove to the hilt if I had the time at my disposal to do so, that the problem is certainly not represented by the figures recorded at the different labour exchanges.</P>
    <P>I have nothing further to add except to repeat that not only is the money to which I have referred there, not only have schemes for this city and many other boroughs been approved for this year, and not only are a great number of them in the hands of the city council or its officials; not only is that the situation this year in relation to the City of Dublin, but we have also four schemes estimated to cost £40,000 that were sanctioned for the year 1944-45 that have not yet been put in motion <Col N="1666" /> by the city council or its officials. Therefore, I suggest that before Deputy Alfred Byrne should see fit to raise a matter of this kind in the House he should make himself aware of the facts as I have explained them.</P>

      <P>There is the Castlewood Avenue-Belgrave Square reconstruction, which is estimated to cost £13,800; there is the Griffith Park improvement and Botanic Avenue roadwork, estimated to cost £6,000; there is the Dodder Valley improvement scheme, estimated to cost £8,750; and there is the housing site in Cabra West area, estimated to cost £11,440, making a total, for the four schemes, of £39,990. These schemes, as I have said, were sanctioned in the year 1944-45.</P>

      <P>Though perhaps I am not strictly in order, may I say a word in regard to these four schemes?  The Parliamentary Secretary was careful to say that there may have been good reasons for postponing them.  There is one of them that I can speak about from intimate knowledge, the Griffith Park improvement and Botanic Avenue roadwork scheme, in regard to which I could give good reasons straightway as to why it was postponed.</P>

      <P>I am not trying to push over the blame from one Department to another.  The Deputy, I am sure, will admit that I am prepared to concede that there may have been, not in one case but in all four, some reason why they were not gone on with.  At the same time, I do not see how, in justice, any Deputy can come into this House and, if you like, harangue the House, the Department of Finance and the officials of the Office of Public Works because of their failure to provide schemes when, as a matter of fact, the schemes have been approved and the money provided for them, but that for one reason or <Col N="1667" /> another the authority responsible does not find it possible to execute the works.</P>
