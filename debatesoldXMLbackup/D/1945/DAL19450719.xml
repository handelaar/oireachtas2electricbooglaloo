      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that there is considerable delay in the delivery of porter and stout to licensed traders in County Dublin; and, if so, if he will state if the cause of the delay is due to shortage of fuel or shortage of barrels; and, if so, if he will either issue permits to Messrs. Guinness for increased supplies of fuel or allow the importation of suitable timber for the manufacture of barrels, as the case may require.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if there would be any point in my keeping the House much longer; I think I have covered the main points that were raised.  A point was raised as to the nature of this State and I pointed out that anybody could see from our Constitution that we are a republic.  I pointed out there is only one head of this State and that the power by which we use the head of the States of the British Commonwealth for our external relations is given by the Executive Authority (External Relations) Act, which is an enabling Act so that this may be done.  That does not in any way constitute the head of these States as the head of our State. This particular device was adopted in order that we might thereby mark our association with the States of the British Commonwealth.</P>
      <P>I would like to remind Deputy Coogan that, if he wants to pursue these constitutional studies of his, he should begin by realising that our rights here do not derive from any British law; that we stand on our rights as a nation, to have our own independence here and our own laws, and that it was on that foundation and not on the foundation of any British law that our Constitution was based. It was discussed here in the Assembly of the representatives of the Irish people, freely elected, and it was submitted to the Irish people to enact. That is the basis, legally, of our position here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as British laws and statutes and any references that may be made to them are concerned, all these laws did was to indicate that our rights would no longer be interfered with by Great Britain.  They had value from that point of view, and that is the point of view from which their <Col N="2751" /> value should be approached and assessed.  They were an indication that the powers which the British Parliament had been exercising over here would not be enforced; the powers they had would be discontinued and would not be enforced as against the will of the Irish people.  So those who want, whether they be professors of constitutional law in this country or anywhere else, to understand properly our constitutional position, will clearly realise that we regard our rights here in this nation as deriving from the inalienable rights of the Irish people.</P>

      <P>I am not going to answer that question.  If I am wrong in that, if no professor has said such things, it will not apply to him and the cap will not fit him.  I touched on the question of Partition and I pointed out that some Deputies are clearly following the line indicated by Senator MacDermot, as he was at the time, in the Seanad&mdash;that these people imagine that, by giving away the rights of the majority, they will conciliate the minority.  They will do nothing of the kind.  Our whole history has proved the contrary, and I hope, whether in our time or when we are gone, there will be no people in this country so foolish as to adopt that course.  It is a fatal course.  I hope also that there will be no people in this country who will lead the Irish people into making sacrifices on promises, that if they make such sacrifices they will get a united Ireland, because so sure as the Irish people make these sacrifices in advance, for the sake of a united Ireland, so surely, when it comes to the test, will it be said: &ldquo;We cannot coerce Ulster,&rdquo; and they will be cheated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That will be the answer which will be given to people who demand anything for the sacrifices they may have made. They will be told: &ldquo;We cannot coerce Ulster&rdquo;; but there is part of Ulster which is being coerced.  We deny the <Col N="2752" /> right of any nation at any time to partition our nation, to cut it in two, but surely whatever case might be made for doing that on the ground of a minority who objected to the rule of the majority, it should not apply to areas like South Down, South Armagh, Tyrone, Fermanagh and Derry City.  These are continuous areas adjoining ours, and if a boundary has to be drawn in this country, for the supposed purpose of protecting the right of the minority, that boundary line should not have been drawn where it is.  We all know that; we all know that Partition is a cruel wrong to this country; and we all know that the sentiments of our people are such that, so long as that cruel wrong is continued, the good relations we would like to have with our neighbour cannot be based on a sound foundation.</P>
    <P>We have been trying to get that sound foundation.  We believe, and I think that in this I speak for the vast majority of our people, that it would be to the interests of the peoples of these two islands, situated as we are side by side, to be on the friendliest and most cordial terms one with another.  We fully recognise here in this island that our people and the people of that other island have very many interests in common&mdash;interests material and, some of them, spiritual. We believe that co-operation on the basis of common interest should be possible, provided, of course, it be always understood that each side would be able to decide for itself whether the matter in question is in its own interest.  But all that possibility is prevented by this unnatural partition of our country and every person, whether in this island or the other, who wishes for these good relations will do everything in his power to try to end this Partition.</P>
    <P>The question of defence has been mentioned.  The question of national defence is, of course, one which the Government of this country has to keep in mind, and everybody with the slightest understanding will know that in that matter we have common interests. If the whole of this island were enjoying its complete independence, <Col N="2753" /> one of the first things which would have to be considered by the Government here would be what measures could be made available for our common defence in time of need. Even for a united Ireland, there would be great difficulties in that regard, for several reasons, one of which would be that Britain is an Empire.  We have no imperial aspirations and no imperial interests, but Britain, on account of her imperial interests, might be engaged in wars of various kinds.  For instance, there might be a war in Japan, or somewhere far away and remote from us, in which the immediate defence of this island would not be involved.</P>
    <P>That would be one type of case, and to arrange a policy of defence which would apply only when our interests were clearly involved would be by no means an easy thing, even for a united Ireland, to work out.  It would be extremely difficult, but obviously it is something which a completely free country would have to look out for. Although only a portion of our country is free, we have to keep that in mind, but all these problems which are complicated in any case, are made almost completely insoluble by the existence of Partition.  However, there is no use in dealing with purely hypothetical matters.  That matter does not fall for consideration at present, and all I want to say to the House is that there is nobody here who can have more reason to think about these matters and to be anxious about them than I.</P>
    <P>I fully realise that these matters of defence might in certain circumstances be vital for us.  In the European war, we were neutral, and, as a neutral state, we had very many anxieties.  We had anxieties from both sides, and the only attitude we could take up was that we would defend our territory here against any Power that came in to attack it.  That may have to continue to be the national policy. I feel certain it will have to continue to be the national policy so long as Partition obtains.  If there were a united Irish Parliament, meeting and considering these questions, it is possible that there might be a different line of approach.</P>
    <P>However, I want to assure Deputies <Col N="2754" /> that this is a matter about which we are naturally concerned, and that we do not want on a future occasion to find ourselves in the position in which we found ourselves when the recent war broke out.  It is for that reason that we have asked the House and that I ask the House now to support us in all the measures for national defence which would enable us to meet a situation, such as the situation we had to meet, with the greatest strength this nation can put forward. I do not think there is any point in my discussing that further.  It is a very big question in itself and there is no need for me to go further into it than in general outline.</P>
    <P>I come down now to one or two matters, apart from the general questions, which were raised.  Deputy Dillon said that the German Minister was here as the representative of Nazism.  I say that is not so.  I say that, when we receive the representative of another State, we are not concerned with the internal policy of that State as long as we have peaceful relations with that State.  It would be an intolerable situation when a representative comes to our country from another country if we should by the fact of receiving that representative appear to show favour or disapproval.  Refusal, as you know, is practically tantamount to breaking off diplomatic relations.  It is regarded almost as a hostile act against any State.  It must be clearly understood, and I am sure it is understood in States that have long experience of these matters, that when a representative of a foreign State comes here he comes as the representative of the people and of the nation, not of the particular Government, and his reception by us implies no question of approval or disapproval or any decision upon the policy of that State.  The German Minister here then, in the same way as his predecessors had been, was a representative of the German nation.</P>
    <P>Next, I come to the question of my visit.  My visit to the German Minister was taken in accordance with the procedure and the practice that had been established here, and which is almost a universal practice.  Again, that act <Col N="2755" /> of courtesy must not be regarded&mdash;of course everybody who did not want to use it for a particular purpose knew that it did not imply&mdash;as approval or disapproval or judgment of any kind on the policy of the German people, or the State he was representing here. That was well known, but, because this country took up an attitude such as Switzerland or other neutral countries took up, and because that attitude did not please the propagandists, they wanted to malign this country and misrepresent it.  There was not much publicity given to the fact that I came here and asked the Dáil to adjourn when the death of the President of the United States was announced.  That reminds me that we do not wait to get official notice of the death of the head of a State.  We do not have to get official notice: &ldquo;the head of such a State died at such an hour&rdquo;.  When the report of the death of the head of the State is received, we naturally assume that that report is true.  We delay a little while, perhaps, sufficiently long to make sure that there was no fundamental mistake, but when it is reported generally that the head of a State has died we accept that fact, and we pay the necessary courtesies.</P>
    <P>As I was saying, when we came here and adjourned the Dáil, as a particular mark of respect to the American nation, and when the flags here were at half-mast in our city practically from the moment we heard of the death of the President of the United States until his burial, there was very little publicity given to it.  It did not suit the propagandists to give that particular publicity; but on the other occasion, inspired from certain quarters, they thought they had an excellent chance to do harm to this country, and they published it in the form they thought would do the greatest harm.  I want to say this, that I did what I did as my duty.  I was quite aware when I was doing it that it was capable of being misrepresented, but I am going to do my duty here in this country and pay the necessary courtesies as Minister for External Affairs even though I have to face the misrepresentation and our country has to face the misrepresentation which it causes.  To do anything else would <Col N="2756" /> bring us into absolute contempt.  I do not want to deal with that, I think, any further.  With reference to Deputy Larkin's remarks, may I say that my doing what I did does not suggest that any people who may differ in their opinions from me or from us are in any sense individually committed to any views, because my action implied no judgment of any kind.</P>
    <P>Another matter was raised, again to misrepresent the situation.  I should like to know what member of our Cabinet is supposed to have Nazi views.  I do not know quite what is the intention behind that, but I should like to know who is the member of our Cabinet who is being accused of having Nazi views.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Aiken?  I know Mr. Aiken better than the person who has been making this suggestion to Deputy Dillon.  Deputy Aiken, because he did his duty as Censor here, because, he was impartial in his work, and because he did not allow propaganda from either side, of course was accused of having leanings in a certain direction. I know the views of my colleagues on a number of matters, on nearly all public matters.  Unless you are stupid, when you are discussing matters with members of the Cabinet you will know pretty well what their views and what their leanings are.  I can say this with regard to our Cabinet, that there is only one thing which particularly distinguishes their views on all these matters with respect to External Affairs, and that is that they are pro-Irish.  They are neither pro one side or pro another side.  Of course, in times of crises like those we have passed through, as I said at the very beginning of this war, when you have nations involved in a death struggle such as has taken place, those who are not with you are always regarded as against you.  If you are not helping one side, then that side regards you as helping the other side.  Both sides will take that view.  That is one of the difficulties of neutrality.  When you are fighting on one side, you have this at least, that your own side will not regard you as against them.  I hope then that we will have no more of that mischievous misrepresentation <Col N="2757" /> that our people and our Cabinet who are here to carry out a neutral duty were doing that in some biased manner. That is not true.  We are a democratic State.  Every single member of that Cabinet is democratic.  We oppose the opposite system, and, if anybody wants to know, they will find our views on democracy as against authoritarian systems not when this war began but years before it.</P>
      <P>As I said, there is no use in prolonging this discussion.  It may have some value if it enables our people to see that our constitutional position here depends upon the law which they have passed themselves; to understand that the other document, the instrument, if I may so call it, which is availed of is the External Relations Act; and that there need be no confusion of mind by anybody who takes up those two documents and studies them.  In order that it will be more easily available, a new edition of the Constitution is being brought out.  It is on sale for 3d., and can be procured by any citizen who wants to study the fundamental law again, and to study it closely.  I would advise all the people, when they are talking on these matters, to get a copy of the Constitution.  If they want to go further, they can get a copy of the External Relations Act, and they will have all the material which is necessary to answer any of the questions that have arisen here during this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night the House wished to refrain from interrupting the Taoiseach, and on being asked by the Chair would they regard his business as being uncontested business for the purpose of permitting him to proceed, the House very readily said that it waived its right to divide, not on the merits of the Estimate, but in order to afford the Taoiseach an opportunity of concluding his discourse.  I, therefore, suggest that we are not free to vote on this Estimate now inasmuch as the business was carried on after 9 o'clock last night on the understanding given to the Chair that we would not.  On that, we now await your direction.</P>

      <P>As the debate <Col N="2758" /> was continued to-day, the House is free in my view to vote if they so desire. I might also say, as the point has arisen, that there was some slight confusion last night as to whether the debate could not be continued after 9.30.  It could not, according to Standing Orders, because there was no motion moved in time for such continuation. Therefore, it could not have been continued.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £8,764 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1946, for a Contribution towards the Expenses of the League of Nations.</P>
      <P>The sum of £8,764 provided in this Vote represents the amount of our contribution to the expenses of the League of Nations in respect of the year 1944.  Deputies know the present position as regards the League of Nations.  The Charter signed at San Francisco some time ago provided for the setting up of a world organisation on different lines, so that it must be expected in the near future that steps will be taken to dissolve the League of Nations, of which this country was, and is still, a member.</P>
      <P>This is probably not the last Estimate which the Dáil will be asked to vote in respect of the League of Nations.  The sum now proposed covers, as I have said, our contribution in respect of the year 1944.  The expenses of the League for the present calendar year, or for that portion of it during which the League remains, will have to be met, and we shall have to bear our share.  It may be necessary, therefore, to ask the Dáil to vote a further and final contribution to the expenses of the League of Nations next year, so that we may have fulfilled our obligations as a member of the League right up to the end.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there will be any objection from any part of the House for continuing the grant to the League of Nations until such time as it is wound up.  The last report of the Secretary to the League of Nations, published in the beginning of the year, indicated, as the Taoiseach has said, that the United Nations Organisation is likely to be the organisation in the world to which will pass in time the functions and responsibilities, in perhaps an elaborated or different form, which up to the present have been borne by the League of Nations, so that the problems for which it had been attempting to find a solution will fall to the new organisation for solution.  That leads me to ask a question which I asked when we were discussing the Vote for the Department of External Affairs.  The question is, whether in view of the importance of the work that it is contemplated will be done by the United Nations Organisation, and the extensive nature of the Charter that has been adopted by the large number of nations that assembled at San Francisco and of the difficulty of our people getting a copy of that Charter now, the Government would consider having the Charter printed as a White Paper.  We are voting a considerable sum of money running into close on £8,000 for the League of Nations plus sums of £6,000 or £8,000 already passed for the International Labour Organisation which is so closely connected with the League of Nations.  I suggest that the cost of printing the Charter would be a very small sum to add, especially in view of the importance of the Charter and of the general information that we want to give to our people with regard to the trend of these things in the world. I think that, to do so, would indicate a desire on our part to continue the good intent that we had regarding our desire to co-operate in a progressive and peaceful way with the world at the time that we entered the League of Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a further question that I want to ask the Taoiseach: It arises out of a suggestion that I gathered from him when he was speaking on the Vote for External Affairs.  What I <Col N="2760" /> gathered from him was that it was not likely we would enter normally into general conferences held among the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations until the war with Japan, and the general war situation, had completely stopped.  I do not know whether I gathered that impression correctly or not, but I would like to ask him definitely whether, in relation to any consultations carried on under the aegis of the United Nations Organisation, it is his intention that he would not sit down at any consultations with the nations representing the United Nations Organisation until the war with Japan has ceased.  I think it would be quite unnecessary and undesirable, if the opportunity arose, to wait until then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am on the League of Nations and on our work and co-operation with the League of Nations and with the organisation which by agreement, almost by planning on the part of the League of Nations itself, is actually going to take its place. I could read from the last report of the Secretary of the League a paragraph that I think would satisfy the Chair on the matter, if the Chair required to be satisfied.  It is not my intention to labour the point, and I do not intend to go into any elaborate discussion on it.  I am suggesting that I think it would be desirable, if the opportunity presented itself, that we should take part in consultations which would help in any way to broaden support for us, or which would give us a clear way of showing to the world that we were anxious to support the policies and the ideals that are enshrined in the preamble to the Charter, and that we would not wait until the last sword had been sheathed in China and Japan before taking that step.  I am encouraged in urging this point when I read in this morning's newspapers that an emergency Order has been issued which removes disabilities that war vessels belonging to belligerents would labour under in entering Irish ports.  If warships of any of the belligerents <Col N="2761" /> may, under certain conditions, enter Irish ports to-day, I am sure we should not place an unconditional restriction on ourselves that we would not sit down in international conference to-morrow, with these ideals to be pursued, if we got an opportunity to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>On the debate on External Affairs I glossed over a subject with which I wish to deal more fully now, that is, the question of the League of Nations.  We have been a member of the League of Nations for a number of years and, personally, I do not see what great benefits have accrued to us from that membership. It has never been explained to me what has come of it.  The suggestion I made on the Vote for External Affairs was that there should come from this country a proposal that the small nations of the world should band themselves into a league for their mutual protection, benefit and welfare, as against world domination by three or four welter-weight Powers&mdash; Powers that make all kinds of promises to small nations but that, for some reason or other, are utterly unable to come to their rescue when they are up to their eyes in trouble.  We know very well that world war No. 2 was supposed to have been fought in order to save Poland.  Promises were made by many nations that they would go to the rescue of Poland but to-day the plight of Poland is worse than when Poland was invaded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put it before the Taoiseach that the time has come in world affairs when the small nations will definitely have to band themselves together for their own protection.  The map of the world shows that there are three or four big nations definitely dominating the whole world.  They do their best to broadcast propaganda to the effect that if the smaller nations do not align themselves with one or other of these big Powers they will be helpless; that they depend on the big Powers for life and for trade.  That is not the case. That situation reminds me of the circumstances that existed in this country some 50 or 60 years ago; when the small farmers and the rural population were up against the landlord system. <Col N="2762" /> At that time we were held in a vice, the iron grip of a handful.  It was considered impossible that the farmers could free themselves from the servitude they found themselves in as a result of mal-administration by the ruling power.</P>
    <P>I think it would be a very wise move to form a league of small nations, and I would ask the Taoiseach to consider the suggestion for what it is worth. In view of the fact that we are a young State&mdash;an infant State, if you like to call it that&mdash;it would be a wonderful thing if we could make advances to several of the small countries of Europe.  If one glances at the map of the world, one finds there is a preponderance of small States as against a few big Powers.  At the present time one can say that the world is virtually ruled by England, America and Russia. One finds that the British Commonwealth is made up of a number of small dependent States or small nations seeking greater liberty and freedom.  In Asia, the same applies. There is a vast number of small States that, for want of association and common ideal, are inclined to fight and wrangle among themselves, thus giving a chance to some big Power to exploit them.</P>
    <P>The second world war has taught us the fate of small nations in Europe. Poland, Czechoslovakia, Austria, were overrun.  In the first world war, Belgium was the victim.  If small nations grouped together they could definitely force the big nations to recognise them, because if they stood loyally to one another in any kind of world crisis, they could pull more weight than any combination of great Powers.  The great Powers have their own causes of difference among themselves. We all know that they are out for world domination.  It is common knowledge that Germany started the war so that she might dominate the world.  It is obvious that England and America and Russia are trying to dominate the world to-day.  A combination of small States that of themselves cannot create a great fighting force on land, sea or air could bring some of these giants to their senses, provided there was loyalty and co-operation <Col N="2763" /> amongst them.  It would be a very fine thing.  Big nations have the disadvantage of being unwidely, whereas small nations, as a rule, are fairly well developed and compact, and are better able to manage their own affairs.  I think there would be a greater spirit of comradeship amongst the small nations if a proper case were put up.</P>
    <P>I do not mean that the small nations should band themselves together for any aggressive purpose, but for their own benefit.  The big Powers would have us believe that they represent the only market, that they represent the only resort for emigrants in cases where the small countries cannot find employment for their adult population. If there were more co-operation between the small nations, we might find that they would absorb each other's produce.  I do not see why they could not trade with one another. That would be the most effective threat to any future aggressor.  It might be much more effective than any league of nations.  The last League of Nations burst up simply because it was dominated by one or two big Powers.  I am afraid the same will happen in any future league of nations. For that reason, I think nothing good would result from money spent on such a league that would be a kind of mixed grill of big, medium and small nations.</P>
    <P>I put this suggestion before the Taoiseach, for what it is worth, in the spirit of offering something constructive and helpful, that might redound to this country's credit and help to solve the very problem that the Taoiseach has been discussing in the last two days, which is the burning question in this country and which we would all wish to have settled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Taoiseach some questions.  While we were a member of the League of Nations, the League, in pursuance of its policy of endeavouring to punish aggressors, imposed sanctions on Italy.  Italy, in a most shameless manner, violated the independence of Abyssinia and, unfortunately, we were associated&mdash;not very creditably&mdash;with the recognition of the conquest of that <Col N="2764" /> small nation by the forces of aggression which Italy unleashed on it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, but we are apparently going to close down this institution known as the League of Nations.  I want to ask the Taoiseach whether we cannot have a cleaner name in that respect before the shop is actually closed.  We then recognised the King of Italy&mdash;now happily deposed and his aggressive régime with him&mdash;as the Emperor of Ethiopia but, as he has ceased to be a king and is having a rather precarious existence these days, and as the whole Fascist régime in Italy has crumbled in the dust, I wonder if the Taoiseach would tell us now whether we still continue to recognise either the deposed king in Italy or any of his successors there as the Emperor of Abyssinia.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a second question to put.  The Taoiseach has seen from the Press, and knows through the Department, that a charter known as the World Security Charter has been signed extensively, arising out of the discussions at San Francisco.  Very many nations have been most anxious to subscribe to the declarations contained in that charter.  We have not yet subscribed and I would like to ascertain from the Taoiseach whether this country proposes to make any application for the purpose of subscribing the signature of this country to the declarations which were embodied in the San <Col N="2765" /> Francisco Charter.  This is a new effort to build a world organisation, in which it is hoped it may be possible to avoid a repetition of the horrible military catastrophe inflicted on the world during the past six years.  I would like to ascertain what our intentions are in connection with the charter and what immediate steps the Taoiseach intends to take, as Minister for External Affairs, in connection with that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving this Vote, the Taoiseach told us it was, in his opinion, the final Vote, though he also said it may be necessary to apply for a further Vote to wind up.  I would like to keep my remarks within the ambit of that particular statement. When he asks this Parliament to vote certain moneys for a set purpose, he should inform us exactly what has happened in world affairs.  I think the Taoiseach should have given us a funeral oration over the grave of the League of Nations.  It would be well if he had given a certificate setting out the cause of death.  It would also have been wise to keep us informed as to the disabilities it suffered under during its life.  It was a child born in the storm of war and it had great possibilities. Many small nations and many great nations expected great things of it, but they did not materialise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Taoiseach was President of that body at one time, he took a very positive view and gave expression to very great thoughts, which brought admiration not only from his friends but even from those who thought differently from him.  I felt that, when the League of Nations Vote was being moved this evening, the Taoiseach would keep all that in mind and would give the House a summary of its activities.  He failed to do so and left Deputy Blowick to ask what benefit we got from the League.  If the Taoiseach had discharged his duty properly, Deputy Blowick would not have been compelled to ask that question.  We might have been shown that the League of Nations had done a good deal of work in the interests of world peace and to establish the rights of small nations. The Taoiseach could have told us why <Col N="2766" /> the rights, when established, were not maintained.</P>
    <P>I do not want to develop an argument on this particular Vote, except in so far as the Taoiseach has asked for certain moneys to defray the expenses he feels called upon to discharge. I assert that the Department has not given us the information to enable us to decide properly whether the money should be voted or not.  I would ask the Taoiseach to disclose to us, if he feels at liberty to do so, the circumstances he found obtaining at the League of Nations in Geneva when he was President of that august body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If we discuss the League of Nations in that manner, it will open a wide field of external affairs.  In most Estimates, the Minister is responsible for the Department.  In this particular case, it cannot be held that the Minister is responsible for the League of Nations.  The Vote simply asks for a contribution towards it and it could not be held that the Taoiseach is responsible either for the administration or the policy of that League.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is responsible for moving this Vote and I am asking him to give us certain information, so that we might vote the money with a freer mind.  He was President of the League of Nations for one year&mdash;not the last year, I admit, and I would respectfully bow to your ruling that, therefore, it does not come within the discussion.  If I am correct in stating that it is in his capacity as Minister for External Affairs he is moving this Vote, I am entitled to make this criticism, even though it may seem unreasonable.  He tells us that this is the last Vote he is going to move for the League of Nations, that it is to be wound up and, unless I took a wrong note of what he said, a further Vote may be introduced as a final contribution, which would be the last sum this Parliament would vote for this purpose.  Therefore, it is for the death knell of the League of Nations that we are voting this money, and he should have told us what, in his opinion, led to this death knell.  He might have <Col N="2767" /> given us a funeral oration this evening, but he did not do so.</P>
      <P>I am aware that representatives of this country, who attended the League of Nations very regularly, have returned to this country, and I feel that the Taoiseach, to enable us to come to a decision on the matter before us, should have stated what reports he received from those various representatives who attended the League of Nations within the last 12 months, whether they attended in Canada or elsewhere, or whether it was in the International Labour Office, or some other activity that they participated. Instead, we are treated in a most extraordinary way and told only that the Vote is being moved for something that is now about to die.  I feel that is not the way to treat this Parliament.</P>
      <P>I suggest that when this body is dying, when it is in its death agonies, the Taoiseach should tell us whether it is likely that any new organisation will arise, and he should tell us what his plans are if any new organisation takes the place of this one.  Perhaps he could give us an idea of the nature of that new organisation and what efforts he is making to become a member of it.  I am not prepared to accept from him a statement that he is not going to go with his hat in his hand to get into it, because I remember distinctly that in 1918 we sent a Minister to a conference at which questions deciding the peace of the world were likely to be discussed. We all know such matters were not dealt with, but at that time it appeared that they would be decided at that particular place.  We sent a Minister to get in there, and I can assure Deputies here, and the people of the country, that we did not care how he got in so long as he got in.</P>

      <P>He is, unfortunately, the Taoiseach of this country, and whether the people have made a mistake or not, I will not say. I cannot be blamed for that.  He is, unfortunately, occupying a position in which he is charged with doing certain things, including the moving of this Vote.  In so far as that is his responsibility, I submit that he must answer here for it.  I say that some organisation will replace the League of Nations and I want to know from the Taoiseach what steps he is taking to get in there.  I respectfully submit that as we sent a Minister to do certain things in 1918 in a certain place, we have the courage to do the same to-day.  Whatever Government represents this country it must do the work that it is called on to do, and before the Parliament of this nation decides to pay for doing it, that Parliament should be sure that the work will be well done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By the ineffective statement he made on the case this evening, the Taoiseach has left this House and the country misinformed and, when he is concluding this debate, he should give us sufficient information to enable us to make up our minds whether it is worth while voting money to go into any further combination of nations.  The Taoiseach has left Deputy Blowick in the position that he is forced to ask the question: &ldquo;What good did we get?&rdquo; That is a situation that should not arise and I say that the Taoiseach is at fault because he failed to inform the House.  I should like to hear what <Col N="2769" /> his plans are for the association of this country with international affairs.</P>

No rational person in this country challenges, or will suffer another to challenge, the right of the Taoiseach to be the legitimate head of the legitimate Government of this country, nor will they challenge, or suffer to be challenged, the right of the Minister for External Affairs to speak on behalf of the legitimate Government of this country at any international conference, League of Nations or otherwise.

      <P>I trust Deputy Blowick will not think I am carping or being critical of or disrespectful to him, if I comment for a moment on his observations about the desirability of small nations combining for their own defence.  Combining is all very well, until the time for defence comes.</P>

      <Col N="2771" /> Deputy Blowick spoke of combining all the small nations in Europe, Asia and the whole world.  Suppose that combination is made and Afghanistan is attacked to-morrow.  Will Deputy Blowick advocate this country's going to war in defence of Afghanistan?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be necessary; passive resistance would be quite sufficient against the big Powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Blowick's contribution to the defence of Afghanistan is that we should passively resist.  I do not think, with deep respect, that, on those terms, he will have many candidates for admission to his league. He also asked the understandable question: what good did we get out of this League?  He is sufficient of an Irishman, and a generous one at that, to turn his mind to the question of what good were we able to do through the league, as well as what good did we get out of it.  We sent representatives to the League of Nations, and we once sent the Taoiseach.  Those were the days when he did not think it shameful to dream dreams.  He thought it worth while, speaking in the name of Ireland, in an unsympathetic atmosphere, amongst people who, he was pretty sure, were not going to listen and of whose ever understanding, if they did listen, there was little hope, to say that this country stood for certain fundamental principles, and a situation might arise in which he would be called upon to dream dreams like that again, unless he has grown so sagacious, so experienced and so realist that he has made up his mind not to dream dreams any more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is worth while going to gatherings of that kind, even though you know you are faced with a bewildered world which cannot find its own way home, because it has lost the key to the right way.  The great contribution which a country such as this can make is to go there and even if as a voice crying in the wilderness, recall to the world the only way.  Sooner or later, that way will be found, because there is no other way to peace&mdash;good understanding and dignity amongst men.  Somebody will have to lead the world back to it, and all human experience <Col N="2772" /> teaches that it is highly unlikely that the nation destined to lead the world back to a knowledge of that truth will be a nation which is itself blinded by the material prosperity and power which have led it astray.</P>
    <P>Surely the mission of a small, poor nation, which has no imperial ambitions, which has no axe to grind and which wants nothing of any other nation in the world but the right to live in peace and good neighbourliness with all other nations, is, by election, the one that will call the world back to the only road which offers hope for its own salvation.  I feel sure that if Deputy Blowick reflects on that aspect, he will agree with me that, if we never got any advantage for ourselves out of the League of Nations, it might be for us an instrument wherewith to achieve a very noble destiny which one of his name should be peculiarly fitted to appreciate.</P>
    <P>I heard reference made to-day to Poland.  The League of Nations of which we are a member has, I suppose, as one of its functions, at this eleventh hour of its life, to see justice done to Poland.  We may ask if the money we are about to appropriate is to contribute to that end.  May I sound this note of caution?  It is sometimes very easy to imagine that, from the columns of the daily Press, one can learn all that requires to be known about the affairs of another nation wherewith to form a prudent judgment, and, in the warmness of one's sympathy, one may rush to decry an arrangement which might, in the long run, be the best for the nation which had engaged one's sympathy, did one but know all the details of the case.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the position of Poland is at present, and all I ask Deputies and persons responsible for pressing upon our Minister for External Affairs an attitude to be adopted at the League of Nations, should the question of Poland engage that body's attention, is to walk circumspectly, guided by this fundamental principle, that we believe of Poland, as we believe of ourselves, that she is entitled to be sovereign and free, and that we believe of Poland, as we believe of ourselves, that every man and woman living there has the right to <Col N="2773" /> render unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's and to God the things that are God's, without let or hindrance from any Power, inside or outside that country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Blowick, and, I think, Deputy MacEoin perhaps, dwelt on the imperfections of the League of Nations to which we now belong.  God knows, it had enough of them, but do Deputies expect a human institution, designed to establish a rule of law, not amongst men but amongst nations, to be perfect <i>ab initio</i>?  It took human beings centuries to establish that the law would be the same for everybody and that every man would be equal before the law.  Does Deputy Blowick doubt that three centuries ago in England the Duke of Norfolk would have laughed if it were suggested to him that before the law he was no more than his potboy?  But to-day all the dukes in England are no more than the humblest potboy before the law of England.  We have not any dukes in this country.</P>

      <P>Surely, Sir, only from that can we learn or hope that some day we can realise, although we begin imperfectly, the real ideal of a League of Nations, whereunder all nations will be equal before the law?  I am making the submission to this House that the League of Nations to which we now belong, or the League of Nations to which at an early date we may belong, is not perfect.  It puts us in no stronger position perhaps than that in which the Duke of Norfolk's potboy stood three centuries ago, but, if we have the faith that such humble people as <Col N="2775" /> he had in the ultimate triumph of justice, we can get for the small, impotent nations of the world the same measure of security that that humble creature got for his like in this day.  But, if we take up the position that unless we can get complete security and perhaps justice, <i>ab initio</i>, in the League we belong to now or its successor in title, we are throwing in the sponge; we are betraying posterity, and, in my submission, the hopes of man.  There is danger in our being in the League.  Perhaps the safe policy is isolation&mdash;to run away from our responsibilities as a sovereign State. There is danger in going in with the predatory powers and fighting in their citadel for the freedom without which small nations cannot live.  But I think the Taoiseach is right in indicating that he favours this nation taking that risk and playing its part in this League of Nations, knowing well that we may not see in our day the realisation of the dreams he used to think it was worth while dreaming, but that if we stand faithfully to such dreams some successor of ours in Ireland will see their realisation.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The original members of the United Nations shall be the States which, having participated in the United Conference on International Organisation at San Francisco, or having previously signed the declaration by United Nations of January 12, 1942, sign the present charter and ratify it in accordance with Article 110.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It has to be ratified by individual States.  Then there is Article 4, paragraphs 1 and 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Membership in the United Nations is open to all other peace-loving States which accept the obligations contained in the present Charter and, in the judgment of the organisation, are able and willing to carry out these obligations;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The admission of any such State to membership in the United <Col N="2778" /> Nations will be effected by a decision of the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The matter of this Charter is going to be a subject for discussion in a number of Parliaments.  We have no particular hurry about it, and can take our time.  The discussions on it will make it possible for all our people, when they have an opportunity of reading them, to understand exactly what is implied and what are the purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that an application would have to go in at some stage.  There may be a question of an invitation.  The main question about the existing League of Nations, for which we are asking the House to vote money is this, that the League is obviously coming to an end.  We have persisted to the end in the League of Nations.  By reason of that we have a share of the final expenses to pay, and that is the purpose for which this money is intended.  There will probably be a meeting to dispose of the property and so on of the League, possibly to hand it over to the new organisation, and to dissolve the organisation of the League as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin seemed to think that it was my duty on this occasion to go over the whole ground of the history of the League, to point out the good things it had done and possibly the faults which made it finally an ineffective instrument for the maintenance of world peace.  The trouble there is in getting an organisation of that kind to work is clear to everybody.  It is all right when it is only a question of small nations, but the moment the big nations are involved, if they become aggressors and do not obey the law, then, of <Col N="2779" /> course, it requires tremendous force to bring them to heel, to bring them to book.  But, as an organisation primarily intended to maintain peace, the decision to use it as an instrument of war, as it has to be used for the enforcement of peace, is one which prevents much enthusiasm on the part of member States.  When Japan, as a great Power, attacked China in violation of the Covenant of the League, war would have had to be made on Japan to undo that aggression.  At least so it appeared to the great Powers, but at the time the great Powers were not willing to undertake the obligations.  A combination of the small States would have been helpless in the matter.  It would have required overwhelming force, applied definitely at the point, to save China and to prevent the aggression of Japan.</P>
    <P>It was, I think, when I was President of the Council, that that happened, and in it I certainly saw the end of the League.  It was quite clear that when one great Power could do that, another great Power, when it was going to be tempted, would feel that the League would be equally ineffective.  That happened, in my opinion, in the case of Abyssinia. Then, of course, confidence in the League had practically disappeared among the various members.  The League was beginning gradually to shape itself into an alliance of certain Powers against others.  At that point we indicated very clearly what our attitude was going to be, that we were not going to be parties to action by the League when it was developing in that particular way.  That is the primary difficulty: to prevent aggression by a great Power means a great war, and you have, so to speak, in order to avoid war, to enter upon war.</P>
    <P>There is no use in a League of Nations until all who are in the League make up their minds that they will combine and actually go to war to maintain the principles of the League. It is no inconsistency for the League to go to war on an occasion like that.  It is a very different type of war from war between, say, an aggressor State and a State that is simply defending <Col N="2780" /> itself.  It is what I would call a police war.  Steps would have to be taken in advance, of course, to minimise the size of that war.  That is the other matter which presents very great difficulty.  How are you going to get a situation in which the League will have sufficient force at its command immediately, practically to overwhelm any one of the member States that attempts to break the law? We maintain the ordinary municipal law in the community by having power available to the Executive which is so great that the ordinary citizen or group of individuals cannot stand up against it.  If they could, you would not be able to maintain the law.  It is the same internationally.</P>
    <P>Unless there is immediately available for the organ of the League, which is there to maintain peace and to see that the law is kept, a force which is overwhelmingly greater than that of any individual who may be about to break the law, then an effective organisation for the maintenance of peace is not there. That is extremely difficult, also, to bring about and that is why, on one occasion when I was speaking on this matter, I suggested that, in my view, we will not have nearly arrived at an effective League until we have something that is very nearly like a confederation of the nations.  I think that ultimately we will have to get to that stage.  I know there are difficulties and dangers in that, too, but we will have to get to that stage before we will have in a League of Nations a really effective means for the maintenance of peace.</P>
    <P>I pointed out that it is the great nations that are the trouble in this, and it is the problem of the great nations that is the real problem.  They realise that they must come in and, because they realise that they will have to bear the principal part of the burden, they want to have the principal part of the power, too.  Consequently, in all these organisations being projected &mdash; and in the present one &mdash; for the maintenance of peace, there is a tendency to give to the great Powers an overwhelming influence, which generally means, in the <Col N="2781" /> long run, that if they keep together all goes well but, when they want to quarrel, then the whole purpose for which the League was established goes to pieces.  If one of them feels sufficiently strong to be able to indulge its ambitions, whatever they may be, then you have the others in a position in which the machinery of the League as a whole cannot be used, because votoes can be employed to prevent the machinery of the League being operated in such a case.</P>
    <P>I have not, as I have said, studied yet very closely the charter of the new United Nations but, from the preliminary look through it that I have had, I am not at all convinced that it is going to be really more effective than the old one was and &mdash; I have given the reasons for it&mdash;I do think that the smaller nations will not have in the new organisation the influence that they had in the old.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick has spoken about our trying to get the small nations together.  When the old League was working the small nations did come together very frequently to try to maintain their own rights under the League.  It was a very common experience for us to have meetings with the representatives of a number of the Northern European States and some other States.  As a matter of fact, we worked in close contact with the smaller European States and I have not the slightest doubt that if we all were members of a new organisation of this kind, we would also be brought together by our natural interests in order to maintain the rights of the small nations against the strong.  But, as was pointed out by Deputy Dillon, the small nations alone could do nothing.  They would not be sufficiently powerful as a league, separately, to be really effective but, wherever their vote comes in, they can be fairly effective by coming together and deciding upon a common programme and, when there are matters that affect the interests of the small States, they naturally do that.  I do not think that, at this stage, however, we would gain very much by going into that wide field but, of course, the question naturally will engage our attention more and more now that the position <Col N="2782" /> is getting from the fluid into a more solid state, and in all probability, at a later stage, will come before the House.</P>
    <P>As I say, it is extremely difficult to get anything like an effective league. The present charter, in my opinion&mdash;I have said it a couple of times&mdash;is not, from the small nations' point of view, as good as the old.  From the point of view of being effective for peace, I do not think it is any better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It has elements of economic co-operation, and facets of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In the old League, as the Deputy is aware, there was a good deal of such work done. Apart from the fundamental problem of the maintenance of peace, the old League of Nations was a very valuable organisation.  I agree with Deputy Dillon that the people of the world will have to struggle towards that ultimate goal of living under a rule of law which will be accepted and have some power to enforce it against those who will want to break it up. We will not get it quickly but, by persistently striving for it, we may arrive there at the end.  One thing may help us is the realisation of what war now means.  Formerly, wars could be engaged in by certain nations without these nations feeling there was a war on at all.  That day, I think, is past and the realisation on the part of the nations which go to war that the victor often suffers as much as the vanquished and that, from the point of view of victory, it certainly is very dearly bought, may make the nations which want to go to war pause.  But human nature remains very much of the same type over a long period and, in bringing individuals and nations under the rule of law, that was done in the past very largely by one strong Power completely demolishing the others and establishing itself as the one ruling Power.  It might be thought that probably that is the way in which this rule of law might ultimately win acceptance in the world, by one Power dominating all the nations and consequently imposing <Col N="2783" /> its will for the time and some sort of evolution, like the democratic evolution of States, coming on afterwards. But I think that is a thought which would be horrible.  One would certainly pray it would not be the way in which it would be done.  It might for a time achieve success and bring about what we were just saying.  I do not think it would be effective.  Most States are of such a size that they can be governed by central authority, and so on, and we have not quite a parallel in the case of the nations as a whole.  I do not think it will apply to nations as a whole. I do not think the thing could last in that form.</P>
      <P>The alternative is something like a voluntary confederation.  Any league, of course, is something like that, but it lacks some essential elements, such as the law-making body.  How are you going to get the law-making body and, still more, how are you going to get the law enforcing authority, and how are you going to get the body that will justly declare what the law is and give just judgments between nations?  These are the elements we have in an ordinary State.  To get these for a world State or a world confederation would be extremely difficult indeed, so that we can only do the best that we can at each particular stage, try to improve it, try to get the individuals in the various nations to realise that peace means a great deal to them and that the method of trying to satisfy national ambitions by war is not the effective and the proper method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, I do not care to dwell on these things at this time because it would be very much better if we had a situation in which we would have something immediate and definite to decide upon.  I think the House will pardon me if I do not go into these more or less speculative matters at the moment any further.  I would like to assure Deputy Dillon, however, that I did not say we were not to dream dreams.  I said that, it was all right for Deputies on the opposite benches simply to dream the dreams but we had not merely to dream them but to see how <Col N="2784" /> we were going to realise them. We cannot approach the matter from any other aspect, as long as we have responsibilities such as we have here on these benches.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £3,000,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1946, for the Alleviation of Distress in Europe due to War.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2785" /> On the 18th May I gave the Dáil particulars of the foodstuffs and other supplies which we proposed to allocate for the relief of the distressed populations in Europe.  I gave the Dáil on that occasion particulars of the various articles and quantities involved.  These have since been published widely and are probably already fully familiar to Deputies, so that I need hardly go into that aspect of the matter again.</P>
    <P>This Vote of £3,000,000 is required to provide for the expenditure which may be involved.  The Vote covers the cost of foodstuffs, live stock and other commodities included in the offer, as well as whatever expenditure it is necessary to incur on preparing for their shipment and transporting them to their destinations.  The Vote does not cover the cost of certain commodities like blankets and cooking apparatus, to the value of £86,000, which form part of stocks held by the Department of Defence.</P>
    <P>The French, Italian, Belgian and Dutch Governments have accepted our offer to make available certain quantities of food and other products by way of aid to their suffering populations. They have also assured us that the necessary shipping will be forthcoming with the least possible delay.  A difficulty has arisen with regard to the supply of tin for tinning meat, but it is hoped that at least a small amount may be procured by the Governments interested.</P>
    <P>The distribution amongst the four countries concerned of the products available is being arranged according to the most urgent needs of the different populations concerned, though it must be said that any one of the Governments could take the total supplies available here and still be very far indeed from meeting the urgent needs of the population.  The requirements of Europe during the coming year in money value would reach a total of several hundred million pounds, and it can be seen how relatively small our contribution is going to be.  The main burden of sending food to Europe falls on the United States and Great Britain, especially on the former, though Sweden and Switzerland have already taken a <Col N="2786" /> splendid part in the work of relief.  We are trying to do our share.</P>

      <P>I think that point requires to be clarified, that in so far as this plan to help the afflicted of Europe is concerned, we want no profit.  On the other hand, we have no desire to thrust charity on those who feel there is something unbecoming in receiving assistance except in exchange for payment.  I think some measure of publicity is necessary to explain to our people that our modest contribution is designed as relief. There are some people who misunderstand the magnitude of the problem with which the world is faced and who tend to suggest that the first duty is to those at home.  If they knew how great is the need of those who are hungry at present, I believe the understanding of the scheme adumbrated by this Estimate would be more complete.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I had almost concluded when this debate was adjourned on the last occasion and I do not desire to add much to what I said then.  There <Col N="2788" /> is, however, one point which I would like to emphasise and it has relation to the lump sums in respect of which the Minister for Finance has declined to pay the increased bonus in the case of persons who retired between July, 1940, and December, 1944.  It may be that in approaching this matter the Department of Finance said: &ldquo;Whilst we will pay the bonus on the basis of an index figure of 110 as from 1st January last we will not pay the bonus on the basis of that index figure in respect of past payments; that is, in respect of payments which were actually made between July, 1940, and December, 1944.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would like to point out that, whilst an officer may have received a lump sum together with an annual pension if he retired between July, 1940, and December, 1944, it would be unfair to regard the lump sum as proper only to the period in which it was received, because it must be remembered that the lump sum was purchased only by the officer agreeing to surrender approximately 25 per cent. of his annual pension.  If he had decided not to adopt the superannuation scheme which gave him a smaller pension and a lump sum, he would have received a larger rate of pension and the mere fact that he decided to accept a smaller rate of pension and have a lump sum gives the lump sum the continuing character that the annual pension has, and it would be unfair simply because an officer decided to adopt the scheme of a smaller pension and a lump sum that the very fact of doing so should deprive him of having applied to that lump sum the same scale of bonus as applies to the annual pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of women the pensions are calculated under the 1859 Superannuation Act.  They have no opportunity of electing to take a lump sum; they have to take an annual pension. The result is that any woman who retired between July, 1940, and December, 1944, got the bonus on the index figure of 110 on her pension as from the 1st January, whereas a man, because his pension was calculated under the 1909 Act, got only a bonus of 110 on threequarters of his pension, <Col N="2789" /> the other quarter having been surrendered in order to obtain the lump sum.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister must, in all equity, recognise that the lump sum should not be lined up against an officer's service at the time he retired, but that it is as much a part of the provision for his future as is the annual pension.  That being so, I hope the Minister will be magnanimous and will recognise that it is unfair to discriminate against a man who gets a lower salary in the lump sum as compared with the woman whose pension is calculated under an Act which gives only a pension and no lump sum.</P>
    <P>This is a problem that is not likely to recur and a settlement could be made without imposing any undue burden on the State.  It is the merest justice to give those concerned a bonus calculated with reference to the index figure of 110, seeing that if they had the normal bonus applied to their annual pensions and their lump sums, they would have applied to the pensions and the lump sums a bonus calculated not on an index figure of 110, but in many cases on the basis of an index figure of 190.  Asking to have this calculated on an index figure of 110 in respect of the small number of persons involved is asking for something which is obviously just.  I hope, if the Minister cannot concede this claim now, he will examine the matter sympathetically and in the near future do the barest justice to those concerned.</P>

      <P>It is very important that we should know right at the beginning of the present Minister's tenure of office does he still believe in the Douglas Credit Scheme?  He made it known to a good many people some time ago that he was veering round to the conclusion that it was a most effective panacea for the economic ills of our people.  I do not know whether the appendix to the Irish Banking Commission's report had any effect on his judgment or not, but if he still adheres to the view that the Douglas Credit Scheme is a desirable plan, I would be grateful if he would rebut for us here the submissions made in the <Col N="2790" /> appendix to the Irish Banking Commission report.</P>

      <P>I referred to the Douglas Credit Scheme, but I have no desire to go any further into the question of monetary policy.  You can see what the administration would be like under the Douglas Credit Scheme.  The Department of Finance would consist very largely of printing presses designed for A and B money and the staff would be working overtime to produce it.  There is no doubt that there is a general tendency amongst persons concerned for social reform to contemplate a scheme of taxation largely designed to effect a substantial transfer of incomes from one group in the community to another with an equalitarian end in view.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The merits for or against that, I have no desire to discuss, but the Minister, I think, might turn his mind to this: the merits of that question, which must some time be discussed, cannot be discussed in the absence of a statistic which I do not think is at present available.  I should be glad to know from the Minister if he proposes administratively to repair that error and to provide us and his own Department with information as to the number of persons in the country with incomes, say, under £200, between £200 and £300, between £300 and £400, between £400 and £500, between £500 and £600 and so on up to the brackets where these statistics are now available, because when we get into the supertax bracket, the Revenue Commissioners already provide these <Col N="2791" /> statistics.  The income of the vast bulk of our people, however, falls far below the supertax bracket, and, so far as I am aware, no reliable statistic in their regard has as yet been made available. I should be glad if the Minister would look into it and, if it is practicable, make it available as soon as he conveniently can.</P>
      <P>I want to state most emphatically something which will not interest the body of the Deputies one ha'porth and which yet goes to the very root of honest administration in our community. Deputy Cosgrave is here and I expect he will give me a hand on it, because he is, and I was, Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee.  For the protection of civil servants, of contractors, of Ministers, and of all elements in the community, the Department of Finance rules lay down that, if you want to dispose of Government property, you must put it up to tender, that no facilities for back-door negotiations will be provided, because, although in many cases it might be easier to dispose of the Government property in that way, the evils which might arise if such a practice were approved convinced everybody that it was better to suffer the inconvenience of the universal rule that if surplus Government property is to be disposed of, it will be put up to auction and that anybody may buy it by tender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently the Army announced that they wanted to dispose of a large surplus of used lorries and, of course, before any Department can dispose of its property, or enter into commitments of that kind, it must seek the approval of the Department of Finance.  This is the astonishing proposal, that the lorries should be offered to Córas Iompair Éireann and nobody else allowed to bid, that Córas Iompair Éireann should take over the lorries at the valuation set upon them by three independent valuers and that if there were any lorries which Córas Iompair Éireann did not want to take, these could be put up to tender and disposed of.  What has actually happened is that Córas Iompair Éireann is going to take them all, even if they make matchwood of them, because they do not want anybody else to have <Col N="2792" /> them, lest alternative purchasers should be competitors with them.</P>
    <P>But here is the danger.  If the Department is going to approve a scheme whereunder Government property is sold to one person&mdash;and remember that Córas Iompair Éireann, an incorporated company in the eyes of the law, is an individual&mdash;and nobody else is to be allowed to compete, in the first case in which that happens, you will get three independent ruthless valuers, in all probability, and the transaction will involve the State in no loss whatever; but, in nine months' time, a similar situation will arise and some other body will come along and say to whomever is the secretary of the Department which wishes to dispose of stuff: &ldquo;Do not bother about having tenders and what not.  I will take the whole lot.&rdquo;  The Department of Finance will say: &ldquo;No, you cannot do that&rdquo;, and this other Department will say: &ldquo;Oh, but we can.  You did it in respect of the lorries.&rdquo;  The Department of Finance will fight a vigorous battle and say that that was an exceptional case and so forth and then the Department desiring to dispose of the merchandise will say: &ldquo;This is a very exceptional case, too&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I solemnly warn the House that, if they let this transaction pass with its approval, the day will yet dawn in this country when elaborate conspiracies will be set on foot to corrupt public servants and to purchase arbitrators appointed to determine the value of goods to be sold by Departments to would-be purchasers who are not required, in accordance with the rules of the Department of Finance, to make tender for what they want to buy.  You may very easily have a Government Department putting up material worth a quarter of a million pounds, and they may appoint three outside valuers.  It may become eminently worth while for an unscrupulous wealthy body to pay those valuers £10,000 apiece to under-value the Government property.</P>
    <P>We are happily blessed in this country&mdash;I have to say disagreeable things because I do not want the House to be misled in this matter&mdash;<Col N="2793" /> with a public service with splendid traditions and standards, the integrity of which has rarely, if ever, been called in question, though instances will occur in the best regulated families, which heretofore in our history have been dealt with in the most Draconian way by the civil servants themselves; but I warn the House that, though public servants in this country are not in receipt of princely salaries&mdash;most of them could secure very much higher remuneration had they devoted their lives to commercial enterprise rather than to the State&mdash;if the House allows a system to develop whereunder it becomes worth while for the unscrupulous would-be purchaser of Government property to offer public servants £25,000 or £30,000 in order corruptly to transfer to him at an under-valued price the property which he ought to have put up to public tender, they are striking a deadly blow at the integrity of the public service.</P>
    <P>That Department of Finance rule, I understand, has been ridden rough shodden over by the Department of Defence and Córas Iompair Éireann in respect of this transaction relating to lorries.  If the thing has not yet been consummated, I most strongly urge on the Minister for Finance to withdraw his approval of the scheme and insist that the lorries will be disposed of by tender.  It is not primarily the value of the lorries I am concerned with; it is the fact that, if this deal goes through, it will be quoted as a precedent for further and further encroachments on a rule which was designed for the protection of the State, of public servants and of would-be purchasers of Government material.</P>
    <P>I was listening to Deputy Norton talking about arbitration for the Civil Service, and I should like to hear the Minister's reply because I cannot see that there is any effective reply he can make.  Our social set-up and our political set-up have withdrawn from civil servants the right to strike.  The general, honourable understanding between the State and its servants is that they will not strike lest the maintenance of public order become impossible should they all simultaneously refuse to function.  If you exact from <Col N="2794" /> the servants of the State the surrender of that right, which in every other walk of life is regarded as sacrosanct in every community, then I think you have got to give them an alternative, and that is the right to an independent arbitrator who will give them what they might have secured had they the freedom of an ordinary body of wage earners organised in a trade union.</P>
    <P>I have been 27 years in public life&mdash; I started very young&mdash;and I have been 20 years running my own business, and if that experience has taught me anything it has taught me this: that if something is just and fair, and would be conceded were the pressure for the concession strong enough, the moment the person in a position to grant the concession makes up his mind that those things are so, he should not wait for the pressure to be brought upon him but should concede willingly and of his own goodwill that which under threat of force he would be prepared to yield.  We once had a general election on this question of arbitration for the Civil Service, and a less salubrious issue on which to go to the country I cannot imagine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, well, the bonus and the salary of the secretary to a Department were particularly well canvassed from many a Fianna Fáil platform in my area.  When you stood up in Connemara and said: &ldquo;Here is a fellow with £1,200 a year,&rdquo; everybody said: &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; and when you added: &ldquo;and he has a bonus on top of that,&rdquo; there was a stampede into the ranks of Fianna Fáil, the boys who thought nobody was worth more than £1,000 a year, but who got re-elected and came back here and increased their own salaries as the first gesture of public economy. However, that is beside the point.  If arbitration, as it seems to me, is founded on an argument which cannot be controverted in justice, I think we ought to concede it.  I am saying that deliberately in the belief that if I were Minister for Finance I would concede it, because I think it would be little short of criminal for any responsible <Col N="2795" /> member of the Dáil to press that course on the Minister if he honestly believed it was impracticable or calculated to make administration impossible. Mind you, if the Minister is in a position to advance views that I do not know of, calculated to prove that it is impracticable, I am quite prepared to change my mind and confess my error.  But I have never heard an argument calculated to prove that, and the argument for arbitration as set out by Deputy Norton here yesterday, and as set out in this House on divers other occasions by Deputy Costello and others, seems to me unanswerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last thing I want to mention is a detail.  Deputy Norton has dealt with the general question of the lump sum payable to civil servants on their retirement.  That is a highly technical question, and there is only one very small detail of it to which I would like to refer, because the rest of the ground in regard to pensions and superannuation has been very exhaustively covered by Deputy Norton.  In connection with the Standstill Order in relation to the bonus, when the bonus was stabilised in 1941 it remained stabilised until the Government arbitrarily stabilised it at a new figure on 1st January, 1944.  Between those two dates a considerable number of civil servants retired in the ordinary course, and when the new figure at which the cost-of-living bonus was to be stabilised as from 1st January, 1944, was determined, some adjustment was made in respect of the bonus upon which the pensions of the public servants who retired between 1941 and 31st December, 1943, had been fixed, but, with one of those glorious Department of Finance reactions which is so typical of them&mdash;I can imagine the stiff rearguard action of that admirable brigade, shouting &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo; and grudgingly giving way a quarter of an inch about the adjustment of pensions &mdash;when that was all settled and the personification of the Department of Finance was all hot under the collar and upset and ruffled at having had to give way so much, somebody said: &ldquo;Now, sir, what about adjusting the lump sum?&rdquo;, at which stage he whacks <Col N="2796" /> the table, closes his desk and says: &ldquo;To hell with the lump sum.  I will do no more&rdquo;.  Therefore, we have the anomaly that the lump sum paid to the very small number of servants who retired between 1941 and 31st December, 1943, has not been adjusted on the same basis as that on which pensions were adjusted.  It is a trifling sum of money.  The possibility of the recurrence of an issue of this kind in the history of the public service is virtually unthinkable.</P>
    <P>Let me assure the new Minister for Finance that that awful word &ldquo;precedent&rdquo; need have no terrors for him in regard to this.  This situation is so unique that it could not conceivably be regarded as a precedent for anything if he would give to the public servants who retired during that period their lumpsum on a basis which would be equitable, taking into account the admission implied by the rectification of the figure at which the cost-of-living bonus has been stabilised as from 1st January, 1944.  I am certain that what happened is substantially what I have described, that the Department of Finance was determined to make a last despairing stand and refuse to consider the payment of the increased bonus on the lump sum.  I have great sympathy with the sound general principle that you must draw the line somewhere since the average person seems to think that the Treasury is a bottomless pit.  Now that tempers have cooled down may I suggest that on reflection the more sensible course for the Department to take in this case would be to be logical rather than parsimonious, and that since every rule must have its exception in order to prove its validity, I respectfully submit to the Department of Finance that in this case it should make an exception.</P>

      <P>I understand that some months ago the Department of Finance gave orders that post office pensioners with less than £4 a week were to be paid fortnightly.  I think that is a decision which we should all commend.  I have received a letter from a retired civil servant who was awarded an allowance by Mr. Justice Davitt when Chairman of the Civil <Col N="2797" /> Service Compensation Board.  I take it that his pension is less than £4 a week, but he says that in the category to which he belongs the pensions are paid fortnightly and quarterly.  He has asked me to bring to the notice of the Minister the difficulty that imposes on a man with a small pension.  I suggest that what was done for the post office pensioners should be done for the retired civil servants who belong to the same category.  I would ask the Minister to look into the matter and see that the pensions are paid fortnightly.  In these hard times it would be of great benefit to men in that class.  It would not involve any great administrative difficulty, and I hope that the Minister will be able to give a favourable reply to my representations.</P>

      <P>When this Vote was under consideration on Tuesday evening reference was made to a loan that was negotiated last year between the Dublin Corporation and the Bank of Ireland, a loan for £1,000,000 at 3¼ per cent.  I am not going to say that the corporation were entirely satisfied with the terms of the loan.  Deputy Mulcahy, who referred to the matter, may not be aware that the Finance Committee of the Dublin Corporation succeeded in introducing a new feature into the negotiations for that loan, namely, that the bank agreed to facilitate the corporation in paying it over by instalments, or at such periods as the capital works concerned demanded.  In that way, a very considerable amount of money was saved. At any rate, that new feature represents a complete departure in the negotiations which Dublin Corporation have had in transactions of that kind.  The old arrangement was&mdash;it is the one that generally obtains&mdash;that the loan was paid over in full. Obviously, it would not all be required &mdash;only to the extent to which work proceeded.  The major portion of the amount had, therefore, to be placed on deposit at 1 per cent., and obviously the corporation lost the difference between that 1 per cent. and the rate at which the loan was negotiated. Incidentally, may I say that in the case of the recent loan it was <Col N="2798" /> obtained at the cheapest rate the corporation has ever obtained a loan in close on 50 years.  The terms, as I have said, were not all that could be desired, but frankly they were the best that could be obtained in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>I am prompted to intervene in this debate to refer to the circumstances which generally obtain so far as public bodies are concerned.  The Minister and Deputies are aware that at the present time the Dublin Corporation and other public bodies, in so far as capital works in relation to housing are concerned, have very large schemes prepared, and as soon as conditions permit these will be undertaken, particularly when supplies are available. A good deal of preparation and thought have been given to all that work by the experts of the local authorities.  The work is being done in close collaboration with the various governmental Departments.  They have co-operated in every way, but the extraordinary feature about all this planning and preparation is that while we may have these excellent schedules of schemes prepared, in the last analysis, the factor that governs the prosecution of the schemes is finance, and so far as we know nothing whatever is being done by any responsible government Department in the matter of the provision of that vital requirement. The position evidently will be that when the schemes are ready to be undertaken the local authorities will be thrown back on their own resources as they have been all down the years with, I may say, disastrous results.  I can recall that in 1936 the Dublin Corporation was faced with a crisis when it was almost impossible for it to obtain the amount of money it required to keep its housing contracts going.  Local authorities through the country have been faced with the position that while they were anxious to have housing, sewerage and water works schemes carried through&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They were faced, on the other hand, with bringing such schemes into operation, and in a good many cases they have, willy willy, to accept the figures put to them either by the banks or other corporations. In that respect, these beneficial services have suffered.  I suggest, more particularly where housing is concerned, where interest charges are such a dominant feature of the overheads that must be paid by the ratepayer, the taxpayer, and, eventually, the tenant, that it is time we should have some directing influence so far as the financial operations of local authorities as a whole are concerned.  We have cases where loans had to be taken at rates of 4, 4½ and 5¼ per cent., resulting in a heavy deadweight, particularly on the individuals who occupy the houses.  As you are aware, Sir, every house that is put up by a local authority is an uneconomic <Col N="2800" /> proposition measured by ordinary financial standards.  It is not possible to charge the economic rent to the tenant because of his economic and domestic circumstances.  The gulf has to be bridged somehow, and it has to be bridged by the taxpayer, the ratepayer, and, eventually, the tenant.  I suggest that we cannot have prosperity and we cannot prosecute schemes such as I have indicated, on the right lines, until the whole question of the financing of such schemes is placed on a proper and sound foundation.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister, who is new to this office and who carries our good wishes in that particular office, that he might usefully signalise his advent to office by acting in conjunction with the Minister for Local Government in examining this whole question of finance for local authorities at the earliest possible moment, and acknowledging the fact that public authorities are in every sense utility organisations, their main objective being to give service to the community on a nonprofit basis.  That being so, the public are entitled to get such services as housing, water works and public services generally, on conditions that will not create a heavy financial burden upon them in later years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My suggestion is that the Minister should consult the Minister for Local Government at the earliest possible moment and, having examined the whole scheme of finance for public authorities, take the local authorities into confidence and indicate to them what plan he has evolved for the future.  I venture to say that something along those lines is not only desirable, but is a matter of urgent necessity because what may happen is this: When the various authorities who now have their schemes prepared are in a position to put them into effect, they will proceed at once, vying with one another, and putting their various stocks on the market, in open competition with one another.  That may have very serious reactions because if a public authority puts its stock on the market and that stock is not totally subscribed, its credit is immediately damaged.  I suggest that a situation of that kind should not be allowed to arise and I appeal, with <Col N="2801" /> personal knowledge of what the position has been over a number of years, and its wide ramifications, that the time has arrived for the Minister to examine a proposition of this character.</P>
    <P>In the debate on this Vote last year, the Minister's predecessor, on the question of pensions, which have been referred to by previous speakers here, used these words&mdash;volume 94, column 1388, Dáil Debates 28/6/1944:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Admittedly, many of the lowly-paid pensioners are in a bad position. I am having the position with regard to many classes of these pensioners examined at the present time.  The matter has been under consideration for some time and while I am still definitely of the opinion that any further payment of emergency bonuses is not going to be helpful to the community as a whole, I would rather see something given to these poorly-paid pensioners &mdash;teachers and others&mdash;than that they should be forced to appeal to the local authorities for home help. I am told that some of them have had to do that.  All I can say at the moment is that I am having the question examined&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I should like, in the light of the undertaking which was then given by the Minister's predecessor, to ascertain from the Minister if that examination did in fact take place, and with what result.  Appeals have been made from all sections of this House for one section of the community in particular, namely, the teachers, many of whom are retired on very low pensions and whose position to-day can only be described as pitiful.  There are others, members of local authorities, retired on very low pensions.  Presumably, their case came within the ambit of the examination and I should like to hear from the Minister, when he is replying, what he proposes to do, what decision he has come to in connection with the matter and if he will make some announcement to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two matters that I wish to raise on this Vote.  The first is the question of superannuation for the Civil Service. <Col N="2802" /> Deputy Norton dealt with it at some length and Deputy Dillon had something to add to Deputy Norton's statement on the matter.  In order to understand fully the provisions of the Superannuation Act and how it affects members of the Civil Service, one should consider the two Superannuation Acts.  The first Superannuation Act, passed in 1859, gave for each year of service one-sixtieth of the individual's salary and, in respect of 40 years' service, that came to be known as the forty-sixtieths.  Subsequently, on representation from the Civil Service, the British Government came to the conclusion that the Act operated unfairly in the case of a civil servant who resigned owing to ill health and in the case of the dependents of a civil servant who died, for whom there was no provision of any kind.  Consequently, the 1909 Act was passed which gave one-eightieth for each year of service and one and a half times the person's annual salary as a lump sum.  In the case of a civil servant who died, the family were provided for by the grant of a lump sum and, for the purpose of the lump sum, the number of years' service was extended to 45. That Act, so far as existing civil servants at the time were concerned, was optional.  A person in the Civil Service prior to the coming into operation of the 1909 Act could opt to take either the provisions of the 1909 Act or the provisions of the 1859 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone who came into the Civil Service subsequent to 1909 must take the provisions of the 1909 Act, so it is obvious that the number of people who are now affected by the provisions of the 1859 Act is quite limited and, as time goes on, not alone will they become more limited but they will eventually cease.  In 1940 the Government stabilised, by Emergency Powers Order, the cost of living as applicable to the pensions of civil servants at 185 and the lump sum was also affected by that stabilisation.  I think I might as well say here that the Superannuation Acts&mdash;the various terms were subsequently amended on a couple of occasions&mdash;were framed for stable economic conditions.  While that was all right up to the last war, towards <Col N="2803" /> the end of the last war, when the cost of living rose considerably, the British Government of the time reviewed the terms of the Act and adopted a sliding scale for the actual salary and for the lump sum.  The sliding scale was in the nature of a bonus and it operated more harshly on the lower paid civil servants than the higher paid ones, due to its peculiar structure.  For that purpose, the lump sum was fixed at 75 per cent. in 1922.</P>
    <P>At that time, the cost of living was going down and they could gradually scale down the actual salary, but the lump sum, being a fixed figure, could not be scaled and the way in which it was dealt with was by taking 75 per cent.  I will give the House some figures to indicate how unfairly this operates on civil servants, and particularly on the lower-paid ones.  A person who had a basic salary on superannuation of £200 suffers a loss as a result of the 1940 Order of £104, with £300, the loss is £128; on £500, the loss is £180; on £1,000, the loss is £213, and on £1,500 the loss is £194. It is obvious from that that the lower-paid civil servants suffer far more severely than the higher-paid ones, but, of course, the effects of it are felt by all sections of the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>In 1922, when the lump sum was fixed at a reduction of 75 per cent., it was due to the fact that the cost of living was down much lower than it had been in 1919 and 1920.  The cost of living fell rather rapidly annually for a number of years and showed slight variations of one kind or another about 1928, 1929, 1930 and 1931, until 1935, when the cost of living rose steeply.  People who retired prior to 1935 are affected adversely by the operation of this Order because of what is known as an overriding maximum. While the pension and the lump sum could be graded down, there was an overriding maximum over which no increase could be granted, and in this way those who retired at that time, and who are a very small number, were affected far worse than those who retired prior to 1935.</P>
    <P>However, in 1940, when the Government brought in the stabilisation <Col N="2804" /> Order and fixed at 185 the cost of living, it operated unfairly on civil servants who retired between 1940 and the 1st January, 1945, when the Government brought in Emergency Powers Order, No. 354, which lifted the operation of the stabilisation so far as it affects civil servants who retire on and from 1st January last and raised it to the figure of 210, which was the cost-of-living index figure at which wages were paid to workers in private or industrial employment in May of 1941.</P>
    <P>The argument of the Government, when they originally fixed the Civil Service cost-of-living figure at 185, was that it was necessary in order to set a headline for the rest of the community; but if it was necessary to set a headline for the rest of the community, it might be explained why it was fixed ten or 11 months earlier for the Civil Service than for ordinary private individuals and also why it was fixed at 185 as against 210.</P>
    <P>The Order, which was introduced at the beginning of this year, so far as it concerns civil servants who retire on and from 1st January, 1945, is unfair concerning the salary, but it shows nothing whatever of a lump sum or a gratuity and those people still suffer the injustice of the fixed figure of 185. As I have explained, the lump sum is really portion of the pension and must be regarded as provision for future needs.  When the pension scheme was originally altered from the 1859 Act to the 1909 Act it was altered because the civil servants had made representations to the Government and the Government realised it was a very equitable method of dealing with civil servants whose death or illness left them no longer in a position to provide for their dependents.  Therefore, the lump sum is really portion of the original pension, and while it is not regarded as a pension in the sense that an annual payment is so termed, nevertheless, from the whole structure of the Act and the structure of the superannuation scheme, it must be regarded as portion of the pension, and the mere form of it is for the convenience and assistance of civil servants and their dependents.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2805" /> How far civil servants who retired between 1st July, 1940, and 31st December, 1943, suffer the worst of both ends of this scheme is clear.  So far as this Order affects civil servants who retire after 1st January, 1945, they will not be adversely affected where the annual allowance is concerned, but the lump sum is cut at the 75 per cent.  The Government must realise the steep rise which has taken place in the cost of living and which has affected all sections of the community, more particularly civil servants and teachers, whose salaries are fixed and who are not in a position to engage in any form of remunerative employment or undertaking, such as is available to other sections of the community.</P>
    <P>I have here a note from the current issue of the journal of the Institute of Bankers in Ireland, in which there is an article entitled &ldquo;The Post-War Pound&rdquo;.  It points out that, taking the Irish £ in September, 1939, as worth 20/-, its present purchasing power is 11/9, and compared with 1914 its value is only 6/9.  It says further, that the corresponding values of the £ in Britain were 13/4 and 8/7, respectively.  I do not know whether the Minister shares the same opinion as the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who always says, when faced with the depreciating value of the £: &ldquo;If you give me 20/- I will give you £1&rdquo;.  That is all right, in the mere monetary idea of money in metal and notes, but when one takes £1 to purchase the articles which could be purchased for £1 in 1939, the basis of the argument falls flat.  Everyone realises, and I am sure that the Minister for Industry and Commerce realises as well, that the purchasing value of the £ has decreased considerably.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I urge the Government to reconsider the whole basis of this scheme.  The people who are affected worst of all are those who retired between 1940 and 1943.  The position is still not satisfactory, so far as the lump sum is concerned, for those who retired even since 1st January last.  It operates most <Col N="2806" /> unfairly and, in the words of a well-known journalist, it is manifestly unjust to operate this Order against members of the Civil Service at a lower rate, from the point of view of the cost-of-living figure, than it has been operated against the rest of the community since May, 1941.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the invariable Department of Finance rule which makes it obligatory on all Departments of State to submit any excess articles, which are no longer of use to these Departments, to public auction.  He mentioned a recent case in which the Department of Defence sold lorries by a private arrangement or agreement, after these lorries had been valued independently by three valuers, to Córas Iompair Éireann.  I can visualise circumstances which would necessitate such a course. These lorries might be bought by private individuals who wanted to store them or merely wanted them for ordinary trading purposes, and the Government might consider that, in present circumstances, Córas Iompair Éireann, being responsible for public transport, could better use the available lorries in view of the fact that lorries of all kinds are in short supply.</P>
    <P>With that reservation, as applied to the present emergency, I think the adoption of private agreements between various Departments of State which have surplus property they no longer require, is contrary to all previous practice and is, I feel sure, definitely contrary to Department of Finance sentiment and contrary to the traditional parsimonious tendency of that Department, which has a certain responsibility to ensure that all available resources are exploited to the full and that no waste of public property shall take place.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to hear the Government view.  It does seem undesirable that any private arrangement concerning the sale or disposal of public property should be entered into, with the exception, perhaps, of the arrangement to which I have referred, and in regard to which there were peculiar circumstances due to the emergency. Other than that, I can see no reason for departure from the ordinary rule <Col N="2807" /> which compels the Department to auction all surplus goods publicly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter of the Civil Service bonus has attracted attention not merely in this House, but in very wide circumstances outside. I am aware that certain clergymen with what, I think, would be regarded as sound theological views, have addressed representations to the Government on what they regard as the immorality of their attitude towards the Civil Service, and I think it has actually gone to the point where one clergyman, addressing himself to a particular Minister, has, so I am informed, said, that no doubt the Government had learned that there was a certain theological view taken of their attitude in this matter and he asked, if the Government had any persons advising them along those lines, he should be put in touch with them so that they could have the matter argued.  I understand he received no reply to that communication.</P>
      <P>Certain representations have been addressed to the Government to the effect that what they have done is grossly immoral.  That it is clearly a breach of contract needs no stressing. So clearly was it a breach that the Government had to fortify themselves by special Orders to prevent the breach of contract being brought to the courts.  They knew very well what the decision was bound to be if the case had been brought before the courts and, therefore, they prevented any application being brought to the courts.  They protected themselves in the event of an appeal to the recognised courts of the country on a mere matter of justice from the point of view of morality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Representations have been made to the Government that what they have done in this connection is grossly immoral&mdash;and that by people who would be expected to pay attention to the pietistic matters we have in the Constitution, matters pertaining to the requirements of prudence, justice and charity.  When it comes to the application of justice for one class of the <Col N="2808" /> community, then the constitutional piety disappears.  The worst feature is that in connection with the Civil Service the Government have had the best of it every time.  Leaving out the question of morality for the moment, they made a contract with the Civil Service.  They enforced that contract when it suited them.  They gained for the State through the enforcement of that contract.  The gain has been acknowledged, and it is a significant one.</P>
    <P>That was at a time when the Taoiseach was stumping the country talking about his determination to cut down salaries.  Feeling he might lose the support of the civil servants, he warned them that some of the higher salaries might be cut, but the bonus would not be cut&mdash;it was automatic. He said that after he had become a member of the Government, but, prior to becoming a member of the Government, he told these civil servants that not merely had they a contract and that it was a good one, but that it was such that they should hang on to it with all their might; in the days of rising prices that he saw ahead, the bonus would be their safeguard.</P>
    <P>May I document those statements of mine?  The secretary of the Department of Finance in 1931 said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The civil servants have made an outstanding contribution to national economy.  The accumulated saving effected from Civil Service pay, through the bonus, since 1922, is nearly £2,000,000.  No other section of the community has so substantially contributed to the national economy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So we take £2,000,000 from them when the going was good, when the cost of living was going down.  We let the automatic scale slide downwards and, over the years, we took £2,000,000. That was a gain which was expressed by the secretary of the Department of Finance as being such that no other section of the community had made a contribution equal to it.</P>
    <P>In 1933, when he had become chief of the Government, the Taoiseach said at Ennis:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2809" />&ldquo;In my opinion it would be a bad thing for labour to agree to get rid of the sliding scale.  I am as certain as I am standing here that world prices are going to go up and that the cost of living will go up, and, when prices do go up, it is a great boon to civil servants to know that their salaries will go up to meet the cost of living&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>So that, having taken the £2,000,000 from them when things were going well, the Taoiseach speaks in that fashion in 1933 and tells the civil servants that his forecast of the future is that prices are going to go up and he warns them: hang on to your bonus; it will be a great boon to you to know that your salaries will go up to meet the cost of living.  Later in the year he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Our promise to cut salaries still remains good but this does not refer to the cost-of-living bonus which is automatic&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If ever pledges were solemnly given, they were given in those words.</P>
    <P>At an earlier date, the present Minister for Local Government, who afterwards became Minister for Finance, had referred to the appallingly unfair way in which the cost-of-living bonus was made up and he singled out in particular the matter of rent.  He analysed the particular point taken as rent in the arrangement of the bonus and said that the average weekly rent in July, 1914, was 4/-.  He brought it up to 5/2 in 1922 and said that it was on that percentage variation of just a little over 25 per cent. for the cost-of-living index which applies to the majority of civil servants living here in Dublin &mdash; and then, in his usual rhetorical fashion, this flourish came&mdash;&ldquo;where you could not even get a dog-kennel let alone a house for 5/2 a week&rdquo;.  It is on the 5/2 a week, according to the Minister for Local Government, that one part of this index figure was based, so that it was fixed on dog-kennel conditions.  Mind you, dog-kennels have become even dearer since, let alone the cost of a room, the cost of a house or the cost of furniture.</P>
    <P>As I say, we got this great saving from this section&mdash;greater than any <Col N="2810" /> other section gave&mdash;in the good days, and, when times became bad, notwithstanding the promise of the Taoiseach, the decision is taken by the Government to stabilise the figure.  I do not know why civil servants were singled out.  Of course, it was easy to single them out&mdash;they were under the thumb of the Government.  It was a mere matter of passing an Order and the thing was done, but that is not the way in which morality works or should work.  Some case should have been made with regard to these people as to why the payment of bonus to them, when we had saved from them in the good days, on an increased cost-of-living figure should not have been permitted, or why the payment was going to disturb the whole national finances to some appalling degree.  No such case has been made.  The only case made is that if civil servants were paid on an increasing cost-of-living figure, if the bonus was not stabilised, there would be inflation&mdash;that marvellous word.</P>
    <P>I have tried to get this understood by the House on many occasions.  I want to try again.  I cannot understand how the £ spent by a civil servant in this country is inflationary, whereas if that civil servant leaves the Civil Service, goes across to England and gets a job at £5 or £10 a week and sends back a £, the same £ spent in this country, derived in England, will not be inflationary.  Yet that seems to be the argument.  If a small number of civil servants broke away from the Civil Service and went across to England, there is no doubt that in a very short period they could earn sufficient to send home an amount that would certainly very nearly equate this sum of £1,000,000 a year which Parliamentary replies reveal is the saving on the Civil Service, but apparently if a civil servant gets the money here and spends it here, it is going to send our prices rocketing, whereas if a group of them go to England and send money home to their families, and their families spend it here, it is not inflationary.</P>
    <P>I must confess to a sense of frustration every time I am faced with <Col N="2811" /> that argument.  I do not know if it is seriously meant, but that is the only argument made.  I think we are all agreed that this money is contractually owing to the civil servants. Apart from that, I say that it is morally owing to them, but it is certainly contractually owing, and if it were not for the stabilised cost-of-living figure, we would be paying it to them.  If there were any difficulty about how it would be raised, we would meet that difficulty.  We would regard the money as owing and, somewhere in the Civil Service Estimates, it would be included, and the money would be raised.  We are not objecting to it on the ground that it is hard to raise the money.  The only objection I have heard is that, if we gave them this money, it would be inflationary in character.</P>
    <P>In England, they do not allow people to spend all they earn.  Big wages are being earned and they have very definite controls in England. They take a certain amount of money from people by way of what are called deferred savings, and so on.  They also try to attract money into certain forms of investment, but in any event they do not pretend that they do not owe the money.  They pay the money, but they prevent the spending of it.  Are we deferring the payment of this money to the civil servants? Are we piling up what we have taken from them as a debt due to them and are we going to loosen that some time when we get rid of this bogey of inflation, or are we, as I think is simply the case, robbing them of what we contracted to pay to them and what the Taoiseach asked them to think of as a great boon when he said that their salaries would go up to meet the cost of living?</P>
    <P>On a very recent occasion, I gave one other example.  Here we are unable to allow civil servants to get £1,000,000 between them and to spend it subject to whatever rationing control and all the other controls that exist in the country, but we are allowing any number of people, visitors and tourists, to come over to this country and to spend their money here.  I notice that on a recent occasion, when the Chancellor <Col N="2812" /> of the Exchequer in England went to the meeting of the Institute of Municipal Treasurers and Accountants at the Guildhall on 22nd June last, he talked about the necessity of providing work by spending money.  That was his theme, but the borough treasurer of Brighton, at the end of his speech said, with reference to the idea of inflation in England, that while there was a shortage of consumer goods, it was necessary that part of the national income should be saved and not spent. He added this phrase: &ldquo;The paramount need is to remove our purchasing power to a place of safety.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One of the places of safety is Éire. English workmen who may not spend the moneys they earn in England are floating over here.  This is a place of safety for the purchasing power of the English pound.  They spend it here, and again, apparently, it is not inflationary because an English tourist spends it, but it would be inflationary if an Irish civil servant spends it. What do the Government of this country do?  Under our financial arrangements, if these English tourists desiring to come over here like to go to any of our banks, they must, on putting in an English pound, get an Irish pound.  If there is any difficulty in supplying Irish pounds, the printing press is there and it is worked for English tourists.  The machinery for getting money is simple&mdash;the background is somewhat complicated and confused&mdash;but there is no doubt that, so far as these people are concerned, on presenting themselves at an Irish bank and giving in a pound, they are entitled to get an Irish pound.</P>
    <P>Suppose 1,000,000 of these pounds are brought in by tourists.  We have then £1,000,000 suddenly emerging into Irish circulation, but it is in the hands of English tourists and not in the hands of Irish civil servants, and we will allow that money to be spent on our rather short stock of consumers' goods.  Anyone who goes to hotels here during the summer and autumn will realise the difficulty that that means for the ordinary citizen of this country in trying to get, for his own money, some of the goods produced in his own country.  There is no difficulty about getting the money as long as the English tourist wants it, and there is <Col N="2813" /> no difficulty in letting him spend it. What happens after that is somewhat confusing.  Undoubtedly, if we allowed this £1,000,000 to flow out into the hands of the civil servants, we would have to find it for them, and it would be found in the ordinary way.  We are under a duty to give to them and there is no difficulty about finding it.</P>
    <P>What will happen with regard to the tourist money?  That is somewhat problematical.  Certainly, this is beyond all doubt: if those tourists spend £1,000,000 here, we will not get English goods to the value of that £1,000,000 this year or next year.  It will be funded, and at some time, either in the near future or in the far future, we may get something for it.  What will we get?  We will get whatever the British Government decide is the value of the £ at the time it comes to be paid.  At that particular period&mdash;the determination of that period does not lie with us, and the prospects are that it is a long way off&mdash;we will get something for whatever money has been transferred into Irish notes and which we will again transfer into English notes by presenting them to English banks, and it will be safely locked up in England until such time as the English like to unfreeze it.  I think that, in all those circumstances, until there is some explanation given as to why £1 or £1,000,000 in the hands of the Irish civil servants is clearly inflation, while in the hands of the English tourists it is not, the civil servants have an undoubted grievance.  Nobody, in fact, believes that there is any sincerity behind the plea regarding inflation.</P>
    <P>I single out the civil servants as a class apart, because there are no other people with whom we have a contract. It is a contract made under Governmental auspices.  Not merely is it a contract made under Governmental auspices, but the Head of the State, leaving all questions of contract aside, told those people: &ldquo;Prices are going to go up.  Hang on to your cost-of-living bonus.  It will be a great boon to you.&rdquo;  It is an amazing thing that in this country where we pretend to be inspired with all the Christian virtues, particularly charity and justice, the Government should be able to say <Col N="2814" /> to those people: &ldquo;We have you under our thumb.  You are the nearest people to us.  We can save £1,000,000 a year from you people, and we are going to save it, and if any of you think about walking into the courts we will see that you will not get there.&rdquo;  When theologians approached them about the immorality of their conduct, I understand that they took refuge in silence. The whole situation is so immoral and unfair that it is a source of anxiety and perturbation to clergymen in this country.</P>

      <P>The question raised by Deputy McGilligan strikes at the root of good government, or bad government as the case may be, in this country, and I hope that those Deputies who could not see their way to listen to his speech, and to the previous speeches made on this matter, will at least take advantage of the holiday period to read the official reports of what Deputy McGilligan has been putting before the House and the country in connection with this very important matter over the last 12 months.  I join with Deputy O'Sullivan in urging the Minister for Finance, on the first occasion on which he has appeared in this House in that capacity, to indicate whether his appointment means a change in the monetary policy of the Department, so far as the Department has a monetary policy.  If he can indicate that that is the case, I certainly will gladly welcome his appointment to that position at this very critical period.</P>

    <P>Deputies were furnished some months ago with a White Paper&mdash;a brown paper if you like&mdash;indicating the post-war development schemes to be carried out by the Government, and indicating quite clearly that over £100,000,000 will be spent in the post-war period, whether it is over a period of a year or five years or 15 years, in carrying out schemes such as rural electrification, housing, arterial drainage, waterworks and sewerage schemes in towns and villages where they are still badly needed.  Of serious concern to the taxpaying community are the conditions under which that money is to be provided for the Government Departments concerned and for the <Col N="2815" /> local authorities who will act as agents for the Government in the carrying out of those schemes.  I daresay the Minister for Finance, in company with his colleagues, must have given some consideration to the conditions under which the money will have to be found for the carrying out of those huge schemes.  I know of no country in the world&mdash;I may be wrong in this; the Minister will contradict me if I am&mdash;where the cost of money for carrying on Governmental administration is so high as it is in this small country of ours.  The Minister's predecessors in office, in the Fianna Fáil Government and in the Fine Gael Government, were the most generous Ministers for Finance so far as the moneylenders of this country are concerned. We were told in the Budget statement that the service of debt is costing the taxpayers about £4,000,000 annually.  We are also told&mdash;I should like to be contradicted on this also if I am wrong&mdash;that out of every £1 collected in rates 7/- has to be set aside for the payment of interest on loans sanctioned by the different Government Departments.  Surely that state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue.  We also know that whenever the farmers&mdash;and it happens very often&mdash;apply for money to the Agricultural Credit Corporation to help them to carry on their farming activities, and to develop their land to the best possible advantage, their own advantage included, they have to pay very high rates of interest for it.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to understand where the Minister for Finance and his colleagues stand in regard to this matter.  Last year, after having sought the approval of the country, the Government passed through this House an Act called the Transport Act.  The question of guaranteeing the interest on the new debentures created under that Act was discussed at a considerable length here, and the Government secured a majority&mdash;I am not sure that they did not secure the unanimous approval of the House&mdash;in fixing a rate of 3 per cent. as the guarantee which the State was prepared to give the debenture holders in case Córas Iompair Eireann failed to find the necessary <Col N="2816" /> money out of revenue.  If 3 per cent. is a fair rate of interest for the purpose of guaranteeing the new debentures, surely it should also be regarded as a reasonable rate of interest at which money could be borrowed by the local authorities, with the consent of the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance, for the carrying on of those post-war development schemes and the carrying on of any other kind of local activities for which money must be borrowed?  The average rate of interest paid by farmers who get loans from the banks or from the Agricultural Credit Corporation, and the average rate of interest paid over a period of years by the local authorities for money which they have been compelled to borrow, is in or about 5½ per cent.  That is about 2½ per cent. higher than the rate at which money can be borrowed for the same kind of activity by the British Government, as far as I can follow their activities in Great Britain. Britain has been able to borrow money or get it off the printing machines&mdash; some of it money made by the sweated labour of the people of this country&mdash; on short term loans at the rate of 17/6 per cent., or roughly 1 per cent., for the purpose of fighting a war, for the purpose of the destruction of life and property in foreign lands.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to detain the House very long.  I hope the Minister will take up more time dealing with the matter so that the tax-paying community may be informed as to the conditions under which these huge sums of money will be provided for local authorities and State departments to carry out these schemes in the post-war period.  If Deputies are entitled to get details of the various schemes, then I submit they are equally entitled to be told the conditions under which the money is to be provided for their execution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Deputy O'Sullivan in asking the Minister to tell the House what has been the result of the Ministerial consideration which was promised to be given in connection with the teachers who, in these days of high cost of living, are trying to exist on miserably small pensions.  Will he also say if any further consideration has been given to the appeals made here by Deputy Anthony, myself and other Deputies on behalf of a small number of persons who come in under the scheme for resigned and dismissed R.I.C. pensioners?  Their position is that the members of the R.I.C. who served the British Government up to the period of disbandment received pensions from the British Government <Col N="2818" /> which, I suppose, are being paid by the taxpayers of this country at a figure that was 10 per cent. in excess of the pensions provided for those who resigned in response to the call of the Republican Government in 1919.  I understand that in the middle of last year the British Government granted an increase of 30 per cent. to the R.I.C. pensioners who served that Government in this country up to the period of their disbandment, and that nothing has so far been done for the other section who served in the R.I.C. at a particular period.  They have got no increase in the miserable pensions which were given to them long after the Treaty was signed.  Has the Minister anything to say on that?  I understand that repeated representations have been made to the Department of Finance in connection with that matter by an organisation which is acting on behalf of the few hundred people concerned.</P>
    <P>I want to raise another matter which I raised previously on this Vote as well as on Budget discussions over a period of some years.  I want to know if the new Minister for Finance intends to follow the bad example set by his predecessors in retaining the means test in connection with the payment of pensions to old age pensioners and blind pensioners.  If the Minister has not had time to look into the matter since the date of his recent appointment, I hope he will take the earliest opportunity of doing so.  Will he see whether the cost of administration, so far as the application of the means test is concerned, is not, in fact, more than the actual sum that is saved by applying the means test.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of rather large issues were raised here to-day and yesterday as well as a number of <Col N="2819" /> smaller points.  Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Dillon raised the question of the sale of army lorries directly to Córas Iompair Eireann on the value assessed by a board of three independent valuers.  While Deputy Dillon was outright in his condemnation of this particular transaction, Deputy Cosgrave followed his condemnation by saying that while it might be all right in this particular instance it would be a very bad precedent.  I agree altogether with Deputy Cosgrave that it would be a very bad precedent, but in this particular case there is only a limited number of lorries available to transport the goods which require to be distributed throughout the country. In that situation, the Government deliberately decided that Córas Iompair Eireann, being the organisation responsible for the provision of public transport in all parts of the country, should be given the option of purchasing these lorries at a fair valuation, the value to be fixed by three independent valuers.  If that could have been avoided and if open competition would not have driven up the price of these lorries to an exorbitant figure, or if it would not have had the effect of having some of them stored away until the end of the emergency when petrol would be in more plentiful supply, the transaction should not have taken place in this particular fashion.  But, as there is a shortage of supplies, the Government has had on many occasions to distribute goods which are imported on the basis of need and of public interest rather than upon the basis of the sums which these goods would fetch in the open market.  I instance such imports as agricultural tractors, threshing mills and threshing engines.  They come in in very limited supplies, and I am perfectly certain that if they were put on the open market farmers who wanted tractors or threshing sets would be quite prepared to pay for them a very much higher price than the price at which they were invoiced.  The Government took the decision, and the Minister for Agriculture implemented it, that the distribution of these tractors and other agricultural machinery should be controlled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2820" /> The Minister for Agriculture asked the chairman of the county committee of agriculture in each county, the county manager, and the county agricultural instructor, to recommend to him a list of the most suitable applicants in the county to whom these tractors would be given at the fixed price of import plus the ordinary profit. Here was a case very much similar to that in which Córas Iompair Éireann was given the first option on Army lorries.  The Government in both cases was giving to the farmer who got the tractor or to Córas Iompair Éireann, a valuable option.  If the Minister for Agriculture had not the courage to withstand the criticism that had to be withstood in order to do the best thing possible for agriculture, instead of ensuring that the tractors would go to the places where they were most required and to the farmers who would do the most work with them in the production of crops for the country, he would have allowed these implements to go to the highest bidder in the open market.  Similiarly, if the Minister for Industry and Commerce had not had the courage to stand up against the criticism that he was doing something for Córas Iompair Éireann, he would not have tried to persuade the Department of Finance that, in this particular case, Córas Iompair Éireann should get the first option on these lorries.  It was in the public interest, and in the public interest alone, that these particular transactions took place in that way and it is not to be regarded as a precedent, if we are not to regard the last five or six years of emergency as a precedent to be followed to the end of the world.</P>
    <P>We hope that the emergency in regard to the supply of goods will come to an end so that open competition will settle prices as between the citizens rather than that the Government should have to step in and ration goods and fix prices.  All I can say about that is that I agree with Deputy Cosgrave that, while this transaction was in every way justified, I would not like to see it becoming a precedent as to the manner in which Government property should be disposed of.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton raised the whole question of arbitration.  He was followed <Col N="2821" /> by other Deputies.  Deputy Norton knows the history of the Government's efforts to have a scheme of arbitration acceptable to the Government accepted by the Civil Service bodies as a whole.  In 1939, negotiations were taking place between the representatives of the Minister for Finance and the Civil Service with a view to amending a scheme which had been submitted.  I have read that scheme and I do not think that the Government should be asked to go any further than they went in regard to arbitration until we see how that scheme works out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>With all the vetoes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We will take the vetoes one by one, if the Deputy will wait for it.  The scheme was first of all to have a system of negotiation between the representatives of the Minister for Finance and the Civil Service and to have negotiation machinery organised and, where that negotiation machinery failed, that the Civil Service could then approach the Minister for Finance with a view to arbitration.  First of all, I want to say that, because of the peculiar place which civil servants occupy in the life of this community, their legitimate grievances should be met by the Minister for Finance and by the Government after normal negotiations and I think that it must be said, and I will say it, after having judged the general level of salaries in the Civil Service and the general level of salaries elsewhere, that the civil servants in this country, by and large, having regard to our national economy, have been treated fairly well in the past.  That is not to say that there are not adjustments to be made. Even during the last five years of war, a number of adjustments have been made and they have been made, not as a result of arbitration, but as a result of negotiation between the representatives of the Minister for Finance and the representatives of the Civil Service organisations.  Whether or not the Civil Service as an organisation accept the scheme of arbitration put up to them, that negotiation will go on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon put the point that because the Civil Service have no right <Col N="2822" /> to strike, therefore, they should have a right to have every grievance which they have put before an independent arbitrator and the result of that arbitration put into effect automatically by the Government and, he almost went so far as to say, by the Oireachtas.  It is true that the Civil Service have no right to strike but the Government has not the same option that an outside employer would have of going out of business if he could not carry out the arbitration award and, while it is recognised that the civil servants are restricted by the fact that they have no right to strike, it must also be recognised that the Government is restricted.  The Government cannot bind itself to accept an award which might in certain circumstances have the result of bankrupting the State. There must be some limitation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Do you believe that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy.  The civil servants have no right to strike, and the Government of the country has no right to go out of business.  In the final analysis, the Government here is set up as the arbitrator, not only between various classes of the Civil Service within themselves, but between civil servants and the rest of the community.  I do not see how any Government could oblige itself to allow every question a Civil Service organisation wanted to raise, any demand for salary that they wanted to put, to go before an independent arbitrator, and bind themselves beforehand to accept such an award.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that, with the passage of time, not only will the real income of the Civil Service be improved, but that the real income of the whole country will be improved.  Over a number of years that has happened, and I say that no Minister for Finance in the future, if the national income of goods and services goes up, would hesitate to give the Civil Service and the other servants of the State their fair and due share of that national income. However, he cannot bind himself to rob the rest of the people on account of the result of an arbitration award. My advice to the Civil Service organisations <Col N="2823" /> is to accept the scheme of negotiation and arbitration put to them, knowing that the Government have decided upon it, and that no material change can be made in that scheme at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will there be any changes made in it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Even during 1939, there were certain slight amendments put into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but the amendments that have been agreed to can go through.  Deputy Dockrell raised a point about the payment of some Civil Service pensioners fortnightly instead of monthly or quarterly.  I do not know whether that is feasible or not, but it is a point I can look into later on.</P>
      <P>Deputy Martin O'Sullivan, Deputy Mulcahy and others raised the important question of the rate which should be paid for money for public schemes carried out by the Government or by local authorities.  I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan that, if possible, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health and myself and the local bodies should take time by the forelock and that, before the material becomes available for putting housing and other schemes into operation, we should get down to business and see in what way the money is to be provided and avoid at all costs various local authorities going into competition for the limited amount of savings of the general community.  It is not true to say that there are no funds available to the local authorities unless they float stock on the market. After all, there is the Local Loans Fund, from which money always has been made available to local authorities for housing, sewerage and other works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>There were some small points raised by Deputy Norton.  He asked why the engineering labourers did not get an increase in bonus during the war.  First of all, they did get the emergency bonus of 11/- a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not get the couple of rises that the Civil Service got, because they were on a consolidated rate.  They were consolidated about 1926, and for a long number of years afterwards they benefited by that consolidation.  I do not know the exact figure at which they were consolidated, but I know it went down very much between 1926 and 1933, when it hit bottom at 150 above pre-1914 war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The treatment of the Civil Service as a whole and the effect of the Government stepping in to say that their salaries were not going to rise with the cost of living is a very big question. While Deputy McGilligan wants to treat it as a particular and separate question, I do not propose to do so.  In order to judge the morality or other wise of the Government policy in relation to the stoppage of the bonus increases, you have to take into account the general policy of the Government in relation to the rest of the community.  The Government, whether wisely or wrongly&mdash;and I hold wisely&mdash; decided that, as far as we could prevent it, we would not have increased competition for a diminishing supply of goods.  It is all very well for Deputy McGilligan in his speech to throw £1,000,000 to the Civil Service.  The civil servants are only one class and they are only a very small class.  If we <Col N="2825" /> are to throw £1,000,000 to them, why do we not throw another £10,000,000 to the farmers and another £20,000,000 to the Army?  Is there to be any limit to the sums that Deputy McGilligan is going to throw around, or to the amount of purchasing power he is going to make available for a fixed quantity of goods?</P>
    <P>In times when there is a fall in prices, as we had in the years after 1929, I would like to see the amount of money being increased, so that when the goods were available they would not go to loss for the want of purchasers, but it is foolish to attempt to get out of difficulties of short supply of goods and services, or to think you are going to increase them automatically in these times by increasing the amount of money that is made available to the purchasers. While I hold very strongly that if there were more goods available than there was money with which to buy them, we should increase the amount of money, I hold equally strongly that when there is a shortage of goods we should try to keep down the amount of money.  I know there is one qualification that Deputy McGilligan would put to that. He would say: &ldquo;If that is your policy, why do you allow British inflation to come in here in the form of tourists, who inflate the purchasing power here for a limited quantity of goods?&rdquo; I would say that if we had no hope for the future, if we threw our hats at sterling being worth anything in the future, if we threw our hats at the tourist trade being of any value in the future, the right thing would be not to attempt, even though it might be an inconvenience to ourselves, to build up sterling assets.  I am not quite so certain as Deputy McGilligan appears to be that sterling assets will be of no use in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take that.  The fact of the matter is that our sterling assets in London have supplied us with £78,000,000 for the purchase of goods outside Great Britain since the beginning of the war.  The Deputy could have got those figures by studying the trade and shipping statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, if the Deputy counts up he will see that we purchased, outside Great Britain, since 1939, £78,000,000 worth of goods which had to be paid for with our sterling assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>But the sterling assets were worth something to us.  I will admit quite freely that since the war we did not get back goods from England, pound for pound in value, for the goods we sent out.  Instead of getting back the goods which we required, we were building up sterling assets in England.  I wonder when did Deputy McGilligan enter into this terrible vendetta against sterling assets?  I have no love for them. From 1932 to 1939 we were doing our best to translate sterling assets into capital goods in Ireland.  Instead of having bigger bank balances in England, we wanted bigger factories and better farming in Ireland.  Deputy McGilligan, Deputy Mulcahy, Deputy Dillon and others were going around weeping because of the disappearance of our external assets which then, as now, were largely sterling.  I would much prefer if I could, by the wave of a magic wand, to translate the £300,000,000 or £400,000,000 that we have abroad into factories, farms, improved farming machinery and better drainage here.  But we cannot do it. <Col N="2827" /> It is very late in the day for Deputy McGilligan, Deputy Dillon or Deputy Mulcahy to cry about the size of our foreign balances, seeing they were weeping so copiously about their disappearance into capital goods which came back to Ireland prior to 1939.</P>

      <P>The men went, to a certain extent.  When we came into office we did not undertake, in the period of a few years, to cure all the evils left behind by Fine Gael.  One of the worst evils was not the fact that we had not their co-operation when we were fighting the economic war, but the disastrous effects their statements had on the mentality of the people.  They were preaching through the country that we could not do anything; that the only thing the country could do was to hold on to its small external assets, to hold on to the nest egg.  That was their policy. I remember, when Deputy Mulcahy was here as Minister for Local Government, we asked him to build houses, to bring in a scheme for housing the rural workers.  What was his answer?  He said: &ldquo;We will do that, but we can do it only when prices and wages fall.&rdquo;  If we waited until prices and wages fell we would be waiting yet and we would have this situation, that instead of having 120,000 additional houses built, such as we got built between 1932 and 1939, we would have been building up bigger and better sterling assets in London.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2828" /> Deputy Mulcahy was making a calculation the last day as to what would be the result of the creation of bank credit to the extent of £600,000, and he said that if they created that credit one-third of it might go to England to buy English goods.  That is similar to what did happen.  In the years between 1932 and 1939 we ate into our sterling assets, against the Deputy's will, and, with all the criticism that he could pour out, he tried to make people believe that we were ruined because our sterling assets were being translated into building materials which were coming back here to be erected on Irish soil to house Irish people. Now he is crying about the increase in our bank balances.  I hope, when goods become freely available again, he will not be weeping if we try to translate our sterling assets in England into goods and machinery which will come back here to help to house our people, to equip our factories and produce consumable goods. I feel perfectly certain that if Deputy McGilligan is alive at that time he will start again trying to prove the disastrous consequences of the Fianna Fáil policy, one evidence of it being the disappearance of our sterling assets in England.</P>

      <P>About £500,000.  There are a certain number of pensioners who went out over a number of years and whose pensions were fixed so that the sliding portion would not go above the point at which the bonus element in their salaries stood at the date of their retirement from the service. Again, if we were to change the scheme in regard to pensions, we would have to change our whole attitude to the standstill Order and the amending Order, and I do not think that now is the time to change our step in regard to the standstill Order. The cost-of-living figure has stood pretty steady now for well over a year, and I hope the next step it will take will be downwards, and if we were to adjust the pensions of those who went out in the past, we would automatically be compelled to allow every other element in the community to compensate itself so far as it could for the increased cost of living.</P>
      <P>As I say, I believe that any such demand should be resisted at the moment.  At the end of this emergency&mdash;and by the end of the emergency I mean when goods and services become fairly freely available again, and when we can get rid of Deputy McGilligan's bitter enemy, our sterling assets, to some good account&mdash;we can and should review the various amounts which various elements in the State are drawing from the public purse.  If the country is producing or importing sufficient goods and services to increase the general standard of life, the State should try to do that, so far as possible.</P>
      <P>If it thinks it has a moral duty, as it has, to look after those in greatest need; it should look after them to the best of its ability; but it is only a crazy policy to try to do more at any particular moment than you are fit to do. The individual who pays out more than his income is going to reach bankruptcy in a certain time, and if the State pays out more than its income; it is going to create a dangerous situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were to accept Deputy McGilligan's theory and bring it to its logical conclusion, it would be quite easy <Col N="2830" /> for the State&mdash;it would be quite easy for me as Minister to do it, if the Oireachtas empowered me&mdash;to double the quantity of money in the country in the morning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Let us take it that there are two loaves available and £2 available.  The price of the loaf is £1.  If you double the quantity of money, making it £4, the price of the loaf will go to £2.  If one man has £100 a year and another man £1,000 a year, and you double the amount of money, the likelihood is that the man with £100 a year will not go to £200 and the man with £1,000 a year to over £2,000, so that the actual power of purchase is altered very much in favour of the man who was the better off at the beginning.</P>

The position with regard to raw materials and the fact that our farmers had to be induced to grow wheat did not arise by the will of the Government.  The prices of goods here went up, but if we had simply added 70 per cent. to the amount of money circulating within the country and given it freely around each year to compensate for the rising prices, the <Col N="2831" /> people who would have been compensated most were the people with large incomes at the beginning.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, that was the gist of it.  He was asking the Minister to reduce the price applied to the banks to 2 per cent., and to the ordinary individuals in the country to 3 per <Col N="2832" /> cent.  The effect of the spending of £600,000 here depends on what happens to the £600,000.  If somebody dropped £600,000 from Mars into my pocket, and if I put it into banks, it would result in the deposits in the banks being increased by £600,000.  If I spent it on importing goods from England, it would result in this country being £600,000 worth of goods better off.  As I said, it all depends on what use is made of the £600,000.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned, in justification of his present attitude, that those engineering labourers whose wages were consolidated in 1936 got advantages when the cost-of-living figure was falling, but of course he knows that the advantage they got was to work for the beggarly wage of £2 14s. a week.  That is the only advantage they got, if one could call that an advantage.  Since then, they have got an emergency bonus of 11/-, it is true, but other officers have got 11/- as well.  Could the Minister not see his way now to re-examine that matter with a view to giving the engineering workers concerned the equivalent of the bonus increase which was granted to other officers as from 1st January last?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather a coincidence that since a new Parliamentary Secretary was appointed in connection with old age pensions we find that there is an excessive means test being adopted in connection with old age pensions applications.  I will give the Minister three or four cases in which pensions have been refused on the grounds that the applicants did not comply with the statutory regulations as to means.  One man is in receipt of 10/- a week pension.  His wife is 74 years of age.  On compassionate grounds the county manager, rather than see that man in receipt of home assistance, decided to give him employment, but he found that owing to his bad sight he was unable to continue in that employment on public boards.  His wife then made a claim for old age pension, but the investigation officer decided that, on account of his 10/- a week pension and the few months' work from the public board, she was not entitled to it.  Their income for that particular year was something like £40, but for the previous year they had only £26 and 5/- home help.  Another man who was in receipt of 7/6 disablement benefit and 7/6 home assistance, was allowed only a small pension.  I could quote numerous cases in the last 12 months where, in the case of fresh applications, appeals were made to the pensions committee, and the pension officer's decision has been upheld in the Department of Local Government. At the present time Deputies are debarred from interviewing the appeals officer.  I am not making any complaints about that; the appeals officer always acted fairly whether a Deputy made representations or not.  What I am suggesting is that a circular must have been sent to the investigation officers, because in my 22 years' experience I have never previously <Col N="2835" /> known investigation officers to put as high a valuation as they are putting at the present day on the perquisites of which applicants are in receipt.  We have public bodies passing resolutions appealing to the Government to abolish this means test.  At present, people with property can transfer it to their relatives, and after two years they are entitled to draw a pension, but the poor person who receives a small amount from national health or home assistance is immediately debarred. That is reckoned as income. It was never so reckoned prior to last year when the new Parliamentary Secretary was appointed.  Since his advent this new means test has been adopted to prevent people from receiving the maximum amount which the Act allows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Was it the policy of the Revenue Department to send out special instructions last year to increase the valuation of labourers' cottages and plots?  These cottages and plots are, in some cases, let at a rent of 1/- a week.  The valuation put on them by the investigation officer is 2/6 a week. When the local pensions committees make recommendations in these cases they find that they are of very little avail, because in nine cases out of ten the decision of the investigation officer is upheld by the Department of Local Government.  Public bodies throughout the country have unanimously passed resolutions asking the Government, in view of the hardships which are being endured by the poor people in my area and other areas, to abolish this means test.  Surely, it is not fair that the investigation officer should reckon as means the 5/-, 6/-, or 7/- a week which some of these people receive in the form of home assistance. I understood that under the Act neither national health insurance nor home assistance was to be reckoned as means, and yet it is calculated as income in this figure of £39 a year.  In my own constituency, and I am sure in many other constituencies, there are many complaints in regard to the manner in which claims for old age pensions are being treated.  The means test is being applied far too <Col N="2836" /> rigidly to prevent deserving people from getting the miserable pension of 10/- a week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Deputy Everett's appeal on this question of the means test as it applies to old age pensions.  Possibly the investigation officers are governed by the regulations. I know a man who has a pension of 6/- a week.  He is the owner of a one-storey house with a valuation of about £4 a year, and by reason of that he is losing 2/- a week pension.  The pension should really be 8/- a week.  That represents a loss of £5 a year to him.  He is a single man, the last of his family.  He bought this house some years ago to have a home for himself.  He worked hard all his life, and the loss of this 2/- a week has been a big disappointment to him.  He was a man who was buyed up with the hope that when he qualified he would get the full pension of 10/-.  He is a man who was never accustomed to receive anything from Government Departments or local bodies.  I think this matter of the means test is one in which some change should be made.</P>

      <P>I want to join in the appeals made by other Deputies for the abolition of this means test.  This is a most important Vote and I think we should have a full House to discuss it.  To my mind it is more deserving of discussion than some of the matters that were discussed here during the last three days.  The old age pensioners are deserving of every consideration from the Minister and the Government, many of them being the parents of young men who fought in 1916.  This Government, like the previous Government which cut down the old age pensions, has made the great mistake of making paupers of the aged people.  In my town I find that the majority of the inmates in the county home are old age pensioners. They could not live outside on the pension.  As inmates of the county home they are allowed out of their pensions 7/- a fortnight to buy tobacco.  The Minister, instead of issuing vouchers, should give a decent pension to the old people.  A lot of money could be saved on the cost <Col N="2837" /> of paper in that way.  Give the old age pensioners £1 or 25/- a week, and do not have them going to the shops with vouchers for so many ounces of butter and so many loaves of bread.  In the shops they have to take what they are handed because they have not the ready cash.  I worked for a very decent employer, who could only give his retired workers a pension of 6/- a week since, if he gave more, the means test would be applied and the old age pension of 10/- would be cut down.</P>
      <P>We have no more deserving people than the old age pensioners.  I am receiving letters every day in the week from people in the rural parts of my constituency.  The case was brought to my notice lately of a man who, some years ago, was evicted from his farm.  His sons have now got back the farm, but the father has nothing and has been refused the old age pension.  The excise officer told me that the man's wife owns the land, and yet he will not give the old age pension to her husband.  It was recommended by the local pensions committee.  I know another case, an old woman, the wife of a road worker, who was granted a pension of only 5/- a week.  Her husband has the miserable wage of £1 19s. 6d. a week, or a 1/- a week less than the agricultural rate of wages.  I think this thing will have to be looked into.  It might be well if the money that is being spent on sending inspectors around the country to look after the stamping of eggs were applied to the benefit of these old people.  There are many old people through the country whose sons were killed in the last war.  They were granted pensions by the British Government, and now they find that the means test is being applied in their cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of one man who had a pension of 8/10 from the British Government for the loss of his son who died as a result of gas poisoning in the last war.  When that man came to the age of 70 he was told that he could be allowed only 16/- a week to live on and his old age pension was adjusted accordingly.  That is a thing that I could never understand.  The <Col N="2838" /> British Government in that case were giving this man 8/10 and the Irish Government then operated a means test in his case and deducted a corresponding amount from his old age pension.  We hear a lot about all the great things that have been done for the country.  I think the meanest thing that was ever done was to operate a means test against old people.  During the summer-time the allowance of turf is reduced.  Would it not be a good thing that they should be allowed that turf during the summer so that they might have it to supplement their winter allowance?  In the general elections of 1944 there were great rumours abroad that the old age pensioners were going to get £1 a week.</P>

      <P>You can joke all right, but it is no joke for the people outside who are trying to live on 10/- a week. If the Government want to give credit for anyone, it should be to the old people of the country.  I had a case in Kilmuckridge of a man who was in receipt of an old age pension of 3/6 a week and he did not get that pension until he was 74, whatever mistake was made.  Deputy Allen may know the man I refer to.  In the rural districts there is a further means test.  An extra half-crown is allowed in the rural districts, but every old age pensioner in the rural districts does not get that half-crown.  In Wexford, a woman who applied for the additional half-crown was refused because her son had the agricultural rate of wages.  I regard that as a very mean policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it will be the best day's work for this Dáil when it increases old age pensions.  We are told by the Minister's representative that it would cost £500,000 to increase the pensions. That would be the best spent money that this Dáil ever voted.  We are told that the emergency is over.  I wonder will there be a further reduction and will the allowances given to old age pensioners be scrapped?  I should like to see the pensions given entirely by way of cash through the post office. The country can afford money for everything and no one will grumble about giving the old age pensioners a decent stipend that they can live on. I hope the Minister will reply to my <Col N="2840" /> remarks when he is concluding the debate.  There is not a quorum in the the House at the present time although this important debate is in progress. Is that not a disgrace?  But last night and the night before we had a full House.  Because the case of the old age pensioners is now being debated Deputies do not want to listen.</P>

I think it is a disgrace to a country like this to see old age pensioners asked to exist on 10/- a week. Great play is made about the small perquisites that these people have but, as one who is in touch with the poor people week after week, I have been more than surprised to see the way they are treated in a Christian country.  There is money for everything but for the old age pensioners, the blind pensioners, widows and orphans and the sick poor.  I say we are a disgrace not only to ourselves but to the rest of the world when we see a Government like this, that came out so gloriously and told the people that if they were returned to power the poor people would never see another poor day.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support some of the views put forward by Deputy Everett.  In the first place, I think it is wrong that account should be taken of the little industry of the rural worker in a cottage in the country.  He is producing goods, occupying his time.  He has gone off the labour market and surely if he does produce something for his own needs we should not have investigation officers going around to make him account for the little that he does in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point is that if a man goes off the labour market there should not be the delay there now is in giving him the old age pension to which he is entitled.  I hope the day will come when, instead of a system of old age <Col N="2841" /> pensions, the social services will be so improved that there will be a contributory retiring allowance for every man who labours and that every man can look forward to some measure of comfort in his old age in return for the work he has given to the nation.</P>

They are not taken into account in the estimate of means, where the person is living in the house. If one of a married couple owns a farm, the income of both is combined and half is attributable to each, so that in the case of a man working on the roads and the wife on the farm, she could not be any better treated than in getting 5/- a week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the amount spent for the latest year for which there are figures?  I am raising this question because, on a couple of previous occasions, I asked why we were asked to raise a sum of £20,000 every year over a long period of years since the Government came into office, while at the same time, as far as I know, not even half that amount has been spent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1943-44, the sum asked for was £7,000 odd; in 1942-43, it was £11,000 odd, and in 1944-45, it was £20,000 and the same for 1945-46. It was explained in 1944-45, of course, that there were certain special circumstances which justified the increase from £7,700 to £20,000.  Now that the European phase of the war is over and the same circumstances and conditions do not prevail, I would like the Minister to tell us why it is necessary to estimate this year for a sum of £20,000.  Can he give the House any indication that this amount will be reduced next year or can he satisfy the House that conditions have changed so as to warrant a very substantial reduction in the amount of this Estimate?</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give any indication as to how this money has been spent within the last year, or even within the last three months?  This question of the secret service is very important, if it has been used in the way that Secret Service Votes have been used all over the world.  This is a lump sum placed at the disposal of the Government for the time being and it is a very important matter as to how it is spent.  I would like to put the same question to the Minister as the Comptroller and Auditor General would like to put&mdash; has it been spent in the interests of <Col N="2844" /> the State?  I feel that that phrase is a very loose one; we have indications that &ldquo;the interests of the State&rdquo; is confused with &ldquo;the interests of Parties&rdquo;.  Some people say that the State is represented by a peculiar unit within the country which has the exclusive right to decide what is in the State interest and what is not, and they confuse the interests of the State with the interests of a Party.  I would like an assurance from the Minister that this money has been utilised in the interests of the State and not in those of a Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to speak against the proposal to carry this Appropriation Bill for the chief reason that the Government have not so far indicated to this House that they have any appreciation of the problems which confront this country in connection with its trade and that, through lack of appreciation, they have failed to indicate or to provide any plan for meeting difficulties which, I think to the mind of everybody, except apparently those in the Government, threaten this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week I endeavoured to draw attention to one or two aspects of the <Col N="2849" /> trading situation on the international scale as I saw it, and the matter is important enough for me to return to it from a somewhat different aspect to-day.  When I did attempt to draw attention to this matter last week the mildest thing said about me from the Government Benches was that my remarks were mischievous and malicious and the other comment that flowed was that I was trying to do as much damage as possible.  I am endeavouring to do damage to self-complacency undoubtedly. I should like to rouse people to even an appreciation of what is recognised as a difficulty by most people who have looked into this matter here and which has certainly aroused considerable anxiety amongst people, friends of ours abroad, who have inquired into this matter and have written or spoken on it.</P>
    <P>Last week I called attention to the fact that a return which I got on Wednesday, 4th July, revealed a very disquieting position.  I asked, first, if any attention had been paid to that; and, secondly, what plans had been made to meet the position disclosed by the figures as displayed to me.  In the main, the item to which I want to draw attention is the last column in the reply to my question of 4th July of this year. I asked what was the balance of trade, that is to say, so far as the years other than the war years were concerned, what was the excess of imports into this country over the exports out of this country.  I find that, from 1924 to 1932, the average deficit on visible trade was something short of £16,000,000.  One finds on looking at the new series of statistical information got ready on what is described as the balance of payment that the greater part of that £16,000,000 was made up of dividends on foreign investments and some sort of remittance and pensions, and, in early days, the Sweepstake money entered into it.</P>
    <P>In any event, there is the situation that in visible trade we were down by £16,000,000; in other words, if we had to pay by exports for all the goods we require, we should in those years have had to lop off £16,000,000 from the amount we brought in.  I am starting <Col N="2850" /> off on the assumption, which may be argued against, that what we brought in was necessary to maintain a particular standard of living in this country.  I think it is regarded as axiomatic that there are only two or three ways in which people can trade overseas.</P>
    <P>You either export your own goods to the country from which you want other goods, or else you export gold if you have it, or else you draw on the reserves which you had previously accumulated.  If you are going to maintain the level of imports, and if you are importing more than the goods you export, there is no other way to meet the deficit except in those three ways&mdash;you try to increase your exports, you ship gold, or you draw on foreign investments.  It is possible of course to reduce imports.  We will see whether that is going to be attempted.</P>
    <P>We are faced with this position, that if we had not piled up an accumulation of assets on the other side we should either have had to reduce our imports by £16,000,000 in the years from 1924 to 1932, or else we should have had to increase our exports by that figure. Since the war started, it is clear from this table that the British&mdash;it is they who control the matter, and the Minister for Local Government rather rejoiced in that the other day&mdash;have put us in this position, that they have simply allowed us to get in overseas trade from themselves or other people more or less the equivalent of what we sent them.  As a matter of fact, in the last four years they have taken from us £3,000,000 of goods more than what they gave back to us either from their own stores or gave back to us by assisting us to get from foreign countries goods which they purchased for us or goods which they allowed us to purchase by cashing-in some of their own hard currencies to our benefit.</P>
    <P>The British, of course, have very much the same problem facing them. I take the calculation made by the special correspondent of the <i>London Times</i> on 2nd October, 1944.  It is an article headed: &ldquo;Making Both Ends Meet,&rdquo; with the sub-heading &ldquo;Britain's Balance of Payments after the War,&rdquo; and a further sub-heading: <Col N="2851" />&ldquo;A Problem of Readjustment&rdquo;.  After giving very good authority, this emerges from the two columns I have here.  They set out the retained imports for the years, 1936, 1937 and 1938.  They are somewhere in the neighbourhood of £900,000,000.  They show the exports which the British used to pay for those imports, and they show that they met only about half the cost of what they imported.</P>
    <P>They go on to show that the rest was made up by dividends from various investments, shipping income, and income from other services.  Then they go on to point out that instead of having, as they once had, credits, investments, to the extent of some £3,000,000,000 or £4,000,000,000 on which they drew to make up for this deficit they had now swerved entirely in the opposite direction; they now owe somewhere between £3,000,000,000 and £4,000,000,000.  It is a change from the old favourable point when they could have an unfavourable balance of visible items to the extent of some £3,000,000,000 or £4,000,000,000 in the year and finance it out of shipping or insurance or various other items.  One of the phrases they use is: &ldquo;Taking all these factors together we see a potential deterioration in Britain's balance of payments which might amount to £450,000,000.&rdquo;  The situation they find themselves in is that their volume of exports has gone down in the last couple of years to one-third the volume pre-war.  If they have to double their old time volume of exports, it means that they have to get their exports climbed up to a point six times in volume what they are exporting at the moment.  That is a considerable task&mdash;six times the volume if they get back to 1938 or 1939 prices.  If they do not, the situation varies in very much the same way&mdash; they pay a little more in the one case and get a little more in the other. They have to get a six-fold multiplication of their present trade.  We have got to find £15,000,000.  They have to find £500,000,000.  They have to get a new £500,000,000 added to the old £500,000,000 they used to export.  Our £15,000,000 is a small figure compared <Col N="2852" /> with that, but relative to our strength from the point of view of exports it is considerable.  If we take the Taoiseach's old calculation that the British Empire money power, trading power, income, everything, was in the neighbourhood of 66 to 1 as compared with us, then our £15,000,000 adds up to £990,000,000.  Therefore, relative to the British figures, we are faced with finding exports surplus to what we used to have to the extent of, in round figures, £1,000,000,000.  In actual fact, it is £15,000,000, but relative to our poor resources it amounts to that considerable figure.</P>
    <P>I have quotations here from any number of people, but I do not intend to quote more than a few of them for the purpose of verifying my argument. The British Chancellor of the Exchequer goes to various important places; he goes, say, to the Canadian Club, and he goes elsewhere.  He is applauded in England for doing something which is required in the interests of the English people when he shows them the magnitude of this task that lies before them.  He is applauded for acting as a proper Chancellor of the Exchequer ought to do.  In fact any criticism I find of him is that he has not revealed the whole situation.  If a Deputy attempts to do the same things here, he is described as malicious and mischievous, and accused of attempting to do damage to the country.  The British Chancellor of the Exchequer has gone out of his way to make speeches.  Other people have made them also.  I only want to bring their names in for the sake of showing that this is not something I have imagined.  This is something which responsible and intelligent people are saying very seriously and in a great mood of responsibility to their own people about their new situation.  I have an early quotation here from a newspaper.  It is from the Financial Editor who writes in the <i>Sunday Times.</i>  He was at one time financial editor of the <i>London Times.</i> As far back as July, 1944, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Some salutary if sombre pronouncements have been made recently concerning the tremendous burden imposed on this country by <Col N="2853" /> the war.  Lord Keynes affirmed to the Monetary Conference at Bretton Woods that the United Kingdom had been greatly impoverished while other countries had been considerably enriched at our expense&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Continuing, this responsible editor said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Bevin, employing a term rather more picturesque than precise, has bluntly declared that we are broke&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Anybody who made use of that expression here would be accused of being malicious and trying to do harm to the country.  I continue the quotation:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These pronouncements are salutary when put in contrast with the complacent and not infrequent assumption that an expanding economy after the war will take care of everything&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He points out in this article that an old-time credit balance of £3,000,000,000 had changed over at that point to an adverse balance of £3,000,000,000, and was likely to go further.  This editor goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Up to the end of 1943, £760,000,000 of private monetary capital, which should have gone into renewals and replacements of physical capital, was diverted into war production&mdash;that is to say, physical capital in this country has been run down to that extent.  £545,000,000 had, up to the same date, been dispersed in compensation for war damage, and it is certain that this was not the full tale of the loss from this cause&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Over there, it is regarded as salutary to say that the country is broke, and that a problem of such magnitude exists&mdash;that £760,000,000 which should have gone into renewals and replacements had gone into war production, and that they had piled up an amazing debt from war damage.</P>
    <P>The British Chancellor of the Exchequer, addressing the Canadian Club in London on the 3rd July this year, talked about what he described as &ldquo;the serious topics of great concern to us all&rdquo;, and said that:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2854" />&ldquo;Of all the problems that face the Chancellor of the Exchequer over the next five years or so, there is none so serious as that of the external economic position of this country. You will have realised what a strain this country has carried and for how long.  We have put in all that we have; we have gone almost to the limit of our physical and economic strength.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He said later:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have great responsibilities, a great burden to take up and we shall not flinch or waver in this task.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He went on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are going to be terribly short of dollars in the years immediately after the war for the purchase of goods and products from the North American continent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He said that &ldquo;at one time they were down, reckoning as they did in millions of pounds, to a single figure for liquid cash reserves&rdquo;&mdash;so that instead of having £3,000,000,000 they had something less than £10,000,000. He said, and I presume this is the reason why we have been unable to get any purchases here from the non-sterling countries&mdash;&ldquo;that the various countries in the sterling area would turn over to us their net dollar earnings&rdquo;. They were able to eke that out in such a way that they were able to get certain purchases from the hard currency countries.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have incurred an enormous financial indebtedness in sterling to a large number of countries.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;You will see that with overseas indebtedness several times the amount of our liquid reserves we have to be very cautious.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He then spoke about &ldquo;anxieties of fact and of event&rdquo;, and went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Because the balance of our economic power at the moment is delicate we cannot afford to push it about from both sides in the hope that after the oscillations are completed it will still be found in balance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2855" /> A few days later he spoke in this way, at an Independence Day luncheon at the Dorchester, to the United States people there:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;You will emerge from the struggle in which we are still engaged with your economic strength unimpaired.  How different is our case.  We emerge from the struggle with a gravely distorted economy, with an enormous burden of external debt and a balance of payments problem such as we have never before had to face.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have been interested to see that rumours have gained currency to the effect that we (England) have been asking for a sum of three or five or seven billion dollars.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He denied that that demand had been made, although some financial journals did not entirely accept his denial.  He went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are an essential element in the economy of Europe and of the wide area of the British Commonwealth, and the whole world will be poorer if we cannot play our part in the tasks of reconstruction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Norman Crump, financial editor of the <i>Sunday Times,</i> says that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we (England) suffer exchange stringency during the immediate post-war years we may be forced to fall back upon a semi-closed economy within the sterling area even although that would be against our wishes and would be detrimental to our standard of living.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And later, he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Our immediate duty is to state that our position and the size of our present gold and dollar reserves is only one among many relevant facts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He emphasises there the fact of letting the public know what the situation is.</P>
    <P>Mr. Schwartz, one of the foremost economists in England, writing in <i>The Observer</i> for the 24th June says, speaking about America giving Britain some aid:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2856" />&ldquo;American investment here would take the form of an official loan between the two Governments, but it is probable that the Government here (that is the Government in England) conscious of the huge outstanding obligations embodied in the still unfunded sterling balances would be chary of such a transaction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I stress that because it is quite clear that what the British intend to do is to fund all these sterling balances that have accumulated against them during the war.  It is almost a certainty they will do that if they take account of what their economists say about the necessity of funding these debts.  In the light of that I ask what the Government here are doing in connection with what the situation then must be.  Clearly we are going to be short by £15,000,000 of necessary imports.  In that situation we must do one of two things: we must produce more exports to balance that or tighten our belts by more rationing and further restrictions.</P>
    <P>Before I leave that I want to deal with the question of sterling, which has been bandied about the House a good deal.  I thought it wise to look for a definition of sterling, and I suggest this definition to the new Minister for Finance.  I saw a letter in the newspapers signed by the well-known signature of &ldquo;Bradbury&rdquo;.  The letter was headed &ldquo;Lord Bradbury's views on the £&rdquo;.  In that letter he said that he had often been asked the question: &ldquo;What is a £ sterling&rdquo;, and continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Finding my inability to answer it rather humiliating, I have addressed the same question to almost everyone I have met who I thought might know.  The best reply I have been able to get is that it is &lsquo;a promise by the chief cashier of the Bank of England to pay at some date which the British Parliament may hereafter determine whatever that Parliament in its wisdom may direct him to pay&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What we have, therefore, is a promise by the chief cashier of the Bank of England to pay out, at whatever date the British Government tell him, whatever sum the British Government tell <Col N="2857" /> him, for each £ sterling that we have accumulated.  We can have that definition of sterling while we are looking for further definition in the dictionary of what our political status is.  Yet the Government here seem to be quite satisfied that we should go on sending more goods to England than we are getting from her, and should go on piling up more promises by the chief cashier of the Bank of England to liquidate them at some unspecified date in the future.  Ordinarily one likes to know when a debt is to be met and by what means, but here we are content to go along accumulating a lot of these things, which are undated as far as the time of payment is concerned, and worse than that, not definitely filled in as far as the amount which will be paid in future liquidation of the sum or goods that we are giving.</P>
    <P>However, that is the situation we have run into.  The Minister said &ldquo;No&rdquo; to-night because he does not know the difference.  I doubt if he is so elementary in his knowledge as all that.  He wanted to know what about the time there was rather a fall in our sterling assets.  I do not remember that. People here went out of their way to build up sterling assets.  As regards sterling or international currency, it is not very long since&mdash;about the year 1943&mdash;it became quite clear to people who were trying to prospect a little bit into the future that sterling had lost its old international exchange value and that, even from the angle of Britain, payment was undoubtedly going to be deferred as far as the time of payment was concerned and that she was going to be very limited in the amount of money that would be got when the payment came to be made.</P>
    <P>After the speech I made in the Dáil last week I was handed a copy of a magazine called <i>The World Review.</i>  It is not a publication that I happen to buy.  But my attention was directed to an article in it by a well-known economist named Peter Drucker, who has written a number of books and who is one of the foremost economists writing on the other side. He is speaking in an article on <i>The Outcome of Bretton Woods Conference</i> and says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2858" />&ldquo;Even before 1939, this investment income had been shrinking; and just as an individual in such a position dips into his capital, England had been selling her overseas investments at a rapid rate.  During the present war, these overseas investments have been sold out completely; moreover, England has run up a substantial debt owed to countries which, only five years ago, were in debt to England.  Quite apart from the obligations of lend-lease themselves, England, formerly the world's creditor, now owes something like 12,000,000,000 dollars to her former debtors, especially to British India, the British Dominions and Argentina.</P>
    <P>This sum, in itself, creates quite a problem of international economics. At present, it is &lsquo;frozen&rsquo;; that is, the owners &mdash; British India, the Dominions and Argentina &mdash; can neither buy goods with it in England nor withdraw it.  These 12,000,000,000 dollars which England owes all over the world&mdash;mostly for raw materials and food delivery during the present war&mdash;are likely to become a permanent loan, very much against the wishes of the owners who need the money for the purchase of industrial goods, especially American goods.</P>
    <P>Much more important, however: England in the future will no longer have investment income with which to make good her deficit in the balance of trade.  Therefore, the £ sterling will probably be as abundant in the world of to-morrow as the dollar will be scarce.  Just as all nations will scramble to obtain dollars, so all nations will try to unload £s sterling &mdash; with the same disastrous consequences for international currency stability&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>From a magazine called <i>World Review</i>&mdash;April, 1945, issue.  The quotation is from an article by Peter Drucker on <i>The Outcome of Bretton Woods Conference,</i> page 18. That is a far cry, of course, out to America.  I pick up <i>The Statist</i>, certainly <Col N="2859" /> to be regarded as a very sobersided, orthodox journal, on the other side, and certainly not a paper to go out of its way to scare people about the value of the money which operates in England.  The first article in <i>The Statist</i> of July 7th of this year is called &ldquo;The Money Market&rdquo;, in which the editor says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is likely that there is no more urgent affair before the nation at the present juncture than a complete disclosure of its financial position <i>vis-a-vis</i> all other countries.  It is true we have been told of some of our obligations: but it is hard to resist the inference that we have been told the worst&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>He later goes on to talk about the situation in America.  I only refer to one phrase:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The conclusion is irresistible; the pressure against sterling is already very great&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Later, in a paragraph which is headed <i>Future of Sterling</i> he says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is obviously no doubt whatever that our economy, from the external point of view and disregarding war transactions, is exceedingly weak at present.  We are still receiving much more miscellaneous wealth from abroad on current account that we are sending overseas, and there is no near prospect of material improvement&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Later, he goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is well to face these facts. Whilst there is little ground for optimism, there is no need for undue pessimism&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Later, he comes to this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In attempting an assessment of the prospects of sterling thereafter, a number of sizable assumptions must be made&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Just listen to these assumptions:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It is fair to assume a complete all-round cancellation of both old and new war debts.  It is fair to assume that the net balance on Lease-Lend account will be wiped out.  It is fair to assume that our adverse sterling balances contracted for war purposes will be insulated in the <Col N="2860" /> post-war economy.  With all these assumptions we are left with a number of vital factors, of which the size of the national debt is perhaps most prominent&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>But these easy-going assumptions of the editor of <i>The Statist</i> are, that we are going to have an all-round cancellation of war debts; we are going to have the net balance on Lease-Lend wiped out and the adverse sterling balances contracted for war purposes insulated&mdash;nice term&mdash;in the post-war economy.  I think that means frozen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Internment&rdquo; is the phrase suggested to me.  It means that we are going to get no goods for them, however, for some time.  However, the main article in <i>The Statist</i>, July 7th issue, is headed &ldquo;Sterling Balances and American Aid&rdquo;.  They refer to the quotation I have given from the Chancellor of the Exchequer at the Canadian Club and they go on to say that there is one question which any and all Parties in England must face and that is:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the question of how Great Britain, committed overseas to the eventual repayment of a vast debt, and committed at home (on peril at default of social unrest, and even of social revolt) to an expensive programme of social benefits and fiscal restorations, is to regain her old fiscal poise and command, lacking which her congested industrial populations, in their scattered &lsquo;pockets&rsquo;, must come to ruin at worst and an intolerably reduced standard of living at best.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Later he says this:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Britain's financial problem must be the chief obsession of any true statesman at this time.  Unsolved, it must baulk all constructive attempts to rehabilitate the Commonwealth in the community of nations and frustrate all attempts to build that better Britain at home of which leaders of all Parties talk so much. Solved wrongly or clumsily&mdash;and most problems have a wrong as well <Col N="2861" /> as a right solution&mdash;it may so hamper the flow of international trade that Britain will, even as the chief sufferer, be compelled to bear the odium for retarded recovery or thwarted international intentions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later, he goes on to point out how this balance accumulated and how it is divided.  Éire is put down for £154,000,000.  He says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the moral plane, therefore, though intercancellation be ruled out&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>&mdash;that is supposing it to be ruled out&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;there is no pressure upon Great Britain to find her solution to this problem with feverish haste.  There is certainly no need for her to accept aid offered without invitation from the United States.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on to point out how that might lead to further complications.</P>
    <P>Then later he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It would seem that one of the first demands of the new Parliament &mdash;under whatever Government&mdash; should be for a clarification of Britain's external financial obligations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He says he wants to have these sterling balances analysed and examined</P>
    <P>&ldquo;with a view to amicable readjustment of liability according to the circumstances of the debts being contracted and the services given on a vague lend-lease basis during the six years of war.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is one suggestion.  They will treat us as if we had been in the lend-lease arrangements and that we had lent or leased these goods to the amount of £154,000,000 to England and we will have an amicable arrangement whereby they would say: &ldquo;We will pay that sometime but certainly not at the moment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later he says that a review of the sterling balances rather than a prospect of being lent or given funds to unfreeze them is surely the right approach to the attainment of this amity.</P>
    <P>Another copy of <i>The Statist</i>&mdash;the issue of June 9th&mdash;has a long, two-page <Col N="2862" /> article on &ldquo;Eire's Economy in War-Time and After.&rdquo;  They go through the facts that are certainly to be discovered from the statistical returns, if they are not actually discovered by the House, and they say this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The reinforcement of her external assets position during the war has been far from an unmixed blessing. It reflects the favourable trend in her balance of payments, itself the outcome not of domestic prosperity but of greatly inflated emigrants' remittances and the dearth of essential imports.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They give the figures I have quoted that the excess of imports over exports amounted to £13.8 millions, even in 1940 and say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Since then annual imports and exports have been on virtually a pound for pound basis, the imports last year at £28.2 million being £18,500,000 less than in 1940 despite the substantial rise in prices in the interval, while exports, registering a much smaller proportionate rise in average values, underwent a decline of £3,500,000 over the same period.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They speak about the chief increase in invisible exports being in emigrants' remittances and the income from foreign investments, the latter running in the neighbourhood of £14,000,000 a year and emigrants' remittances, which used to be £3,000,000, coming a close second at approximately £13,000,000.</P>
    <P>Speaking about the effect of the increased cost of living here on the working class, <i>The Statist</i> continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...the rise of 70 per cent. since pre-war in the cost-of-living index tells its own story of the impact of the war on the vast bulk of the community&mdash;on the working classes who have enjoyed a much smaller proportionate rise in wages than the workers in this country, where the rise in the cost-of-living index, held in check by the Exchequer disbursement of subsidies now running at about £225,000,000 per annum, has only recently been climbing above <Col N="2863" /> the 30 per cent. mark.  Still more severe must have been the impact upon the salaried classes, whose remuneration, adjusted only in minor degree to the higher cost of living, has been subject to sharply increased taxation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the present Minister for Finance has read his predecessor's Budget Statement, but he said to-day that there had been an increase in the real income of the community. The ex-Minister for Finance pointed out that the only monetary phenomenon was that there had been, in fact, a decline.  That is referred to here as a decline in the real income of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will examine that later.  I do not know what the Minister is talking about this time. Facing this problem of our great hoard, our great treasure, on the other side, these payments by the chief cashier at whatever time the British Government like to tell him to pay, and at whatever amount the British Government decide, <i>The Statist</i> goes on to say that the measure of our success in solving our problems here:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;will be largely conditioned by the extent to which accumulated sterling balances can be converted into goods and, much as Éire's assets in this country differ in the manner of their accumulation from claims built up by other creditors on the basis of grossly inflated local prices, the probable rate of their liquidation is at the moment only a matter for conjecture.  The sterling balances so held are, in essence, claims on the future production of British industry and the priority needs of a war-scarred Britain bereft of its foreign investments and faced with urgent problems of housing and industrial re-equipment, will themselves reach considerable dimensions in terms of industrial output.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tried to express that the other day, but here is <i>The Statist</i> to express it perfectly.  Do we think it likely that <Col N="2864" /> England, faced now with the situation where she was providing enormous investments, facing a new £500,000,000 extra per annum, is going to stop, for a week even, to make goods for us, to pay us back those debts?  I suggest they will pay us against new goods, and only against new goods, and that that condition will last possibly for a generation.  Here they say it is a matter of conjecture to them as to whether Britain is going to make sacrifices in producing goods in order to pay back something that this country is due. <i>The Statist</i> goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Ironically enough, Éire, as a result of a war in which she has remained neutral, has had more than ever to take sterling on trust at a time, too, when there is more sterling than ever to be taken on trust.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think I have quoted enough to indicate that it is no scaremongering here to ask that the Government should seriously consider the new situation.  I have only taken a handful of the various comments and clippings from economic journals which I might have brought in here to make this point.  I think it is sufficiently made.</P>
    <P>How are we accepting it?  It is hard to get a common line amongst the members of the Government.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health took the attitude the other day that Churchill was going to win everything through, he had won the war and was going to win the economic war, he was going to win everything, and we were putting our one-time hair shirt on Churchill.  This is the mood some of the Ministers are in.  The Taoiseach, following afterwards, seemed to admit that that was the situation, but he wanted to know plaintively what we were going to do about it.  What we are going to do depends on the view people have as to what the next five, ten or 15 years are going to bring.</P>
    <P>No matter what the difficulties of the new development may be, I doubt if anybody, who really believes that Britain is not going to give us any more trade than what we balance by exports to her, would think it a sound <Col N="2865" /> policy to continue to export surplus goods to that country and have the value packed away in sterling balances, to be paid out whenever the British Government told the chief cashier of the Bank of England to pay them out.  If one assumes that the British Government is not going to loosen up in regard to these old-time credits which are now frozen, then it would be monstrous lunacy to continue to trade except on the strictest £ to £ basis.  I do not know whether the Minister has made up his mind that that is the situation or not.  The Taoiseach says: &ldquo;What can we do about it, we must continue to do that.&rdquo; In a country with an underworked and definitely underfed people, I see no reason whatever for exporting surplus &mdash; what are called surplus &mdash; cattle, beef, bacon and eggs out of this country and across to England.  I see no reason why, if we are convinced we are not going to get anything from the British, we should not do a £ for £ business.  If that is not the situation and if the Minister has hopes that a better situation is going to develop, anyone reading <i>The Statist</i>, anyone listening to Lord Keynes, anyone listening to the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, anyone listening to Mr. Norman Crump or Mr. Schwartz, would not believe that in the next 15 years we are going to get anything from England except in exchange for the goods we send for.  If that is the situation, there is nothing to be said for the policy of continuing to send our surplus goods to England.</P>
    <P>There is a fairly big problem in the background: how is the country going to live in the next ten years?  Are we going to keep our imports at the present restricted level?  You do not get the full level merely by looking at the figures I got in answer to a question here, since these are at present inflated money values.  The volume of the trade passing from England is a very small fraction of what it used to be pre-war.  Taking even the inflated value, if the Minister believes that we are not going to get as much goods from England, no matter what we send them, and if there cannot be any reliance on their giving us goods on <Col N="2866" /> credit, then what is our policy?  Are we going to tighten our belts to the point that we will do without goods? I do not think that the Fianna Fáil policy two or three years ago would have been that, but in recent months the Minister for Finance said in his Budget speech that imports were necessary if the standard of living was to be maintained.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has said it, the Minister for Agriculture has said it; they have all claimed that they know where the exports are coming from, but there have been very little signs of them developing.  The situation now developing appears to be really one that we must have something like that.</P>
    <P>The Minister seeks to finance that by the dividends and investments we have.  I suggest that anybody who is thinking sanely cannot believe that we would be allowed to get anything in on dividends and investments in the next ten or 15 years.  What is it proposed to do?  The only really sane answer is that we must try to get our exports up to the new point.  It means getting an extra £15,000,000 of exports.  Do we know the British are going to take that?  Have we made inquiries?  Do we know, if we do give them £15,000,000 worth of goods, we will get £15,000,000 worth of goods from them in exchange?  I believe we will.  They will not give it on credit, but they may give it for new goods.  If we are going to get new goods, where is the new production?</P>
    <P>It is too late to go into the various things which have been said, but the Minister for Agriculture in Cork a couple of years ago said he saw no hope for dairy products as an export. The Minister for Local Government and Public Health has told us that we may look forward to the virtual extermination of the cattle trade.  If we are going to have the position visualised by those two Ministers, that no great value is set by our exports of dairy produce, where are we going to get the exports?  The Taoiseach the other day said that there had been an attempt made.  He did that by talking carefully of the 9 per cent. going to the United Kingdom.  One does not need <Col N="2867" /> to be a member of the Institute of Advanced Studies to know that 9 per cent. on £22,000,000 is not as good as 8 per cent. on £40,000,000, but he tried to believe it was.  As far as exports to the United Kingdom were concerned, there was an average export of about £2,000,000, which the present Government reduced to about one and a half million pounds, and as far as industrial exports are concerned there used to be an average export of £6,000,000, which the present Government brought down before the war, not even counting the war, to £3,000,000.  So we have a reduction in our exports; we have a reduction in our trade with countries other than Great Britain.  We have Great Britain obviously going to put us on a pound for pound basis.  We know we must have the imports on that basis.  We <Col N="2868" /> need new production and there is no method that this country knows of to get that new production.
