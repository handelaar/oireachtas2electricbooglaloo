      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether he is aware that the Northern Ireland Government has intimated its intention of cancelling residence permits held by citizens of Eire in Northern Ireland, and whether, in view of the fact that persons born in Northern Ireland are permitted to take up employment in Éire without the necessity of obtaining Governmental permission to do so, he will make representations with a view to permitting residents of Éire to retain their existing employment in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (The Taoiseach) Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that it is proposed to initiate legislation in the British Parliament which will empower the Government in the Six Counties to exclude men and women born in Ireland from residing in part of their own country.  It is understood that the proposed legislation will follow the lines of the temporary legislation at present in force.  That legislation was on a purely temporary basis and was enacted in 1942 by the British Parliament mainly as a matter of security on the grounds that it was imperative to control the movements of individuals to and from the Six Counties.  It is important to note that it applied not only to Irish citizens born on this side of the Border but also to those born in the Six Counties who did not happen to be resident there at a specified date. Furthermore it was retrospective in its effect.  All this was most objectionable <Col N="1184" /> to us and we made our position in regard to it clear at the time.  The proposed new legislation has all the objectionable features of the war-time enactment but it has not even the excuse of military necessity.  On the contrary, when the whole country is at peace, it is proposed to make a law which will violate the natural right of all Irishmen and women to live and work in any part of Ireland.  The Government here was not consulted in regard to this proposal and, needless to say, did not assent to it.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of great regret to me that the proposal has been brought forward.  It is based on no better principle than that on which so many European peoples are being violently displaced.  Our people keenly resent the implications of the proposal; it is an example of the expedients by which the policy of the unjust partition of the country has to be maintained.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach point out to the British Government at the earliest possible opportunity that during the past five years we have sent almost 200,000 of our people to Britain, a considerable addition to Britain's manpower resources during the war, and that, putting the matter on no higher level than the basis of gratitude, this is a most ungrateful method of reciprocating the help which Britain undoubtedly got by the fact that almost 200,000 of our citizens went to work in Britain's armament and industrial factories during the war?  Will he also take an early opportunity of pointing out to the British Government that it is most unfair that the Six-County Government should be armed with powers to deport Éire citizens from the Six Counties when there is a free right of entry by citizens of the Six Counties to take up any type of employment they desire in the Twenty-Six Counties?  Will the Taoiseach endeavour, by reliance on these and other arguments, to induce the British Government to modify the decision giving the Government of Northern Ireland powers which, if exercised, will operate very harshly on our citizens?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach make the only representation that matters, and that is that Irishmen have an inherent right to live in any part of their own country that they choose to live in without regard to any Government inside or outside this country? Will the Taoiseach repeat that representation without any of the adventitious observations about help given to Britain during the war, for I seem to remember a time when it was not popular to advocate help for Britain during the war?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is popular now to send them home.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite apart from that, they have a right to live in their own country wherever they choose to live and I ask the Taoiseach to place that on record again, if not for the benefit of Britain, for the benefit of the world.</P>

      <P>Is there not a similarity between the cases of our nationals in Northern Ireland and the cases of people here who experience delay in getting visas that have been released by the Department of Industry and Commerce to enable these people to go to England?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked a question and if it has developed into a debate it is not my fault.  Would the Taoiseach say whether it has been represented to the British Government that persons born in the Six Counties have a free right of entry to employment here and that, in view of that fact, it is <Col N="1186" /> obviously unfair that there should be any prohibition on the right of our citizens to take up employment in Britain apart from the consideration that they should be free to travel anywhere they like?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have never admitted that they were British subjects. We made it quite clear, particularly from the time of our Nationality Act, that we did not accept that position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first time the Taoiseach has said so.  I raised this matter in the House before, and I could get no information on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that Córas Iompair Éireann gave notice on 20th August last, to the trade unions affected, of its proposed withdrawal from the machinery of <Col N="1187" /> negotiation, including sectional councils, negotiating committee, the Irish Railways Wages Board and the machinery for dealing with cases of discipline, as from 1st March, 1946; that the company has not made any proposal for the setting up of alternative machinery and has given no indication that it desires the existence of any form of conciliation machinery; whether, having regard the the fact that the machinery in question has operated sucessfully for more than 21 years, during which time it prevented any official stoppage of work on the part of the employees covered by it, i.e., the conciliation and salaried grades in the whole of the Irish railway service, he will say if it is the intention of the company to leave the workers concerned with only the strike weapon as an alternative to settlement of disputes by agreement, and if this attitude has secured his concurrence or, if not, whether it is his intention, in the event of alternative machinery being established, to ensure that it will be agreed beforehand with the unions and not imposed unilaterally by the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Railway Scheme for Establishing Machinery of Negotiation was initiated in 1923 and eight railway companies and three trade unions were parties thereto.  I understand that the scheme provides that any party thereto is entitled to withdraw on giving six months' notice and that Córas Iompair Éireann notified its intention to withdraw in August last.</P>
      <P>The legal obligation of the company is to regulate the rates of pay, hours of duty, and other conditions of service of its employees in accordance with agreements made between the trade unions representative of such employees on the one part and the company on the other.  The withdrawal of the company from the Railway Scheme for Establishing Machinery of Negotiation does not affect its statutory obligation in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The method by which agreements between the company and the trade unions representative of its employees <Col N="1188" /> can best be negotiated is a matter for settlement between the company and such trade unions and if it is the opinion of the company's management that the existing railway scheme is no longer suitable for this purpose, it is not necessary for it to obtain my concurrence before withdrawing therefrom.</P>
    <P>I assume that alternative machinery for the negotiation of agreements and the settlement of disputes will be arranged by discussion between the company and the trade unions concerned. Such alternative scheme could not be imposed unilaterally by the company.  Provided, however, that the statutory obligations of the company are not affected, it is not my intention to intervene in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says he assumes that certain negotiations will be put on foot for the purpose of establishing some alternative machinery.  Will the Minister say whether that statement is based upon any consultation with the company, and whether we may assume, therefore, that some alternative type of machinery will be establish for the purpose of doing the type of work which the previous conciliation machinery did with very considerable success for a period of 21 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That assumption is based upon the knowledge that the company desire an alternative arrangement for the negotiation of agreements, but I assume also that the railway unions concerned will be as interested as the company in initiating discussions on the matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state, with regard to the Grants-in-Aid and advances made from public funds for the Irish Tourist Board, (a) the rate of interest charged to the board, and (b) the arrangements made with the board as to the repayment of principal.</P>

      <P>The Grants-in-Aid of administrative and other expenses of the Irish Tourist Board, payable under Section 15 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1939, are voted annually by the Oireachtas; they are not repayable, and, consequently, not subject to interest charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A rate of interest of 5 per cent. has been fixed under Section 17 of the Act in respect of advances to the board under Section 16 for works, investments or loans of a profit-earning character.  Section 18 of the Act provides for the repayment of advances by half-yearly instalments, the commencement date and period of repayment to be fixed by the Minister for Finance after consultation with the <Col N="1193" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce. The repayment terms for advances must necessarily be related to the character of the particular scheme for which the advances are made.  In two cases the repayment period has been fixed at 30 years, but as the schemes have not yet been completed, no date for the commencement of repayment has been specified.  In another case 25 years has been fixed as the repayment period and the 1st July, 1945, as the commencement date.  In a further case a repayment period of not more than 15 years was appointed and repayment commenced on the 1st July last.  Consideration of the terms of repayment to be fixed in the other cases has been deferred until the schemes reach a more advanced stage.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether his attention has been directed to the fact that native speakers of Irish in County Donegal regard the spelling stipulated for in <i>Litriú na Gaeilge</i>, published by the Stationery Office, as highly unsatisfactory and well calculated to react unfavourably on the language as spoken in County Donegal; and, if so, what steps he proposes to take with a view to meeting these objections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the position is as represented by the Deputy.  I have not received any information to that effect, nor has my attention been directed to any evidence which would support the Deputy's statement.  I can find no evidence in the publication mentioned by the Deputy to justify the contention that the system is well calculated to react unfavourably on the language as spoken in County Donegal.  The second part of the question does not, therefore, arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in a wide range of words which, in ordinary usage in Donegal, are tri-syllabic, the spelling advocated in <i>Litriú na Gaeilge</i> clearly indicates that they should be pronounced as words of two syllables and, if representations are made to him on behalf of competent speakers of the language in <Col N="1194" /> Donegal, will the Minister give favourable consideration to the publication of a supplement to the general rules laid down in <i>Litriú na Gaeilge</i> which might be appropriately used in the Donegal Gaeltacht?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no obstacle, of course, to any individuals or bodies who may be interested in this question making representations to me to have their objections to the new spelling considered.  I think there is some misapprehension if it is thought that Donegal has not been represented in this matter.  The committee which has examined this question, and which was responsible for the publication referred to, has had the opportunity of seeking the advice of authoritative Irish writers and scholars from Donegal. Moreover, it is accepted, as stated in the foreward to the publication, page 5, that every dialect must sacrifice something if we are to achieve the objective of having a national standardised, simplified spelling for Irish. So far as the evidence at my disposal goes, I am quite satisfied that the Donegal side of this matter has been carefully attended to and carefully examined and there is no unfairness to Donegal any more than there is to any of the other areas concerned.</P>

      <P>As regards the second part of the question, I have recently had the mail arrangements at offices on the Mallow-Waterford section examined and I am satisfied that the present services are the most satisfactory that can be afforded while the restrictions in railway transport continue.</P>

      <P>In line 29, after the word &ldquo;let&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i>&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The case for this amendment was practically made by Deputy Moran last night, and, as a matter of fact, I was wondering how he managed to make his argument at that particular stage, in view of the fact that there was a specific amendment on the point.  The case made by Deputy Moran is the case that I would make, that is, that so far as tenancy agreements are concerned every effort should be made to ensure that nothing in the nature of prohibition will be included, and that so far as temporary convenience is concerned, it should be of a <i>bona fide</i> character.  Otherwise, in the case of a shortage of houses, a landlord could insist on a tenant, taking over the premises.  The tenant, because of economic or other pressure, may take the premises, and at a later stage may find himself at the mercy of the landlord and the court, because there would be no protection in the matter of eviction, the only protection afforded being in relation to rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Moran raised this matter last night and said that, there were any number of cases in which people sought to evade the provisions of the Act by pretending that a letting was a matter of temporary convenience.  Deputy McGilligan queried that and I subsequently made inquiries.  I find that the question has been decided.  In 1925, a case was brought, and the Chief Justice held that whether a letting is for temporary convenience or not is a question of fact to be determined by the court.  It cannot be done in the way Deputy Moran suggests, and, that being the case, I do not think there is any necessity for this amendment.  If <Col N="1203" /> what Deputy Moran says were the position, I quite agree that we should see to it that that type of evasion would not be allowed, but, in view of the court decision in the matter, Deputies should be satisfied that the section is all right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understood Deputy Moran, he said that the making of agreements purporting to be for temporary convenience, whether they were or not, was quite common and that in that way there was evasion of the Act. Deputy McGilligan queried it, because he said he thought there was a decision on the point.  I made inquiries and I find that Deputy McGilligan was right. The mere statement that a letting is for temporary convenience is not sufficient. It is a question of fact to be determined by the court; in other words, the court would go into whether it was or was not a letting for temporary convenience.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asking that, in addition to the provision which enables recovery under the Housing Acts, provision should also be made for proceeding under the Public Health Acts.  As a member of a local authority, I am interested in this point.  Linked up with town planning is the procedure of taking over a number of old houses, which would probably in a short time be ready for demolition, particularly for street widening.  The Dublin Corporation has operated extensively in that direction in the last five or six years. It is obvious that street widening may not take place for a considerable period and meanwhile the local authority has property on its hands.  The procedure <Col N="1204" /> at present is restricted to activities under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, while the procedure under town planning is strictly related to the Public Health Acts.  I seek to give power to local authorities, and particularly to the Dublin Corporation, to recover under the Public Health Acts.</P>

      <P>With regard to amendment No. 105, in the name of Deputy Cosgrave, it seems to me that the amendment is outside the scope of the measure and that it applies to the Housing Acts generally.

      <P>In sub-section (1), page 22, line 45, before the word &ldquo;owing&rdquo; to insert the following words:&mdash;&ldquo;the engineer or the architect of the sanitary authority prove to the satisfaction of the court that&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asking in this amendment to allow the procedure to be vested also in the <Col N="1205" /> engineer or architect of the sanitary authority, and the reason I ask for this is that local authorities, quite naturally, have a very serious interest in the life of ordinary private property, particularly in a city like Dublin.  Cases might arise, during the operation of Part III particularly, where the tenant would be called upon to execute repairs, and these repairs might be of a very considerable character, involving a heavy financial outlay&mdash;say, a matter of £50 or more for the repair of a roof&mdash;and obviously the tenant could not undertake such an outlay.  I am linking 45 and 46 here, Sir.</P>

As I say, the sanitary authority in a city like Dublin have a very serious interest in old private houses, and the opinion of the engineer or architect of the sanitary authority would be of distinct value to the court.  For that reason, I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell us in what way it is determined what is &ldquo;tenantable repair&rdquo;? What amenities are included in that?  For instance, suppose that a landlord sets a house, the valuation of which is £36 a year, in which it might reasonably be assumed that there was a hot water supply.  If the landlord's attention is drawn to the fact that, in fact, the hot water supply is not effective at all and is merely a dummy masquerading as a hot water supply, is the tenant allowed to put in a reasonably adequate hot water supply and deduct the cost of that from the rent? Let me give another instance.  Suppose that a tenant who is ordinarily responsible for interior repairs in the house discovers that the walls of the house habitually blacken, no matter what paint or paper he puts on them: is the tenant entitled to put on the walls whatever structure will render the house water-tight and capable of being decorated, and deduct the cost of that from the rent?  While I know the Minister's difficulty in dealing with specific cases, if he cannot give the House any idea of the limitations of these words &ldquo;tenantable repair&rdquo;, can he refer us to any compendious judgment of the <Col N="1207" /> courts, or some other source, where we might get some true appreciation of the obligations we are placing upon a landlord in adopting the terms of that section?  Lastly, would the Minister say whether the form of those terms: &ldquo;that the court may order the landlord to pay to the tenant such sum as, in the opinion of the court, will be required to put the premises into good and tenantable repair&rdquo;, is new, or are those terms taken from some previous statute on which there is a case of law to be found?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That term is taken from the 1923 Act, and I am advised that the term &ldquo;tenantable repair&rdquo; is well known.  I cannot give the details, naturally, but I understand that it is a well-known expression, that cases have been decided on that term, and that the court is able to say what tenantable repair is.  Naturally, I could not go into the details here.  As the Deputy knows, it must be a court order.  The tenant cannot make the repairs, and then claim from the landlord. It must be decided by the court. Anyhow, this is taken from the 1923 Act, and the term is well known in the courts.</P>

      <P>Would Deputy O'Connor say what is the regular experience in regard to this matter?  Is there much recourse had to this section, or do tenants actually go to the courts and say: &ldquo;The walls of my house are turning black and it is necessary to have repairs done&rdquo;, and the court then orders such repairs to be carried out?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I asked the question is that I have a recollection of somebody saying to me that this section operated harshly on landlords, whose tenants left premises at or about the date the rate is struck.  To be quite frank, I cannot recollect the exact technical difficulty that arose, but I was informed by somebody whose opinion carried weight with me, that sub-section (1) placed on a landlord a liability which he had not got heretofore, and that, in many cases, it might represent very material hardship. Perhaps the Minister would make inquiries between this and the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that it was decided that a landlord was only <Col N="1209" /> entitled to relief for one period of six months during the whole term a house might be unoccupied.  What is being done now is to make it clear that the relief is for six months in every year the house would be unoccupied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <P>The object of the amendment is to <Col N="1211" /> prevent the possibility of persons trying to get outside the Act by refusing to grant any tenancy other than one for 14 years or upwards.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any necessity for the amendment.  A person who can negotiate for a 14 years' term does not require any protection under this Bill.  He may be able to get an abatement or other concession by getting a lease for over 14 years, and by paying a sum of money to the landlord may get more favourable conditions.  Generally I think the amendment is not necessary in the case of people who are in a position to make a long-term letting of that kind.  I do not think it is necessary to give the same protection there as to people who make a short-term letting.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 113:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of the section to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(&nbsp;) This section shall not be construed to prohibit or make punishable the demand or acceptance by a landlord or the offer or payment by a tenant of such sum as would be a reasonable security against waste, failure to keep covenants or conditions of the tenancy on the part of the tenant, such security not to exceed in any case 20 weeks' rent, and to be returnable to the tenant or his personal representative after the termination of the tenancy, less all or any deductions to which the landlord <Col N="1213" /> may reasonably be entitled by reason of such waste or failure aforesaid.</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to meet the case where a landlord accepts from a tenant a sum of money to be held as security for non-payment of rent or breach of covenant by the tenant.  This practice originated about 15 or 16 years ago.  Instead of asking the tenant to get somebody to sign as guarantor, the landlord asked him to put down a small sum as deposit which the landlord would hold during the tenancy.  That sum was always available to put the premises in repair when the tenant left and to pay any rent which might be due by the tenant.  It afforded considerable security to the landlord.  The section prohibits the taking of any money as premium.  It is not intended, I think, to prohibit the taking of deposits such as those with which my amendment deals but there is some doubt as to whether the section would, in fact, prohibit the taking of those deposits.  I should not like to disturb the position brought about by the section.  I appreciate that it is necessary to have some prohibition; otherwise landlords might evade the provisions of the Act by taking cash payments from the tenant and, in that way, obtain more rent than the Act allows.  If I thought that the amendment was likely to take from the strength of the section or to open the door in any way to abuses of that kind, I should withdraw it.  I suggest that the matter is one which the Minister might consider between this stage and next stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the point on which I rose to speak a moment ago. The particular point to which my attention was drawn was that referred to by Deputy O'Connor&mdash;the requirement to put down a certain sum of money as security.  In a particular case in the city, the total amount of money put down by tenants by way of deposit is in the neighbourhood of £20,000. Deputy O'Connor's case is that such deposits should be permissible from the point of view of giving certain safeguards to the landlord regarding breaches of covenant and failure to carry out the conditions of the tenancy. He thinks that the putting down of a <Col N="1214" /> deposit is equitable from that point of view.  The other side of the picture is that, while the deposit in each case may be comparatively small, the total sum deposited may be very large.  A question has been raised why such a large sum should be required from a body of tenants who receive no return by way of interest on the deposit.  The interest goes to the landlord.  In addition, there is the danger, as pointed out by Deputy O'Connor, of advantage being taken of this practice. We are not concerned merely with the restriction of increases of rent under this Bill; we are also concerned with facilitating people who require habitations in getting them.  If we leave the door open in this way, by requiring larger sums in the form of deposits, the landlord may be enabled to exercise a very wide discretionary power in the selection of tenants.  Inasmuch as the landlord has got the ordinary legal protection afforded by the agreement, he should not require this additional protection from the tenant.  The tenant has no other protection than that afforded him by the agreement.  If we do agree that such deposits or security should be permissible, the tenant should be entitled to the earnings of that money rather than the landlord.</P>

      <P>There is always the danger that, if you permit deposits of this character, having in mind some large body like the Artisans' Dwellings Company who, we may presume from their standing, act in perfectly good faith and take those deposits merely against repairs and so forth, you will open the door to individuals who will not act in good faith, who will take deposits which are really key-money and in the event of the tenant seeking his remedy under the Act and claiming the money back on the ground that it is illegal to take key money, will come into court and say: &ldquo;This is not key money; it is a deposit such as is envisaged under the O'Connor amendment and, at the end of the tenancy, we shall return this money to the <Col N="1215" /> tenant provided the repairs we have to carry out when the tenant leaves do not absorb it all.&rdquo;  What is the position of the tenant then?  The court has to decide.  There is clear authority given under this amendment to take repair-deposits.  The landlord says: &ldquo;I will give the money back the minute the tenant goes.&rdquo;  The tenant says: &ldquo;I do not intend to go; it was hard enough to get into the house.&rdquo; The landlord says: &ldquo;I hold this deposit under the O'Connor amendment and I dare anybody to interfere with it.&rdquo;  How are you going to meet that position?  If Deputy O'Connor, who has experience of these matters, found himself confronted with that situation how could he meet it?  How could he proceed to prove to the satisfaction of the court that it was not an O'Connor-amendment payment, that it was, in fact, key money?  If you are to prevent key money being given, you have to come down like a guillotine and say; &ldquo;We will not have the practice at all.&rdquo;</P>

It may be a great inconvenience, and I would perpetuate that inconvenience unless prudent and experienced people said to me that in practice it was going to give rise to the evil that I envisage.  I am afraid that it will.  I am sorry that Deputy McGilligan and other members of the House who are constantly in and out of the courts in rent cases are not here to give us the benefit of their advice, but, in the absence of reassurance on that point, I think the Minister should stand fast so that between this and the Report Stage he may have the opportunity of seeking extra advice. If he is told that there is no serious danger of abuses of that kind arising, then, of course, there is a great deal to be said for the amendment.</P>

I had in mind people like the Artisans Dwelling Company, and such bodies, who desire for a legitimate purpose to operate a system of this character and who, on submitting details to the Minister, to a Circuit Court judge or a district justice, might <i>ad hoc</i> be permitted, in respect of the properties named in their schedule of application, to operate the system.  I can imagine that in our desire to close the door against every abuse we might gravely embarrass perfectly worthy and well-intentioned bodies that have found this to be a great convenience in operating their estates equitably and justly.  Very few applications, I imagine, would be made.  I do not think it is unreasonable to reserve power to certify for such an arrangement in respect of specified properties, if necessary for a limited time.  They might be required to renew their application every seven years, so that in the meantime, if an abuse has grown up, the whole matter can be investigated when the new application comes forward, and the right withdrawn if there has been abuse.</P>

I think that it would open the door to the very abuses that Deputy O'Connor feels it is designed to prevent.  If a tenant and landlord dispute items of waste or disrepair it would appear, on the face of it, that the landlord would have the right to make a deduction, so that the tenant would have no option in the matter.</P>

      <P>He can, but you are putting the landlord in this position that he can say to the tenant that he is deducting £12 out of the £15 for <Col N="1217" /> waste or disrepair.  You immediately put the tenant in the position that he has to go to court to assert his rights. I think that a position like that, as between landlord and tenant, would be altogether inequitable, and should not be allowed to crop up under the Bill.  I think that if the Minister did consider inserting an amendment of this sort he would have to make further provision by which the tenant would be given the same right in cases where deductions were made by the landlord.  I think this amendment would leave the door open to a lot of abuses, and I suggest to the Minister that he should not consider it.</P>

      <P>I do not know a thing about the Artisans' Dwellings Company, but I do know that we have certain companies in the country that built houses to let to people with moderate incomes.  This system of making a deposit and returning it at the end of a period has worked well. If no damage is being done to the tenant who goes out of a house owing no rent, and if this has worked in practice, we ought to be slow to rush in and break up the system.  Otherwise, it will make the administration of large groups of the particular kind of houses that we want to have built more difficult.  It is for that reason that I suggest to the Minister that, while we in this House cannot possibly legislate for the exceptional case, there ought not to be any objection to leaving a discretion in the district justice, the Circuit Court judge or the Minister himself to hear an application from a particular landlord who puts the facts before him, and asks for permission to operate this machinery in respect of the property set out, at the same time putting on him an obligation to come back in seven years to get the application renewed.

      <P>Deputy Larkin put the case very clearly on behalf of tenants and with, I think, admirable restraint.  He mentioned a large sum of money.  I would like to point out to him that there is no limit to the amount of money that any company or persons engaged in building houses to rent require.  Every penny counts when you consider the cost, say, of erecting 1,000 houses.  My object in drafting the amendment was that the financial standing of the companies that have made it a practice to take these deposits should not be disturbed in any way.  These companies have built up a financial reputation that has induced the public to give them money on very favourable terms.  It was with the object of preserving that state of affairs that the amendment was drafted.  In case the section might disturb the practice of companies holding these deposits, the Minister might consider between now and Report Stage if anything could be done to validate the procedure of holding a sum of money as a deposit against failure to keep the conditions of the tenancy.  I might mention that I have never heard tenants complain of this procedure. The fact that a selected tenant for a house is ready to put down £15 as a deposit shows that he is a man of some substance, and that it is really the best recommendation he could give. If that procedure of taking deposits was not there greater hardship might be inflicted on tenants.  They might be asked to get guarantees from insurance companies in respect of which they would have to pay an annual premium.  I am withdrawing the amendment in the hope that the Minister will reconsider it.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes to confer power on the Minister for Justice to make regulations providing for the compilation of registers of controlled premises the standard or basic rents of which have been determined by the courts.  The regulations may prescribe the form of such registers and the particulars they are to contain and may also provide for their inspection by members of the public.</P>
      <P>Very complete records of cases in which standard rents have been fixed are available in the Circuit Court and it is proposed at the outset to compile a register for Dublin from these records and from such records as may be available in the District Court.  The vast majority of cases under the 1923 Act have been dealt with in the Circuit Court so that the register, when compiled, will be a pretty complete record of all standard rents fixed in Dublin. Should it be thought necessary to do so, similar registers will be prepared for other larger centres such as Cork, for example.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 117:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of the section to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3) No regulation made by the Minister under this section shall make obligatory the use of any rent book in cases where the landlord or his agent on the occasion of each payment of rent, furnishes to the tenant or his agent, a receipt or receipts signed by the landlord or his agent, identifying the premises with reasonable <Col N="1222" /> particularity, and specifying the amount of the rent paid and the period or periods covered by such receipt or receipts.</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed in aid of solicitors, estate agents and all persons who have any dealings with tenants or take rents from them.  It is quite a simple matter.  We generally find that the rent book is a complete nuisance because the tenant coming to pay the rent will come without the book and has to be given a temporary receipt. If the regulations that the Minister will make under the section are to have any effect, I am afraid it must be obligatory on landlords to supply rent books.  There have been abuses where landlords refused to give any receipt at all or gave the receipt in such a form that it could not be known what it was about.  Naturally there should be regulations to cover that kind of thing but I consider that where a proper receipt is given, such as would come from an estate agent's office or a solicitor's office, there should not then be any necessity for a rent book.  The rent book is going back and forward through the post.  It gets into a state, after a year or so, that it is almost falling to pieces and the inconvenience caused by temporary mislaying would be very great.  Whenever a solicitor gets a case of a tenant, if there is a rent book, he puts it out of action and gives the receipts according to his own procedure.  I suggest to the Minister that he might accept the amendment so that the people who do their business properly will not be obliged to give rent books when that would not suit their particular procedure or practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would urge the Minister not to accept this amendment. I have in mind probably the biggest party affected by this particular form of receipts, that is the Dublin Corporation.  Any of us who has to deal with corporation tenants has had the sad experience on numerous occasions of being handed a handful of receipts.  When the receipt is in perfect order the amount is quite clear, but when it has been in the possession of the tenant for six months or longer it becomes illegible.  It may <Col N="1223" /> be quite convenient from the point of view of landlords, especially those dealing with a large amount of property, to issue receipts and to have the counterfoils bound in a large volume, but it is very difficult and very inconvenient for tenants and any person having to deal with their case to have loose receipts as the basis of a particular case.  If the point made by Deputy O'Connor with regard to wear and tear of rent books is to be considered, it would be possible to send loose receipts and provide the tenant with a book into which the receipts could be pasted.  Deputy O'Connor knows the difficulty in looking after a couple of hundred receipts. That point might be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the point made by Deputy O'Connor, namely, to make it obligatory on the landlord to provide a rent book, should be considered.  I do not know whether the Minister has any definite ideas or not as to the form these regulations, which he is empowered to make in respect of rent books, will take, but I think it would be practicable and very useful if a standard form of rent book were devised.  There is one objectionable feature about rent books, and I do not know how we can meet it, that is the commandeering of the rent book by the landlord and replacement by an entirely different rent book with entirely different figures inserted.  It is all very well to say that the tenant should know he has legal protection against that sort of thing, but we are dealing with very many people who have no conception of their legal rights.  I have had experience of cases where the tenant was given a rent book which was completely useless from the point of view of protecting his interests.  I do not know whether or not a regulation could be made providing that the continuity of the rent books should be shown, but certainly I think there should be some standard form of rent book set out in the Minister's regulations and that it should be obligatory on the landlord to supply that book.  The cost would be very small.  It should be obligatory that the entries should be consecutive, <Col N="1224" /> properly made and legible, so that even those tenants who may not be very literate would be able to read what their commitments were and to what extent they had met their commitments.</P>

      <P>I do not know that the Minister can meet the point put up to him by Deputy O'Connor and Deputy Larkin.  The whole thing depends on the honesty of the landlord and the person collecting the rent.  Public bodies used to have books and they found they were not satisfactory.  The town clerks reverted to the practice of giving the tenant a receipt.  There must be some obligation on the tenant to look after his own business and I think it is in the interest of the tenant to keep safe the receipts he gets so that if by chance the collector goes wrong the tenant will be in a position to produce the receipts.  It is very difficult to devise any machinery to safeguard against the weakness of human nature.  As far as the question of making it obligatory upon landlords to have special standardised rent books is concerned, I do not think that would meet the situation either.  In the main it depends upon the tenant to look after his business in respect of any money he pays out, to see that he gets a proper receipt and as to whether that is an ordinary voucher or a rent book makes very little difference to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be very useful to have a rent book as Deputy Larkin has said, particularly for the poorer classes of people who find difficulty in keeping receipts together. They would also be a great help in connection with any case that would come to court.  The district justice would be able to see at a glance what the position was as he would have it in the book.  We will try to devise a standard rent book giving the name of the landlord and the agent and whether the payment was for current rent or in respect of arrears.  We are hoping to put in some short extract from the Act giving some details of the rights the tenants have under the Act.  I think there is something like that in operation in England.  That is what I had in mind.  If there are certain <Col N="1225" /> classes of tenants for whom this might not be necessary, we could suggest on the Report Stage the matter of exempting them.  Generally speaking, I think it would be desirable to have a rent book rather than a lot of receipts. I think a poor person would find it much easier to keep a rent book as he might not have a good place in which to lock up receipts.  Then, of course, there is the point to which Deputy Larkin referred that, if a Deputy or a member of the corporation is approached by a tenant, the tenant might have only one receipt, he might not have the consecutive receipts; whereas, if he had a rent book, the Deputy or member of the corporation could see at a glance what the position was.  On the whole, I think it is a good thing. I will consider if I can meet Deputy O'Connor's point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important point and possibly this experience may be of some value to the House.  Anybody living in the West of Ireland years ago had an opportunity of witnessing the operations of what was popularly known as the &ldquo;gombeen man&rdquo;, that is the dishonest shopkeeper who desired to trade on the incapacity of simple people to appreciate the importance of receipts for money paid.  I can assure the House from my experience amongst my own neighbours that the greatest safeguard simple people can have is a pass-book in which the merchant will write every item that he supplies, with the appropriate price attached to it, and on the pages of which he will inscribe the details of every payment made.  I entirely agree with the Minister that you are dealing with people who are not experienced in business matters.  While they may be very strict about asking for their receipt on the occasion of the collector's call, it is stuck in an eggcup and sometimes somebody in the house is short of a match and he makes a spill of it and lights it and the receipt is gone.  It is only a very foolish person or an improvident person who will tear a sheet out of a pass-book.  So true is that, that in my experience 95 per cent. of persons who come with a pass-book out of which leaves have been torn are dishonest.  They are trading <Col N="1226" /> their pass-book for the purpose of defrauding their creditors.  <i>In simile modo</i>, I think it is no exaggeration to say that 70 per cent. of people who have lost receipts are in good faith and have genuinely lost them.  So that, if there is an analogy between shop debts in rural Ireland and rents in poor quarters of the cities, I strongly recommend to the House the desirability of securing the issue of rent books.</P>
      <P>In that connection, I should like to make reference again to a novel to which I have referred earlier, <i>London Belongs to Me</i>, by Norman Collins. There he describes a rather interesting practice that landlords have and that is making an excessive charge for rent books.  You do find old ladies living in rooms who will lose a rent book and the landlord can say: &ldquo;You must pay half a crown for a new one&rdquo;.  That can become a great abuse if poor helpless people are required five or six times every year to pay half a crown for a rent book.  On the other hand, you have to think of the landlord's view, that, unless you make the rent book of some value, there are people so foolish that they will take no precautions to keep it intact.  That is a practice which may require to be watched.</P>
      <P>Lastly, I entirely agree with the Minister that the rent book would almost justify itself if he requires to have inscribed at the back of it or on the covers or somewhere else, certain provisions of the rent restriction code of a fundamental character designed for the protection, say, of tenement dwellers, because very often a repeated reading of a thing like that would bring home to a person something that he would be very slow to pick up no matter how often you told him.  It strengthens the simple person in the assertion of his rights when he can produce a pass-book and say: &ldquo;I have such-and-such a right; it is written there, and I insist upon having it&rdquo;. It protects people from being bluffed out of the assertion of their rights by some glib individual who is concerned to deprive them of the rights that we desire them to enjoy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For these reasons, I strongly <Col N="1227" /> advocate the use of rent books.  I have no doubt that the Minister's advisers will be able to devise an equitable scheme imposing the obligation on landlords of providing them, without asking them to provide them too often in the current year, and ensuring that excessive charges will not be made for renewals in the event of their being lost or mislaid.</P>

      <P>Before Section 59 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>No alienation, assignment, or sub-letting of the whole or part of any premises to which this Act applies shall be valid unless the written consent of the landlord or his agent thereunto lawfully authorised shall first have been obtained thereto.</P>
      <P>I propose this amendment principally in order to clear up the position regarding tenants' rights and privileges. We have it suggested that a party deriving title under a tenancy may be the tenant, but there is nothing to show clearly that a tenant is entitled to assign his tenancy, or what the position is.  I suggest to the Minister that this prohibition should go into the Bill, that it is neither right nor proper that a tenant should be allowed to assign his tenancy.  Particularly in times when there is a scarcity of premises, a tenant might be induced, for fee or reward, to assign a tenancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same applies to sub-letting.  I submit that the landlord is entitled to be consulted before sub-letting.  The <Col N="1231" /> tenants may be bringing more people into the house than it will accommodate, or anything of that nature may happen.  A landlord should be entitled at least to know who is in occupation of his premises.  This provision will not be necessary in the case of any landlord who has a properly drawn tenancy contract.  It only applies where there is no written contract but merely an ordinary letting.  I submit that the tenant should not be allowed to play about with his tenancy and that it should be assignable by him only on the death of the tenant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment appears to me to be full of difficulties for tenants of houses.  The word &ldquo;sub-letting&rdquo; coyers a lot and I would ask the Minister not to make it harder, but to make it a little easier for a tenant, where the tenant has taken in a member of his own family, which may be done for a period of sickness or unemployment.  The landlord may come along and throw a notice to quit at the mother or married daughter.  I know of a case quite recently where a daughter came over from England to have a new baby in her mother's house and the landlord fired a notice to quit at the mother for sub-letting.  I hope Deputy O'Connor does not wish to make it more difficult in a case like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who own property are fully protected and the conditions about sub-letting are severe enough.  Deputy O'Sullivan and other members of the Dublin Corporation can tell of the difficulty that arises very frequently, where a mother brings in an unemployed son, who was evicted from some other house.  The corporation agents are no different from other landlords and, though my colleagues sometimes do not agree with me, I would say that out officials come down in some cases rather harshly and tell the mother that she must put her son out, as there is to be no sub-letting of corporation cottages.  There should be some special claim for these cases of hardship and they should not be made more difficult.  We all know that there is protection at the moment and that, if a tenant goes into a landlord's <Col N="1232" /> house and tries to turn it into one or two-roomed flats, or let it unfurnished, the landlord is protected.  He has a grievance against that tenant, he can say he did not give permission to sub-let and objects to it, whereupon the tenant has to surrender.  From that point of view I would ask the Minister not to make it harder for the type of case to which I have just referred.</P>
    <P>In my position in the City of Dublin, I have come across cases every day in the week where these hardships were being inflicted on the poorer class of persons.  I do not know how the matter can be overcome.  I do not wish to approve of the idea of some speculator taking a six or seven-roomed house at £1 a week and then sub-letting it in rooms at 10/- a week. I do not hold any brief for that type of person and think it is very unfair that that should happen in a city that is so overcrowded at the moment. There are married couples going around Dublin looking for rooms. They cannot get in anywhere especially if they have one or two children. Younger people cannot get into these houses either, because the tenant says: &ldquo;Although I have two rooms vacant, my landlord will not allow me to sub-let.&rdquo;  What is the use of having these two rooms idle?  There are some thousands of people in Dublin who cannot find any place to rent. There appears to be constant influx from the country and that is aggravating the position.  Old houses are falling down at a far more rapid rate than they are being replaced at present and if you prevent sub-letting you will, as I say, aggravate the position.</P>

      <P>On the Second Reading, I raised the question on Section 51 as to whether it was intended to prohibit a tenant assigning for valuable consideration his interest in a tenancy and I was assured there was no such intention.  I presume from that statement that the Minister is not going to accept Deputy O'Connor's amendment.  I think, as framed, it is a very dangerous amendment.  It restricts the right of sale, assignment or sub-letting without the consent of the landlord, a consent which in practice would probably be refused.  As Deputy Byrne has pointed out, owing to the acute shortage of housing to-day, it would be dangerous to put any restriction on the assignment or sub-letting of a house or part of a house.  If there is any merit in Deputy O'Connor's amendment and if the Minister is inclined to consider it, I would suggest that a further addition might be made to the amendment providing that the consent of the landlord should not be unreasonably refused.  That is the formula you have in the Landlord and Tenant Act. As the amendment stands, if the landlord refuses to agree to the sub-letting it would be an end of the matter, but if you add the words &ldquo;which consent shall not be unreasonably refused&rdquo; it might be helpful.  Personally, I do not like any restriction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not a middle course between the views advanced by Deputy O'Connor and those put forward by Deputy Byrne?  I think there is a great deal in what Deputy Byrne says.  Having carried me a long part of the way with him, I felt, however, that his sympathetic soul carried him a little too far.  We who live in rural Ireland are familiar with the evils of unlimited sub-letting both in connection with labourers' cottages and under the landlord system.  Unlimited sub-letting in the days of the landlords was largely responsible for the rundale system and the production of a large number of uneconomic holdings.  Unlimited sub-letting has resulted in certain cases, where people secured possession of cottages designed to relieve unhealthy domestic surroundings and in which eventually they let in two or three other families, on their receiving five or six times the rents they themselves were paying to the local authority for such houses.  I think it is a good thing to restrict in some measure sub-letting, but there is a lot of force in Deputy Byrne's representations.  If there is a woman who has let an apartment to her married son or daughter or a blood relation who happens to be in dire stress, I do not see why we should legislate to require that mother to turn her son or daughter out of the door.  I think that Deputy O'Connor would agree that an exception might properly be made in the case of a member of the family and that we should deprive a landlord of the right to resist a temporary sub-letting to a member of the family while at the same time a landlord's consent would be required for any sub-letting to a stranger.  Any attempt on behalf of the first tenant to turn a place which was designed for one family into a lodging house for half-a-dozen families should also be resisted.  I suggest that the Minister might turn the matter over in his mind and consider whether some amendment along those lines is practicable and desirable.</P>

      <P>In connection with lettings made by the Dublin Corporation, it is only right to state <Col N="1235" /> that in the circumstances mentioned by Deputy Byrne the corporation does take a sympathetic view of all cases where, say, a head of a family has a married daughter who has fallen on evil days and the necessity arises for her to go back again to her parents' home.  In such cases, while the present position in regard to housing exists, the corporation does take a sympathetic view and there is no unnecessary harassing of such people.  So far as sub-letting is concerned a provision is made in the definition part of the Bill, in Section 2, recognising the position of a sub-tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>We all agree with Deputy O'Connor so far as that part of the amendment dealing with alienation or an assignment of a tenancy by a tenant is concerned.  After all, a landlord must have some rights.  However, when one comes to examine his amendment in the light of the experience which we, public men, have gained during the last 15 or 20 years as members of local authorities, one is forced to the conclusion that it would be highly dangerous to accept this amendment in its present form. For instance, take the case of a tenant who, perhaps owing to circumstances over which he has no control, is unable to pay the rent.  With a view to enabling him to pay the rent that tenant brings in a friend, a first cousin, a son-in-law or a stranger for that matter.  Those people may be living with the tenant for a period of anything from five to ten years.  They are in reality the tenants because they finance the payment of the rent.  The actual tenant merely goes through the formality of handing the rent over to the rent collector.  The danger of this amendment is that these people, when the real tenant dies, might be served with a notice to quit by the landlord who perhaps would be able to get a higher rent from somebody else. Whilst I have sympathy with Deputy O'Connor's point of view I think it would be highly dangerous to incorporate this amendment in the Bill.  As regards the question of houses controlled by local authorities, there is no use in blinking the fact that these <Col N="1236" /> houses are often sub-let as much as two or three times and, although it is absolutely in contravention of the conditions of the tenancy, the circumstances of the housing position are such that no public authority could in equity serve notice to quit on these people.</P>
      <P>We all know that three or four families are living in many small houses at the present time.  Those houses were built for the purpose of doing away with slum areas and creating healthy areas, but we know that, in the past three or four years, owing to circumstances over which neither the Government nor the people had any control, those new houses have been turned into veritable slums.  Of course no tenant has any right to assign his tenancy or to tamper in any way with the tenancy of a house which does not belong to him, but if the amendment were accepted in its present form I could see great hardship arising as a result in certain cases.  The sub-tenant might be put out of the house the moment the original tenant had to leave as a result of some circumstances unknown to the landlord.</P>

      <P>I do not know the conditions prevailing in country places, to which I presume Deputy Coburn is referring, but, in connection with the Dublin Corporation, Deputy Byrne has mentioned the hardship imposed on certain individuals.  Deputy O'Sullivan has told us that the corporation takes a lenient view in those cases, but I should not like to see anything done in connection with this matter which would weaken the right of the Dublin Corporation to restrict the sub-tenancies.  We in the corporation have moved those people out of insanitary dwellings, and put them into corporation houses.  There is no use in blinking the fact that if the corporation did not watch a large number of those people they would turn the corporation houses into slums, and the very purpose for which those houses were erected would be defeated. I should be very sorry to see anything done in this Act which would weaken the hand of the corporation or of landlords <Col N="1237" /> generally in this matter.  We are anxious to see the tenants get every consideration possible, but some of them require to be protected from themselves.</P>

    <Col N="1240" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I asked the Minister, in substance, why he had withdrawn from the members of the British Legion the protection which is accorded to minorities in this country by Article 40 of the Constitution, with special reference to paragraph 2 of Section 6 which says that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Laws regulating the manner in which the right of forming associations and unions and the right of free assembly may be exercised shall contain no political, religious or class discrimination.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What is that right?  That right is to combine for any lawful purpose, to assemble in public demonstration for any lawful purpose and to march peacefully, without unduly obstructing traffic, through the streets of any city or town for a lawful purpose.  Were these citizens law-abiding men?  I do not think there is anyone here who will challenge the fact that the members of that body, the British Legion, are, taken by and large, good citizens and law-abiding men, whether we agree with their political convictions or not. In any case the Minister believes that because, in the copious note I took of his replies to my supplementary questions yesterday, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I never said these men contemplated a breach of the peace.  The Deputy need not read that into my reply.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So there is common ground that they never contemplated any breach of the peace.  Now, what was their purpose? Their purpose in marching from Smithfield to the Garden of Remembrance was to commemorate their dead.  I do not think any section of the House, no matter how violently they may feel, will demur to any part of our community commemorating, with affection and with pride, comrades who are dead.  I do not deny&mdash;rather I glory in the fact&mdash;that they walked publicly to renew their faith in the ideals for which their comrades died and for which they fought and were proud to see their children fight.  I make no apology for submitting to this House the nature of that ideal, enshrined in <Col N="1241" /> glorious lines by one of them who died and who wrote these verses for his daughter on the threshold of his grave. Tom Kettle, facing a death which came upon him, wrote:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In wiser days, my darling rosebud, blown</P>
    <P>To beauty proud as was your mother's prime,</P>
    <P>In that desired, delayed, incredible time,</P>
    <P>You'll ask why I abandoned you, my own,</P>
    <P>And the dear heart that was your baby throne,</P>
    <P>To dice with death.  And oh! they'll give you rhyme</P>
    <P>And reason: some will call the thing sublime,</P>
    <P>And some decry it in a knowing tone.</P>
    <P>So here, while the mad guns curse overhead,</P>
    <P>And tired men sigh with mud for couch and floor,</P>
    <P>Know that we fools, now with the foolish dead,</P>
    <P>Died not for flag, nor king, nor emperor,</P>
    <P>But for a dream, born in a herdsman's shed,</P>
    <P>And for the secret Scripture of the poor.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Have the men who marched to glory in that ideal anything to apologise for to their fellow-countrymen?  I glory in the ideals that inspired those men.  To me the names of Redmond and Kettle are as precious as the name of any Irish patriot who ever gave his life for Ireland.  And I have a right to speak on that, for I come of people whose voices have been heard in the public life of this country, not for the last decade, but long before many of those who posture as the only patriots were heard or thought of.</P>
    <P>Let this be the acid test.  The Minister says that these men who marched had no intention of perpetrating any breach of the peace, but that the police spies in, presumably, illegal organisations, had warned him that there were persons who, in the event of these men peacefully and legitimately marching, would precipitate trouble.  I ask the House <Col N="1242" /> to pause.  If Taoiseach de Valera announced his intention of marching with the Fianna Fáil Party from Nelson's Pillar to Glasnevin lawfully and peaceably and within the terms of the protection provided by the Constitution, and ill-disposed persons announced that they intended to attack that procession and precipitate a breach of the peace, would the Minister for Justice issue, at the request of the Gárda authorities, an Order prohibiting Taoiseach de Valera from marching, or would he say to the Commissioner: &ldquo;The Taoiseach and his supporters have a right peacefully to march, and if any persons challenge that right let all the forces of the State be deployed to prevent them from successfully challenging it&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>If he would do that for the largest political organisation in this country, why will he not do it for a minority for whom the Constitution was written? Powerful majorities do not require constitutional protection.  They are able to fight their own corner.  Constitutions are written to ensure that no matter how powerful executives may become or mobs may become, the full panoply of the State will always be deployed if the fundamental rights of the most powerless sections in the whole community are challenged.</P>
    <P>Here I charge the Minister with meanness and with worse, because he says: &ldquo;I took these precautions at the instance of the Guards who feared that there was danger of a disturbance of the peace consequent upon the events that transpired outside Trinity College earlier this year.&rdquo;  Are a body of law-abiding, decent citizens to be made responsible for the act of a brat, one isolated, ignorant brat who, from the top of Trinity College, burns the National Flag?  Is it or is it not true that the Provost of Trinity College waited on the Taoiseach to express the regrets of that venerable institution for that incident?  Is it or is it not true that the Taoiseach bade the Provost to dismiss it from his mind, that his regrets were most fully accepted and it was amply understood that no precaution could invariably prevent some irresponsible and <Col N="1243" /> ignorant brat from perpetrating, solus and alone, an outrage which had been contemplated by no responsible person of the institution to which he belonged?</P>
    <P>Is this body of respectable men, who undertook to carry their flags furled lest their march might be interpreted as in any way an aggressive challenge to the prejudices of any part of our people, to be told that, because that one individual brat behaved as he did behave, all their rights under the Constitution were to be swept away, that any mob which announces its intention of preventing them from doing that which it is admitted they have a constitutional right to do will be bowed to by the State and that the orders of that mob which says: &ldquo;We will not let them do what they have a legal right to do,&rdquo; will be transmuted into a statutory prohibition?  If that is allowed to pass unchallenged, I warn this House to-day&mdash;I am long enough in politics to realise that it may be a popular thing to insult and to tyrannise over the kind of men who believe in the thing which I have sought to communicate to the House in the words of Tom Kettle, the kind of men whose comrades died for these things&mdash;that if they stand idly by while the rights of that minority are trampled in the dirt, before the brazen-throated clamour of ignorant would-be tyrants has died in the ears of those who are consoled to hear it, they will hear the tread of Nemesis, for if tyranny over one minority is protected to-day, tyranny over another minority will manifest itself to-morrow.</P>
    <P>If tyranny be once established in this country, whether it be exercised by a Party or an individual, it sets our people, on the bloody and slippery slope to civil war.  Our people will not surrender their right to be free and the measure of freedom is the right of minorities to be free.  No powerful majority need worry about its rights&mdash; it can take them, <i>vi et armis.</i>  The hallmark of freedom is when the defenceless, the weak, the little man, is as safe in the enjoyment of rights as the most powerful citizen or combination in the State.  Does Dáil Eireann now assert the right of all men in this State to be <Col N="1244" /> equal before the law, or does it accept the doctrine that if you are small, if injustice to you commands the plaudits of ignorant mobs, you ought to be trampled upon, your rights should be ignored and those who wish to oppress you should be given the sanction and approbation of the State?</P>
    <P>If that be the decision here to-day, to-morrow worse will happen, and ultimately the struggle for liberty will pass from this Chamber to another arena, and the world will have it to tell that we, the elected representatives of Irish people, proved unequal to our trust as the trustees of these liberties so dearly bought.  Freedom is either freedom for all men, or it is tyranny of the vilest kind masquerading as a whited sepulchre before the world.  I am asking for nothing but this, that there shall be equality before the law and here is the test which I submit to every Deputy.  The British Legion asked leave to walk from Smithfield to the Garden of Remembrance. A mob challenged their right and the Minister forbade them to exercise it.  If Taoiseach de Valera had proclaimed his intention of walking from Smithfield to the Phoenix Park, and a mob challenged his right, would the Minister for Justice have forbidden the Taoiseach to walk?  If to that question he answers &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, and means it, and if the country believes him, no injustice has been done; but if Fianna Fáil had the right to walk, the British Legion had the right to walk, and if the British Legion had not the right to walk, Fianna Fáil had not the right to walk.  Is it to be mob law or Irish law?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it be assumed that Deputy Dillon stands alone in this matter.  I want to say that speaking for myself and a very large section of our people who are of the opinion that the Minister was quite wrong in banning that procession, I am fearful as regards the future freedom in this country, if, on the threats of any section of our people, a body or organisation of men can be prevented from marching in procession for any object which they think is a worthy one.  On this occasion, the ban was imposed on a procession of the British Legion in Éire.  To-morrow it may be imposed on a section of the Labour Party.  Everyone knows that there is a great rift at the moment in the Labour Party and if, in the assertion of their rights and with a view to putting their position clearly before the people, one section of the Labour Party decided to have a meeting in St. Stephen's Green, and the other section, antagonistic to the views that might be expressed at that meeting, took it upon itself to object <Col N="1246" /> by innuendo, propaganda or otherwise to the holding of a meeting and that propaganda reaches the ears of the Minister, am I to understand that the Minister, acting on the basis of a supposed danger that may arise, will ban the meeting?</P>
      <P>As one who is a worker, who has been a member of a trade union and who knows what is going on in this country at the moment, I agree absolutely with every word Deputy Dillon has said.  I am an Irishman and a patriot, and one who has honoured and will continue to honour any man who dies in defence of a cause which he believes to be right.  I know that large bodies of Irishmen have met in the streets of Manchester and have marched in processional order to honour the memories of Allen, Larkin and O'Brien and that those processions were not banned by the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, there is no use in members of Fianna Fáil, or members of Clann na Talmhan or Labour, sitting here with their tongues in their cheeks.  Those are facts, and there is no man who regrets more than I do the action of the Minister in banning this procession. Those men who fought in that last Great War were Irishmen.  They proved themselves to be so, and the men who fought in this war have been good Irishmen.  There is nothing wrong with them.  Those same men would fight anywhere for the freedom of their own country and would uphold the Irish standard, no matter in what country they found themselves placed at the moment, and I do not think it was right or fair, when one considers the issues that were at stake, in regard to what took place during that war and the last war, to ban that procession.  Here, again, in view of what has come out in the papers as a result of the termination of the last war, I think it was very injudicious, to say the least of it, on the part of the Government, to ban that procession on that particular Sunday.  I agree with Deputy Dillon, especially when he refers to the fact that it may be their turn to-day and it may be ours to-morrow. Take care that there is not a great deal in what has been said by a certain man at a recent conference and <Col N="1247" /> that, when all is said and done, this country may after all become the last citadel of Fascism if we start banning processions without any just cause, but merely because of a rumour that there may or may not be a riot.  It is the Government's duty to protect the rights of the citizens of this State and to protect the rights of any section of our people, even though that section may be a small minority.  I hope and trust that when the Minister is replying he will be able to give some more sufficient and cogent reasons for his action than he gave yesterday in reply to Deputy Dillon's question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to add to what I said yesterday, but at the outset I should like, lest there should be any misapprehension, to correct what Deputy Dillon said about me&mdash;that I myself banned the parade.  I did not.  I was informed beforehand that the police proposed to ban it for the reasons that I have stated, but anyone listening to Deputy Dillon would certainly gather that we were out against those men honouring their dead.  As I pointed out yesterday, they got greater facilities this year than in past years in the matter of processions.  They were allowed to hold church parades on two Sundays this year as against one day in previous years, and they were allowed to sell poppies on the Dublin streets on two days this year as against one day in other years, and there was no restriction whatever on house-to-house sales.  If the police feel that there is likely to be a breach of the peace, they have the right to ban a procession, and that is what they did on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no more to say.  I am not capable of following the line that Deputy Dillon adopted, and there is no necessity to do so.  There is no necessity for him or anybody else to tell me that people have the right to honour their dead.  I need not be told that. Every decent man or woman everywhere will agree on that, and Deputy Dillon should not try to put me in the position that I was trying to prevent these people honouring their dead. <Col N="1248" /> Everybody in this country and, I hope, men everywhere, would be only too glad to see people coming together to honour their dead comrades; and to say that I have tried to prevent people doing that is altogether wrong.  Last year, there was no question about this matter.  Neither Deputy Dillon nor anybody else raised it.  But this year, when extra facilities were given, Deputy Dillon raises the matter.  I have no more to say.  I am quite satisfied that the Gárda were entitled, from the information they had, to fear that there was danger of a disturbance of the peace, and, in the exercise of the rights the Gárda authorities have, they prohibited that parade.</P>

      <P>If they told me that their services would be over-taxed&mdash; that there was danger of a breach of the peace which would over-tax them&mdash; I would have to agree.  If the Commissioner told me that a procession would be of such a nature as would lead to a serious breach of the peace which it might be difficult to control, why should I prevent him, even if it were a Fianna Fáil parade?  We cannot be expected to mobilise the whole Army.</P>

      <P>I do not say they are, but I do not think these resources should be mobilised at will.  The Gárda have that right and I will not interfere with it.</P>
