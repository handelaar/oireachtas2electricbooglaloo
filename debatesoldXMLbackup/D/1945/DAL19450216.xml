      <P>It is proposed to take business, as on the Order Paper, Nos. 1, 2, 4 and 5.  If and when the business on the Order Paper is completed, Private Deputies' business will be taken, as on List No. 4&mdash;item 1, resumed.</P>

      <P>By permission of the House, the Government can take Private Deputies' time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, Sir, I should like to advise the Government that we object to Private Deputies' time not being allowed at 12 o'clock to-day, and if the Government are proposing to take Private Deputies' time I expect that that will be done by means of a motion, and, in proposing such a motion, I would ask the Government to tell the House what is the reason for the urgency of the two Bills mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the reason for urgency is quite clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a motion before the House, Sir?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been formally moved yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there is no motion before the House.  If there <Col N="260" /> were, I presume that it would have been put by the Chair, if necessary, but I think that Deputy Mulcahy's attitude in this regard is unreasonable. During this Session, whole days have been devoted to Private Deputies' business&mdash;something that was never done before&mdash;and I think that in view of the manner in which the Government have gone out of their way to facilitate Private Deputies at the expense of Public Business, the various Private Deputies who have motions on the Order Paper ought to be prepared to facilitate us now.  This Bill, as the House is aware, is very urgent.  We cannot allow the present position to continue, and the law must be made clear and definite in regard to the administration of the Military Service Pensions Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Local Government Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that, in these circumstances, it would be unreasonable for Deputies to put their private motions before Public Business. So far as the Government are concerned, if they do propose to take Private Deputies' time to-day, we are quite prepared to give equivalent time next week to Private Deputies' motions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are sitting from 10.30 a.m. until 2 o'clock to-day in order to convenience other members of the House, including the Government Party.  The Military Service Pensions Bill has been under discussion now for practically two days, and there is no reason why the discussion on that Bill should not be completed by 12 o'clock to-day, considering all that has already been said upon it.  At any rate, there are several motions on the Order Paper.  We are in the middle of a discussion on housing&mdash;a motion that has been on the Order Paper, in Private Deputies' names, since before April, 1944.  As a matter of fact, I have gone back before April, 1944, in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. H.M. Dockrell Mr. H.M. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>You can go back to December, 1943.</P>

    <Col N="261" />
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, at any rate, it was on the 1944 list.  The motion coming after that was also on the Order Paper in April, 1944, and there are six other motions that have been on the Order Paper since September and, probably, earlier than that. Accordingly, I repudiate the Minister's suggestion that any Private Deputies' time has been given at any sacrifice of their own time by the Government.  If Private Deputies' time was given by the Government, I suggest that it was due to the fact that the Government had not their business ready.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that a most extraordinary principle is being urged upon us now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no agreement to sacrifice Private Deputies' time to-day, and I submit that the discussion on housing is due at 12 o'clock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>So, then, the Government's offer to give time next week is being rejected by the Deputy? As I have pointed out, the Government have endeavoured to meet the Opposition in a reasonable way, and are we now to be told that the Opposition, or, at any rate, the principal Opposition Party, are not prepared to accept that offer which, I submit, is a very reasonable one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are asking that Private Deputies' time should be taken to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Government will have to retain its prerogative in this House of ordering the business of the House.  I move that consideration of Public Business be not interrupted at 12 to-day for Private Deputies' Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion is that the consideration of Public Business be not interrupted at 12 to-day for Private Deputies' Business.  I am putting the question&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose that motion, Sir, for reasons that I propose to give.  The Government have informed us that they are going to stand over their prerogative in <Col N="262" /> ordering the business of this House. We are going to stand over the prerogative of the ordinary Deputies, with a view to seeing that those things which press on them, and which press on their people, are brought in a formal way before the attention of the House, and through the House, before the country.  In order to give themselves the chance of dealing in a fairly systematic, simple way with some of the more pressing problems of the country, the Private Deputies of the various Parties have agreed, as a kind of gentlemen's agreement, not to take more than three hours on the discussion of a Private Deputy's motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that, with the increased number of Parties, and therefore an increased number of different points of view in the House, three hours is not an adequate space of time in which to discuss some of the motions on the Order Paper, but Private Deputies have been conveniencing one another and the Government in relation to that matter so that the principal problems that are troubling the country to-day might be brought in a simple and timely way before the House.  We agree that the Government has responsibility, but I do not know how the Government Party is discharging its responsibility when it takes up the greater part of three days in discussing the Bill that is before the House&mdash; a Bill that is, to some extent, a legacy of mistakes made in the past.  If, in the line of pensions, men have to be assisted by pensions to enable them to meet their domestic and other responsibilities because of circumstances in the past, there is also implied in every one of the motions on the Order Paper that as a result of mistakes in the past there are other sections of our people who are suffering in the matter of housing, of agriculture, of poverty, and in many other ways.  In view of the general attitude that has been taken up by the Government, of, to a large extent, refusing information when they do hold a commission of inquiry on any particular matter, lying down on the findings of such commissions, and withholding the reports of these commissions from people who require that information urgently, and <Col N="263" /> when an attempt is now being made to straighten up regulations of order in the Dáil that have lasted for 20 years, so as to induce more discipline in the expression of public opinion in the House, I think that the attitude of the Government is unreasonable.  We see all these signs around us, and I think that any members of this Dáil who fail to stand by the prerogatives of Deputies in this House, and to open their minds here in a systematic way on what is troubling the House and to bring more vigorously home to the Government the urgent necessity of dealing urgently with some of the major factors of life here, and who allow their opportunities to slip, or are willing to rest on their opportunities in these matters, are false to the promises on which they were elected and have no right to put themselves forward as Parliamentary representatives in this House of the people who elected them.</P>
    <P>The motions which have been on the Order Paper for more than six months were put down in an unorganised and unsystematic way by individual Deputies or pairs of Deputies, as applying to conditions in their own constituencies, but, pieced together, they should help to drive home to the Government the general nature of the problem which requires to be dealt with&mdash;and dealt with urgently.  We were advised this morning that the Local Government Bill was to be taken to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That has not been announced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We were advised at 10.15 that it would be taken to-day.</P>

      <P>It was announced in my office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy ought, at least, to tell us who informed him that it would be taken to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was advised from my office that it would be taken to-day.  That is denied and I accept <Col N="264" /> the denial completely and withdraw the suggestion.  But urgent matters have been reported upon&mdash;matters to which we might very well have asked the Government to devote a whole day &mdash;which bear urgently on present conditions. Those matters might have been discussed in preference to much of the business which has been before the House since we assembled after Christmas.  I am resisting the proposal of the Government to-day so as to warn them that there are matters requiring to be dealt with urgently and to appeal to individual Deputies, who cannot be smothered by the Government Whip, to keep a watch on their prerogatives and to stand over their responsibilities by seeing that Parliament discusses those matters which are vital to the lives of our people, in that way doing the duty which the people sent them here to do.  Some of us want to ensure that we shall not fail in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, if I may, to deal with some of the points which have been raised.  May I remind the House of the terms of the announcement which has been made &mdash;that as soon as Government Business ordered for to-day shall have been disposed of, the House will take up Private Members' Business. Deputy Mulcahy has said that, in his view, the Bill under discussion would be disposed of by 12 noon.  If that really represents his view, what is the purpose of this opposition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be disposed of by that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Evidently the view of the Deputy and his Party is that they should have full opportunity to misrepresent the Bill, but that Private Deputies, for whom the Leader of the Opposition is so concerned, who support the Bill, should not have the opportunity to justify their vote in regard to the matter.  That is the regard which the Leader of the Opposition has for the rights of Private Deputies.  As the question of the rights of Private Deputies has been <Col N="265" /> raised, may I say that in no section of the House is there a greater number of Private Deputies than on this side&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies who are normally silent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>They are just as much concerned for their rights as the members of any other Party, but they have a sense of proportion and put the public interest and public business <Col N="266" /> first.  They recognise the urgency of the public business ordered for to-day, and I am sure that, for that reason&mdash;a very good reason&mdash;the majority of Private Deputies will support the Government in its attitude if this question is put to a vote.</P>
      <P>Question put: &ldquo;That the consideration of public business be not interrupted at 12 noon to-day for the purpose of taking Private Deputies' Business.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I concerned myself with showing that the charges that the Government was proceeding to deprive citizens of their constitutional rights or that the Government was asking the Dáil to do something which was unprecedented had not the slightest foundation.  I pointed out that if it were true that we were doing something unconstitutional it would be impossible for us to make that effective and that inevitable anything we did in that way would be null and void.  I tried to show that we were not, because this is retrospective legislation in a sense, doing something which was unprecedented and to prove that, I quoted certain Acts of this House which have been passed for the last 20 years.  I mentioned first of all the Deputy Registrar in Bankruptcy Act, 1926, the Copyright Preservation Act, 1929, and the Accidental Fires Act, 1943.  I made passing mention of the Land Act, 1926, the Land Act, 1936, the Finance Act, 1929, and the Courts of Justice Act, 1936.  That was a fair list but it was by no means, I feel certain, an exhaustive list, to show that in bringing in a measure of this sort we were not doing anything in principle which had not been done already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To-day I hope that I can equally well dispose of the suggestions which were made from the opposite benches that this was a tricky measure; that we were cheating people out of their rights; that, as Deputy McGilligan said, we were behaving scandalously. Those are terms which no honest person, looking on and knowing what was being done, would stand by. Those are expressions which could be suggested only by bitter, political partisanship, expressions which could be suggested only by the desire to make capital out of the discontent or the dissatisfaction of the people who failed to qualify under the Act to get a military service pension.  There is a large number of such people.  The Deputy, who pretends to have such <Col N="269" /> respect for the institutions of the State, who pretends to have such respect for our welfare and good order and quiet, shows his goodwill in that matter by trying to get those people to regard themselves as &ldquo;a beaten-down, defeated, tricked and cheated body of men.&rdquo;  I say that that speech convicts the person who made it, no matter how he may pretend to exhibit concern for the order and welfare of this State, of a very different intention, or at least of a recklessness in speech and of the consequences of his speech, a recklessness that could have come only from a narrow, political partisanship which threw consequences to the winds.</P>
    <P>I say I hope to-day to show that this measure is a just measure; that there is no question of denying justice to anybody; that the procedure which has been adopted, and which we are trying to validate in this Bill, has been a just procedure; that anything which has happened is something that could have happened under any procedure; and I challenge the members of the House to devise a procedure which would be better calculated to give fair play and justice.  We have been told that we should have proceeded as if this were a court of justice.  There is nothing in the Act to indicate that it was the intention of the Legislature to have the proceedings conducted as if in a court of justice.  There is nothing in the Act to indicate that&mdash;quite the contrary. Everybody knows that the procedure in a court of justice would be altogether unsuitable for the investigations that had to be conducted in this case.  We had Deputy McGilligan here last night trying to suggest that this could all be done in open court, and trying to suggest that it was, in fact, done in an open manner under the 1924 Act.  There was no truth in that.  They did not proceed as if in open court.  The procedure was in many instances the same sort of procedure that has been followed under the 1934 Act.  They were so anxious about secrecy in the matter that they did not allow the documents to be seen by anybody except by the people who were made immediately responsible <Col N="270" /> for examining them and carrying on the investigation.  In 1930 they brought in an Act in the Dáil, and kept everybody, even the officer of this House, the Auditor-General, from having access to those papers, and even retrospectively, I think, prevented anybody from having access to those papers.  Anybody who knows the circumstances knows that the procedure of the open court is not a procedure which would have been suitable for the examination that had to be carried on.  It is suggested that we should have it now.  I say it was never the intention of the House to have a procedure of that sort.  I say even that in the Act itself, taking it as a whole, and taking the meaning which has been attached to the words by the Supreme Court&mdash;there is no question of challenging that decision; their word is the last word and is the law&mdash; there is no such suggestion.  I say that, as far as the intentions of the Legislature were concerned, there is nothing in the Act to indicate that it was intended that those four men should sit and act with him as if they were a court&mdash;nothing whatever.  I say that for ten long years it was never suggested that that was the intention.</P>
    <P>It is very hard for us who were here at the time to recollect exactly what was our particular intention in that regard.  Most of us perhaps took it that the general intention we had was set forth in those words &ldquo;sit with&rdquo;. In no place is there an indication that the Referee should sit as a court. There is one phrase with reference to the advisory committee, but the duties of deciding were placed squarely on the shoulders of the Referee alone. The others were to be an advisory body to help him in the investigation which it was his duty to carry out.  For over six and a half years they worked together.  They worked together more or less as a body, consulting with each other about the cases that came along, until they had reached definite standards, standards as to the degree of service and the character of service which they would regard as qualifying service under the Act.  During those long years, they got to know each other's standards, and worked together, and in <Col N="271" /> order finally to expedite the work they divided into two parts.</P>
    <P>Now, look back and see the constitution of the advisory committee as it was at the beginning.  It was constituted in this way: two civil servants, who, naturally, would be chosen as experienced officers, who would have good knowledge of administrative work, who would know how the public interest is safeguarded in regard to finance and so on, and who would know what follows in an administrative way from Acts of Parliament, etc., and two I.R.A. officers of high standing.  We had two of each kind.  Why we chose two of each kind, and not one of each kind, I cannot say now.  It was probably thought that there would be a better discussion if there were two of each kind.  But after the two of each kind had sat together for 6½ years, they were divided up into one of each kind together.  They sat in the same room, and if one pair&mdash;the pair in each case being an I.R.A. officer and a civil servant&mdash;were doubtful in any particular case, they would go over to their colleagues, who were sitting at a table nearby, and consult with them.  That happened even after they were divided, and no case came before the Referee for his final consideration and his final judgment, on which he was to make a report, unless it had on it the signanature of the recommendation on the one hand of the pair, namely, an I.R.A. officer and a civil servant.  The suggestion that these cases have not been fairly treated and carefully examined is a suggestion without any foundation whatsoever.  The only thing that has happened is that the Supreme Court has said now, after the Act has been in operation for ten years and 60,000 cases have been considered under it, that the procedure adopted was not in accordance with the expressed words in the Act.</P>
    <P>I say that the intention of Parliament was to have these cases fairly examined.  The intention of Parliament clearly was not to have court proceedings.  The Chief Justice himself in his judgment said it was clear from the Act that court procedure was not contemplated.  The intention was <Col N="272" /> to have the cases examined by an impartial Referee, with four members to advise him, so that he might get at the facts.  I again say the procedure was a just one and we see no reason why it should be scrapped now because it was not technically correct.  We think the procedure was sound and we think that if we were planning that Act to-day we would choose the same procedure if it had been put forward by anybody as the proper procedure. We think the procedure gave substantial justice.  Of course, the Referee is only human and the advisers are only human, and their difficulties were similar to those experienced by everybody who has ever been an examiner and has had to examine candidates.</P>
    <P>Those who have experience of examining candidates know full well that if, say, 40 per cent. is fixed as the standard for passing, and if the examinations are of a certain type with a large number of candidates who fall in or around the 40 per cent. mark, there is tremendous difficulty in drawing the dividing line and deciding who is under the standard and fails and who is above it and passes.  We know that passing or failure in many examinations is a very important thing for the individuals concerned. Every examiner knows that, no matter how carefully he arranges his system of marking, he will find a number with 38, 39, 40, 41 and 42 per cent.  When he has to divide them and say: &ldquo;You have 40 per cent. and pass; you have 39 or 38 per cent. and you fail,&rdquo; what does he do?  If he is a conscientious examiner he knows full well that quite possibly his marking may not be so accurately scaled as to be able to distinguish between a mark one way or the other.  I have had to do it myself on many occasions; I have had to re-examine with care those with 38, 39, 40, 41 and 42 per cent., as I knew that my judgment and decision would have very important consequences for the people involved.</P>
    <P>It is often very difficult to make sure that those to whom you have given 39 are under the standard, those to whom you have given 40 are up to it, and those to whom you have given 41 are <Col N="273" /> over the standard.  My experience has been in regard to subjects in which it was relatively easy&mdash;difficult, but still relatively easy&mdash;to decide; since certain marks could be given to parts of a question.  Think, however, of questions like English Composition, where matters of style and personal taste may be affected.  It is perfectly certain that, if you decided the figures on the 40 per cent. standard and then passed the papers to a colleague, those which you marked just above the 40 per cent. line may be marked below it by him. Where you have to draw a line, you know perfectly well that there is a very thin difference indeed between those just above the line and those just below it.</P>
    <P>What has happened in this case is precisely the same as happens in all examinations of that type.  It can be anticipated that it will happen under any scheme of investigation for pensions that you can set up.  It was inevitable from the start that these difficulties would arise and it is not extraordinary that they have arisen. You have only human agency to rely on for the decision and so all you can expect is that the human agency will act fairly and justly, without bias and with reasonable care.  One might say there should be scrupulous care, but scrupulous care can be carried to such an extent that it defeats its whole purpose and years and years could be exhausted in examination.  We had 60,000 cases to be dealt with.  I gave 300 days as the number of working days in a year.  If you could do only one case per day&mdash;and I have spoken of a case which took three days, and which took a month afterwards before a decision could be made&mdash;it would take 200 years.  Further, if each case occupied the same length of time as the one I have mentioned, three days, it would take 600 years to go through the whole lot.</P>
    <P>We have a practical problem and there must be some limit to the scrupulousness with which it has to be faced.  There can be one examination or two examinations, but there cannot be examination after examination indefinitely.  Even if there were, it is <Col N="274" /> possible you would have one put above the line at first and put below it afterwards. This was always a practical problem.  In deciding this matter, the courts felt that they had not to consider any of these questions of public convenience or anything of that sort, or of practicability, or even of the intention of Parliament because of the fact that the words seemed unambiguous. Very well: we say that, the law being as it is, we cannot now scrap the work of ten long years&mdash;ten long years of reasonable care and effort in arriving at decisions.  During that ten years a considerable amount of public money had to be spent on the mere question of administration, the mere question of investigation.  Obviously, there must be an end to this sometime. I admit that it ought not to be regarded as ended if there are cases which could be segregated for re-examination. There again you get into difficulties.  How are you to segregate these cases?  In the case of an examiner, as I mentioned, he could take his table of marks and could see the students or candidates who got 39 per cent., those who got 40 per cent., and those who got 41 per cent. and he could examine these very carefully. He has no difficulty in making his selection.  But how are we to make a selection of these cases?  Who is to do it?  Have we any Daniel who will come and tell the Minister or tell us how it is to be done?  We have tried our hand at it and we have not been successful.  So far we have simply found that if we open the door at all inevitably we open the door for everybody. If you restrict them at all you must restrict them according to some general principle.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling amongst Deputies that the Minister for Defence could, quite arbitrarily, take these that he thinks are, or that are represented to him as being, people who were put below the line and who should have been above it, people who could be compared with others who are above it and say: &ldquo;If so-and-so is above the line, these men should be above the line.&rdquo;  Will you tell us how it is to be done?  Personally, I have struggled with the problem and, for myself anyhow, <Col N="275" /> I have not been able to find any satisfactory solution.  I am told, and I believe it to be true, that in each of the 82 brigade areas there were, on an average, from ten to 20 cases&mdash;in some cases fewer and in some cases more&mdash;and that if, on an average, we could deal with, say, ten to 20 cases in each of the 82 brigade areas our problem would be solved; that where you have people above the line and people below the line and there is a difference of opinion as to who should be above the line and who should be below, that could be solved if we could get these cases reconsidered.  Will somebody tell us by what machinery we could pick out these ten or 20 people in every brigade area whose cases should be reconsidered?  If you can do it, you will be forcing an open door so far as this Government are concerned in having these cases dealt with.  As I say, so far I have been unable to find out or to have suggested to me, though I have asked for suggestions from all Parties and I have got suggestions from a committee of Old I.R.A. men in my own Party, how the problem could be solved.  To my mind, the solutions of the problem which have been given to me are not satisfactory. We cannot put it on the Minister to select these cases.  We cannot put it on the brigade committees to select them.  The committees will naturally say that that is not their business. The Minister has no way of doing it. I do not know that the Referee has a way of doing it.</P>
    <P>We are told that it is by a too strict application of the rules and the law that this has occurred.  In other words, we are asked to loosen up a bit.  We are told not to be so careful of the law, to loosen up and to do this thing less strictly in accordance with the law and give the administration of the matter more elasticity.  I do not see how we can do that.  I do not see how the Minister can act except in accordance with the law.  I do not see how the Referee can depart from the standards which have been set up.  The Referee and the committee have examined these cases carefully.  Remember, before the final decisions were <Col N="276" /> given, the brigade committees were communicated with and given 28 days' notice of cases in which persons were held not to be qualified.  Where they reported that there was further evidence and that they wished to be heard further, these cases were held up for further consideration.  After the 28 days had expired and the result of the investigations had been notified, another 21 days were given during which objection to the decision might be offered.  There was a re-examination in a large number of these cases. Finally, there was, in accordance with the Act, the provision that, if new evidence which was not previously available became, available, there could be an appeal.</P>
    <P>I propose to deal now with the practical part of this problem.  Up to the present, I have been trying to clear away misrepresentations of the problem and of the Government's attitude. Let us now face this problem and see who is going to solve it. Deputy Norton suggested that we should have a select committee of this House.  This House can act as a select committee and have a try at it.  We will have a Committee Stage on which amendments can be put down. Deputies can tell us how it is to be done by amendment of the Act, within or without the Act.  How are we to get a selection without reopening the whole matter all over again and getting 60,000 cases re-examined?  How are we to deal with the problem of picking out those ten or 20 people in each of the 82 brigade areas whom the people who know them feel should get pensions if other people have get them?  Will Deputies tell us how to pick them out?</P>
    <P>The Referee has gone through them and he has decided that they have no case, at least that they are not up to the standard that has been set, the standard on which he was working. How is he to do it again?  He cannot pick these cases out by any process of going over them again.  Will any Deputy or any Party in the Dáil tell us how these people are to be picked out without putting the responsibility of picking them on shoulders that <Col N="277" /> cannot bear that responsibility?  Are the brigade committees to be accepted? The brigade committees through the country have been very helpful in this matter and I should like, in passing, to pay a tribute to them.  They have given a long period of devoted service in trying to help this Act to be put through.  But is it fair to put upon them the responsibility of picking out ten or 20 people in each brigade area and forwarding them to the Minister?  Will the Legislature accept the proposition that they should be entitled to do it, to send them up for re-examination?  How can we fix the number?  I told you it is not the same for every brigade area.  In some cases there may be only one or two who would deserve, in justice, to be dealt with in that way.  In another case there may be 40-50.  If you set 50 for one area how will you cut it down to ten?  By what process will you say if it is 50 in one it can only be ten in another?  It is quite obvious that whatever the number is it must be for all the brigade areas, roughly the same.  If it is 50 for one it must be 50 for each.</P>
    <P>I say we have not been able to solve that problem.  It is a problem that everybody would know would arise. Suppose you solve it, do you think that ends it?  You have drawn a new line or, at least, you have placed people differently with respect to the line. You will then have new people saying that they were wrongly treated in not having been part of the 20, 30, 40, 50 who have been sent up.  They will have a grievance.</P>
    <P>The truth is that when you are dealing with a matter of this kind, and when it is clear that a large number of applicants do not come within the class for which the Act was intended, you are going to have dissatisfaction from everybody who thinks that he ought to be included and who is not included by those who are set up to judge the matter.  You can only leave it to the judges in the long run.  There is no way out of it, as far as I can see. There was the system of final appeals which were granted only when there was additional evidence not previously available.  It is suggested that <Col N="278" /> we knock that out.  The moment you do that, what do you do?  You open up the case for everybody again.  Indeed, I think it has been suggested&mdash;and I am afraid myself&mdash;that if we are going to make any amendment in this at all it will involve a rehearing or a re-examination, not of any selected number, but of the whole lot over again. How long it would take I do not know. But, do you think, if the examination is a hurried one, if there is machinery set up to do it quickly, that in the end it is going to give final satisfaction? I do not think it will.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we would be most anxious to get a solution, even though it would not end this trouble by any means.  There is no way of ending it. We would be very glad to get a solution, if somebody can tell us how to cover these ten or 20 or 30 people in each of these brigade areas who, in common opinion in the area, should have got pensions, taking as the standard of comparison what other people who have got pensions have done.</P>
    <P>Other people tell us &ldquo;you should define what `active service' means; you should define it in an Act.&rdquo;  The trouble here was that you defined your procedure too much, apparently, when you put in &ldquo;sit with,&rdquo; because &ldquo;sit with&rdquo; has been interpreted as meaning to sit bodily and corporeally with. If you try to define &ldquo;active service,&rdquo; considering the variety and types of active service that there were from 1919 during the period covered by this Act, I can tell you that you will have a still finer El Dorado for the lawyers than was presented to them by the court decision.  The more you define procedure in a case like this in an Act of Parliament the more you make it possible for the lawyers to come to the ordinary courts and to try to get in the ordinary courts decisions on these matters for which the ordinary courts are not suited.  As I say, that is the practical point.  I, at any rate, for one, knew that that would occur.</P>
    <P>A suggestion has been made here that the granting of pensions and the Pensions Act was a political artifice here to try to induce people to be on the side of the Government.  There is no truth in it.  It would be very <Col N="279" /> short-sighted political policy that would suggest such a thing.  The history of the Pensions Act, as far as we are concerned, is this: We came in, but before we came in there was considerable dissatisfaction about the pensions that had been granted under the 1924 Act.  There were 21,000, I think, who had applied for pensions under the Act.  Some 7,000 of these applications had been disposed of administratively without ever coming to the Board of Assessors.  If we had done something like that we would hear some shouting, I think.  I think 3,000 got pensions and the remainder did not get them.  The task under the 1924 Act was relatively simple compared with the task that had to be undertaken under the 1934 Act.  One of the conditions under the 1924 Act was that the person had to be a member of the National Army.  They had their lists and their rosters, and so on &mdash;there was no such list that could be availed of in the case of the 1934 Act &mdash;but still there was dissatisfaction&mdash; wide dissatisfaction.  There was dissatisfaction not merely amongst the supporters of the Government of that day but dissatisfaction amongst the people outside, generally, that these pensions were granted.  There was a general feeling that those who had taken part in the War of Independence had gone in there for purely patriotic and quite unselfish motives and the suggestion was that it was quite wrong to have any monetary awards, or anything that could be said to be a monetary award, given for service of that sort.  That was the general state of feeling and the intention on our part was not to have pensions. But were we to allow the position to continue of discrimination?  Probably twice as many Old I.R.A. men had been against the Treaty as were for it.  Were we to allow that discrimination to continue?  How were we to level things and make them even and to end the discrimination?  There were two ways of doing it.  One was by repealing the 1924 Act and having no pensions at all.  That could be said to be the general idea of policy that was in mind for evening things&mdash; nobody to have a pension because of <Col N="280" /> service in the War of Independence. The other was to level up.</P>
    <P>We came into office and I was a very short time in office when I was approached by a deputation of those who had got pensions under the 1924 Act.  The case they put up to me was this: &ldquo;You, as a Party, have publicly indicated that it was your intention to honour the commitments of the previous Government.&rdquo;  That had occurred in connection with loans and other things of that sort.  They said to me:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Are we to be the only body in the country, the only class, who are not to come under the general terms of agreeing to carry out the commitments of the previous Government? Are the banks to get their money; are those who have contributed in various ways to get it; are the officers in the Army who have been retained in the Army to have their posts, and are we, who got these pensions partly because we were going out of the Army, to be deprived of the pension?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I felt that it would be an unjust and unfair thing for us if we were to honour the obligations of the State to the banks and to the others who had given money and otherwise helped the State at the time&mdash;to honour the commitments of the previous Government in regard to loans, and then to repeal, or dishonour, if you like, the commitments of the previous Government in regard to pensions.  It would not be just or fair or right.  Therefore, the idea of ruling all pensions out had to be put aside and the only other way was to bring in a Bill which would deal with the other sections of the I.R.A., to deal with them roughly on the same terms as the 1924 Act dealt with the others, on the terms on which the people who fought on the side of the Treaty were dealt with.</P>
    <P>That is the origin of that Pensions Act.  The intention was to do the same thing, but the task was infinitely a more difficult one.  They were able, with their procedure, with all the advantages of being only a year or two after the event, with all the advantages of having lists, to deal with these cases on an average of 3,300 a <Col N="281" /> year.  If they could do them only at the rate of 1,000 a year, how long might it be anticipated until they could deal with 50,000 or 60,000 cases? Looking ahead at the time, it was difficult to know what number was likely to apply, but you could have made a rough guess on the assumption that there would be at least twice as many.  It might not be quite accurate, but it could have been the assumption at the time that there would be twice as many Old I.R.A. men against the Treaty as in favour of it.  You could have anticipated that if there were so many thousands in the one case you would have at least 40,000 in the other case.  That would not be a bad rough guess&mdash;40,000.</P>
    <P>As regards those who had been refused pensions under the 1924 Act, there was an even chance that half of them could apply again because, so far as I know, they were not excluded under the 1934 Act.  You might have guessed about 50,000 and, looking ahead at that time, it is not difficult to estimate that if you could deal with 3,300 a year, it would take about 15 years before you could hope to go through the mass of applications presented under the 1934 Act.  The procedure which had to be contemplated was a procedure which would have to cope with that work in a reasonable time&mdash;truly, an immense mass of work.</P>
    <P>I say that has been done now and we are in this position, that we have to scrap it all unless we bring in a Bill like this.  I say this Bill is necessary. It was suggested on the opposite benches that it is not necessary and that we should leave things as they are.  I have no doubt the legal profession would be very glad to leave the position as it is.  But it is not our business to provide an El Dorado for the legal profession at the expense of the taxpayer.  These cases up to the present have cost something like £5,000.  Every one of the 60,000 applicants can go to the courts at the State's expense and get the order of the Referee quashed, and he will have then, if he wants to avail of it, the right of being heard by the Referee and the advisory committee as if it was a court and he can have all the procedure <Col N="282" /> of a court with all the delays that it would involve.</P>
    <P>Is there any Deputy here who thinks that it is right to leave the situation like that?  It has been said that we need not worry about the 11,000 who are getting pensions under the Act&mdash; who have been awarded pensions&mdash;and that they can go on receiving pensions and we can continue paying out the money to them.  I wonder is that a just or a fair thing to do, the law being as it is?  Have we not been told by the courts that the procedure under which they got these pensions was not in accordance with the law?  Is the Minister for Finance to continue paying State money while the position is that this money is being paid out on awards which have been arrived at by a procedure which the courts have declared is not in accordance with the law?  In other words, is the Minister to continue to act arbitrarily and practically in an unlawful manner?</P>
    <P>I know the lawyers will tell me these pensions have not been voided.  My answer is they have not been voided, but every one of them is voidable and we do not want to continue in the position in which we can be represented as paying out money on awards which have not been strictly based on the terms of the legislation passed by Parliament, nor do we want to be in a position in which we will pay out money on cases every one of which is voidable.  We want to change that position.  Even for the purpose of paying these moneys there is a necessity for this Bill.  Deputy McGilligan says: &ldquo;All right, bring in a Bill and we will all support you.  Bring in a Bill legalising all these payments and we will all support you.&rdquo;  That is very fine for those who are getting pensions, but what about the people who are not?  What of the people about whom all this complaint is being made?  Is that going to help them?</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan's cure is to let them come up and it is estimated by some Deputy that there will be a small number.  Everybody can have his opinion about the number, but we have to face the fact that any one of <Col N="283" /> the 60,000 applicants can bring a case forward.  Even those who have got pensions could bring a case up again and say: &ldquo;I did not get the rank that should have been given me.&rdquo;  I did not mention it so far, but I might have, that this question of rank is also a matter of tremendous difficulty.  It is the same as the case that occurs with an examiner who has Pass and Honours.  If he has 40 per cent. as the Pass mark he has difficulties, and if he has 70 per cent. as the Honours mark he again has difficulties.  He has to examine with great care his 69 and 70 and 71 in the same way as he has to examine his 39, 40 and 41.  If you have five standards in your percentages you will have to consider that in respect of every line you draw.  You will have the same difficulty.</P>
    <P>Are we to leave the position then that every applicant, whether he has or has not a pension, can go to the courts, get an order at the expense of the State, and compel a hearing of his case in the manner in which, it is held by the courts, is prescribed by the 1934 Act?  I say it would be unreasonable and it would be wrong to leave the position like that.  I say it is necessary to have a Bill like this in order to validate the awards that have been made in regard to pensions and to validate the whole procedure&mdash; unless it is all to be scrapped&mdash;that has been adopted since the investigation began.</P>
    <P>This, I again want to stress, is a matter of procedure alone.  No Deputy here and nobody outside has said that the procedure was one calculated to cause injustice.  He may have quarrelled with the award, but he does not quarrel with the method, and he could not quarrel with it as a general method of trying to secure a fair investigation of these cases.  But we are faced with the difficulty that there is a line above and below which are certain cases.  The distance between the line and some of the cases above and below is not very great.  You draw your line, and inevitably there are some cases close to it below and some close to it above, and there is no human agency which can provide <Col N="284" /> absolutely for all the cases and say: &ldquo;Yes, without a shadow of a doubt, those above it should be above it and those below it should be below it.&rdquo; We ought, however, to do our best, within our human limitations, to secure a solution.</P>
    <P>I have been anxious for it, and I ask the different Parties and the different members to help us, but I say that the proposal that we should not give the Bill a Second Reading but should refer it to a special committee is no solution.  We have been too long struggling and know <i>a priori</i> the difficulties.  We know too well that there is an insoluble difficulty at a certain point, and we have no faith whatever that any coming together of members of the Parties here will provide a solution which, on the one hand, will be fair, and on the other, will command public respect.  We must have public respect for this if we do not want it said that &ldquo;the Government gave a pension to so-and-so and did not give it to somebody else.&rdquo;  The Government is not doing anything of the sort.  The Government's responsibility began, in the main, when it had the Act passed and set up the machinery.  Very limited powers are given to the Minister and I think it right that that should be so.  We must have some system by which it will not be left to the arbitrary will of the Minister or of a brigade committee to choose.  We must try to get some solution by which a system will be devised under which it can be done.</P>
    <P>The only way that I can see is to let them all be re-examined, and how long will that take?  When it is done, if it be done, is there any guarantee that that re-examination would not leave us in very much the same position as to-day?  What guarantee have we that, if we have a re-examination of the six, ten or 20 cases in a brigade area, they will not find themselves on the wrong side again?  Is there any guarantee that there would be greater satisfaction when the whole re-examination was through?  I do not think there is.  I think we have arrived at the time, or are very near it, when we must decide that, as <Col N="285" /> human beings, with all the limitations of human nature, in relation to an extremely difficulty question, we have reached pretty well a final stage.  We must face that some time and I think we ought to make up our minds to face it now.  Certainly I would urge the Government to face it now, unless during this period in which this question will be under close examination in committee some Party or some individual is able to come as a Daniel amongst us, and give us a solution which will be fair and just.</P>
    <P>I would welcome such a solution and the Government would welcome such a solution, but if that solution cannot be found, for goodness' sake let us not take refuse in the pretence that the Government is acting unfairly or unjustly and let us not say that we are tricking, cheating or kicking out those who did not get a pension, as Deputy O'Higgins has said.  Let us have some decency anyhow in public life in relation to a matter of this kind. Everybody knows that there were very many more than 60,000 people who did very loyal work in different capacities in that fight for independence.  We did not set out to reward or to give recognition to these services because we could not.  The wider you go, the more difficult becomes your problem. If you have a small circle with a number of points within and without, a certain number of the points will be near the circumference inside and outside. Enlarge the circle and the number of points around the circumference will be still larger.  The wider you go, the more dissatisfaction will you cause by your dividing line between those who will get recognition and those who will not.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the 1924 Act was of a very restricted character.  The headline was set by that Act and the purpose of the 1934 Act was to give pensions to those who approximated to individuals in an army on active service.  It is not suggested, I think, that there were 60,000 people who would come within that category of soldiers on active service.  The purpose was to deal only with a particular limited class.  The community as a whole might object and might say: &ldquo;In <Col N="286" /> various ways we played parts which were just as important.&rdquo;  The information conveyed by the man who tells a company column leader that he has seen troops in the district who are going to surround that column leader might be of more value than a number of other activities and might have saved the lives of a number of men. The ordinary person who comes and tells a leader that there is an enemy column in a vulnerable position and enables the leader to ambush them and destroy them might give much more valuable service than a private in the Army, but you cannot go into all these things.  There were householders who, by keeping columns, practically beggared themselves, but we cannot deal with these, because, as I have said, if we try to give recognition to every family and every individual who played a noble part, a valuable part, in the fight for independence, we would have to cover a very large section of our population.</P>
    <P>We did not do that; we narrowed it down in accordance with the general idea of giving pensions to those who approximated to soldiers.  We did not define it and it took so long for those administering the system to come to their final agreement that only 1,000 cases were disposed of in the first year. They got through only 1,000 cases in the first year because they were then engaged in setting their standards.  If there are a number of examiners in a public examination, they come together and try to devise standards, so that they will have some sort of uniformity.  It took them a long, long time to come to agreement, to give an idea of what was that particular standard of service which would entitle people to come under the Act.  All that could be said in regard to those who got pensions and those who have not is that the only thing that is being done in regard to their service is that a certain body of people which was set up to examine the cases examined them fairly and impartially.  They have arrived at the conclusion that a certain number&mdash;11,000 odd&mdash;gave service which approximated to the service which would be rendered by a soldier <Col N="287" /> on active service in an army and that the other services, no matter how valuable they may have been either absolutely in themselves or in the estimation of individuals or neighbours&mdash; and there is no suggestion whatever that many of them were not valuable: some of them were invaluable and that may have been so in the cases which I indicated here&mdash;did not come within the Act.  It was not the intention of the Legislature to give pensions in those cases.</P>
    <P>I have tried to deal with this question fairly and honestly as I see it.  I ask other Deputies to face squarely up to the problem and to approach it in the same way.  I have had to talk on this at great length, because this thing was clouded and fogged with all sorts of misrepresentations.  I put it to every honest Deputy that it is his duty to validate the procedure unless he can show wherein it was faulty or wherein it was calculated not to give justice.  Nobody has addressed himself to that problem.  Nobody has said in what way a person was going to have a better chance by having four people with the Referee, seeing that a majority had nothing to do with it. The four people were there to advise the Referee.  He need not listen to their advice.  He was bound, of course, to respect it, but he need not accept any advice that was given to him. Who is going to say that if that procedure had been adopted there was a better chance for anybody, who did not get a pension than there was under the system which is there?  I do not think anyone has tried to show that there has been anything in this but care and fairness in accordance with the procedure that has been adopted.  The procedure, I say again, could reasonably have been accepted as the right procedure as expressing the genuine intention of this House until we had a decision in the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>I ask Deputies to give this Bill a Second Reading as a just Bill, as a necessary Bill, and as a Bill that is designed in the public interest to deal with a problem of public importance. If anybody thinks that he has a solution to deal with cases, which are <Col N="288" /> either known to himself or known to others, in accordance with the standards which he can see have been adopted, he can put forward an amendment of that sort and if it will meet the case and be a genuine solution, we will welcome it.  I am sure the Minister will welcome it.  I know I will, and that the Government will welcome it.  I say give this Bill a Second Reading. I feel that there is no justification for the Dáil not to do that.  Give it a Second Reading, and then on the Committee Stage let us consider if there are any Daniels who will be able to provide a solution.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach a question?  I did not like to interrupt him when he was speaking.  If the Taoiseach and the Government are anxious for a solution will he say what is the insuperable difficulty in the way of permitting a select committee to meet, with a time limit on its deliberations, to endeavour to find a solution which, on a matter of this kind, is much more easily found in the conference chamber than in the cut and thrust of debate in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no cut and thrust in this matter.  The Parties can separately sit down and apply all that sort of unity that you can get within a Party to provide a solution.  Let each Party put up a solution if it has one.  I do not believe in escapism.  This is only a shelving of the problem, this handing over to a select committee and saying: &ldquo;Oh, we will pass the buck.&rdquo; We do not want to pass the buck.  We have a responsibility, and we do not want to pass it to anybody.  We have a responsibility for seeing this thing done.  If the Parties opposite want to meet together in groups or otherwise there is no barrier to their doing so. The only thing we ask is: &ldquo;Give us a solution to this particular problem which we ourselves, through our struggling with it, believe to be practically insoluble.&rdquo;  It is because of that that I do not believe any group, sitting down for any length of time, will be able to get a satisfactory solution.  If it does, then, as I have said, we will consider it.  I have seen some suggestions which I do not think <Col N="289" /> faced up to all the circumstances of the case.  Let the different Parties meet within themselves.  In that way you will probably get greater frankness in your discussions.  Let them come together.  They all know what the problem is now.  I hope that Old I.R.A. men who have been verifying officers know what the procedure is.  I think it is correct to say, too, that there will be a White Paper on this. The Minister is considering the production of a White Paper on the procedure that has been followed so that everyone can see what the procedure is.  Parties can discuss it between now and the Committee Stage.  I suggest that is a much more practical way of dealing with this than by shelving it.  We want the Second Reading of the Bill on the grounds which I have stated. If, on the Committee Stage, Deputies want to propose amendments, I want to assure them that they will be sympathetically considered by us.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I say to the Taoiseach, realising his difficulty, and not in any way spreading the genesis of it, that what is a problem for the Government to-day is a problem for all of us.  Let us come together as we did to face much more serious problems. There is the Defence Conference. Would the Taoiseach, without asking us to go any further with discussion of the Second Reading, leave it to the Defence Conference where men came together and were satisfied to assist the Government in every way, even in the case of more difficult problems? <Col N="291" /> They have shown that they were prepared to stand as a group behind the Government, even though they were not satisfied with the administration of things that they were supposed to be responsible for.  There is a group representative of the various Parties to consider serious problems.  They have a certain amount of understanding with one another.  I speak for myself, but from what I know of all those who addressed themselves to this debate, they would be prepared to sit down in council in the Defence Conference, which has not much work to do now.  They could hear what the Government problem is, get details and if their combined wisdom would not suggest some way out they would understand the line of business and take some decision.  I intervened in the matter only to say that I am prepared to accept my share of the responsibility that I feel is passed to us by the Taoiseach when he asked for suggestions. I make that suggestion.  I ask the Taoiseach if he is prepared to accept it.  It would, mean that instead of a select committee a well-tried committee would sit down with representatives the Government sent there to discuss the problem and to see what it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make that clear at the start.  My suggestion has been rather as a challenge to the different Parties and to the House to find a solution.  I believe that it will not be possible to get a satisfactory solution that will command public respect, without an examination of the whole matter.  In fact, I have been very seriously considering the whole problem from that point of view.  If any Party or any group within the ordinary machinery working in this House can find a solution let them put it forward. I want the Second Reading of this Bill. I think the Government is entitled to the Second Reading.  As a matter of <Col N="292" /> public policy it is the Government's duty to put this Bill through, either with such amendments as it can make or in the present form, if no amendments are put forward.  I must insist that the Government get the Second Reading.  After the Second Reading is through, then these other questions can come up in Committee, if there are suggestions that a solution may be got other than that proposed.  I do not think this is a matter for the Defence Conference.  The conference was set up for a special purpose and it worked very well for that purpose.  I do not think this is a proper question to put to them.  I think a committee otherwise composed might be more suitable. All these things can be considered in the proper place when it comes to amendment of the Bill.  With regard to our responsibility, I ask that the Second Reading of this Bill will go through.  If the Government is not going to get the confidence of the House the usual procedure will have to take place.  In our opinion this is a measure of public importance and the Government will do its duty to get it passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to develop in any way my picture of the Government's difficulty, but I suggest that this shocking haste after long years is unseemly.  If the Taoiseach is asking for public respect for the final decision that we are going to take, then I think it is unseemly to press this now.  The Minister for Defence told us that before April, 1939, there were only 64 rejections.  It took four years, out of tens of thousands of applications, to ascertain that 64 had no claim.  To what extent that delay was responsible for the creation of this problem I do not know.  I suggest that that is part of the difficulty, as well as the dragging of the procedure <Col N="293" /> that was followed, everyone connected with it knowing what difficulties they were going into year after year until now the bubble has burst in this respect.  That is responsible for the position in which the Government finds itself.  I suggest that the Government are too close up against a certain type of responsibility or somebody acting for them in creating this problem.  The members of the Defence Conference came together under a certain amount of pressure from the House generally, and against the wishes of the Government at that time.  They have kept together and have maintained public respect and public support for the authorities and the activities organised for defence purposes.  There is not a single one of them who does not feel that it was a certain amount of sacrifice on their part to appear to take public responsibility for some of the weaknesses in defence administration during these times.  Nevertheless there has been no serious complaint on the part of anyone about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have kept together during the last two years, but if we are there as a Defence Conference to-day it is because we were filled with a desire to serve the Government in any difficulty it is up against.  We realise that even though the Government might not have wanted us on many occasions we have served the people well, as a kind of gesture, in keeping the flag of unity flying for all sections of our people who gave us their confidence and thus gave us a certain amount of confidence in ourselves.  If the difficulties about which the Taoiseach speaks in connection with this measure are what he now suggests they are, and if he wants to suggest that there is any body or member of this House that can help him in the solution of those difficulties, then I say that there is no group, more tried or more fitted, or more representative of all Parties in the House than the present personnel of the Defence Conference&mdash;that there is no body more fitted to discuss the nature and extent of this problem. Without any reference to how the difficulty has arisen, by sitting down together to meet it as a difficulty that has arisen to-day, that has to be faced <Col N="294" /> to-day, and that probably could be faced to-day in a way that would command the respect of the people, I suggest that there could be no better qualified body than the Defence Conference to deal with those difficulties if they were put in front of them. That is my contribution in reply to the suggestion of the Taoiseach to-day that if we could help him in any way in connection with this matter he would welcome suggestions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, I shall carefully consider that suggestion when we arrive at the Committee Stage of the Bill, but I feel that the validity of the principle that has been adopted in regard to this Bill must be passed on the Second Stage in any case.  We cannot throw the whole thing again into the melting-pot.</P>

      <P>It has been shown that this Bill is of a very controversial nature.  It is certainly unique to the extent that, as a result of the discussions upon it, it has been shown that more members of the Government Party have felt it incumbent upon them to speak on it than upon any other Bill that has appeared before the House for a considerable time. That goes to show that there are certain doubts in their minds and in the minds of their constituents as to the Bill that is before us to-day.  Those of us who are against the Bill have been taunted by members of the Government Party that, throughout our constituencies, we alleged that the decision of the court would be responsible for giving pensions to all members of the Old I.R.A. who had already made application.  We never suggested anything of the kind.  We know that the decision of the court merely means that a man whose case has been rejected can now, as a result of the Referee not having been present, be put into the position of appearing before the tribunal again in order to make his case for a pension. Any of us who had doubts as to the trickiness of this Bill are now satisfied, I think, on that point, after hearing Mr. de Valera's long oration.  We had the Siegfried Line, the Maginot Line, and now it would appear that we have the de Valera line.  I wonder that <Col N="295" /> during the course of Mr. de Valera's speech&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg pardon, Sir.  As I was about to say, it appeared to me, listening to the speech of the Taoiseach, that we were discussing the Estimate for the Department of Education instead of the Bill that is before us.  For a long time the Taoiseach seemed to be demonstrating his mathematical calculations and, to my mind, whatever remarks he made along those lines had no bearing whatever on the situation with which we are now dealing.  The issue here is perfectly clear, and I am perfectly satisfied that what was responsible for the introduction of this Bill was not the validating of the claims of those who had been awarded pensions.  I am satisfied that the introduction of this Bill was due to the fact that certain people, as a result of a decision by the Supreme Court or the High Court, were to be permitted to come before the tribunal again and make their case.  The Taoiseach gave us a very lengthy address and, during the course of that address, he, several times, invited suggestions.  I know of no instance in this House, since Fianna Fáil came into power, where one suggestion was ever taken from any part of this House, no matter how good it was or in what good faith it was given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy, Leader of the Opposition, has made a suggestion to-day, and the Taoiseach has turned it down already.  The Taoiseach says that he will consider it when he gets the Second Reading of the Bill.  Of course, he knows very well that he will get the Second Reading, because he has a majority in this House to give it to him.  Evidently, however, the House must accept the principles of the Bill, even though they differ with those principles, before the Taoiseach will agree, not merely to accept, but even to consider any suggestion made by any member of the House who is just as anxious as the Government to have <Col N="296" /> this thing settled once and for all.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that a Committee of this House, such as has been suggested by various Deputies, and also suggested through the medium of a motion which the Irish Labour Party have put down, would receive the unanimous approval of the Old I.R.A. in this country.  They have repeatedly asked that the minds or views of those Deputies in the Dáil who were in touch with them during the Black-and-Tan period, or the period during which they were fighting for the independence of our country, should be expressed here, and they have asserted that they would be prepared to accept the views of those Deputies.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach talks about the period which would be necessary in order to hear those claims, and, again, we have his mathematical calculations, which would bring us 50 years hence. I suggest to the Taoiseach now that a simple way of dealing with this matter would be to take the evidence submitted on behalf of those who have already got pensions and compare it with the evidence given on behalf of those who did not get pensions.  I am sure there would be some startling revelations in that connection, and I suggest that political influence has been used on behalf of some candidates for election to the Oireachtas in connection with this matter of pensions. Anybody who is conversant with these matters must know that prior to elections every pressure is brought to bear in the interests of members of the Government Party, that promises of pensions are made, and that, after the election, pensions have been awarded, and I say that that can be proved.  Various Deputies in the House have suggested that we should get together in an endeavour to settle this problem once and for all, but, as I have said, none of our suggestions will be accepted.  I pointed out a few moments ago that a greater percentage of Government Deputies have talked on this matter than have talked on any other Bill for a long time, and I suggest that the reason for that is that they are beginning to feel the draught in their constituencies. The people in their constituencies place an interpretation on the Bill <Col N="297" /> entirely different from that which they have been told by the Party managers to place upon it.  These Deputies go out of their way, at the end of their statements, to make an appeal to the Government to reconsider the cases of certain people who have been turned down, but for the past ten years members of other Parties in the House have been making that appeal, and I have heard very few members of the Fianna Fáil Party in this House, when the Estimate for military pensions was under consideration, making any such appeal.  It is only now that we hear some of their voices&mdash;now, when we are faced with this Bill which, no matter what the Taoiseach says, does interfere with a man's right, so far as the Constitution is concerned.  I submit to the Taoiseach that rights are being interfered with, so far as the Constitution is concerned.  I submit that any individual should have the right to appeal to the highest court in the land if he feels himself aggrieved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That brings me to another point.  The Taoiseach spoke about the intentions of the House and about his intentions.  The High Court is going to have a busy time if it is to interpret either what the Taoiseach says or his interpretation of certain things.  He is always purposely ambiguous in dealing with matters of this kind.  He talks about retrospective legislation and frankly admits that this is retrospective legislation, although some of the speakers from the Government Party scouted the idea.  He cited certain cases.  I submit that there is no parallel between the cases he cited and the case we are now considering. He referred to the case of the deputy-sheriff of Cork.  That was a case in which legislation was introduced to save a particular man.  He did what he was told to do by a judge, and it would have been wrong for a man to be punished for acting in that way.  Here, we have a case of retrospective legislation to prevent men who were prepared to sacrifice their lives from getting their rights.  It <Col N="298" /> does not matter what the Taoiseach says, that is the position.</P>
      <P>He spoke about the intention of the Dáil so far as the Referee was concerned. He said that his interpretation was that the Referee was not to be present in a corporeal sense.  For a considerable time, the Referee was present with the tribunal and one wonders who made the alteration.  Did the Referee take it upon himself to absent himself or did he receive orders from the Government to do so?  Like Deputy McGilligan, who spoke yesterday, I do not believe that the interests of those in receipt of pensions are in jeopardy.  If that be the case, I suggest, as he suggested, that a one-clause Bill should be brought in to safeguard the position.  I also suggest that the Government and the Government Party are more concerned with preventing any other body from making an appeal to the High Court than they are with safeguarding the position of those who have got pensions. It is all very well to say that those who have already appealed to the High Court will be heard by the tribunal, but it must be borne in mind that those were test cases and that many others agreed to indemnify the parties concerned if they were mulcted in costs.  The persons concerned in the test cases are few and, in their magnanimity, the Government can agree to their cases being heard. There are other cases which will not be heard simply because the parties will not be able to produce what the tribunal regards as &ldquo;new evidence&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dealing with the question of pensions and service, we have yet to learn what is a &ldquo;major operation.&rdquo;  That appears to be the bone of contention so far as applicants are concerned.  Let us take the case of Enniscorthy town, which I have mentioned here on various occasions over the past 20 years.  There were 260 genuine claimants from Enniscorthy and the board has made assessments in only 92 cases.  Anybody who obtained a pension in Enniscorthy will admit that almost all the other applicants are as much entitled to an assessment as he was. There was no major engagement in Enniscorthy, but Enniscorthy stands <Col N="299" /> out on its own, next to Dublin, in the fight for Irish independence in 1916. The insurgents took over the town on the Thursday of Easter Week.  They knew that there was a large force in Wexford ready to march on the town. They made all preparations to attack that large force.  They took all necessary precautions to guard the town against them and they were prepared to sacrifice their lives in doing so.  Yet, their applications have been refused, although others in the town with the same experience and the same service have received pensions.  That is the reason.  I suggested to the Taoiseach a few moments ago that a simple way of dealing with applicants would be to have a series of comparisons.</P>
    <P>Again, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Defence suggested that if there were more than one referee, there would be varying decisions.  There are varying decisions already and we have only one referee.  There are varying decisions in connection with my constituency &mdash; decisions which affect men with the same service.  Perhaps &ldquo;affect&rdquo; is the wrong word.  The decisions varied but the service was the same, the rank was the same and the desire to work for Ireland was the same.  The readiness to sacrifice their lives for Ireland was the same, but there was a variation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The north, principally. The decisions varied and I believe that certain pressure can be brought to bear upon both the Referee and the board. I ask the Minister for Defence to declare what were, and are, the avowed political beliefs of the past and present Referee.  What are the avowed political beliefs of the board?  It will be found, if that question be answered, that their beliefs are Fianna Fáil.  A man would not be human if his political beliefs would not be put into operation when pressure is brought to bear upon him from a certain quarter.  Suggestions <Col N="300" /> were asked for by the Taoiseach.  As I said at the beginning, I do not know of any instance in which a suggestion made, in all good faith, by a member of any other Party was accepted by the present Government.  We are as anxious as he is to settle this question. We know the difficulties as well as he does.  We know that this is a bone of contention all over the country.  There are certain areas into which one cannot go without being asked when this question of pensions is to be solved.  We know that, in the interests of the country, the discontent that exists should be removed and we are prepared to give all necessary help to get this matter out of the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know, as well as you, that there are people making application for pensions who have no right to them. Deputy Moran yesterday referred to some applicants as &ldquo;chancers&rdquo;.  We do not go so far as that because we believe that there are numbers of people who are genuinely of the opinion that they are entitled to pensions.  It is all very well to talk about major engagements but there are other things which affected the lives of the people of this country.  There were young men in this country in 1916 who left universities, left schools, left their trades, young men who were serving apprenticeships and who in consequence of the actions they took were marked men by the police.  They had to live away from their homes and occupations for a number of years.  Surely the claims of these men should be taken into consideration. Many a young man who set out to serve his apprenticeship to a trade had to abandon it in consequence of the fact that when the Irish war in which he had participated was over he had gone beyond the age at which he could acquire a knowledge of that trade.  Many of these men are idle to-day. Others are working at unskilled occupations of which they cannot find sufficient to enable them to live.  Surely these men should get special consideration. It should be easy enough to find out what their activities were.  They may not all have been able to take part in what are called major engagements but they were prepared to do so.  Their lives were in danger and they were prepared to sacrifice them if necessary. <Col N="301" /> God knows, many of them have gone to their eternal reward since, and the Government ought to make an earnest effort to deal with the cases of those who are left.</P>
    <P>Again, I would ask the Minister to agree to the suggestion made that a committee should be set up.  I believe that the Government could deal with all the cases expeditiously if they adopt the suggestion I have made.  I think it will be found on examination by any impartial committee that if you examine the evidence submitted on behalf of those who have got pensions, and compare it with the evidence given on behalf of those who have been turned down, and if you take as a precedent the cases of those who have been granted pensions, automatically a great many more applications will get through.  It will not take them the  years spoken of by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Defence to deal with those cases.  I do not see anything unfair in adopting a procedure of that kind.  The courts of justice in this country often adopt precedents in deciding cases, and what is good enough for the judges of this country should be good enough for a tribunal to deal with the period in which the young men of Ireland were prepared to sacrifice their lives in the interests of their country.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach insists that the Bill should get a Second Reading.  He would not even go so far as to say: &ldquo;Well, give me the Second Reading of the Bill and then I shall accept the suggestion that a committee should be set up.&rdquo;  He is orthodox in everything. The Taoiseach is always right; the general body of opinion in the House is wrong and the Taoiseach is right.  It might be proved otherwise if he gave the House an opportunity to set up this committee to examine these applications from every angle. We are as anxious to settle this matter as he is.  We are desirous of helping in the matter, to remove once and for all what I consider to be a stain on the history of this country, that we refuse to deal with the genuine cases of young men who went out to fight when young men were needed.  We may say what we like, but there are <Col N="302" /> cases that should not have been turned down and in which pensions should have been granted.  The proof of that lies in the fact that during yesterday's debate every member of the Government Party who rose to speak concluded his speech by making an appeal to the Minister and the Government to provide means again to hear a number of those cases.  That in itself goes to prove that some of those men have been dealt with unfairly.  Deputy Killilea especially asked the House to come together to consider this matter. I would suggest to Deputy Killilea that the motion submitted by the Labour Party provides the opportunity that he asked for.  This Party has always been against retrospective legislation.  Retrospective legislation is reprehensible at any time, but when retrospective legislation is being used to prevent the young men of Ireland, who were prepared to fight for Ireland, from taking full advantage of their constitutional rights then it certainly is very reprehensible indeed.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything more I need say on the matter.  As far as I am concerned I do not think it at all necessary that this Bill should be passed to validate the claims already agreed upon by the tribunal.  As I said before I believe the Government are more concerned with the other side of the Bill which prevents the young men of Ireland from taking advantage of their constitutional rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBrennan" hpid="Mr. T. Brennan Mr. T. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the Bill.  I do so in order to ensure in the first instance that the present position under which 11,500 men are receiving pensions will be regularised and continue.  Deputy Corish states that Ministers and Deputies on this side of the House are more interested in taking, through this Bill, the necessary steps to prevent applicants whose claims for pensions have already been turned down by the board, from taking advantage of the ruling of the Supreme Court.  I believe that Deputy Corish and other Deputies who argue in that way have an ulterior motive in doing so.  Deputy Corish I believe knows that a big percentage of the men whose claims have been turned down are men <Col N="303" /> who have given certain service to the nation when such service was needed, but whose service, in the opinion of the Referee, did not reach the particular standard necessary to qualify for a pension.</P>
      <P>I think it will be admitted by any honest-minded man that we who have been working as members of brigade committees or as verifying officers for the past nine or ten years, helping to have the 1934 Act administered with justice, have by now acquired a knowledge of the type of applicant who is likely to qualify, and come within the circle referred to by the Taoiseach in the course of his speech.  That will be admitted by any honest-minded man.  After ten years of dealing with the board, ten years of going through the records of our own brigade, I think we should be in a position to know the individual who is likely to qualify and the individual who has not a chance.  I pay tribute to every man who was in the Old I.R.A., but there is a certain standard set up, and if a man does not come up to that standard he will not qualify.  What in the name of Providence is the use of encouraging 30,000 men, who have not got a chance, to have their cases reopened?  They will receive the same notice as they received under the procedure adopted by the Referee previous to the ruling of the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corish referred to men in the North Wexford Brigade who held officer rank, and who, although they had the same service as other officers who received pensions, did not qualify. Again, I do not know the particular officer or officers he has in mind, but I probably have a shrewd idea.  Again, I say that after ten years helping in the administration of that Act, the very fact that Deputy Corish should get up in this House and make such a statement proves, to me at any rate, that he has not the vaguest idea of how that Act was administered either by the brigade committee or by the advisory board.  I can say this in regard to the North Wexford Brigade, that every officer was assessed and got his rank if he had reached the <Col N="304" /> standard set up by the board.  If the officer or officers referred to by Deputy Corish have not received an assessment, it must be due to the fact that they did not, in the opinion of the board or the Referee, reach that standard.</P>
    <P>Previous to making that statement, Deputy Corish had, if I might say so, been a little scurrilous, inasmuch as he suggested that at certain periods, particularly at election times, pensions were &ldquo;dished out&rdquo; as encouragement to certain Old I.R.A. men to vote for the Fianna Fáil Party.  I suppose that may be good propaganda, but again I think no honest-minded man in the House will credit it for a moment.  It did not happen.  I do not believe it happened.  I do not claim to know much about the South Wexford Brigade area.  I did know it at one period but from the time that Wexford was divided into two areas my activities were purely confined to the northern area and that portion of the south which I now represent.</P>
    <P>I say again that, by the steps which are being taken in this Bill to prevent applicants who have already been turned down from going to the courts and getting an order, the Government are doing a good job for the applicants themselves, and I base that solely on the results already achieved in each case.  Every applicant got an opportunity of filling up his form.  I do not say that they all filled them as they should have done.  They may have filled them up in a haphazard manner &mdash;I believe so myself&mdash;but if they had established a <i>prima facie</i> case they got an opportunity of going before the examining board and adding to what they had already stated in their application forms, if they had anything to add.  In face of that, they did not receive an award.  A very large number of them, 30,000 or so I think did not get as far as the board, but they got their final notice and they got three weeks in which to appeal.  If they had further evidence to submit, I am sure that the board gave them every facility in that matter.  If, in face of all that, they eventually received the final notice, I think it is futile on the part of those applicants <Col N="305" /> to go further with their cases.  I say that, having had ten years' experience of the board, sitting there as a verifying officer.  I think it is only right that at least some verifying officers should speak openly and make a statement such as I have made, advising those people: &ldquo;Forget about it.  You have not reached the standard; you are not likely to reach it, and what more is there about it&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>We have Deputies on the far side of the House who believe there are ulterior motives behind this argument and that applicants are being prevented from taking advantage of the ruling of the Supreme Court.  We have Deputies making political propaganda out of it and thereby encouraging further hope in the breasts of those men.  If they had any knowledge at all of the working of the Act, either as members of a brigade committee or as verifying officers, they would not be encouraging such men to continue seeking to have their cases reopened.</P>
    <P>Certain statements were made here by Deputies in reference to verifying officers, company officers and brigade officers.  They do not affect my area, except in so far as they affect the credentials of the different brigade committees and the verifying officers all over the country.  Statements were made here that officers, in order to qualify for company rank or brigade rank, built up their lists of names to the numbers which would entitle them to that rank, by returning a lot of dud names as being those of persons who were members of the I.R.A. but who were not, in fact, members.  I think that is a wild statement to make.  I have so much respect for the intelligence of the board that I believe any brigade, battalion, or company officer who would attempt to falsify numbers for the purpose of qualifying for rank would have a rude awakening from the members of the board and the Referee.  In my opinion, they are not people you can slip one across so easily.  Yet we have statements like that, which carry no weight in the House, I am sure, though they may receive publicity in the Press and certain people may be inclined to believe <Col N="306" /> them, thus bringing the Old I.R.A. organisation as a whole into disrepute.</P>
    <P>I believe the Bill is necessary, in the first instance, in order to regularise the payment of pensions and when I express myself so, I do so, not through having been convinced by what the Taoiseach said but because on the morning I took up the paper and saw the ruling of the Supreme Court, it did not require an abundance of intelligence to realise that every man who is drawing a pension was interested in that particular ruling.  Common sense told me right away that something had to be done to regularise that position.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of certain individuals throughout the brigade areas who, in the opinion of the brigade committees&mdash;even in the opinion of the Minister himself, probably&mdash;would come in the category referred to by the Taoiseach as on the 38, 39, 40, 41 and 42 per cent. marks.  We are all definitely interested in those men, because they are border-line cases.  We all could illustrate cases where the service rendered by those men was absolutely essential to some important operation that was carried out.  I am hoping still that the elusive solution will be found for the crux which has arisen and that justice will be meted out to those individuals.</P>
    <P>There are some men&mdash;a small number, I believe &mdash; with outstanding national service who, for some reason or other of their own, did not make application for service certificates up to the closing date for the receipt of applications.  I suggest to the Minister that he should make provision in the Bill whereby applications would be accepted up to and including 31st December, 1945, placing it on the same plane as that which will obtain in regard to claimants having a right to appeal to have their cases reopened up to 31st December next.  I think that would be a good gesture, and, now that we are dealing with this amending Bill, I suggest to the Minister to make provision to give those people, if they think well of it, an opportunity to apply for a service certificate.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on taking the necessary steps to regularise <Col N="307" /> the pensions payments that have already taken place.  The Bill ensures that certain individuals who have been drawing these pensions and who depend on them from a bread and butter point of view will continue to receive them, and I congratulate the Minister on having taken that step in regard to the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Moylan) Seán Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it very difficult to follow the logic of those who have opposed the Bill, and who on the one hand want to extend the ambit of the Bill to include a number of people who have not already qualified, and on the other hand assert that pensions have been given solely through political influences.  If pensions have been given through political influence it is the duty of every member of the Opposition as forcibly as he can to prevent any further extension of political corruption. I should like to oppose some of the speeches made here which in a great measure represented the I.R.A. men as servile, suppliant hounds looking for a financial advantage which was not due to them, and to say that never in the history of any nation was there such decent, unselfish service given as by the men who served with me from 1916 to 1923.</P>
      <P>The present position does not arise because of any demand made by any of the men who are in receipt of pensions under either the 1924 or the 1934 Acts.  Deputy Cafferky said that he would be totally opposed to the payment of pensions to able-bodied men, and I find myself always very much in agreement with that point of view. Any of the men who served in 1916, 1921, or 1923 did not go out to fight, did not go out to work in the hope of getting a reward, or with the desire for a reward.  They went out unselfishly to serve this country, and the circumstances of the times practically forced pensions awards on these men who secured them under the 1924 and 1934 Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even from the ex-Leader of a Party one would expect some exactitude of expression.  Deputy Donnellan discovered for us the reasons for the 1924 <Col N="308" /> Act and for the 1934 Act.  They were payments for political support.  They were specially passed so that special influence could be secured by the Parties that passed them for support in an election.  Deputy Donnellan has shown himself to be no mean political opportunist.  The 1924 Act was passed in that particular year and we had no election until June, 1927, and, if my memory serves me right, the results of that election for Fine Gael, or Cumann na nGaedheal as they were then, were not such as to assure the Cumann na nGaedheal people that their efforts through the 1924 Act were a satisfactory system of political propaganda. It may be all very well for Deputy Donnellan, as an individual, to start three years before the election started; but the idea of a Party like Cumann na nGaedheal passing a Pension Act in 1924 for the purpose of influencing the electorate in 1927 passes my understanding.  Does not everybody here know that the Government in 1924 did not need to look for political support?  They were a Government formed of men who had come through a revolution, who had been successful in the civil war, who had the support of the people behind them the people who wanted peace and security, and they did not need to purchase any support in voting power&mdash; they had it.</P>
    <P>If I understand the reason for the 1924 Act, I regard it as a measure for public security, a justifiable measure for public security.  The Government were controlling a country which was in a very disturbed state.  I do not want to refer to the civil war.  I have taken the view in regard to the civil war as it was expressed by Mr. Frank Pakenham in his book &ldquo;Peace by Ordeal&rdquo;, that the men on both sides adequately met the forces of hostile circumstances and that it was in the nature of things that circumstances should be supreme.  But everybody knows that, when the 1924 Act was passed, there was a disturbed condition in the country.  Not only had you the opponents on both sides in the civil war, but you had the aftermath of disruption inside the Army itself.  In my belief, the 1924 Act was passed as <Col N="309" /> a measure of public security, so that the Government in power would have the support of fighting men and would tie to themselves these fighting men who would ensure that public peace was kept in the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin was very eloquent with regard to the 1924 Act.  Deputy Davin, so far as I know, is not noted for exact detail.  It is true there was a demand by those who supported Fianna Fáil that the 1924 Act should be nullified.  It was quite a natural demand.  It was a demand made by men who had fought through a very bitter period and suffered through a very bitter period.  Everybody knows the demands made in election times. Very often the demands concern themselves with things of little moment when things of great moment have passed over easily.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin showed us here yesterday the power that his attenuated Party had in the Dáil in 1932&mdash;power without responsibility&mdash;and we know through the ages of history who are those who have power without responsibility. Deputy Davin told us that the Labour Party were responsible for securing to the recipients of pensions under the 1924 Act that those pensions would continue.  There is no denying that the supporters of the Party in power to-day did argue that the 1924 Act should be nullified, and that is quite an understandable position.  The action of the Government was the correct action&mdash;to take the view that legislation passed by a Government when one Party was in power should not be wilfully disturbed by another Party following into power.  Otherwise, we could have no stable Government in the country.  Irrespective of what Deputy Davin said or what the outcry in regard to the matter was in the country, the Government took no action in regard to the 1924 Act but, in regard to the power of the Labour Party in the Dáil, they certainly took action in 1933.  The 1934 Act was passed in that year and, again, it was three years before we had an election.</P>

      <P>Let it go at three. <Col N="310" /> Mind you, the result of the 1937 election, if I remember rightly, was not altogether satisfactory to Fianna Fáil. Therefore, if the 1934 Act was passed as a measure to secure electoral support, it must again be regarded as a failure.  Deputy Donnellan, with his peculiar system of logic, will probably think that the 1945 Act is being passed now for the purpose, by Fianna Fáil, of securing the support of some unspecified section of the community in 1948 or 1949.</P>
      <P>As I said, even the ex-Leader of a Party should inform himself of what the facts are in regard to any legislation or those things it affects.  He has, particularly, a complete misconception of the character and the motives of the I.R.A. men affected, misunderstands completely the Act, shows no conception of decency in regard to the matter, talks about the I.R.A. in Galway as if they were Slattery's mounted foot&mdash;three brigadiers and one private.</P>
      <P>Then we come along to the Leader of a Labour Party.  He still is the leader, though of a now rather attenuated Party.  One would think that Deputy Norton, with his experience in the Dáil and his vast experience in discussion amongst trade unionists, would truly inform himself in regard to the functions of the board and in regard to the functions of the Referee, but Deputy Norton has told us that the Dáil was kept completely in the dark and has asked why was it that the Dáil was not kept informed in regard to the working of the board and of the Referee.  Thirty thousand cases had been heard by the board and the Referee.  Men had been heard from every county.  The working of the board was known in every county in Ireland.  It was discussed everywhere and, in spite of that, Deputy Norton asks, in 1945, why was not the Dáil kept informed of what was going on in the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supreme Court decision finds that there was a technical defect in the administration of the Act.  It nowhere suggested, at any time, that any injustice has been done.  It does say that there has been a technical <Col N="311" /> defect in administration.  This legislation is devoted to putting that defect right and the Taoiseach in his speech last night has very definitely cleared the air in regard to the constitutionality of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Again, various Deputies have talked about the secret nature of the evidence given, as if the boardroom was a secret star chamber in which those who came before the board and the Referee were condemned unheard.  I said that I knew no more unselfish service given to this country than was given by the I.R.A.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin yesterday took it upon himself to condemn the men who fought in the civil war.  The men who fought in the civil war did not engage in it lightly.  The men concerned in the civil war suffered many days and hours of agony when they realised the shape of things to come, when they realised the gathering clouds, in May and June of 1922, when they realised that the efforts they had put into the work from 1916 were about to be destroyed, when circumstances were too much for them.  And, when Deputy Davin was preparing himself for his brilliant political career, these men were making a sacrifice, throwing away their whole and complete future, hoping for nothing, believing that there was never again a future for them in this country.  In the bright days of Deputy Davin's career, when he was a member of the Public Accounts Committee&mdash;of which he later became chairman&mdash;and when he had occupied the dignified position of the whip in a much stronger Labour Party, Deputy Davin sought in the Public Accounts Committee to insist that the evidence brought forward on behalf of applicants for pensions should be made public, and the Government of the day, rightly, passed legislation to insist that military secrets in this country would be kept&mdash;because they were military secrets.  Those who suggest to-day that star chamber methods governed the workings of the board do not know what they are talking about, but a man of Deputy Davin's experience should know, having it rammed down his throat by legislation in this House.</P>

      <P>Search me.  Now, I have a tribute to pay to the advisory board.  Deputies seem to be completely insensible to the magnitude and the delicacy of the task imposed on these men and I can from my own knowledge, and Deputy MacEoin can back me up if he likes, pay a tribute to the assiduity, the intelligence and the integrity of the men who formed the board and the examining committees. The men who gave evidence before the board were the verifying officers selected by their own comrades as those best fitted to make a case for them.  The business of a verifying officer, as the name implies, is to verify the statements of the applicant.  The form of application was prepared with care.  Any man who applied got a form of application.  Any genuine applicant brought his form of application to his brigade committee, where he got all the advice and assistance he needed in making his case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was not the business of the brigade committee to inform any applicant that he had no case, but it was the business of the verifying officer, under the seal of confidence, to tell the board exactly what he thought of the evidence given by the applicant on oath.  I know that the brigade committees all over the country were tireless in their work trying to secure the evidence and collect it and place it at the disposal of <Col N="313" /> the board, so that the board had a complete picture of the condition of things in every brigade area.  I know, too, what Deputy MacEoin pointed out, that men who had fought against each other in the civil war formed these boards and worked honestly, decently and honourably to secure evidence in support of the claims of men who were, 12 or 20 years before, their enemies.</P>
    <P>Very seldom do I annoy the House by making a speech, and perhaps I could crave the indulgence of the House if I go a little further than I intended in regard to this matter. There has been such a complete air of innocence, such a complete misconception of the facts of the relevant years, that possibly it would be well to record now what was the origin of the formation of the I.R.A.  When I joined the volunteers in 1913 it was a voluntary organisation.  Not only did its members not expect or work for pay or reward, but actually they paid weekly subscriptions.  I informed a British soldier of that in 1915 and he said it was the funniest army in the world.</P>

      <P>We tried to build up the volunteer organisation in 1913, 1914 and 1915.  Owing to the war, the circumstances of the time, the Wooden-bridge speech, it was difficult to establish a successful organisation everywhere. 1916 came and went.  Some members of our organisation were executed, some imprisoned, and all scattered.  After the release of the men from imprisonment in 1917, we had to start the heartbreaking task of building up the volunteer organisation again.  That was a difficult time, a hard time for many people.  Many of the pioneers of those years took major parts in the work that followed&mdash; some of them took minor parts, and others took no part.  In assessing a man's service, the board naturally considered whether he was an early comer into the volunteers, whether he was a pioneer worker, what was the value of <Col N="314" /> his work, and what was its strength. Any applicant appearing before the board who was such a pioneer advanced himself a step in the opinion of the board and in relation to the eventual award.  Over these years we had also the Sinn Féin organisation. Deputy Davin will remember that.</P>

      <P>Very often there was a misconception in the minds of the people as to Sinn Féin and the volunteers. Very often the volunteers at the time were called the Sinn Féin volunteers. One of our difficulties in the years 1917 and 1918 was to create the military mind, to try to build into the civilian mind some idea of militancy, to try to separate the functions of those in Sinn Féin and of those whose natural forte was the volunteers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Originally we had to pay subscriptions every week and we got the subscriptions over all the years in large and little streams, but, in 1918 and 1919, many of the people throughout the country, particularly, I suppose, as a result of the 1918 Sinn Féin election, got what we have heard was the ancient Chinese idea of warfare: the approaching of the enemy with many banners and large shouts.  We had the money collected for arms and munitions being diverted to the purposes of fife and drum bands and banners.  Every little village in Ireland wanted, like Knocknagoshel, to take its place among the nations of the earth.  These activities, foolish as they very often were, at least acted as irritants to the British.  We had Defence of the Realm Acts, various Coercion Acts and various depredations by the R.I.C. until eventually our Volunteer organisation began to be hammered into some sort of military organisation.  Eventually, a situation arose in which the Volunteers, as they had functioned and existed up to then, were no longer an effective body for the purposes for which they were intended, and then we had the formation of the active service units.  There has been no difficulty about getting a <Col N="315" /> decision before the board in relation to men who served in the active service units, but, behind the active service unit, there had to be an organisation and a staff.  The members of a staff are like the buttons on your trousers &mdash;you never notice them until they fall off.  There is in <i>Henry IV</i>&mdash;I understand we are to see the picture one of these days&mdash;a magnificent and immortal description of a staff officer, but staff officers are the essential part of an army.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin was not a staff officer.  He had the usual contempt for the man with the &ldquo;chin new-reaped&rdquo;.  The board readily recognised the necessity for, and the value of, staff officers, and in regard to staff officers who had given service, there was no difficulty in proving their cases before the board and getting an award.  It would be wrong for us to glorify a member of the active service unit at the expense of the ordinary member of the company.  While companies were composed of men who were not real soldiers, there was in every company a big number of men who were more than anxious to take part in any fighting, but who could not do so for lack of guns.  Many of these got opportunities now and again, because an active service unit operated in their particular localities, to engage in ambushes, to be mobilised for attacks on barracks and various other operations. In the case of many of these men who gave valuable service and who had certain engagements to their credit, no difficulty was found in getting qualifications for them from the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, there were what have come to be known as key-men.  Key-men, in the circumstances of the case, had to be found in every area&mdash;men capable of organising behind the line, who concerned themselves with the building of dumps and dug-outs, the making of munitions, the provision of communications and protection duties. Although these men could not qualify <Col N="316" /> under what ordinarily was regarded as active service, the board decided that the value of these men, who never fired a shot, was so immense that they could not in all conscience refuse them the award they were giving to the men who handled the guns, and awards were made to them.  That is the history, shortly, of the basis on which awards were made.  Awards were made for full-time service of a specifically military nature, entailing the complete disruption of normal living, with its consequent ill-effects on the economic position and the future prosperity of the applicant.</P>
    <P>I pointed out that many Deputies seem insensible of the magnitude and delicacy of the task imposed on the board in dealing with 60,000 cases, many of which were not by any means identical, many of them different in many aspects.  I ask the House if there is any court in the world which is capable of giving truly abstract justice in 60,000 cases?  I know just a very few cases in which I disagree with the award, in which I think men were wrongfully refused an award&mdash;a very few cases&mdash;but that is only my opinion, and naturally I was prejudiced, and am prejudiced, in favour of the applicant.  I think that a board working under any other system, under any other instructions devised by all the Parties in the House and by the Defence Conference, could not secure a method by which as substantial justice would be done as was done under the method adopted.  I fail to see how we can better the methods which have proved so effective over the years.</P>
    <P>I again point out that the form of application given to each applicant, prepared with care, and which he was permitted to bring to his brigade committee for help and assistance, is a document which showed <i>prima facie</i> that the applicant was a person to whom the Act applied.</P>
    <P>I have been asked by men to give them certificates of service&mdash;not men who were in sympathy with the I.R.A. viewpoint&mdash;men who not only took no part in any activity, but showed their pro-British views in 1920 and 1921, men who never fired a shot and never said <Col N="317" /> a word in favour of Ireland.  Such men came along to me and asked me for certificates of service.  Some of those men were in my own brigade area, and I think it is inevitable that such men were in every area.</P>

      <P>We had a discussion last night on the <i>bona fides</i> of Longford on bogs.  I have seen application forms filled.  I remember working on a building many years ago.  It was a time and material job.  Every man kept his own time.  The labourers used to come along to me to fill in their time books for them.  When I asked &ldquo;What were you doing on Monday?&rdquo;  I got the reply &ldquo;I brought a ladder from the shop down to the house in the morning, and I was digging foundations for the rest of the day&rdquo;.  When I asked &ldquo;What were you doing on Tuesday?&rdquo; the reply was &ldquo;Mixing mortar,&rdquo; and for the other days of the week the reply was the same.  Some men knew so little about the I.R.A. or about I.R.A. activities that I have seen a form where a man claimed in 1918 that he attended the funeral of a Volunteer who had died from the 'flu, that early in 1919 he tore down posters that the R.I.C. had put up, that he attended a Sinn Féin meeting in such and such a place, and that he was down in Waterford for the 1918 Election, and so on from one particular period to the next.  When we remember what Waterford was in 1918, I am fully convinced that, in contra-distinction to the claims of many of those men, the Ballybricken pig buyers would have a far better claim.  There are thousands and thousands of these forms before the board.  The case made here is that we should set up a special commission, something like the <i>Times</i> commission, and have evidence from everywhere in the country and the views of every Deputy.  The views that most Deputies have given on this matter have not been very enlightening.  I ask the House to support the Bill because it is doing no injustice and because at this stage, after 10 years of investigation, it would be practically impossible <Col N="318" /> to do an injustice to any of the applicants.  I speak with experience of the activities of the I.R.A. from 1916 to 1923, and of the working of the board.</P>

      <P>It is with a kind of fear and trepidation that I take part in this debate.  I am one of those who took no part in the activities for which so many applicants are now seeking pensions. As a Deputy what I am concerned with is that the people who supply the money for those pensions will be more or less assured that there is value given for it.  I am also jealous that the laws of the country should be upheld, and that the constitutional rights of every individual, no matter how humble his position may be, should be safeguarded.  We had a long historical résumé from the Minister for Lands this morning which had very little bearing on this Bill.  We had the usual long tale told by the Taoiseach himself last night.  He talked himself into a sort of unnecessary frenzy over certain remarks that had been made by Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy McGilligan.  I should like to offer this advice to the Taoiseach, that in his present state of health it is not good for him to work himself into such frenzies.  He could have left the discussion on the Bill to his very able Minister for Defence.  There must have been something which annoyed, which disturbed, the conscience of the Taoiseach when he felt himself compelled to come here last night and deliver a very long speech which he continued this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would appear to me that the issue here deals with a simple point of law, and all law, when boiled down, is nothing but common sense.  In this case the highest court in the land came to a decision based on the facts submitted to it, and on the law as it has existed in this country for the last ten years.  The question for the court was whether the conditions governing the 1934 Pensions Act were fully complied with, and it came to a decision on that question.  I was rather surprised at the Taoiseach's attitude last night in glossing over lightly the conditions governing the various sections of this Act.  There is no ambiguity <Col N="319" /> about Section 6 of the 1934 Act, or what it sets out should be done before these cases are determined.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="320" /> Debate adjourned.</P>
