      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether, in view of the fact that, by agreement between the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union and various employers, many thousands of workers are, or will soon become entitled to a fortnight's annual leave with pay, he will amend the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1939, so as to allow such a period of annual leave to all workers, including agricultural workers and others not already entitled to annual holidays with pay.</P>

      <P>Under the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1939, and the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act, 1938, certain classes of workers, such as domestic workers and other workers who are employed on public holidays, have a statutory right to a fortnight's annual holidays with pay.  Under the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1939, other classes of workers to whom this Act relates are entitled to a minimum period of seven consecutive whole holidays in each full employment year and six public holidays with pay.  It is not proposed to alter the statutory obligations on employers in this respect.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that a considerable amount <Col N="490" /> of wheat and barley is being damaged by exposure in the Gort area by reason of the fact than an insufficient number of wagons is made available at Gort; and if he will state whether steps can be taken to see that the additional wagons urgently required are provided; and if this is not possible, whether he will make available additional petrol to lorry owners in Gort for the transport of wheat and barley.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that 99 wagons have been supplied for grain traffic at Gort in the five weeks ended 20th October and the company are doing everything possible to clear off arrears.  It must be realised that grain traffic is appreciably greater than last year, while there has been no increase in rolling stock.  I am satisfied that the transport companies are giving the best service possible in the circumstances, but that there is no arrangement whereby simultaneous demands for wagons from all centres can be met immediately on request.  In some instances the mills and stores have been unable to unload the grain consigned to them at the rate of its delivery.  Petrol is being made available for grain haulage to the maximum extent possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that considerable quantities of new tyres for small motor cars and vans are being offered for sale at excessive prices.  When the rubber supply position became acute early in 1942, the manufacture of tyres for light motor vehicles was discontinued and since then no new tyres for these vehicles have been available from home sources.  It is not yet possible to make new tyres available for light motor vehicles and, therefore, the question of controlling distribution does not arise.  The prices of tyres for light motor vehicles have been controlled since early in 1942.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, some months ago a public controversy arose between the then chairman of the Committee of Management of the National Health Insurance Society and myself, as Minister for Local Government and Public Health, as to the special relationship and responsibilty to the Minister of those whom he appointed from year to year to the chairmanship, trusteeship or membership of the committee of management of the society.  These are matters of fundamental importance, and the views expressed by the then chairman in regard to them could not, in my opinion, be reconciled with the proper discharge by me of my duties as Minister responsible for the administration of national health insurance generally nor with my particular responsibility for the appointments in question.  Unfortunately those views had been so publicly and emphatically expressed that I believe that any private overture on my part to suggest they might be modified to meet my position would <Col N="494" /> neither be warranted nor welcomed. It is, of course, unnecessary for me to add that the issues raised in this controversy as to the relationship and responsibility to the Minister of persons appointed by him from year to year to the society were quite independent of the merits or demerits of certain proposals put forward by the then chairman.  These proposals are in fact being examined in my Department.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state if any proposals are under consideration by him for the erection of cottages under the Labourers Acts, in that portion of South Kerry extending from Killorglin to Sneem, particularly in the Cahirciveen area; and, if not, whether he is aware of the bad housing conditions of labourers in the town of Cahirciveen, where only four cottages have been built by the Kerry County Council during the past 23 years; and, if so, if he will urge the council to take the steps necessary to expedite the building of such cottages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No proposals for the erection of labourers' cottages in the area between Killorglin and Sneem are at present before my Department. Sanction to the issue of loans for the building of labourers' cottages in County Kerry has practically been suspended since 1936 owing to the failure of the local authority to take adequate measures for the collection of outstanding arrears of rents of cottages.  In the year 1932, the arrears amounted to £10,000, and there was a progressive increase up to 1941, when the arrears amounted to approximately £18,000.  Although arrears amounting to £4,638 have since been struck off as irrecoverable, the arrears still due and collectable on the 30th. September amounted to £10,822.  The position in Kerry in regard to rent collection compares most unfavourably with the adjoining counties.  I would only be too happy to promote measures for the improvement of housing in Kerry, but the Deputy will <Col N="495" /> realise that, while the local authority fail to collect from the tenants reasonable rents for their cottages, proposals for the building of further cottages could not be entertained.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There are several provisions here which bring in County Mayo as a contributing factor and on this section I would like to put the views of the Mayo County Council before the Minister.  We object to having to pay anything under this Bill, as we derive no benefit whatever from it.  We say that no proper inquiry was held to ascertain who should be responsible for the costs, before the Bill was introduced.  The only inquiry that was made by the Department, so far as we are aware, was a letter addressed to the Mayo County Council in 1941, in which the Minister stated that Galway <Col N="502" /> County Council and Galway Corporation did not want to let County Mayo out of its liability under the former legislation.</P>
      <P>There is no navigation carried on in County Mayo under this Bill, yet we are asked to pay for something from which we derive no benefit whatsoever. I would ask the Minister to introduce a section, on the Report Stage, or to amend the existing measure, to cut out the liability of County Mayo to contribute anything under this Bill. County Galway derives some benefit from it, as the canal in County Galway serves some purpose to the Galway people, but we are asked to pay money for works being carried on in County Galway and, naturally, we in Mayo object to contributing under those conditions.</P>
      <P>There might be some sense in handing over this scheme, or in handing over the rivers affected, to the Drainage Board, as far as the County Mayo is concerned.  It might serve some useful purpose to the people of Mayo, but the handing of it over to these trustees under a navigation scheme runs directly contrary to the interests of people concerned regarding drainage in County Mayo, as the water will have to be maintained at a certain level in this navigation scheme.  I am sure it is 20 years since the part of Mayo affected by this particular scheme was used for navigation.  Some kind of a pleasure steamer used to go up there about once a year, some 15 or 20 years ago, but that has been discontinued for very many years past and Mayo County now has no interest whatever in this particular scheme, though we are being saddled with the cost of it to the extent of one-tenth, under this particular Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are also left in doubt as to the position regarding the arrears under the old trustees.  When we were deriving no benefit under the Bill in the County Mayo, we had no representatives from the County Mayo on the former board of trustees.  I understand a considerable amount of arrears is due by the County Mayo under the old legislation and this Bill does not say what is to happen to those arrears. <Col N="503" /> As far as I understand the Bill, it simply transfers to the new trustees all the rights and liabilities of the old trustees, with the exception of their qualifications.</P>
    <P>There is another question which might well arise so far as the former trustees are concerned, that is, whether they were proper trustees, whether they had the qualifications under the 1856 Act and whether anything they purported to do was in fact <i>ultra vires</i> their powers under that Act.  At all events, if this Bill is passed with this section in it as it now stands, being silent as to the position regarding the arrears, it simply is passing on a burden of litigation between the Counties of Mayo and Galway, without defining the position between them.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill as a whole are in direct conflict with the Report of the Drainage Commission.  The Drainage Commission, in dealing with this very problem, stated in paragraph 302 of their report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Several of the existing navigations are still nominally maintained, although traffic is negligible and there are no prospects of increased trade as the traffic formerly carried is now more expeditiously dealt with on the roads.  To bring some of these navigations to an efficient state would now require a considerable outlay without any compensatory increase in business.  The abandonment, however, of these canals or canalised rivers might in some cases leave them available for river discharge and give an increased outlet for floods; in other cases, where interference with existing water rights would not prevent it, the drying out of canals might improve adjacent lands subject to waterlogging.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, it is proposed to keep the canals from the navigation point of view, whereas the drainage report suggested that the canals in this particular area should be dried out, from a drainage point of view.  The same report refers to the very canal dealt with under this particular Bill:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="504" />&ldquo;303.  The short canal, 5/8ths of a mile in length, connecting Lough Corrib and the River Corrib with the sea, is a case in point.  Over it are five swing bridges built in 1859. Two were renewed last year and the renewal of three more and of the lock gates is contemplated.  The total cost of these works is from £40,000 to £50,000, although the only traffic consists of one or two pleasure boats making one passage up or down the canal each year and these boats could easily be lorried to or from the docks at very little expense.  If abandoned, the canal will form a very useful drainage channel for dealing with flood discharge.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Drainage Commission, in respect of the very canal this Bill deals with, suggests abandonment.  It suggests that the canal, if used for anything, might be used for flood discharge. Although it is suggested in the Bill that some of the bridges over the canal will have to be taken over by the local authority, the canal will still have to be maintained as a canal.  Certain water levels, which will affect drainage and flooding, will have to be maintained.</P>
    <P>As far as the County Mayo is concerned, its only interest in this Bill would be on its drainage side.  The navigation side of it does not affect the County Mayo at all.  If the Bill goes through in its present form it will mean that it will be a hindrance, if anything, to drainage.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should provide that the part of the County Mayo affected by the Bill should be transferred to the drainage authority. That, possibly, might meet the position in the County Mayo.  As far as the County Mayo is concerned, there is no question of navigation there.  There is an old canal that is dry.  It was built in the famine times.  It forms part of this canal between the Mask and the Corrib.  It has been lying there, and there is no water in it.  I understand that in those days they had no cement and that when the canal was opened the water disappeared through the fissures.  The only time we ever hear about that canal is when somebody's cow falls into it and breaks its neck, <Col N="505" /> and then there is a claim against the county council.  That is part of the navigation works under this Bill in respect of which the County Mayo is being asked to make a contribution of 10 per cent. towards the cost.  I understand that all the principles in the Bill affect the County Galway solely.  If there is a fight between the Galway Corporation and the Galway County Council as to the cost, I do not see why that should affect the people in the County Mayo.  There was never a penny spent by the former trustees of the navigation in connection with their functions in the County Mayo, and there never will be a penny spent in it under this Bill.  The cost of the bridges that it is proposed to build over this canal is solely a matter for the people of Galway, and it would be absolutely unjust and inequitable if the people of the County Mayo were to be asked to make a contribution for the maintenance of bridges over a canal that is situated in the County Galway, or for the operation of that canal.</P>
    <P>The Minister has suggested that, under the Bill, these canal bridges will be passed over to the local authority in Galway.  That may be so, but the question of the maintenance of the canal will still be there.  We in the County Mayo are being asked to bear 10 per cent. of the cost of the maintenance of the canal, so that if anything arises in connection with the maintenance of it, or if anything falls into it, we in the County Mayo will still be liable under the Bill for 10 per cent of the cost.  So far as I know, the people to whom the canal may be of some use and who will derive any benefit from it, are not being asked to make any contribution under the Bill.  I refer to the millers who use the canal.  I understand there are five or six of them in Galway, and that they use the canal for power and water.  There is no mention of them under the Bill.  As I see it, the Bill is not wanted either by the Galway people or the Mayo people.  If it is necessary to introduce this Bill for the purpose of getting rid of some legal tangle, well and good.  The big objection we have to the Bill is that we cannot possibly derive any benefit <Col N="506" /> from it.  It does not serve any purpose as far as the County Mayo is concerned.  Why, therefore, should we be asked to contribute something under this when we have absolutely no interest in it?  Before the Report Stage is reached, I would ask the Minister to make further inquiries as to the old position and, on the justice of the matter, to exclude the County Mayo from the provisions of the Bill. There is no reason why we should have anything to do with it, or why we should be asked to pay anything under it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that I will strenuously oppose any provision in the Bill which seeks to place a burden on the ratepayers of the County Mayo.  The title of this measure is the Lough Corrib Navigation Bill.  In the definition section we find that</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the expression `the Navigation' means the navigation in the District of Loughs Corrib, Mask and Carra in the Borough of Galway and Counties of Galway and Mayo.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has never been a navigation system, to my certain knowledge, in the County Mayo, or even in portion of it.  As the last speaker has said, an attempt was made at one time to link up the Mask and the Corrib, but because of the porous nature of the sub-soil the water went to earth, so that for almost 100 years the canal has been known as the dry canal. Is the Minister proposing to have a navigation system in the County Mayo, linking up Galway with Lough Mask and Ballina?  If so, I would remind him that it is only a short time since the House voted a big sum of money to Córas Iompair Éireann for the provision of transport.  Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that if he examines the matter properly he will find that a navigation system in our part of the world would be rather a flop, from the financial point of view.  Under this Bill the Mayo County Council is being asked to contribute 10 per cent. of the cost of the upkeep of certain bridges.  The people in County Mayo will derive no benefit whatever from that contribution, and for that reason I am opposed to this proposal.  The <Col N="507" /> Mayo County Council has been making a contribution for some years.  I understand there are some arrears due at the moment, the payment of which has been refused by the Mayo County Council, and rightly so I would say. Under the navigation system that was carried out almost 100 years ago, weirs were made, with the result that instead of being any use their existence has caused the flooding of good land and has prevented drainage being carried out.  If there was anything in the Bill which made provision for the execution of drainage works, which is a big problem with us, I would welcome the Bill heartily.</P>
    <P>I cannot see that the County Mayo is going to derive any benefit whatever from this Bill, and for that reason I am opposed to it.  The Bill seeks to place a burden on the Mayo County Council in connection with the navigation of the Corrib.  I think that system has been outmoded long ago.  Road transport has left it high and dry.  I think it is a useless business to try to make County Mayo liable for even a small contribution under this Bill.  I agree that the 10 per cent. is small, but I do not see why the County Mayo should be saddled even with that small contribution.  This Bill may do a certain amount of good to Galway. This matter is one solely for the people of Galway.  So far as this navigation is concerned, we in the County Mayo have been the losers up to this, and, therefore, I do not think it would be right to make us contribute to a work from which we will derive no benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Lough Corrib navigation was provided from a date almost 100 years ago, and there is a board of trustees at present administering the navigation.  The Mayo County <Col N="508" /> Council is at present liable for the payment of 32 per cent. of the cost of administering the Lough Corrib navigation. The main effect of this Bill is to effect relief for the Mayo ratepayers. Their present liability for 32 per cent. of the cost is being reduced to 10 per cent.  Deputy Moran suggests that some of the works should be abandoned.  One of the purposes of this Bill is to provide a means of abandoning works not locally required, without the formality of a provisional Order confirmed by legislation. Deputy Moran suggests that the Mayo County Council contribution should be reduced below 10 per cent. If there is a case for reducing it below 10 per cent., then this Bill provides power to amend further the proportion of the total cost to be paid by the various contributing authorities.  The Mayo County Council can make a case at any time that they wish for a further variation in the contributions, but I I think they will find that their <i>locus standi</i> in the matter will be seriously impaired so long as their past contributions are in arrears.  The obligation of the Mayo County Council to pay the contribution under the existing navigation award is a legal obligation, and the Mayo County Council cannot escape that obligation merely by deciding not to pay.  Most of us would avoid paying our debts by that method if it could be so simply adopted.</P>
      <P>It is admitted that the present board of trustees is not constituted in accordance with what would be regarded as modern requirements. The qualifications required for membership are now almost impossible and, therefore, we are proposing in the Bill to alter the qualifications for membership of the board.  It is not correct that, as Deputy Moran said, Mayo County Council has no representative on the board.  Two of the present trustees are resident in County Mayo.  There are four vacancies on the board, and the new board as constituted under this Bill will include, we hope, a representative of the Mayo contributing area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides for the transfer of any portion of the works to a drainage <Col N="509" /> authority.  It provides for the transfer of portion of the works to a local authority if that appears to be a suitable arrangement.  It provides also for the abandonment of the works if it is clear that they are no longer required.  This navigation was at one time more important than it is now, but, until other arrangements for dealing with it have been made, its administration by the board of trustees must be maintained.  The purpose of this Bill is to reconstitute the board of trustees with new qualifications and on a different basis, and to provide for a variation in the proportion in which the expenses of the trustees are defrayed by the contributing authorities.  The effect of the change is to increase substantially the proportion of the expenses to be met by Galway City, and to decrease substantially the proportion to be met by County Mayo.  Galway City in the past contributed 16 per cent; in future the contribution will be 60 per cent.  Mayo County Council contributed in the past 32 per cent.; in future they will contribute only 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moran stated that there is no mention in the Bill of charges upon persons using the canals for power or water purposes.  It is not necessary to have any such mention in the Bill, inasmuch as the board of trustees has power to collect tolls and other charges for services rendered, and its powers in that regard are not being amended by the Bill in any way whatever.  I think, therefore, that the objections to the Bill are founded largely upon misunderstanding. So long as the navigation remains there, untransferred to a drainage authority or not abandoned, some provision must be made for maintaining it.  The responsibility of maintaining it rests upon the board of trustees.  The effect of the Bill is to reconstitute the board of trustees upon a more representative basis, and to vary the extent of the contributions which have to be made to the expenses of the board by the contributing authorities.  It operates to relieve County Mayo of its former obligation; it effects a substantial reduction in that obligation, and ensures for them <Col N="510" /> representation upon the board in proportion to their contribution.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it will save discussion on other sections if I ask the Minister a further question.  Mayo is interested, as I said, solely in the drainage side of this matter.  The Bill provides that those works can be handed over to other bodies such as a drainage authority, but the Bill also provides that that must be with the consent of the drainage authority.  In the case of a white elephant such as this, it is quite possible that nobody would want to take it over.  The drainage authority might refuse to take it over.  Could the Minister see his way to make provision cutting out the consent of the drainage authority, so that those works might be transferred to the drainage authority without making their consent, as it were, a condition precedent?  The drainage authority might adopt the view&mdash;I could quite understand it&mdash;that they do not want to take over canals or waterways that might be very expensive and might not fit in with their ideas of national drainage.</P>

      <P>On Sections 2 and 3, I notice that there is to be a censorship of publications board consisting of five persons and an appeal board consisting of three members. There is no great principle involved here, I admit, but one does not like to see a position where there are only three members of an appeal board instead of five.  What is the defence for that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see whether there is any particular defence for it, but it would not be easy to get ten people voluntarily to serve; that is, five on each board.  If we can possibly get a judge amongst the three on the appeal board we shall do so. I may not succeed in doing so, but I intend to ask a judge to serve, and if you had two competent people to serve with him, I think that should be sufficient.  As I say, it would not be easy to get five.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>According to Section 5, an officer of customs and excise may detain on importation any book which, in his opinion, ought to be examined by the censorship board under this Act.  That seems to be an extraordinary position: to give to a very busy customs officer, who may meet an old lady coming in with a book that has, say, a suggestive cover, the job of satisfying himself, after a glance at the book, that it is a case for censorship.  How can an officer satisfy himself that a book is censorable in these circumstances?  Is it the intention of the Act to prevent individuals from bringing in any particular book with them?  In practice, it would amount to the customs officer holding up everybody who happened to have a book under his arm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If the book appears to him to be a book that ought to be prohibited, he is entitled to take it and send it on to the board.  Of course, that power already exists. Under an Act of 1876 they have that power to detain books.  It is only when they come across a book that <Col N="513" /> appears to them to be a type of book for censorship that they are entitled to detain it and send it to the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, it would be putting the powers of a customs officer very high to ask him to decide there and then whether a book is censorable or not.  Of course, I can understand his exercising such powers in the case of pictures or postcards, and so on, but surely, in the case of a book, he could not come to a conclusion of that kind on the spot?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the officer stopping a book that has been banned, but how will this be carried out?  How can the officer make up his mind, after a casual glance, and say that a book is indecent, or is not indecent?  Whilst appreciating the fact that it is necessary to stop a banned book, I cannot understand how this will be worked.  How will the officer make up his mind, in practice, as to whether or not a book should be detained? How does the Minister suggest to the House that this is going to work?</P>

      <P>It has not worked. Nothing of the kind.  It never did work.  The Act that the Minister refers to was a British Act and applied to England, with a population of 40,000,000 people, and had to do with all kinds of books coming from abroad. It is a different matter here altogether. I do not know what sort of a mess this is going to be.  There is no option for the customs officers, in practice, except to seize every book that comes in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If he had no intelligence, I suppose he might do that.  This has been in operation since the Act came into force, and as far as I am informed, it has worked reasonably well.  The officers do not go out of their way to seize books, but if they happen to see books coming through the ports or through the post&mdash;this is mainly concerned with the post&mdash;that they think ought to be detained, they will do so and forward them to the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is absolutely essential that this power should be in the hands of customs officers, if the Act is to work at all.  They are the people into whose hands objectionable books are most likely to come, because in dealing with the mails or with passengers' luggage, they may frequently find such books, and would send them to the censorship board.  If we were to deprive customs officers of this power, the Act, to a large extent, would be unworkable.  Otherwise, it would rest with ordinary citizens to bring such books to the notice of the board.  These State officials deal with mails, luggage, and with practically everything that comes in, and they could very properly bring such books to the notice of the board.  It would be ridiculous to deprive them of this power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the last Deputy missed the point.  We are not concerned with books that are banned, of which there will be thousands, but a person may come in with a book and the customs officer may have a doubt after a glance at it, and may form the opinion that it is a book that should be censored.  I cannot see how that can be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This is to make sure that what has been done was legally justifiable.  The officers have been doing this work, but there was a question whether they were acting legally.  This section makes the point clear, if there are any cases in doubt. I am not saying that they were not right, but there was a doubt.  Officers have been doing this duty since the 1929 Act was passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly there must be some authority to look after books coming into the country.  We know that objectionable books have been brought in by travellers.  All customs officers are not students of literature and cannot know whether books are objectionable or not.  I am looking at this matter from the point of view of a person who brings in a book and finds himself in an embarrassing position when it is seized.  My only anxiety is to see that this authority is exercised with care and with discretion by customs officers.  It is quite possible, now that the war is over, that books will be coming in in greater numbers, and that abuses may arise because of seizures on an indiscriminate scale from travellers.  On the other hand, I am not in a position to suggest any alternative method of dealing with the matter.  This section throws on customs officers the duty of judging what is contraband in literature, what is good and bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That was done under the old Act.  Under the British they could do that when books were known to be obscene.  Since the other Act was passed, I am told that almost half the books that were censored came from that source.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>A former member of the judiciary of this country was held up on one occasion by customs officers because he was supposed to have a banned book in his possession.  The title of the book bore some resemblance to a book that was already banned, and in going through the luggage the customs officer noticed the title of what he thought was the banned book.  Subsequent inquiry showed that the book in question was not banned, and that it had no relation to a book that was banned.  Discretion will have to be exercised by those on the spot to ban books.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>I believe that books have been held up and then sent back. Discretion has been used.  You cannot do anything else.  Everybody knows that the ordinary policeman has to exercise discretion and so must customs officers.  You cannot lay down a hard and fast rule.  The officer must use his discretion.  If a mistake is made and mistakes have been made occasionally, I do not see any remedy except to apologise and to return such books.</P>

I can visualise a situation arising in which members of this House are going to be pestered by this provision.  Personally I do not like it.  I cannot see how members of the Oireachtas are going to function as an appeal committee in matters of this kind, because to do the job conscientiously they would require to go through a particular book.  A situation might arise in which skilful authors or publishers would wangle an appeal through members of the Oireachtas, perhaps, to evade the payment of the five-pound fee.  I can see this matter becoming a nuisance to public representatives and I suggest that it be reconsidered. An amendment could be put down for the Report Stage.

      <P>This provision was inserted as an extra safeguard.  We had, at least, one motion in the Seanad objecting to something done by the Minister under the present Act.  Up to the present, the Minister has had to take responsibility for censorship and I thought that a question of public interest might arise under the new conditions and that public representatives might be interested to see that certain books should not be banned.  The five members of the Oireachtas might never act in this connection but, if they felt that a certain book should not be banned, I thought that it was only right they should be given power to lodge an appeal.  I am prepared to hear any case against the provision, which was inserted to ensure that the Act would be worked in accordance with the public interest.  I cannot see anything wrong with the provision.  It is a new idea and it was introduced because Deputies came to me from time to time and stated that they thought certain books should not have been banned.  When we were considering this Bill, it struck me as a good idea that Deputies should be given this power inasmuch as I shall be out of the picture in future so far as the banning of books is concerned.  I think that the provision is an improvement.</P>

I do not think that there are five men in the House who are competent to pronounce such a judgment.

      <P>I am not disposed to press the provision upon the House. Deputy Roddy suggested that five prominent persons be specified in this connection and that was what I had in mind when I introduced this provision. I do not see how you could get more representative persons than members of this House.  There will be no compulsion on any Deputy to object to the banning of a book.  He is merely given the right, with other Deputies, to lodge an appeal against the banning of a book.  The onus of appealing is, therefore, not being placed upon members of the Oireachtas.  Under the present Act, the responsibility of banning books was placed upon me.  I acted on the advice of a board but I had to take the responsibility of imposing the ban.  All the members of the board who advised me, with one exception, were laymen.</P>

I would not at all agree with Deputy McMenamin that there are not five members of this House who would be competent to decide this question.  The vast majority of the members would be quite competent to do so.  I do not see how you could get more representative persons <Col N="522" /> than members of this House but, if members do not desire to have the right proposed in the Bill, I shall not press the matter.

      <P>I appeal to the Minister seriously to consider the views put forward by Deputy Roddy.  I do not agree that a change should be made for the reasons put forward by Deputy McMenamin but there is a great deal in what Deputy Roddy says, that Deputies and Senators will be placed in a very invidious position if they are given power to act in this way.  We must have regard to the fact that there is a small body of opinion outside which regards censorship as antiquated and behind the times.  I think that citizens with special qualifications should be selected for this purpose. In my opinion, there is need for this censorship.  There is great need to prevent the sale of books, periodicals and papers which contain matter which is not only indecent but vulgarly indecent. Representatives of the people in the Dáil and Seanad, who might be put on a board which would be appealed to in this way would however find it very difficult to exercise an independent judgment without thought of the political reactions to themselves personally.</P>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister that he should give the case put forward by Deputy Roddy serious consideration. I am prepared to say that I agree with the point of view put forward by Deputy Roddy but not for the reason that has been expressed by Deputy McMenamin.  I think the average member of the Dáil or Seanad, if he were not a member of either body, would be a suitable and capable member of a board such as is suggested and would be able and willing to carry out the duties of that particular office.  It is because of the position of members of both Houses that I think that the point of view which Deputy Roddy has put forward should have some consideration from the Minister.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (2) and substitute the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  A prohibition Order under this section in respect of a periodical publication, in respect of which a prohibition Order or an Order under Section 10 of the Act of 1929 has not previously been made, shall, unless previously revoked under this Act, be in force for, and expire at the end of, whichever of the following periods is appropriate, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in the case of a periodical publication which, immediately before the making of the prohibition Order, was being published at intervals ordinarily exceeding one month, the period of 12 months from the date on which the prohibition Order comes into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  in the case of a periodical publication which, immediately before the making of the prohibition Order, was being published at intervals ordinarily exceeding one week but not ordinarily exceeding one <Col N="524" /> month, the period of six months from such date.</P>
    <P>(c)  in any other case, the period of three months from such date.</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with the period for which periodicals may be prohibited.  Under Section 9 (2) as it stands, the first prohibition Order made in respect of any periodical will remain in force for only three months.  That is exactly the period provided for also in Section 7 of the 1929 Act but since the Bill was circulated it has been suggested to me that this period is too short for monthly and quarterly periodicals.  I agree with that view and it is therefore proposed by the amendment that in the case of a publication published at intervals exceeding one month the prohibition Order should have effect for a period of 12 months from the date on which it comes into operation and that in the case of periodicals published at intervals exceeding one week but not exceeding one month, the prohibition Order should last for six months.  The 12 months ban would apply to quarterly magazines so that during the period of 12 months four issues would be banned.  There is no point in having a ban of only three months in the case of such periodicals.  Then in the case of monthly publications, the ban would last for six months.  In the case of all other publications, dailies or weeklies, the ban will last three months.  I should add that when a periodical is prohibited for a second time, the Order will remain in force indefinitely unless it is revoked.  That was the position hitherto.</P>

      <P>This, in my opinion, is the really objectionable section of the Bill and really nullifies the whole effect of the Bill.  The section says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No person shall, except under and in accordance with a permit, import any prohibited book or any prohibited periodical publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a person is charged under Section 186 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, with the importation of a prohibited book or a prohibited <Col N="526" /> periodical publication, it shall be a good defence for him to prove that the book or periodical publication was imported otherwise than for sale or distribution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is to say that people in this country can import books for themselves and if they are prosecuted for having imported or having in their possession indecent books, they can put up the defence that it is for their own use that they got them.  In my opinion that kills the whole effect of the Bill.  I do not think it can be defended and I would ask the Minister to strike out sub-section (2) of the section because I must resist it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions of this section are in accordance with the practice hitherto observed.  A person might bring in a prohibited book without being aware that it was prohibited. The practice has been simply to confiscate that book if it was found and the person concerned was not prosecuted.  The book might be the personal property of the person concerned; he might be coming from some place abroad where the circulation of the book was not prohibited and he might not be aware that it was banned here.  The practice has been, as I say, to seize such a book and that was the end of it.  I do not see anything wrong in that.  There was never a prosecution and all we are providing now is to make it clear that it would be a good defence for a person charged under the section to prove that the book or periodical was imported otherwise than for sale or distribution.</P>

I must oppose that and I intend to oppose it.  While the Minister says that it refers, perhaps, to the case of a foreigner having a book that he does not know is banned, and which is taken from him, that is not what the sub-section says&mdash;&ldquo;Where a person is charged, under Section 186 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, with the importation of a prohibited book or a prohibited periodical publication it shall be a good defence for him to prove that the book or periodical publication was imported otherwise than for sale or distribution&rdquo;&mdash;in other words, that it was for his own personal use.  It can be imported through the post or otherwise because there is no prohibition as to the method in which it can be imported. There is no use in passing this Censorship Bill if that is going to be permitted. It is all right for the Minister to say that it applies only to strangers coming into this country who do not know anything about the law but this section does not limit it in that way. The Minister has power to issue a licence for the importation of a banned book.  There may be cases where that would be necessary because the book might be of scientific value or something like that.  I am prepared to give the Minister that power but I certainly object to this sub-section and I shall oppose it.</P>

      <P>No.  Of course, a person may evade the customs, but if he is caught trying to bring in a book that is prohibited it shall be a good defence for him to say that it was not for sale, that it was his personal property.  In the case where the Minister gives a permit, the book or periodical can come through the post or in any other way.  Once the permit is there there is no prohibition.  In the case of a person who brings in an obscene book, if he can satisfy the customs that it is not for sale, it is a good defence, if he is prosecuted under the 1876 Act, to say that it was his personal property and only for his own use.  That has been the practice up to this and I do not see any reason to alter it.  I think it would lead to a lot of unnecessary prosecutions.  I do not agree with Deputy McMenamin that everybody will go over to England and bring in prohibited books.  This sub-section is simply to bring the law into line with what the practice has been.</P>

      <P>I just want to make the point on your ruling Sir, that some of the amendments that have been put down do not directly impose <Col N="531" /> a charge upon public funds, but they do attempt to make provision that a person who is entitled under a particular Act to get a particular pension shall not have withdrawn as much money by abatement as the Bill as it now stands would withdraw.

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That it is expedient to authorise such payments out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas as are necessary to give effect to any Act of the present session to amend the Military Service Pensions Acts, 1924 to 1945.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise two points on the money resolution just by way of question which I had not an opportunity of raising on the Second Reading.  There was a general feeling amongst a large number of people&mdash;I think it was expressed almost unanimously in the Seanad on one occasion&mdash;that this type of rebate on military service pensions should be completely wiped out; that the time had passed when it had served the purpose for which it was originally intended. I should like to ask the Minister what the Bill as at present drafted will cost, and what the cost would be if the rebate was entirely removed? <Col N="532" /> The second point I should like to make is one which I thought might have been dealt with in the Bill. There is at present a discrimination between the way in which officers serving in the Army are dealt with, whether they are entitled to pensions under the 1924 Act or the 1934 Act. Let us take a commandant serving in the Army at present, whether as an emergency commandant or as a regular commandant.  If he is a person who is entitled to a military service pension under the 1924 Act, he does not get that pension; he simply gets his ordinary pay and allowances as a commandant.  The pension that he would be entitled to under the 1924 Act is completely held in abeyance.  A commandant, however, who is entitled to a pension under the 1934 Act gets his pay and allowances, but he also gets a pension under that Act abated to the extent to which the law as it stands allows it to be abated.  That means that there is a discrimination between officers of the same rank and who are performing the same duties, the person who suffers the disability being a person who has longer experience in the Army than the other. As the Minister is wiping out some of the grievous anomalies by this Bill, I thought that he would have given some consideration to that matter, because it is a state of affairs that is invidious and ought not to stand.  As the Minister is amending the situation somewhat now, I think the situation should be amended in respect of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the suggestion of Deputy Mulcahy. As the Minister is aware, a number of officers&mdash;not very many&mdash;are affected adversely because they are in receipt of pensions under the 1924 Act.  The Minister may say that the 1924 Act should not have been so framed that it would include officers who might subsequently be receiving an allowance or financial emoluments from public funds. But it is possible that when the 1924 Act was drafted a situation like the present emergency was not considered; that a number of officers&mdash;I do not think there are more than 100 affected by this&mdash; who would be serving in the same ranks and, in many cases, doing <Col N="533" /> identical duties with others would have their pensions abated entirely because they come under the 1924 Act while other officers who are entitled to pensions under the 1934 Act draw their pensions during the emergency, even though they are serving under the same conditions, except that they are emergency and not regular officers.  I think the Minister would do well to bring in an amendment on the Report Stage to deal with this matter.  The number of officers affected is not very large, but the Minister must realise that they have a definite grievance. In view of the attempt which the Minister is making to reduce the discrimination under the abatement provisions in the schedule, I think he should also bring the position of these officers into line.</P>

      <P>I said in the course of the discussion last week that this Bill was as far as the Government were prepared to go.  After that, I was able to induce the Government to amend the Bill in respect to the matters dealt with in the amendments which I am introducing.  I want to assure the Deputies who have spoken, and any other Deputies who may like to speak on the subject, that such a suggestion will not be considered.  It is not intended to amend this Bill in any respect further than I have indicated. The matters referred to by Deputy Mulcahy are matters which I suppose could not have been foreseen.  The people who are in receipt of these pensions under the 1934 Act came into the Army in a certain category and it was not foreseen at the time that any person would be coming into the Army who would be entitled to receive benefits under the 1934 Act.  If you like, it was a slip of drafting or something else; but I am not going to alter the position by putting all the other people on the same level.  If anything were to be done, it would have to be done in the reverse direction. I do not propose to take any action in respect to it.</P>

      <P>(2)  The references to remuneration or to an allowance in sub-section (1) of Section 8 of the Act of 1924, and in the Third Schedule to the Act of 1924, as amended by sub-section (1) of this section, shall be construed as excluding references to&mdash;</P>

    <P>This amendment will cover the out-of-pocket expenses incurred in performing the offices which are not included in the remuneration for the purposes of abatement.  I should say that, by a decision of the court some time ago, the Department was forced to abandon its practice of allowing pensioners, such as tax and rate collectors, expenses they necessarily incurred in performing the duties of their officers.

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given us some figures which show that the total increased expenditure incurred by the abatement proposals in the amending Bill will amount to £30,000 and he says that, if the abatement were abolished, it would cost £50,000, which would be reducing annually and, possibly, reducing from <Col N="536" /> now on at a far faster rate than up to this.  While the proposed amendment is a big improvement, I think the Minister, now that he has decided to go so far, should abolish the abatement entirely and give some opportunity to army officers, who will be retiring, to get jobs in particular posts without having their pensions abated.</P>
      <P>As the situation is at the moment, any person who has a military service pension and who has been fortunate enough to secure an appointment with a company or a firm that is not subsidised or contributed to in any way from public funds, is entitled to draw the full pension.  On the other hand, some officers&mdash;not all of them with large pensions but some of them who were officers in lower ranks&mdash;have got jobs under local authorities or under such bodies as the Irish Sugar Company, the Turf Development Board and the Electricity Supply Board.  These officers have their pensions abated, as the particular bodies or firms to which they are attached are subsidised or contributed to from public funds.  In some cases, due to the emoluments they get from the actual positions they occupy, some of these officers have had their pensions almost entirely abated. The maximum pension for a commandant is £290, for a major £340, for a colonel £400, and for a major-general £500.  These rates, of themselves, are quite low and, if this amendment is passed, it will mean that a commandant will lose 10 per cent., a major 15 per cent., a colonel 20 per cent. and a major-general 30 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This situation is further aggravated by the retiring age.  A number of these officers will retire before they might, in the normal way, reach promotion to a higher rank.  Very few have retired at the highest rank, except a few members of the Defence Council.  Some of them will retire at a lower rank than that which they could hope to reach, because of age.  They are prevented from getting the full pension, because of this unfair abatement clause schedule.  I suggest to the Minister, without going into the reasons now why these pensions were awarded, that as the amount is small, and as he has admitted it is getting smaller every <Col N="537" /> year, and as a number of these officers will die off and the number will become smaller very quickly, he should consider bringing in an amendment, on the Report Stage, withdrawing entirely the abatement clause in the Bill.  He realises that, in the near future, a very large number of army officers, particularly those old officers, will be demobilised and their services entirely dispensed with, as they will have reached the retiring age.</P>
    <P>These Acts&mdash;particularly the 1924 Act&mdash;are operating unfairly on these men and operating unfairly on particularly on those who got jobs where public funds were involved.  They see fellow-officers who were fortunate enough to get work elsewhere, or who were fortunate enough to retire at an earlier age and were, in consequence, able to get into business or get into a better financial position, possibly because of their youth, reaping the rewards of their early retirement. These men, who have sustained the Army over a long period and who have given long and useful service, are put in an invidious position, and I suggest to the Minister that he should make a further effort and wipe out the clause entirely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I also would urge the Minister very sincerely to make some concession to these old-time volunteers. I am pleased to state that, in urging this on the Minister, I am urging the nearest thing to a unanimous demand that we ever heard in this House, as judged by the Second Reading debate. Any Deputies who spoke, irrespective of Party, urged the Minister to reconsider this penal levy on people whose services were given to the State.  Now, one could understand the Minister's desire to keep on some kind of a levy if it were a levy or deduction from pension based on a person's income. If anybody with an income of £600 a year were deprived of so much of their pension, that would be understandable; and it would mean giving pensions to those who needed them most and making a deduction from those who needed them least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are in a position to make a return of the <Col N="538" /> income of every pensioner.  If the Minister made a percentage reduction on all pensions, starting at 1 per cent., with 2 per cent. on the next £100 and 3 per cent. on the next £100, there would be a substantial gain to public funds and there would not be a penal tax, a penal levy, a punishment, on people whose services are given to the State rather than to independent firms outside.  What is being perpetrated under this Bill is that a person, not in State service, may have as income a salary of £10,000 a year and the State pays that person a full pension; but if a person in the State service has a salary of over £300 a year, then there is punitive action in the sense that we put a penalty on that person for serving the State.  I do not think there is any defence for such punitive action against people who elected to serve the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister may hark back to the parent Act.  Every one of us can see the reason why, in 1924, these stoppages were laid down.  The State was just being formed.  All the services of the State had to be equipped. It was a time when public attention, public consideration, was being given to people who had pre-Truce records and, whether it was a Government appointment or a local appointment, everybody with a pre-Truce record would be lined up in a queue demanding appointments, claiming positions, on account of his pre-Truce service. To meet that exceptional state of affairs there was a very bíg inducement laid down in the parent Act to encourage people to go out into the commercial, industrial, professional and agricultural life of the country rather than seek State employment.</P>
    <P>That was a temporary phase in the history of the country and originally this penal clause was meant to meet that perculiar situation that arises only once in every country and never is repeated.  But yet, apparently, just because a remedy was created to meet a temporary Government embarrassment, that levy is to continue for all time.  Honestly, I do not think there is any defence for it.  I think the mere fact of introducing this Bill is an admission <Col N="539" /> that an injustice is being done. This Bill, in effect, is merely a measure to reduce the injustice.  That is not the way for a Government to face up to its responsibilities.  If the system is unjust, then an amending Bill should be introduced to scrap that system.  If stoppages are required, if the State cannot afford this extra £20,000 for men the best part of whose life has passed, if it is a case of the £20,000 being an obstacle, then I think the fairest thing would be to introduce an amending Bill providing that so much will be taken off everybody's pension for every £500 a year of income they may have.  I believe that 1 per cent. would collect as much money by that scheme as 10 or 15 or 20 per cent. would under this scheme.</P>
    <P>I most strongly protest against those who elected or were selected to serve the State being marked for special punitive action.  I do not really think that there is any defence for it beyond this, that a precedent was created 20 years ago.  I was anxious to put forward an amendment proposing that the stoppages begin with an income over £500, but that amendment has been ruled out of order on the ground that it was proposing increased expenditure.  As a matter of fact, it does not propose increased expenditure; it proposes that the State takes less out of the pockets of certain people.  It is perfectly in order for any Deputy to put down an amendment to the Finance Bill that the income-tax be reduced and I suggest my proposal is just the very same. The force of one amendment would be to urge the State to take less out of the pockets of the individual income-tax payer; my proposal, if passed here, would urge the State to take less out of the pockets of a few very highly-deserving people.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Cosgrave said, we are reaching a point in the history of the Army when this continued stoppage is a very serious thing.  We have, in our service pension scheme, provision made that officers under a certain rank will be compulsorily retired from the Army at a very early age.  I think that <Col N="540" /> scheme is a copy of other service pension schemes where the conditions are quite dissimilar.  At the time our Army was built up, the men at the very top were very much the same age as the lowest-ranked officers.  The result of that was that there was no opportunity of promotion.  It was not a case of a man not doing his job properly or not having sufficient ability; the fact was that the men over him were quite as young as he was and there was no opportunity of promotion.</P>
    <P>In other armies it was customary to lay it down that a man of a certain age but still of junior rank would be compulsorily retired, the reason being that he was not a successful officer as there were opportunities for promotion. We have adopted that rule and applied it to our Army, not because the men were not able or successful officers, highly efficient in every way, but just because the vacancies were not there to promote them, and in the next year or two we are turning a lot of people out at 45&mdash; very deserving people who have given at least 20 years' service to the State.</P>
    <P>With most married men the age of 45 is the peak point of expense.  It is just the particular period when their children are growing up, when college fees and other moneys have to be found, when the children have to be launched in life.  That is the time when we will carelessly and thoughtlessly turn out hundreds of officers and, if they manage to get any appointment, directly or indirectly, under the Government, we will lock up the pensions they have so well earned by giving to the State the best years of their youth.  I do not think that is really defensible and I will ask Deputies who may not be as free as I am to advocate a course here in public, at least to use their influence between this and the Report Stage and to urge on the Government the advisability of doing the fair thing, in so far as they can.</P>
    <P>From my recollection of the figures given by the Minister on the Second Stage, the difference between going as far as this Bill proposes and going the whole hog, completely wiping out stoppages, would amount to £20,000 <Col N="541" /> per annum, less income-tax.  Let us remember that if the stoppage scale is removed completely, then the higher salaries in the main will be affected and, with higher salaries, as we all know, the bulk of what is given by one hand&mdash;or 50 per cent. of it&mdash;is taken back by the other, so that that figure of £20,000 is more apparent than real.  Probably, in practice, it would represent extra State expenditure in the neighbourhood of £13,000 or £14,000 for a very short number of years.  The average age of the people affected would probably be in the 50's, between 50 and 55.</P>
    <P>That particular set of people have, in the main, been subject to extensive or total stoppages of their pensions in the last 20 years.  Any of us can calculate the fine, the financial penalty, which has been imposed on people with even a comparatively small pension of £50 to £100 a year over the last 22 years.  In another group of cases, it applies to the last 11 years. Surely these people have been sufficiently punished financially for giving their services to the State and the public authorities without pursuing them to the grave.  The £20,000, or less, as it may be, is a very rapidly diminishing figure.  All the people affected are elderly.  They are dying off daily and their number is reducing rapidly.  It is not a sum about which we ought to be divided when there is a united demand to have justice done.</P>
    <P>We have cat-sparring now about a matter of £20,000 and probably before a month is out millions will be voted, and we will not bother as to the difference between £1,500,000 and £2,000,000; we will merely get at the nearest round figure.  But yet when it comes down to individuals, to individuals who in their own way and in their own time were pioneers, individuals who were outstanding, the people who made it possible for us to be either generous or niggardly in an Irish Parliament, these people are to be penalised.  And penalised for what?  For continuing to serve the State after it had been established. I cannot say that too often&mdash; that the injustice in this is the case of two men who served the State equally and who got equal pensions, but one <Col N="542" /> of whom is out in industry earning £10,000 a year and getting full pension, while the other continues to slog along serving the State and getting a reduced pension because he serves the State.</P>
    <P>None of us heard in the Minister's Second Reading opening or closing speech any defence for continuing that fine, for continuing this financial penalty on people for State service and for continuing that penalty particularly in view of the age of these people.  I again urge the Minister to consider the point he will be reaching in the Army in the next year or two.  He told us that he is taking on 700 new officers. He will be pushing out a very considerable number of old officers, if his scheme holds, at a comparatively young age.  Having pushed them out, the majority of these men, with 20 years' administrative experience, experience of control but no professional qualifications and no business experience in the ordinary way, will be seeking some form of employment with the various local authorities.  They are pushed out, as I say, at the peak point of expenditure for them and their tiny pensions are to be reduced.  Every call of justice from all sides of this House&mdash; the Minister has heard various Deputies speaking with one voice&mdash; demands that now, 21 years after the passing of the original Act which was introduced at a time when there was a very good case for stoppages, it is time to consider the advisability of remitting the stoppages entirely.</P>
    <P>Without looking a gift horse in the mouth, I think it would be true to say that the Minister's amendment is merely a gesture of giving something, which, in fact, gives nothing.  Surely it would be an unknown concept of public finance to tax a person on the expenses of his office.  Even the Revenue Commissioners would never dare to suggest that they should tax a man on the expenses incurred by him in his office or his public duty, and what the Minister proposes by way of amendment is that he will not make deductions from pensions in respect of expenses necessarily incurred in the performance of a man's duty.  That may be a concession as against what was in the original Act, but it is the bare minimum.  If the Minister is not <Col N="543" /> prepared to go the whole distance and remit these stoppages, I ask him at least to consider between now and Report Stage, in consultation with his colleagues, the advisability of commencing the stoppages at a salary of £500, and then carrying on according to the scale of stoppages outlined for each extra £100.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the representations made to the Minister by my friends, Deputies Cosgrave and O'Higgins.  It would be far better if the Minister agreed to abandon the abatement sections completely. The amendment proposed by the Minister will be welcomed by many in the service of the State and public authorities because it removes to a certain extent the injustice of abatement.  It will particularly be welcomed by the Guards who, for some considerable time past, have made the case that, when abatements were made, only their basic pay should be taken into account and that allowances which they get should not be taken into account.  They consulted senior counsel, who advised that, in making abatements on allowances, the Government were not acting in accordance with the law as it stood.  The Guards could have brought their case to court, but they refrained from doing so.  They relied on the Minister to redress their grievances and the confidence they placed in the Minister is now shown to have been completely justified.  The Guards, I know, will greatly appreciate the amendment, but I think it would be much better if the Minister again considered the matter, and, instead of going a certain part of the journey towards doing justice to these people, agreed to go the whole way and repeal entirely the sections providing for these abatements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that it would be very unfair to abate the pension of a man who had given long service to the State.  Most of these pensions are very small, and the men concerned find it very hard to make a living.  Many of them have big family commitments, and have had to try to make a start in life when they had reached middle age.  I would ask <Col N="544" /> the Minister to respond to the unanimous wish of the House that this abatement clause should be wiped out altogether.  I hope he will see his way to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to add my voice to the appeals which have been made to the Minister to abandon altogether the abatement clause which he is still hanging on to in a substantial measure in this amending Bill. I am prepared to concede at once that the amending Bill is a considerable improvement on the 1924 and 1934 Acts.  We can gain nothing by blinding ourselves to that fact.  Still, I think that the Minister is trying to defend something which he knows it is not easy to defend.  What is being done here is this: you are setting up a scale of pensions for persons under the Military Service Pensions Acts, and you are saying to certain persons legitimately entitled to pensions&mdash;their entitlement to them has not been questioned by anybody&mdash;that if they work for the State, then even though they are entitled to a pension from the State, the State will get back a portion of it in the form of a special levy which will be imposed under the powers conferred in this amending Bill, just as power to do so was conferred in the 1924 and 1934 Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may say that he is not imposing an abatement provision in respect of all classes of pensioners. But take the case of the two people instanced by Deputy O'Higgins, both entitled to military service pensions and both awarded pensions.  One says he will go out into the world, take up a profession or go into industry or commerce or even into the black market.  While so engaged he can get any income he likes, and there is no question of his pension being abated. The other person says that he will go into the State service and will conform to the exacting standard of rectitude required from State servants.  He says that he will put up with the low remuneration which is to be got in the State service in return for, perhaps, a sometimes illusory security.  The Minister says to the first person who goes into industry or commerce or into the black market: &ldquo;You can have <Col N="545" /> your full pension and gather in as much as you can from your normal business activities, but if you go into the State service and work there for half the amount that you can earn outside, then take notice that I will get after your pension.&rdquo;  How can the Minister defend that?  One man goes into the State service and works for £500 a year; another man goes into industry or commerce, or takes up a profession and earns £2,000 a year and at the same time gets his full pension.  The man in the State service with £500 a year suffers an abatement in his pension.</P>
    <P>I think that I would be misjudging the Minister entirely if I thought that he had any enthusiasm for defending a principle of that kind.  In matters of this kind the Minister may just be the instrument of the Government.  I suggest to him, knowing that this is not a principle that he would defend&mdash;I feel sure that he cannot have his heart in defending it&mdash;that he might, in view of the appeals which have been made to him from all sides of the House, his own included, undertake to discuss the matter further with the Government with a view to withdrawing this abatement section entirely. The cost of doing so would not be considerable.  These pensions are not going to be a continuing liability on the State.  One has only to read the daily newspapers to see how fast the State's liability in respect to this type of pension is diminishing.  I feel sure that all sides of the House would gladly face up to the position of defending the additional public expenditure which would be involved by the abandonment of a principle which, I think, is morally indefensible, and which is singing out a small class of people for a form of taxation which is inequitable from every point of view.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to do what Deputy Norton has suggested, and that is to bring to the attention of the Government the remarks which have been made in the House.  I must say, in respect of Deputy O'Higgins, that his speech astonishes me.  The Deputy has been a member of the House since, I think, 1929.  I do not think I would be doing <Col N="546" /> him a wrong if I suggested that the first time he ever raised his voice in respect to this matter was when I introduced this amending Bill.  The circumstances which exist at the present time existed in the time of the former Government.  Deputy O'Higgins spoke about age limits.  I do not know how he dragged them in because, honestly, I do not think they were relevant to the debate.  But even the age limits which he discussed in respect to the retirement of military officers have existed since 1924, so that if there was any hardship in respect to men retiring at the age of 45, 48 or 51, or whatever it may be, the hardship was just as bad in the days of the former Government, which the Deputy supported, as it is now.</P>

There is no change to-day from what the position was in the time of the former Government and, therefore, I cannot see what point Deputy O'Higgins is making.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton has spoken about the principle in this matter and so has Deputy O'Connor, but Deputy O'Higgins is not worrying about the principle. There is no principle involved in this as far as Deputy O'Higgins is concerned because the Deputy has an amendment on the Order Paper which would still exclude a number of people.</P>

      <P>Whatever views I may have in regard to the principle involved in this, I have done this much anyhow: I have conceded to the request of the Conference of the Old I.R.A. They did not ask me to wipe out the Schedule.  They asked me to amend it in a certain way, and I have amended it practically in the manner in which they asked.  I am not going to read into their minds, but I am going to assume that they are satisfied that persons in receipt of public moneys, above a certain scale, are entitled to have some abatement made in their pensions.  I presume it was a feeling of much the same kind that was in the mind of the former Government when they decided to abate pensions in respect of employment given to individuals who had pensions.  I can only presume that the mind of the Conference was running on somewhat similar lines, and that the members of it did not see anything very wrong in some pensions being abated.  As Deputies will see from the Bill, there is no abatement where the amount does not exceed £250.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to accept any suggestion that the officers of the Army or any section of the officers of the Army should be in any different position from any of the ordinary pensioners. Any of those men who are receiving pensions from public funds will, if this Bill goes through, have their pensions abated to whatever extent they should be abated by reason of the amount of money they are receiving from public funds.  I do not see that I should be asked to differentiate between one class and another.  I certainly will not do it.  All I am offering to do is to bring to the attention of the Government the remarks that have been made here in respect of the abatement <Col N="548" /> of pensions.  I am prepared to under take that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that he would not differentiate between one class and another.  Surely that is exactly what we are doing.  That is what was done in the 1924 Bill, and in the 1934 Bill, and that is what is being done in this amending Bill.  We are differentiating between the person earning wages or salary from the State or local authority as against the person earning a very much larger salary in any other walk of life.  As far as I listened to Deputy O'Connor, Deputy Norton, Deputy Cosgrave and other speakers, on this stage and on the Second Reading, it is that discrimination against individuals that is objected to.  The Minister has said that a scheme of abatement of pensions has been on the stocks since 1924 and that a voice was never raised against it before.  The Minister understands parliamentary procedure as well as I do.  He understands that, when a Bill becomes an Act, except there is an amending Bill before us it cannot be debated or discussed here.  The amending Act of 1934 was an Act to give the same scale of pensions for the same service to those who were opposed to the National Army in 1924 as to those who served in the National Army. That was not an occasion for raising the question of abatement in pension. This is the first opportunity we have had.  The Minister's remarks, in so far as they were specially aimed at myself, applied to every Deputy who has joined his voice with mine in urging reconsideration of the Minister's decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those officers who are retiring at the age of 45 may have been in the scheme in 1924&mdash;I think it was never very definitely fixed until the scheme introduced just prior to the Minister's time&mdash;but it is also true to say that, when an officer is 25 or under 30, although he sees that if he has not reached a higher rank than that of captain by the time he reaches 45 he will be compulsorily retired, it is not real to him until he reaches the age of 45, and there is always the hope that there will be sufficient vacancies to allow promotion. But on the last occasion when the <Col N="549" /> Minister referred to the Army in this House he told us that he was proposing to take on 700 new officers, and at the same time those satisfactory officers who gave efficient service but are still of captain's rank or lower are to be compulsorily retired on reaching 45 years.  Surely this is an occasion when the whole thing lights up afresh and anew, and anybody conversant with the situation and particularly with the acute stage we are reaching this year and next year would be failing in his duty if he did not call attention to it. When the bulk of those officers had 15 or 20 years to go, it was quite a different situation, and well the Minister knows it.</P>

The Minister made a fairly lengthy statement on it.  He traced it back to the time of the flood.  He went into history in order to answer that casual reference of mine.  The custodian of order in this House does not happen to be either the Minister or myself.  It is the Chair.  Any time I am called to order by the Chair, I will obey.

      <P>The Minister says that he does not want to discriminate, but as I have already said there is a number of officers who are suffering discrimination inasmuch as they are entitled to pensions under the 1924 Act, but because they are serving at the moment they have their pensions abated.  Officers of similar rank and similarly situated in every way except that they are drawing their pensions under the 1934 Act are not having their pensions abated.  The Minister must realise that there is definitely a difference there, and, while it does not affect many officers, it is a source of real grievance to them.  I am glad the <Col N="550" /> Minister has accepted the suggestion that he should bring this matter before his colleagues.  In the Seanad in March of last year he said that he came to the conclusion that the only remedy would be to remove the Schedule completely, but he did not think the Dáil or the Seanad wanted to do that. &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I do not think it could be done.&rdquo;  So far as the Dáil is concerned, the Minister has representations from all sections that they are in favour of removing the Schedule completely.  So far as the Dáil is concerned we guarantee to accept the responsibility if the Minister will remove it, and I imagine the Seanad will be prepared to do likewise.</P>

      <P>There is one point on which I should like to ask the Minister for guidance.  Has he done anything about the pensions of the Old I.R.A. men who had pensionable service, but who, because they remained in the Army instead of leaving for a week or two and getting their I.R.A. pensions, are not getting any benefit from the I.R.A. pensions, even though they may leave the Army in a couple of months' time?  This is a Bill to amend the Military Service Pensions Act.  I communicated with the Minister several times about I.R.A. men who remained on in the Army, and are today certain that they will be demobilised shortly.  They were entitled to I.R.A. pensions all during that time, but did not get them.  Will the Minister do anything for those men?  I would ask his guidance on this matter or the guidance of some members of the House who may have more details than I have.  Will the Minister do anything for those I.R.A. men?  I understand there are only about 50 of them coming out&mdash;who got no benefits, and who, after their service in the I.R.A. and over 20 years' service in the Army, feel very much aggrieved because they have got no benefits from the I.R.A. pensions. Perhaps the Minister would give me some guidance on the matter.</P>

The Third Schedule says: &ldquo;Where the annual amount of <Col N="551" /> the remuneration, pension, or allowance payable out of public moneys does not exceed £250,&rdquo; and so on. When the amount of the remuneration that the pensioner receives from public funds is being calculated in the Department of Defence, will the amount of the service pension be added to the amount received by way of salary, or will the abatement take place on the amount of salary only? Will a service pension or any other pension of which such a person is in receipt be left out of consideration?</P>

A grave injustice is being done to those men and, now that there is a Bill before the House to amend the military pension law, I ask the Minister to see that justice is done.  I have letters here showing that, in some cases, men have lost up to £400 because of their continuous service in the Army.  They served continuously, instead of leaving for a temporary period, claiming the I.R.A. pension, getting paid it and re-joining.  The Minister must recognise that there is an injustice being done, and I ask the House to remove that injustice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill which proposes a number of changes in the law relating to local government. Some of these changes are important and will, if adopted by the Oireachtas, alter existing local government practice in several respects; others represent little more than a clarification of the law, as it stands, in order to remove doubts and difficulties in its interpretation. Local authorities now deal with a great diversity of matters and it is inevitable that local government law will reflect that diversity and contain provisions regarding matters whose only relation to each other is that local authorities are in some way concerned in them.</P>
      <P>In the past, by reason of this diversity, it has been found convenient in Bills of an appreciable length, dealing with many different subjects, to divide them into parts, grouping the sections according to the subject matter.  That course has been followed in the present Bill, which is in five Parts, with three Schedules.  Part I of the Bill, I think, does not require any explanation.  It is the usual preliminary and general sections containing certain of the definitions forming part of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second Part relates wholly to financial matters, and before referring to particular sections it will be agreeable if I refer generally to the existing position and the changes which are proposed in this Part of the Bill.  In every urban district or borough, other than a county borough and the borough of Dun Laoghaire, there are at present at least two rates levied by the urban or borough council as the case may be. One of these is the poor rate, by which the amount of the demands of the county council is raised, the other is the town rate.  This term, town rate, is in general use in urban districts for the rates raised to supply the expenses of the urban council in carrying out their own functions.  The term &ldquo;town rate&rdquo;, I may mention, is not statutory. The town rate includes the rates under the Towns Improvement Act of 1854, and may include rates under the local <Col N="554" /> Acts.  In a borough there is also the borough rate under the Municipal Corporations Acts.  The borough rate is levied on the same basis as the poor rate in the county.  The expenses of an urban authority under the Public Health Acts are raised under Section 226 of the Public Health Act, 1878. This section begins by declaring that the expenses of an urban sanitary authority are to be defrayed, in the case of the corporation of a borough, out of the borough rate, and in the case of an urban district council, out of any rate leviable by them as town commissioners over the whole district.  The section continues with provisos relating to the nature of the rate to be used and its special incidence.  The effect of this is to produce a diversity of practice for which there is no justification. For example, in Drogheda Borough, the sanitary rate is a flat rate on all hereditaments, whereas in most urban districts land and railways are rated as one-quarter of the valuation. In Galway Borough it is difficult to determine by what rate or with what incidence the sanitary expenses of the Corporation should be raised.</P>
    <P>A somewhat similar position existed in every county borough before the passing of the several City Management Acts.  Those Acts altered the position by substituting one municipal rate with one definite incidence for the various rates with different incidences. In framing the City Management Acts a difficulty arose, by reason of the fact that hereditaments of certain classes had been exempted from some of the older rates, and it would, therefore, be unjust to require the occupiers to pay the whole of the new municipal rate. The difficulty was met by ascertaining the average amount in the £ paid by hereditaments of each exempted class over a number of years, immediately before the passing of the relevant Act, and the proportion which that amount bore to the average rate in the £ in the same period paid by an ordinary hereditament.  For instance, if it were found, as it was in the case of Dublin, that agricultural land was assessed at a sum that was approximately equal to about half the rate on the full valuation, then the fraction for agricultural land was fixed at one half.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="555" /> The present Bill, in Part II, proposes to do for the urban districts what has already been done for the county boroughs and Dun Laoghaire, that is, to consolidate existing rates in each area into one rate.  The provisions of the City Management Acts have been adopted for this purpose.  As the House knows these provisions have worked in the county boroughs satisfactorily and without confusion.  The effect will be that in future there will be only one rating law for all rates.  That law will be the existing law relating to poor rate.  It may be suggested that the poor rate is not, perhaps, in every respect ideal, but it is more certain and easier to ascertain than any other rating law.  No doubt, in time, when the question of valuation for rating has been disposed of a comprehensive rating Bill will be undertaken.  That cannot be properly undertaken until the question of valuation has been settled.  But any such comprehensive rating Bill will be rendered easier by the present Bill, which will eliminate the divergencies created by local Acts promoted by various towns during the 19th century.</P>
    <P>There is, however, one matter in which the introduction of the municipal rate into the urban districts and other boroughs is more difficult than in the county boroughs.  As I have already indicated, each county borough was dealt with by its own special Act so that in ascertaining the valuation fractions it was only necessary to consider the incidence of the rates in the particular borough to which the Act applied.  This Bill, on the other hand, deals with a great number of areas wherein, as I have already explained, the incidence of the rates is not uniform.  The burden of rates on the particular hereditaments could not, therefore, be kept substantially the same in every area, except by the inclusion in the Bill of valuation fractions for each area, as was done by the City Management Acts.  I did, I may say, in this connection, for a time toy with the idea of the fractions being fixed by Order of the Minister for each area, but, on full consideration, I decided on the <Col N="556" /> alternative method of applying the same fraction for each type of rateable property that under general law gets partial exemption at present.</P>
    <P>There are altogether four different types of property which will get a reduction in valuation when the new municipal rate is being assessed.  They are agricultural land, canals, land used as railway and half rents.  The first three at present enjoy in most towns exemption from the town rate to the extent of three-quarters of the valuation.  The fourth, half rents, is half the annual rent derived by the owner or other person interested in any rateable property which is exempted from poor rate by reason of being used for public or charitable purposes, or for the purposes of science, literature and fine arts.  The owners of these half rents are rated to poor rate but not to town rate. It is proposed in Section 22 to alter the method by which commissioners of a town that is not an urban district will obtain expenses and assimilate it to that method by which a subsidiary of the county council obtains funds. At present, as the House knows, the commissioners raise their own rate. They have separate rate books and collectors. Their rate is limited to 2/6, but that limit may be exceeded if the excess is caused by housing expenses and expenses of school meals.</P>
    <P>There are 23 of these towns, in five of which elected commissioners are no longer functioning, their business having been transferred to the respective county councils.  The total aggregate sum raised in rates in these towns is about £15,000.  What is proposed in the Bill is that the county council shall levy on the town the money required to meet the expenses of the commissioners.  These small towns are usually unable to employ whole-time officers or maintain the same standard of service as larger authorities.  We hope, by relieving them of this troublesome business of levying and collecting rates, they will be freer to attend to other business entrusted to them.</P>
    <P>Section 23 is designed to deal with a situation which has arisen in recent years where cases have occurred in <Col N="557" /> which inadequate estimates have been adopted, and insufficient rates levied to meet the service of the year.  Under the law as it stands&mdash;under the normal law&mdash;once a rate has been made and assessed, nothing can be done until the following year to correct the position. It is proposed now to allow a local authority that has made an insufficient rate either to revoke their action and make a new rate, or, if that is not a convenient course, to make an additional rate.  I think I can say, with regard to Part II generally, that it will be found that, with the exception of the last two sections to which I referred, Sections 22 and 23, most of the remaining provisions in this part of the Bill are adaptations or provisions which the Oireachtas has already approved of in the City Management Acts.</P>
    <P>Part III relates to officers and employees and is intended to be supplementary to Part II of the Local Government Act, 1941, which is the principal code now dealing with the staff of local authorities.  Section 24, of course, is the definition section, relating particularly to this part of the Bill.  Section 25 is a more elaborate provision for amalgamating offices than that contained in Section 32 of the Act of 1941.  Section 32 of the Act of 1941 only applied to what are called major offices.  This new section, Section 25, applies to all offices.  Section 26 is intended to meet the cases of officers whose conditions of appointment required them to retire on marriage, and who have not, in fact, complied with that condition.  It will not apply to officers to whom such a condition did not apply on appointment.</P>
    <P>The performance of the duties of a particular office by a deputy during absence or illness of the holder of an office is already provided for by the Act of 1941, but in some instances it is doubtful whether the certificate of a deputy or substitute would be valid where the officer cannot act in person. Section 27 is intended to regularise this position.</P>
    <P>Some misapprehension appears to have arisen in the minds of some persons who have read the Bill regarding Section 28, which gives the Minister <Col N="558" /> power to make regulations requiring an officer to devote the whole of his time to his official duties.  I should like to emphasise in that connection that under this Section there is no intention whatever of converting existing part-time officers into whole-time officers against their will.  The purpose of the section is to enable the question of whole-time or part-time service to be settled in the same manner as other conditions of service.</P>

      <P>That is to say, it will be laid down as a condition of employment that the officer will devote the whole of his time, whether part-time or whole-time, to his official duties.  It was held by some who read the Bill that the object of this was to compel officers to devote the whole of their time to their duties.</P>

      <P>Yes, I think so. Under Section 29 of the Bill it is proposed to continue as part of the ordinary law certain powers at present vested in the Minister in relation to the pay of weekly wage earners and other employees of local authorities. It is now generally recognised that it is necessary to ensure that local authorities should not, in the matter of remuneration, get out of step with outside employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill is intended to replace existing provisions in relation to the construction or reconstruction of bridges in which more than one road authority is directly interested. At present, where a bridge is built between two counties, not more than half of the cost may be raised off either <Col N="559" /> county.  This had led to difficulties, particularly where one county held that half the cost was too onerous having regard to the benefit derived from the bridge by that county. The Bridges Acts, 1834 to 1867, provided a procedure to meet these difficulties but this procedure is rather cumbersome and expensive.  Moreover, it deals only with inter-county bridges and makes no provision for a case where a bridge, though wholly in one county, would materially benefit another county or counties by improving the road communication of the latter.  This point is dealt with in the new procedure in this Bill.</P>
    <P>What is proposed in Part IV is that if a road authority is of opinion that the construction of a new bridge, or the reconstruction of an existing bridge, either in or outside or partly in or partly outside its area, is expedient for the purpose of improving road communication between places in such area or between places in or outside such area or road communication through such area, they may make application to the Minister for a bridge Order providing for such construction or reconstruction.  The application for a bridge Order must contain proposals for defraying the expenses of the work and of the maintenance of the bridge by two or more road authorities. On receipt of an application for such an Order, the Minister may direct a road authority to submit to him a report on the feasibility of the work, the probable cost and the best situation for the work in the case of a new bridge.  In the case of a proposed reconstruction work, the site of the bridge has, of course, already been determined.</P>
    <P>On receipt of the Order the local authorities so directed by the Minister must carry out all necessary surveys. After consideration of the report, which under Section 32 is referred to as a preliminary report, the Minister may cause a public inquiry to be held to consider the proposal and the reports of the surveying authority.</P>
    <P>After consideration of the report and of the report of the public inquiry, the <Col N="560" /> Minister may make a bridge Order which shall direct a road authority to construct or reconstruct a bridge in accordance with the Order, and may require contributions to be made in a specified manner towards the cost by a benefiting road authority.  These contributions may include expenses incurred in the maintenance of the bridge after it has been constructed or reconstructed.  The road authority directed by a bridge Order to construct or reconstruct a bridge must submit plans to the Minister for his approval and, when the plans have been approved by the Minister, the work must be carried out by the local authority specified in the bridge Order with all reasonable speed.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill contains a number of miscellaneous provisions.  Sections 45 and 46 deal with the procedure when there is an equality of votes at meetings of a county council or at meetings of a committee of a local authority. Members of the House are no doubt familiar with certain cases in which there has been some difficulty in securing the election of a chairman, particularly after an election, where there has been some doubt as to the chairman's right to vote.  The House knows also that, until the chairman is elected at the first meeting of the new authority, the chair is taken by the chairman of the outgoing county council.  As I have indicated, it occasionally happens that the chairman is not a member of the new council.  The purpose of Section 45 is to ensure that in these circumstances the chairman of a county council who is not a member of the county council has no vote, neither a first vote nor a casting vote. The casting vote of the chairman who is a member is preserved except where it is otherwise provided that the decision is to be taken by lot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>He presides only as a directing authority; he has no right to vote.  Section 47 is designed to make a local inquiry with its attendant delay and expense unnecessary where there is wilful refusal or neglect on the part of the local authority to comply with an express statutory requirement. The section merely restores the position as it was from 1925 to 1942.</P>
      <P>Under Section 48, when members of a local authority are removed from office the members nominated by them to subsidiary bodies will also cease to hold office whether they were members of the parent body or not.  Under Section 49 the quorum for the commissioners of a town is being reduced to three.  The quorum for commissioners at the present moment is five, which is a larger quorum than is now required for an urban district council.</P>
      <P>The purpose of Section 50 is to straighten out a rather involved position in regard to the audit of accounts of public bodies.  The effect of the provisions of several statutes has been to give two Ministers similar powers to regulate the accounts and audit of certain bodies.  In practice no conflict has arisen in this regard but it is necessary to clear up the position from its legal aspect.  Under sub-section (6) of this section, the county manager, who is an officer of the county council, is made for audit purposes an officer of every elected body for which he is manager.</P>
      <P>Section 51 deals with traffic signs on roads and amends Section 36 of the Local Government Act, 1935.  Under the section the Minister may make regulations as to traffic signs which will now include mechanical devices such as traffic lights.  Section 54 clarifies the position of rate collectors in relation to furnishing information which is required for the preparation of the rate.  It will scarcely affect the existing practice in these matters but, as I have said, it will clarify the law in regard to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="562" /> Section 55 relates to the conditions to be fulfilled where it is desired to change the name of a thoroughfare. Many representations have been received with regard to this matter asking that the existing law, contained in a Public Health Act of 1907, which required the consent of a majority of two-thirds of the number of ratepayers and valuation in a street before a change could be made, should be modified.  It is proposed to repeal the relevant section of the Act of 1937 in this regard and to make fresh provisions by which a change can be made by the local authority, if not less than two-thirds of the persons rated in the street consent.  The condition as to securing the consent of occupiers having an aggregate valuation of two-thirds of the valuation of the street has been dropped.  I should point out that this change in the name of a street can be made only by the local authority. It cannot be effected by the manager.</P>
    <P>Section 56 is designed to give local authorities the same powers as regards investments of their funds as trustees have.  The proviso in Section 7 of the Trustee Investment Act, 1889, has become, under changed conditions, so restrictive that in some cases local authorities could not invest in national loans.  It is proposed, therefore, to repeal Section 7 and re-enact it without the restrictive proviso.</P>
    <P>Under the existing law, a local authority can acquire land only when they intend to use it for a definite purpose. Land acquired for housing, for example, may, through shifts in population or otherwise, cease to be suitable for the purpose for which it was acquired.  Nevertheless, the local authority have no power to use it for any other purpose.  Again, a plot of land which the owner would be willing to sell to the local authority and which would be suitable for any one of a number of public purposes might unexpectedly come on the market.  Under the law as it stands the local authority, having had no opportunity to work out plans for the utilisation of the land, would have no power to acquire it.  In order to avoid such anomalies, it is proposed, under Section 57, to give local authorities power to acquire, but to acquire by <Col N="563" /> agreement only, land which they may need at some future time although the specific purpose for which they would use it has not been decided upon.  This power to take land in advance of actual requirements will, I believe, facilitate urban planning.</P>
    <P>Section 58 excludes loans borrowed by county councils as public assistance authorities from the borrowing limit of one-tenth of the valuation which was imposed in 1898, when they had no public assistance functions.  County councils, however, as public assistance authorities, will be subject to the limit of one-fourth of the valuation fixed by Section 57 of the Public Assistance Act, 1939.</P>
    <P>Sections 59 and 62 relate to local inquiries that are ordered by the Minister.  Some of the Department's general inspectors have in recent years been assigned the duty of acting for local bodies when the members of such bodies have been removed, and also have been acting temporarily as managers when vacancies occur. They are, therefore, not always available to hold inquiries.  Furthermore, for certain inquiries it is desirable to have persons with special training and experience.  It is proposed to give the Minister power to appoint temporarily specially qualified persons to hold inquiries if occasion requires.  It is sometimes necessary, in connection with these inquiries, for the manager of the local authority to have separate legal representation at them.  This is particularly the case if his own decisions or conduct are involved.  If he is separately represented by order of the Minister, his costs may be paid, subject to any limit the Minister may impose. A similar position may arise in regard to other officers and private persons.  If the Minister considers it reasonable that a contribution should be made towards the costs and expenses incurred, he may certify the amount of the contribution and direct its payment under these sections.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections of the Bill are concerned largely with slight revisions or amendments of the wording of earlier statutes.  Only two of them call for comment.  It is proposed that in future the clerks of old age pensions <Col N="564" /> committees shall be appointed by these committees without reference to the Local Appointments Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Section 67 is designed to remove difficulties experienced in operating Section 34 of the Local Government Act, 1925, which deals with the cutting of hedges and trees which are prejudicial to a public road.  Hedges and trees may shade a road to such an extent as to make it unduly difficult and expensive to maintain, or they may cause obstruction or render the road dangerous to users.  Under the section the owner or occupier may be requested to trim the hedge within 21 days.  He is, however, given a right of appeal to the District Court for an annulling order.</P>
    <P>If he does not comply with the requirements or appeal to the court the local authority may get a court order and if that order is not complied with the county surveyor may have the work done and the cost recovered from the occupier.  The Act of 1925 prohibited a county surveyor trimming or cutting hedges or trees between the end of March and the end of September. The effect of Section 67 of the Bill will be to permit a hedge to be cut within that hitherto prohibited period and also a tree to be cut if, but only if, the surveyor is satisfied that failure to have the tree cut involves serious risk of accident.  The need for some such power has been represented to me by more than one county council and has been mentioned on a number of occasions at the conferences with the county surveyors which have taken place in my Department.</P>
    <P>Amongst the enactments repealed which are set out in the First Schedule will be found parts of the several Public Libraries Acts.  The purpose of these repeals is to abolish the rating limits for libraries.  The House knows that from the middle of the last century up to 1920 the limit was 1d. in the £.  This was raised to 3d., which in county boroughs may be increased in certain circumstances by another 3d. In most counties the limit fixed has not been reached but library development in Dun Laoghaire, for instance, <Col N="565" /> has been impeded by the existence of the limitation on expenditure.  As the fixing of a limit of rates, in my opinion, serves no useful purpose, in present circumstances and in the present condition of public opinion in relation to the provision of public libraries and educational facilities for the people, I propose to ask the House to abolish the limitation.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The form in which this Bill is presented will certainly come as a very serious disappointment to anybody who has anything to do with local government.  It simply adds to the rag-bag that is local government legislation.  I think the Bill is misdescribed as a Local Government Bill. The best the Minister can call it, in my opinion, is a Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  I doubt if any Local Government Bill has ever been such a medley as this is.</P>
      <P>In the First Schedule we find we are dealing with bridges, libraries, housing, road traffic matters, rates on agricultural land, Public Assistance Acts, rates, and all through the Bill we come across additional things, such as election expenses, voting, elections of public bodies, etc.  I think the Bill will also come as a serious source of annoyance and irritation to people who are dealing with local government.  It is particularly disappointing in view of the fact that the public have been led to expect that, the Minister having special legal assistance to help him to codify certain aspects of local government law, having two Parliamentary Secretaries and a very swollen Department to assist him, we might be getting nearer the day when local government law would be got together in a neater handbook than we have been able to have up to the present.  Local government law is a thing that should be in handy form for public representatives, managers, officials, and various classes of people interested in local government, and for the lawyers who have to deal with so many different matters affecting the interests of individuals in relation to public bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department is notorious in one way or another for delay in dealing with many matters to which public <Col N="566" /> bodies require urgent attention to be given.  A very considerable part of the delay I think is due to the rather impenetrable jungle which local government legislation has become, and the Minister, instead of clearing up that, seems to be adding to it.  I suggest that that is a matter of great seriousness and that if there is to be an annual adding to the rag-bag of local government law, then it will cause a considerable amount of confusion and expense to a large number of people.</P>
    <P>A number of matters in this Bill call for attention.  The Minister has referred to Section 28 and I suggest that that section will require, at any rate, to be explained a little more than the Minister has explained it.  He has indicated that it deals only with the defining of the duties of officials, on the one hand, and future entrants into the service, on the other.  I think the Minister would do well to review the general situation that may be brought about by this addition to the legislation.  There have been a very considerable amount of controversy, legislation and judicial decisions with regard to the interpretation of &ldquo;whole time&rdquo; for public officials and it would be well if the matter were clearly defined now that the Minister is taking additional powers.</P>
    <P>I think Section 47 will probably give rise to a great deal of discussion.  The Minister proposes to take power in certain circumstances to wipe out a local authority without an inquiry of any kind.  I suggest to the Minister that there may be simply a question of fact to be established and that it is becoming more and more necessary that there shall not be powers to wipe out a local authority or any statutory body without an inquiry and without the report of that inquiry being made public.</P>
    <P>The Minister was not very explicit when dealing with the question of auditors and the changes that are being made.  If we turn to the Third Schedule we find that the accounts of the Dublin Port and Docks Board are to be audited by the Department. That brings us up against the whole audit position under the Department <Col N="567" /> of Local Government.  There is very considerable delay in the audit of the accounts of many local bodies, and that is neither fair to the public interests nor to the officials whose accounts are left for a long period without being audited.  Again, the standard of training and the standard of responsibility of auditors is deteriorating.  An auditor ought to be in a completely detached and independent judicial position.  There is an appeal to the Minister against his decision, and he ought to be a lot freer from the Minister's direction and control than he seems to be at present.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Port and Docks Board is a very important body which only recently advertised for a general manager at a salary of something like £2,500 a year.  I doubt if it is feasible or advisable to bring the work of that board, managed by a person who is intended to be responsible and independent, and dealing with, you might say, purely business matters, under the rather detailed auditing of the Local Government Department.  The manager is likely to find himself in the position in two or three years' time, after taking decisions dealing, perhaps, with small amounts, of facing an audit of his accounts and having to account for sums of 2/6 or 4/9.  The Minister was peculiarly silent as to why he was bringing that board, or the Dublin and Cork fever hospitals, under the Local Government Department for the purpose of audit.  I think the matter requires a considerable amount of thought and explanation.  I should like to know whether the Dublin Port and Docks Board have considered all that is involved in agreeing, if they did agree, to the proposal made in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt in a very inadequate way with Section 57 and the question of the acquisition of land. The section proposes that a local authority may buy land at any time and in any place without necessarily having any use for it.  I do not know whether the question of town planning was considered in this connection.  I do not know whether there is to be consultation with another local <Col N="568" /> authority when land is being bought in its area or how that is being arranged for.  There is no provision for it here and there is no provision for publication of the fact that the land has been bought.  There is simply a general, slovenly provision by which a local authority can buy land without having any use for it at the time, and if, after a year or two, it makes up its mind that it does not want it, it can proceed to sell it again.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that, under Section 59, he proposes that for the holding of certain inquiries he may go outside his inspectorial staff or the staff of his Department and may select some person with special professional and technical qualifications to hold an inquiry.  I think that idea is entirely wrong.  In any inquiry that will be held by the Minister, even though technical matters may be very prominent in connection with it, there will be more than the mere technicalities involved.  Very often it will be more a question of administration and the carrying on of business than of purely technical matters.  I suggest that what the Minister requires is power, if he has not got it already, to associate with an inspector of the Department who is carrying out an inquiry, a technical assistant of whatever kind the inspector may want, to guide him or sit with him and to watch the course of events from the technical point of view.  I do not think any inquiry carried out for the Minister should be carried out by a man purely on the ground that he had professional or technical qualifications. Apart altogether from its apparent lack of necessity this proposal opens up certain objections.</P>
    <P>Under Section 60, the Minister may, if he considers the matter, change it, but I think it entirely wrong that the Minister should issue an Order that, under particular circumstances, the manager should be separately represented at the inquiry.  That section&mdash;if it is necessary at all&mdash;should read &ldquo;that the manager may appear separately at an inquiry&rdquo;.  The initiative should be left entirely to the manager and it is entirely wrong for the Minister to order the manager to do anything. <Col N="569" /> The manager is a very responsible person, and if there is an inquiry in which he is involved in any way, he should not be made to appear in any circumstances to be subject to an Order of the Minister, except where the Minister has a statutory right to order him to do a particular thing.  It may be that the Minister may wish to safeguard the local authority, or the local authority may wish the Minister to safeguard them against elaborate and unnecessary legal expenses incurred by the manager in appearing separately before an inquiry; but I think the idea that the Minister should order the manager to appear separately before the inquiry is entirely wrong.  Generally, the Bill is a shocking medley, which will simply add additional trouble and additional confusion to local government law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a good deal in the point made by Deputy Mulcahy regarding the Title of the Bill, which he suggested might better be described as a Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, on account of the wide range it covers.  However, I suggest that its general utility is not necessarily destroyed by its title, since there are some beneficial clauses in it, and very obviously there would be times when certain members of the House would chafe at the idea that certain sections should be delayed because they could not be introduced here.  So we need not grumble too much about the title.  So far as I can see, the Bill seems to be designed chiefly to bring the code of local government throughout the country into line with that at present operating in the municipality in Dublin.</P>
      <P>On the general details, there are several points that I might refer to at this particular stage.  I notice in the First Schedule the repeal of the entire Section 47 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898.  That is an important section and I cannot discover anywhere in the Bill that a substitute has been provided.  That section states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) A council shall not directly or indirectly apply any part of their county or district fund, or any <Col N="570" /> moneys under their control, for any purpose not authorised by this or any other Act....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If no substitute is being put in for that particular provision, I would be interested to know the reason for suggesting the repeal.</P>
    <P>In Section 6 we have repeated in this particular Bill&mdash;it is not entirely an innovation, in so far as it was introduced in the Mental Treatment Act&mdash; the question of adaptations of other Acts.  That might be dangerous in certain circumstances, and the House would need to be guarded against it. In regard to Section 10, dealing with town commissioners, I listened to the Minister and I find it is proposed now that the charges in this case will be county-at-large charges; but there is a clause in connection with the 7½ per cent. increase and, so far as I know, it is not quite clear as to the ultimate destination of that 7½ per cent.</P>
    <P>Section 13 refers to &ldquo;a&rdquo; sinking fund.  This does not seem to have any relation to the fact that there are several sinking funds in connection with various categories of stock.  It seems to refer to &ldquo;a&rdquo; sinking fund, as if there were no others.</P>
    <P>Section 20 deals with vacant premises and is an improvement, so far as the City of Dublin is concerned.  The procedure at present, I understand, is that there is an abatement allowance of one-twenty-fourth.  Here it is proposed to make it one-twelfth, so that if the repairs go on for a full period of 12 months the question of the responsibility for the entire rates disappears. No provision is made for any limited time, so far as the repairs are concerned. I suggest there should be at least some restriction on the question of time, otherwise a landlord may, for reasons of his own, prolong a period of that character&mdash;and that surely is not in accord with the position we see around us in Dublin at present, where there is an acute shortage of housing accommodation.</P>
    <P>Section 23, to which Deputy Mulcahy and the Minister himself referred, deals with the insufficiency of rate.  Frankly, I see a certain element of danger in this, in so far as it could bring about slipshod estimating of the <Col N="571" /> annual estimates.  I can conceive no reason why the Minister should introduce this in the Bill, other than to make provision for a county commissioner, say, taking the place of a county council that had been disbanded. If we are making provision for a case of insufficiency of rate, whereby the local authority is empowered to send out a further demand after the rate has been struck, and even after the ratepayers have paid their first moiety, I might very easily ask, if the converse case applies, supposing the rating authority found they had overestimated: Would it be possible to give a refund to the ratepayers, in the middle of the financial year?  I suggest quite frankly, from my experience of my own city council, that occasions of this character have never arisen.  The result has been that the officials responsible, plus the council's members on the estimates committee, are pretty careful to see that all items which it is possible to envisage are included in the financial year, so as to avoid the confusion which, in my opinion, this section inevitably will bring about.</P>
    <P>On Section 50, with reference to the audits, for quite a long time I have watched the process of local government auditing throughout the country, and I think members of the House attached to local authorities will agree with me that there are grounds for complaint regarding the times at which the audits are carried out.  The statutory period is usually 12 months&mdash;or half-yearly&mdash;but it is common knowledge that the auditors in many cases are investigating the accounts at a much later period than the prescribed period.  It is utterly impossible, and in some cases exceedingly unfair on the local officials, to have to give an explanation, say after a period of 18 months, regarding the circumstances under which a certain decision was taken, long prior to the inquiry.  I am glad to say it does not happen in the City of Dublin where the audit is prompt and up-to-date; neither am I reflecting in any way on the personnel of the audit staff, who do their job in their own way and do it well; but <Col N="572" /> it does suggest to me&mdash;though I have no information whatever on the point &mdash;that the audit staff of the Department is insufficient.  There is no reason why the accounts of a county council or of a public health authority should not be audited with the same object in view as in the case of an ordinary commercial concern.  The object is the same in each case.</P>
    <P>As regards Section 52, which deals with the scales of maximum expenses for elections, I would like to bring to the Minister's notice a point that concerns working-class representatives who happen to be on public bodies. This has relation particularly to members of county councils.  They give a lot of their time to the administration of affairs in their own counties.  I am not quite sure what is the scale of expenses, or whether it is merely transport expenses.  I understand, however, that the expenses are totally insufficient.</P>

      <P>Take the ordinary workman who is a public representative. He has to give up his day's work to attend a meeting and he will lose a day's wages.  I think the time has arrived when there might be some consideration given to such representatives in rural areas, where meetings of the county council are held in the forenoon or the afternoon and where a person has to travel a long distance at great personal sacrifice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 57 refers to the acquisition of land.  A good deal might be said for the suggestion that this section, as set out here, might lead to a certain form of abuse.  The only reason why the House might be inclined to accept it is that put forward by the Minister, that a parcel of land might come suddenly on the market and it might be advantageous for the local authority to have an opportunity of acquiring it quickly.  I know of no other reason for leaving the section in the broad form in which it appears in the Bill. Local authorities have sufficient compulsory powers in order to acquire land and the only justification that <Col N="573" /> one could advance is that of quick acquisition.</P>
    <P>As regards inspectors, I agree with the point of view expressed by Deputy Mulcahy, and that is there should be no necessity to introduce inspectors in the manner laid down in Section 59.  If there is any lack of training so far as the various members of the inspectorial staff who conduct inquiries are concerned, that could be removed in the manner suggested, by attaching to them, for the time being, technically trained individuals.</P>
    <P>I am surprised at Section 51, which deals with traffic signs on roads.  The Minister appears to have allowed his own powers and those of the local authorities to lapse.  In that section it is set out that the commissioner may direct the local authority to do certain things.  I think the more appropriate way would be to permit the commissioner to make representations to the local authority.  To direct them is quite an unusual form and I think that to incorporate the commissioner as the statutory authority over a local authority in the matter of traffic signs is going a little bit too far.</P>
    <P>I see that, in Section 55, the Minister has adopted a suggestion which I made here some time ago by way of a Parliamentary Question; that is, in regard to the names of streets.  The old order was that you had to have two-thirds in favour.  I think the change set out in this section will be much more acceptable to the local authorities.  Seeing that the Minister has included in the Bill the suggestion I made here some months ago, might I bring to his notice another matter, a comparatively small matter, and perhaps it might be possible to accept it when we are dealing with the Bill in Committee?  It is a matter that affects the City of Dublin particularly, but it is of considerable interest elsewhere. Under Section 76 of the Public Health (Amendment) Act, 1857, county boroughs and other public authorities were entitled to include in their estimates a certain amount for the purpose of providing bands in open spaces at certain periods of the year.</P>
    <P>Last year, I had some correspondence <Col N="574" /> on this subject with the Minister. Representatives of city bands came as a deputation to the city manager, and to me when I was Lord Mayor, to see if it would be possible to continue their performances throughout the winter season.  These bands are greatly appreciated by the public, but they have no general source of revenue.  Some of them will possibly have to go out of existence unless revenue of a stable character can be provided for them.  If they are not assisted in some definite way, they may have to go out of existence.  My correspondence with the Minister set out that, as the law stands, it would be impossible for the corporation to make provision for winter sessions in halls, as the Act makes provision only for open spaces.  I throw out the suggestion that that small matter, which is of considerable interest to people in Dublin City, might get the serious attention of the Minister and his Parliamentary draftsman and he might possibly accept an amendment on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>We were led to believe here by the Minister or his predecessor some years ago that strenuous efforts were being made to codify the law relating to local government&mdash;that in the immediate future we might hope to have the law framed in such a manner that the ordinary man in the street could understand it.  Thirty-six enactments are to be repealed in this Bill. If one goes through the Bill as it is presented, it is clear that the ordinary individual who is a member of a local authority and who wants to understand the law relating to local government will still be in a position of great difficulty.  If he endeavoured to understand local government law in its present form, his efforts might easily lead him into a mental hospital.  This Bill seems to make everything more confused.  It even amends legislation that was passed here a few years ago. I refer now to the Public Assistance Act, the Local Government Act, 1941, and the Management Act of that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An effort was made to codify some of the law relating to public assistance, but now this Bill seems to make confusion more confused&mdash;that is the sum <Col N="575" /> total of it.  After saying that, I would like to mention that it may be just like the curate's egg, good in spots.  We would like to see what are the good and the bad parts.  It is unfair that 36 enactments should be repealed under this Bill when the position is that the officials of local authorities throughout the country do not know fully what the law is, even though they are working within the local government laws all their lives.  That is the position&mdash;they do not know what the law is and each year local authorities bear a huge sum in legal expenses, through the courts and through the necessity for seeking advice from legal people as to what the law is.  I hope the Minister will be able to tell us when it is proposed to codify our local government law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 10 is the section under which a very far-reaching new principle is sought to be imposed on the country.  I think the Minister in his explanation of it got over it rather too lightly.  It is a proposal to make the county council bear the expenses, subject to the 7½ per cent. provision, of an existing local authority which, since 1848, had funds of their own.  I refer to town commissioners.  He did not tell us the necessity at this stage of doing away with town commissioners' funds and putting the charge as a county-at-large rate on the county councils.  I protest very strongly to the Minister against that proposal.  We know that this is the thin end of the wedge; we know that following up this Bill we will have another in a few years making the same proposal in regard to urban councils. We were expecting it in this Bill, but I am sure it is on the way.  If this is established as a new principle&mdash;it never existed and never was suggested before&mdash;we will have urban authorities included&mdash;a county-at-large rate bearing the expenses of urban authorities. What is the justification for doing away with town commissioners and <Col N="576" /> letting them carry their own expenses? The expenses of town commissioners are very low compared with those of any urban authority.  They had little or no expenses.  The county council carried the expenses of sanitation, of water supplies, of scavenging and many other matters in areas under town commissioners. Town commissioners had one responsibility, that is, lighting.  Under the 1932 Housing Act, they voluntarily took on the responsibility of building houses in their towns and it is now proposed in this Bill that houses built by town commissioners should become the responsibility of the county council and the county-at-large rate will be expected to provide houses for people in the local towns.  If the percentage of 7½ does not cover it, the county-at-large rate must provide funds in respect of losses on rates of local towns in the matter of housing.  That is how I read this Bill.</P>
      <P>Not alone that, but, under Section 22, a county council must provide, on demand, any funds which town commissioners need.  I do not think there is any legislation in operation in this country under which a county council must provide funds on demand.  There is a limit to the demand which a vocational education committee may make on a county council.  They can only go up to 6d. or 7d. in the £, or whatever figure is fixed by legislation, but, under Section 22 of this Bill, town commissioners may demand any sum whatever. The provision with regard to 7½ per cent. extra is the only safeguard a county council has, and I think it most unfair for the Minister to suggest that the ratepayers, the farmers of any particular area, should provide funds for the amenity needs of any town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this principle is to be adopted, we will have urban councils to-morrow making the same demand on the Minister, who will then come to the House and ask for approval of legislation making the provision for urban authorities a county-at-large charge. When you reach that stage, you might as well put a roof over the whole country, because that is what it amounts to.  There is no good reason why a county at large should provide <Col N="577" /> the funds for any local authority whatever. It is town commissioners under this Bill, and I suppose it will be urban councils under some other Bill.  The Minister should seriously consider the matter and not decide on this in a light fashion.</P>
    <P>Anybody living in the country and working on a local authority can see the trend of things.  We can appreciate that it is probably in the interests of a county manager to a certain extent to have this done.  If he has only one fund for all the local authorities within his area, his position will be much easier, because he will have one compact staff under his direction to operate all the funds of the local authorities within his area.  We can see also that the tendency is for county managers to become county commissioners to a great extent, and that is how the whole thing will work out.  It is something which should not be allowed to pass without special regard being paid to it.</P>
    <P>With regard to that section which enables local authorities to strike and to collect a second rate in the year, I hope the Minister gave full consideration to the matter before suggesting that it is feasible.  At present 99 per cent. of local authorities make a serious effort, after advice from their officials and managers, to strike a rate adequate to their needs for the year, and to give them power at this stage to strike and collect an additional or separate rate within the rating year means that all the people who pay rates will be driven insane. Why not strike an adequate rate, or why not allow a local authority to have a deficit within the year, as they are empowered to have at the moment, and collect the amount in the coming year?  They have power at the moment, if they find any service for which they need to provide funds, to provide the necessary funds by way of overdraft and collect the amount the following year.  To suggest that two rates should be struck in the one year is most unfair.  It is wrong in principle and will not work out.</P>

I suppose it is necessary to make the provision, but I wonder what is the necessity.  Is it also a matter of convenience? Section 25 provides for the amalgamation of offices.  Is it proposed to amalgamate the offices of different local authorities within a county council area?  Can the Minister make an Order under this section amalgamating, say, the office of an official of an urban authority with that of the county manager?  I believe it is possible under the section and I should like a statement from the Minister as to whether it is proposed to amalgamate such offices.  If so, I suggest that we should take note of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister also to explain Section 28, which is bound to give rise to controversy and trouble unless it is fully clarified.  A large number of officers of local authorities are part-time officers.  Dispensary doctors are part-time officers at the moment, and, under this section, the Minister could, if he wished, decide that these part-time dispensary doctors in any area should be full-time officers, and similarly with regard to mid-wives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, you have the case of engineers to local authorities.  They are now under the county councils. <Col N="579" /> Some are only part-time officers, just as they were when previously employed by the boards of health.  They are paid small salaries.  I do not think the present arrangement is a desirable one.  I think that the engineer of a local authority should be a whole-time officer, and should be paid a salary sufficient to remunerate him for his services.  Under the present system they must engage in some other work. From the local authorities' point of view, it is not satisfactory to have them as part-time officers.  I think it would be well if this section were more clearly defined as to what officers it covers, whether existing officers or only future officers.  In many cases that I am aware of, the existing officers should be whole-time officers.  If put in that position they would, of course, require to be better remunerated than they are at present.  I think that the section is likely to be a very controversial one unless its provisions are more clearly defined than they are in the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to Part IV, which deals with construction of bridges, I would like the Minister to bear in mind that some local authorities have already gone very far in the matter of the erection of bridges.  This section, I take it, will apply to all bridges in the future.  The existing legislation deals only with the Bridges Act which made provision for the erection of a bridge by two or more adjoining counties.  I take it this part of the Bill will apply to all bridges within the area of a local authority.  I am aware that some local authorities have already spent a great deal of money in arranging for competitions for the preparation of plans for the erection of bridges in their area. They incurred that expense in good faith, and it would be a serious matter if all the expense and trouble they have gone to were to go for naught.  It would be too bad if, when this section becomes law, the Minister were to be in a position to tell the local authority that they would have to go over all that work again, especially in view of the fact that some of them have spent some thousands of pounds in getting plans prepared.  That has been so in the case <Col N="580" /> of the large bridge which the Wexford County Council propose to have erected outside the town of Wexford.  I hope it will not be necessary for the county council to have to spend more money in having new plans prepared and in getting borings made.</P>
    <P>Section 47 proposes to give the Minister additional ground for the removal of members of a local authority. I think that the Minister has sufficient ground already.  I hope that in future very full consideration will be given to the matter before the members of a local authority are removed from office.  I know quite well that the members of local authorities very often deserve to be removed from office.  As I have said, I do not think the Minister should look for additional powers in this matter, or that the Dáil should give them.  I repeat what I said before in the Dáil, that it is very easy for the members of a local authority to remove themselves from office.  What I mean is that local elections are held every three years.  It takes at least five or six years for many members of a local authority to get the slightest idea of local government law.</P>
    <P>After an election it very often happens that quite a large number of the members elected to a county council are new members.  They may have in mind the idea of reducing the rates because they feel that the ratepayers in their county are too heavily burdened.  The trouble is that they do not know how to go about the task they have in mind, and in that way get themselves up against the manager and the Minister.  In the end they find themselves removed from office.  I would ask the Minister to be sympathetic to the members of local authorities in that respect, and to understand that the officials, the manager and the secretary of a local authority have it largely in their own hands to have a council removed from office.  I know that from experience.  On the other hand, if you have a sympathetic manager and a sympathetic secretary to a county council who understand what the members mean, they can help them and in that situation you will have very few councils removed from office.  But, as I say, it is in the <Col N="581" /> hands of the officials of a local authority, at any time, to have a council removed from office.  I firmly believe that if the officials of a local authority want a council removed from office at any time they can do so.</P>
    <P>With regard to Section 51, I want to say that in my opinion if there is any direction to be given to a local authority for the erection of road signs that direction should be given by the Minister and not by the Commissioner of the Gardaí or anybody else.  I do not think any outside body should have that power.  It should not be in the power of anybody to give the direction except the Minister.  In my opinion it would be undesirable that anyone other than the Minister should have the power to direct a council.</P>
    <P>As regards Section 55, which proposes to give power for changing the name of a street, I think it is a pity that, while the Minister has gone a certain distance in the right direction, he did not go further.  There is no reason why, because certain types of people live in a street and probably do not see eye to eye from the national point of view with the Government, or with the members of the local authority or with the general mass of the people, they should have the power to prevent a street name being changed: that they should be able to prevent that street being given a good national name in accordance with the views of the mass of the people in a town or district.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister, without putting in any proviso, should give a local authority the power to change the name of the street where the members of the local authority desire to do so.  After all, they are the elected representatives of the people. They are in a responsible position and should have that much power without being obliged to get the views of the ratepayers in any particular street.  I suggest to him that he should go further in this section and give that power to a local authority.</P>
    <P>I would urge him to go still further and give the local authority, the county council in this case, the power to change the name of any village or townland in their county, if they think <Col N="582" /> it well to do so.  I think the time has arrived when a council should have that power.  This, I suggest, is an opportune time to give county councils that power.  It is a power that county councils have been seeking for quite a long time, and it was expected that the Minister would have made provision for it in this Bill.  I know, for example, that 99 per cent. of the people in a village in County Wexford desire that its name should be changed to its old Gaelic name.  The county council has not the power to do that at present.  I believe I would be correct in saying that 99.9 per cent. of the residents in that village would desire to have that done.  The official name which the village has at present is not the name that the mass of the people desire it should have.  Their desire is that it should have the old Gaelic name.</P>

It is called officially Newtownbarry, and there is no power in law for the county council to change that name to its proper national name, that is, Bunclody.  I hope the Minister will amend this section in order to give local authorities power to change the names of villages, and towns also.  The local authority of a town should be given power to change the name of their town if they wish.  If the local authority in Dublin wanted to call this city Baile Atha Cliath instead of Dublin, there is no reason why they should not have power to do so.</P>

Those changes of names should not depend on the will and pleasure of any of the citizens who live in a particular town or village.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that if the people desired it there would be nothing wrong about it.  With regard to the section giving the Minister power to make an Order instructing the manager to be separately represented at a local inquiry, I wonder under what strange circumstances that would happen. Would it be on an occasion when that particular county council or urban council was in the dock, and an inquiry had been ordered by the Minister as to whether or not it should be put out of office?  It would be very bad in principle to have the manager of a local authority ordered by the Minister to go before a court of inquiry to give evidence against his own local authority. I hope that is not proposed in this section.  It is a dangerous procedure. The Minister has power to order the manager to be represented, at a local inquiry, separately from his own council.  He might be called upon to give evidence against that council. That is a dangerous procedure, and I suggest to the Minister that he should reconsider that section.  He has power also to compel the local authority to provide funds to pay for the legal advice the manager may need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that it is necessary to amend Section 67 with regard to the cutting of trees or hedges, but I think the Minister might have left it to the local authority or to the manager or the county engineer to determine at any stage of the year that the trees or hedges might be cut.  Those are all responsible men and they will not cut any hedge or tree unless it is necessary in the public interest to do so. It should have been left to their discretion to cut any tree or hedge at any time of the year.  I would go <Col N="584" /> further than that.  I think it is opportune that the law should be changed in respect of roadside fences.  Under the law as it stands a roadside fence is the property of the person who owns the land inside it.  I think the roadside fence, or at least half of it, should become the property of the road authorities.  In the case of many county roads it will be found that the road engineers are not free to trim the hedges as they should, because the local landowner owns the whole fence. I think the front of the roadside fence should be the property of the road authority, and that they should be allowed to treat the full frontage of the fence on the roadside just as if it were portion of the road.  We have not gone far enough in the section in giving the road authority the power that they need to keep roadside fences in proper condition.  In my opinion, the powers taken here are too limited.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not refer to the Second Schedule of this Bill at all.  I do not see any section in the Bill dealing with valuation.  There does not appear to be any section that has reference to the Second Schedule.  Certain Schedules are being amended, and I am just wondering how local rating will be affected.  Are the rates on the railways to be reduced under this? Are the railways to get a portion of the agricultural grant for the future? Is that what it means?  I should like the Minister to explain what the Second Schedule means.  Is the agricultural grant to be distributed to a wider section?  Is it to be made applicable to the railways?  I hope the Minister will give a further explanation to the House as to the new principle that is covered up by a whole lot of provisions in this Bill, making the county at large responsible for maintaining town commissioners.</P>
    <P>That is a new principle that is embodied in this Bill, and I expect that we will have further instances, as I said before, of making the county at large responsible for urban authorities. This is the first step in that direction. We can see the trend quite well.  As soon as you do that, you may put a roof over the whole country, because <Col N="585" /> nobody will live in the rural areas. They will all come in to avail of the amenities of the towns.  That is the direction in which such legislation is heading.  If the ratepayers of the county at large are going to pay for the maintenance of any town, the tendency will be for those rural dwellers to take full advantage of the amenities provided in any town area. I hope the trend of our legislation will not be in that direction.  All our efforts should be to try to keep the people on the land.  That is why another Minister has provided that in the future every rural dweller will have the benefits of electricity.  It is bad in principle to ask the ratepayers of any county to pay for the amenities in the towns, and I hope the Minister will not do so.</P>

      <P>I move the motion standing in the names of Deputy Anthony and myself:</P>
      <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that, owing to the increase in the price of milk, the National Free Milk Scheme grant of £90,000 to local authorities is inadequate to meet the demands of the various voluntary committees carrying out the distribution of the milk, and that an increase in this grant should be made to cover present demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion has been on the Order Paper for nearly 12 months.  It was put down immediately after an increase in the price of milk had been given to the producers, an increase which they richly deserved.  However, my point is this: that we have in Dublin, as you have in many parts of the country, voluntary organisations working this scheme for the Government and for the local authorities.  In Dublin we have the Infant Aid Society, who have upwards of 400 voluntary visitors, and with an exceptionally <Col N="586" /> good ladies' committee, representing all classes.  Now, Dublin's share of this national grant of £90,000 is £30,000, and it has been the same sum of £30,000 for the last five or six years, although the price of milk has been increased on at least two occasions, and, I think, on three occasions. What has happened in the case of the local authorities is that as the price of milk went up, the way the local authorities met that increased price, since the Government would not increase the grant, was to reduce the quantity of milk ordered for the benefit of the delicate children of necessitous parents.  One would have thought that, when an increase in price was agreed to by the Government, those public and charitable bodies that were receiving grants to carry out their work would get an increase in these grants to enable them to meet the demands made upon them.  Instead of that, what they have done is that they have taken the milk away from the babies of necessitous parents.  Now, this was a special type of high-grade milk, tuberculin-tested, and was of great benefit to the children of Dublin, and I, as well as others, asked here in the Dáil for an increase in the grant.</P>
    <P>I have before me a report of the Infant Aid Society, who complain that their activities have been seriously curtailed as a result of this.  The report says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The annual grant of £30,000 allocated by the Local Government Department under the National Free Milk Scheme was regarded some years ago as adequate and even generous, but now, owing to the rise in the price of milk and the increase of unemployment with its consequent increase in applicants for free milk, the society finds it hard to meet the demands made upon its resources. At the present time a much greater supply of milk is required to off-set the shortage in other foodstuffs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I remember being at a meeting at which a very eminent member of the Parliamentary Secretary's profession&mdash;I think it was Dr. Shanley&mdash; spoke.  Everybody in this House has a great regard for his opinion, and he <Col N="587" /> said at that time that malnutrition and starvation were widespread in this city. When a man of his standard and type speaks in that way at a meeting of the Infant Aid Society, when these proposals were being considered, I think that his remarks and his opinion are worthy of very special note.  Another paragraph of the report says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The most important activity of the Society is the daily distribution of milk.  During the past 12 months 2,172,384 pints were distributed for the benefit of children under five years of age whose parents were unable from their resources to provide them with a sufficient amount.  The milk supplied was produced from tuberculin-tested herds, the property of 13 contractors.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, Dublin City has 27 depots, and we are hoping, in the very near future, to open at least three more&mdash;one of them in connection with our big Dublin Corporation housing scheme.  In fact, I think that three of them will be in the new Corporation housing scheme.  That would mean that, because of lack of funds, the milk would have to be distributed over a greater area, and will mean that some necessitous parents' children, whom the voluntary inspectors thought worthy of recommending, will be deprived of the milk. Another paragraph from the report goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is only by visiting the poorer homes that any adequate idea can be gained of the distress and poverty that abound, and the hardships and suffering borne by the people, as revealed in recent reports of the Voluntary Visitors, make sad reading.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I shall not attempt to enlarge on the official statements in the annual report of the Infant Aid Society and of other societies that are doing this great work.  You have the Catholic Social Services Guild, the St. John Ambulance Brigade Feeding Centres, and so on, all doing magnificent work, but I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to consider the point I have made: that to permit an increase in the price of milk, and pay for it by a <Col N="588" /> reduction in the amount of milk consumed by the children, was very false economy and, perhaps I might be permitted to say, very bad management. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider this whole matter and to agree that £30,000 out of the total grant is insufficient for Dublin in view of the present circumstances.  I am supported, as I have already said, by this very fine committee of ladies in Dublin, who are giving all their services free of charge, and I am sure that in order to make a success of this great scheme we will have the blessing and good will of the Parliamentary Secretary. I am sorry that Deputy Anthony is not here.  He was to have seconded the motion, and I understand that he had some special figures to put forward to the House.  I am sure, however, that the motion will not fall through for want of a seconder.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the motion in general terms. If it were possible to induce the Parliamentary Secretary to give an increase in the present grant, it would be a very good thing, but, as I said before, in connection with all such matters, the only approach to a question of this character is along the lines that we have advocated from these benches time after time, and that is to put the father of the family in a position where he can buy these things for his children.  It is the same in the case of the distribution of free boots as in the case of the distribution of free milk, and so on, and until we reach that stage, the result of most of these motions will be just a palliative, and only a palliative.  However, on the merits of the motion itself, I can imagine the Parliamentary Secretary saying that Dublin is not faring too badly in connection with this particular grant, seeing that Dublin is getting one-third of the grant, while the population of Dublin is one-sixth of the whole, but I would remind him that the grant has been in existence for a considerable number of years and that, in the intervening years, the price of milk had advanced, and that advancement in price has had a very adverse <Col N="589" /> effect on the number of children that can be dealt with.  I think that that is obvious, seeing that there was only a fixed sum available so far as this committee was concerned.</P>
      <P>I understand that about two years ago the number of children dealt with was about 6,000, but to-day the number is about 4,000, owing to the fact that the committee is prevented from extending the scheme to deserving cases, and for that reason they appeal to the good feelings of the Minister to increase the grant. In some cases the committee went a little outside the ordinary regulations, and gave milk to some families that they wished to assist, but, as they had to cut their cloth according to measure, they were restricted in the number of deserving cases they could deal with.  I join in the appeal made for an increase of the grant, as the money could be put to good use as far as the Infant Aid Society in Dublin is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the motion.  The whole problem of dietetics, and the nutrition of our people is very important.  I do not think we have given it sufficient study. However, from some indications, I know that the Parliamentary Secretary has taken a deep interest in the subject in recent months.  Milk contains very essential vitamins.  It is a big problem as far as a large percentage of children of poorer people are concerned, inasmuch as they are not provided with essential proteins and vitamins. As Deputy Byrne pointed out, owing to the increased cost of milk, the quantity available to them has fallen. I do not know what the average consumption of milk represents, but, taking into account that we are an agricultural country, and that a big percentage of the people live on the land, the difficulty scarcely exists in rural Ireland.  In the bigger urban areas, and in the City of Dublin, however, there is no doubt whatever that there is a problem.  But it should be comparatively easy of solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know a little about what is being done in Great Britain regarding the milk problem.  Of course it is infinitely greater there than here, because of industrialisation and the <Col N="590" /> volume of population living in urban areas.  In Great Britain the consumption of milk averaged about half-a-pint per individual, and the policy of the public health departments was to raise the amount to something like one pint per individual per day.  That is not a big amount when it is considered that an infant requires two pints daily.  I am satisfied that a big percentage of the poorer people and children in slum districts, as well as in poorer quarters of our urban areas, are not getting anything like sufficient milk to effect a balanced diet.</P>
    <P>I realise also that the world population generally is not getting a proper standard of diet.  It has been comparatively easy to supply calories, because carbohydrate foods have been in abundant supply in the past.  At a convention held immediately before the end of the war, at which 44 nations were represented, it was decided that the aim should be to provide a proper dietary standard for the people of the world.  I take it that that meant a proper balanced dietary that would include the necessary proteins and vitamins.  The problem is not peculiar to this country, because the world food supply is far short of the necessary vitamins.  The position would appear to be easier as far as calories are concerned.</P>
    <P>This motion raises a very interesting question, even in our condition here, with the facilities we have to produce the more important high-value foods to effect a balanced dietary.  The situation here appears to be an extraordinary one, as a substantial percentage of people live on a dietary which is not balanced, that lacks essential vitamins and proteins.  Of course, the ideal thing to aim at is what Deputy O'Sullivan suggested, that parents should be provided with means to purchase necessaries which will ensure a healthy family existence.  The Parliamentary Secretary, being a medical man, knows better than anyone in the House that dietary lacking in essential vitamins is responsible for a great deal of disease, especially amongst children, so that even from the State point of view what the motion suggests would help to provide a healthy and virile <Col N="591" /> race, and, in the long run, would save expenditure on institutional treatment. It is certainly not false economy to provide a substantial sum, which would ensure that people not in a position to secure the necessary vitamins and proteins could be helped to do so by State assistance of that kind.  I am pleased to add my support to the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to associate myself with the motion.  I believe that a supply of milk is necessary for children. Half a pint of free milk is not sufficient where there are four or five children concerned, while the price of additional milk is 3½d. a pint.  The majority of members here are also members of public bodies, and, when making an estimate for these things locally, they should not be quibbling as regards the cost.  We who are members of public boards know what happens when an estimate is put before one of these bodies.  There is an outcry about the rates.  The question is asked: &ldquo;Where will the money come from?&rdquo;  That question is put by persons who urge that all these things should be done.</P>
      <P>The only way to get them done is by members of the local bodies voting additional money.  Nothing will be got from the Government; it is from the ratepayers everything comes.  I see people going out in the cities and towns for half a pint of milk and being charged at the rate of 3½d. per pint.  How can the farm labourer provide milk for his family on a wage of £1 19s. 6d. a week?  What good is half a pint of milk to a man on home assistance?  What can a man on unemployment assistance provide for his family?  The man on unemployment assistance in my town can receive no more than 14/- a week and a few vouchers.  How much milk can he provide for his family?  The position is much the same in the case of a man in the city on unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We talk about the nourishment of poor children but they are getting no nourishment.  Even if a man is employed, it is impossible, owing to the cost of living, for him to provide adequate nourishment for his family. Some members of public bodies use <Col N="592" /> the argument that poor families are in receipt of family allowances.  Too much is made of these family allowances. We are facing a cold winter. What will these people get?  A cwt. of wet turf, with a half-pint of milk. So far as the poor people are concerned, the social services are all wrong.  If the emergency had continued for a further five years, money would be found for an army, no matter where it would come from. But now we have no money for such purposes as this.  If we want to provide extra milk, we should provide the money.  The money will have to be got if we are to keep our people alive. Coming along the streets to-day, I saw compressors at work tearing down shelters.  Money could be found for air-raid shelters and money should be found for working-class and poor people now, especially for the young people who will be on these benches when present Parties will have disappeared.</P>
    <P>If you want a good nation, the nation must be fed, but to-day we have people queueing up for vouchers.  It would be far better if they were assured of decent wages.  It would be better if the worker were given a wage on which he could bring up his family in proper comfort than to have this system of vouchers and free milk which the workers do not want at all. What is wanted in this country, and every other country, is work for decent wages.  Now that the war is over, we are back where we were.  There is nothing facing the country but unemployment. Great Britain and the Six Counties threaten to send home our men.  I hope the reply of our Government will be that they will provide work at decent wages for those men when they come back.  If they do that, they will be only doing their duty.</P>
    <P>When an estimate for social services comes up at the local boards neither the Farmers' Party nor the Fianna Fáil Party nor any other Party should be quibbling.  If we are to do the things which should be done, we should provide the money.  We are all ratepayers and we shall all have to pay our share and make a sacrifice for those who are in need.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="593" /> We may not be out of the wood yet so far as the war is concerned.  Things are not too safe and we may have to fall back again on shelters.  If we have to do so, the necessary money will be found.  We are sending shiploads of food all over the world.  We are bringing over children from other countries while we have in our own country hundreds of thousands of children who are not too well off.  In every town and city you will see barefooted children. You will see fathers of poor children at O'Connell Bridge and every side street looking for coppers.  We have been told about the scarcity of labour during the past five years, while, at the same time, there are 40,000 or 50,000 unemployed.  I happened to be in the United Kingdom Office last week.  I had to wait there two hours to get a visa for a refugee to go back.  The people were coming there in hundreds and were being treated not too nicely at all.  When they go inside, the porter says: &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; The answer is: &ldquo;I have come about my passport.&rdquo;  The next question is: &ldquo;What did you come home for?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>When they go to the Permit Office they are told to sit down, fill in a form and wait until they are called.  A person might be seated there until 4 o'clock in the evening and be told then that he has to come back again at 8 o'clock in the morning.  That is what is happening in this country, day in day out.  I heard a Deputy speak here to-day about the conditions under which cattle are carried on trains. Why, cattle are treated a lot better than some of our people going over to try to earn the wherewithal to buy new milk and bread and butter for those left at home are treated at Dun Laoghaire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the Parliamentary Secretary is a fair minded man and being a doctor he knows what our youngsters need.  He will agree with me, I am sure, when I say that local authorities must provide a certain amount of money to finance social services.  I should like him to increase the grant for milk so that every child <Col N="594" /> would get a half pint or a pint of milk no matter what the cost may be.  If we are to have a healthy race, healthy families and prevent the spread of T.B., ample supplies of new milk are necessary.</P>
    <P>Some few years ago the Department's regulations had the effect of putting people who could supply milk to poor families in rural areas out of business.  These regulations created monopolies for the big dairy men so that they could increase their prices. That happened all over the country.  If there was not water at the cow's head, the veterinary surgeon went out and closed down the dairy.  He told these people they could not sell milk unless they complied with the regulations. Probably the man whose dairy was closed was the only man in that area who could supply half a pint of milk to poor people in the immediate vicinity.  Now because there is no registered dairy in the area, the poor person cannot get half a pint of milk although he is entitled to it under the scheme.  These regulations have put people who were producing plenty of milk on all the small farms out of business.  At one time a person could buy a pint of milk anywhere.  To-day, owing to the regulations enforced, they have been driven out of business and the men who can rear 40 or 50 cows and have fine cowhouses have a monopoly of the business.  Signs on it, the price of milk has gone up.  Monopolies have been created, not for the betterment of the country but for the betterment of a certain clique, who are reaping the benefit of these regulations by charging what they like to the poor of the country.  I do not know whether I would be in order in referring to turf which also comes under the heading of social services.</P>

      <P>They cannot heat the milk with wet turf.  Certain people in my area started bottling dairies but when the emergency came along the bottling part was forgotten and they had to go back to the old churn again. They were then no better than the men whom they had put out of business.  Their excuse was that they could not get bottles.  That is the game that is going on and that is why poor people in rural districts, in the midst of full and plenty, have to pay 3½d. a pint for milk.  I know that in the city, of course, a fairly high price has to be charged owing to the cost of transport, but in the heart of the country where the cows are on grass all the summer, the people have been charged that price.  I know that the Farmers' Party may not approve of these remarks because they are advocating a better price for milk but if they succeed in getting it, who suffers?  The man with small wages, the man who is not able to pay.  He will have to do with less milk for his children.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary when he is reconsidering the milk scheme to make an adequate allowance of milk for every child and not to be content with an allowance of half a pint for a family.  Frequently I have to approach the town clerk or the county manager in my own area on behalf of various people to see that they will get this half-piont of milk, but I think that every family in receipt of home assistance or unemployment assistance should get a pint of milk in respect of each child in the family, even if there were six in family.  That would mean a total daily allowance of six pints of milk for such families, but milk is the principal item in their diet and we know that at present they are not able to buy flake meal.  At 4/- a stone, none of these people is able to buy flake meal which would be a useful addition to the milk if they could afford it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are going to improve the condition of people in need Ministers will require to be much more generous and social services will have to be administered without any means test.  There is supposed to be full and plenty for all <Col N="596" /> in this country but we are being criticised by certain people who say: &ldquo;What are you doing with the Government? You are letting the Government send food out of the country while thousands are starving.&rdquo;</P>

That is not too much to expect.  If he does that, it will not be necessary for members of local authorities to go to their home assistance officer or to the county manager with the appeal &ldquo;Such a man is in a very bad way; will you be able to give him a half-pint or a pint of milk?&rdquo;  That should not be.  The resources are there.  An unemployed man with a family cannot buy milk at the present price.  It is so much eye-wash to have a milk scheme under which we give half-a-pint of milk to a family.  As a worker, living in the midst of the poor, I can say that I do not know how they exist having regard to the present price of milk, butter, bread and turf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember, not very long ago, listening to the Parliamentary Secretary replying to a question on this subject.  I am very much afraid that his reply to this motion has already been made for him to a large extent.  I hope, when he comes to deal with the motion, he will try to regard it, not so much from the administrative point of view, but rather from the point of view of the new rôle that he has taken on of late in this House, that is, his rôle as the man who is mainly responsible in regard to public health matters in this country.  I think his attitude on a number of occasions recently in the House would portend not only a more liberal approach to many health problems, especially the problem of tuberculosis, but also that on certain questions he is prepared personally to go a good deal further than he is able to get support for officially.  I hope he will approach this problem from that point of view.</P>
      <P>Possibly it is true that the answer to the motion can be found locally, but there are many things that one finds in local affairs and the affairs of local authorities that are objectionable in many ways.  I think it would be regrettable that on this particular subject, which vitally affects the most perilous years of human life, the Parliamentary Secretary would not find it possible to approach the question from the medical point of view and from the point of view of continuing a very good service which was initiated and broadened out by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very easy for many of us on these benches to criticise the Government in relation to present social conditions and, personally, I feel the Government find it particularly difficult to <Col N="598" /> justify many of the problems that face us to-day, but, on this particular occasion, when we are dealing with the problem of safeguarding and strengthening to some degree the health of children up to the age of five years, we should try to concentrate on the problem itself and to regard it, not merely from the point of view as to whether the main responsibility should be borne by the Central Exchequer or by local authorities but in the light of the new approach to the problem indicated by the Parliamentary Secretary on the occasion when we discussed the Bill dealing with the treatment of tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>Although, I am afraid, to some extent a day or two ago in the House he went back on his position as indicated on that occasion, we should not allow his attitude on that occasion to be weakened by general criticism, but we should support it.  Now we are asking not for any large or exaggerated expenditure, not for any new feature of social service, but merely asking the Government to keep to the standard in the system of milk distribution which they themselves found necessary some three or four years ago.  We should try to find some point of agreement with the Parliamentary Secretary in regard to that matter.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that possibly the deficiency in volume that has resulted through the increase in the price of milk could be made good locally, but if there are sins of omission on the part of local authorities I do not think that in this particular instance the Parliamentary Secretary, either for the sake of scoring a debating point or for the sake of protecting the Government against the effect of the motion, should take advantage of that. I think he should try to support the motion on the basis that at a particular time the Government found it not only expedient but wise to make a certain grant which allowed the provision of a certain quantity of milk, that that quantity is no longer available for certain reasons, that if that quantity was justifiable some years ago, in present conditions and in the light of the new approach by the <Col N="599" /> Government, and particularly by the Parliamentary Secretary, to such problems, it might be possible to add to the sum now available so as to ensure the distribution of milk on the basis of the free milk scheme in the same volume as formerly applied.</P>
    <P>So far as the value of the milk and effect on the children are concerned, do not think anybody in this House has clearer appreciation than the Parliamentary Secretary.  It is quite clear that, at least in large cities, particularly Dublin, the 2,000,000 pints of milk distributed under this scheme are of tremendous benefit to infants up to the age of five years.  The only regrettable feature is that it cannot be continued beyond that age and on a larger scale and that its application cannot be extended to bring in a greater number of children without the application of this form of means test. But these are features of a broader problem, the problem of the general approach to tuberculosis, the lack of adequate and proper food amongst the population generally, and I do think, on the narrow question we are debating to-night, the Parliamentary Secretary, as he has done on a previous occasion, should take his courage in his hand and, if not able publicly to accept the motion, should at least personally undertake in his official capacity to press with considerable force the point of view that has been expressed here to-night, namely, that, at least in so far as the Government has considerably amplified the scheme and made available more money, they should continue to maintain the standard that they set up some years ago by allowing an increased allocation which would allow the provision of milk in the volume previously obtaining. The actual amount involved is not very great and, at a period when we are on the verge of a very considerable saving in so far as expenditure on defence measures is concerned, the amount required would be infinitesimal as against the beneficial results that would flow from adding, again, at least in the City of Dublin, to the 4,000 children who at present receive this milk the other 2,000 who unfortunately <Col N="600" /> had to be deprived of it as a result of the increase in cost.</P>
    <P>I would urge on this point that the statement which the Parliamentary Secretary made on a previous occasion might be passed by and that he should try to approach this problem with the same attitude that he took up when introducing the Sanatorium Bill and spoke at some length on the general problem of tuberculosis in this country.</P>

      <P>As the seconder of Deputy Byrne's motion, I associate myself very fully with it.  I should like to join with the other Deputies in appealing to the Parliamentary Secretary to give this matter his most sympathetic consideration.  As Deputy Byrne has very ably pointed out, it chiefly concerns a section of our people with whom we have very much sympathy, namely, the poorer classes. Deputy Byrne and Deputy O'Sullivan have explained the situation with regard to the conditions prevailing in the City of Dublin.  Similar conditions exist in other districts in the country, especially in the big towns.  I am sure that the taxpayers, who, we are aware, are very heavily burdened at the moment, would be the very last people to oppose a substantial increase in the grant for this most deserving scheme. Everyone is aware that milk is very essential, especially to young children. In many homes throughout the country, especially in the large towns, this milk scheme has certainly been of very great help.  I would be pleased to see it continued in the future and, as Deputy Byrne has pointed out, I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will give the matter his most sympathetic consideration, as he realises the great importance of the scheme.  Milk is very necessary so that our children may be brought up as good healthy citizens.  Therefore, I trust that the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to hold out some hope of a substantial increase in this grant in the future.</P>

      <P>I feel that I am intruding somewhat, but I am one of the few producers of milk who spoke on this question.  I certainly would not like to see our children deprived of any milk, but not very long ago when this Party <Col N="601" /> put forward a motion asking for 1/- a gallon for milk in the summer time and 1/3 in the winter, most Deputies voted against it.  I wonder what was in their minds?  It is no wonder that milk is getting scarce.  There is a very big difference between the unfortunate producers who are sending milk to the creameries with a view to supplying butter for the people and those who produce milk for sale in the towns and cities.  I could never understand the mentality of those who voted against that motion.</P>

      <P>Where is the city dairyman who supplies milk to the cities under this scheme to get the milk except from the farmers?  When these men are not able to keep up the supply, they come to the creameries for it.  The production of milk has declined and it is no wonder that that should be so.  The two great laws of logic are cause and effect and I was dealing with the cause.  My teeth water, so to speak, when I hear of the wonderful price the Dublin dairyman gets.  Of course, he has bigger expenses than we have in delivering the milk, etc.; but we would be very glad to get a little more for our milk.  If we had been given the price we asked for two years ago, there would not be the decline in production which we have at present. We cannot keep cows and supply milk at 10½d. per gallon in the summer and 1/- per gallon in the winter.  You will not get an adequate supply of milk until you increase the price.  The supply of butter will also be short until you pay the farmer adequately for his work.  It is a case of: &ldquo;To hell with the farmer.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It is pleasant to find&mdash;it is a rather common experience with me&mdash;that all Parties in the House are anxious that more money should be spent.  That is encouraging.  But if we are to spend more money on every aspect of the social life of our people we have to get the money somewhere.  When we look for the money, whether it be in the form of rates or in the form of taxation, we do not get the same enthusiastic support from all Parties in this House. Deputies tell me that they are all behind me and that they are all for spending unlimited money on supplying poor children with milk.  Similarly, they are all behind me in spending unlimited money on trying to stamp out tuberculosis.  The same attitude is adopted in this House in relation to every aspect of social life that is discussed here.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is anybody in this House who would be happier than I if I could be assured that every child in Ireland had an adequate supply of the most wholesome food that a child could be supplied with, that is, milk. We should all be happy if we could reach that position.  The question to which we have to address ourselves is: &ldquo;How is it to be done?&rdquo;  The motion says that, owing to the increased price, the grant of £90,000 per annum for the provision of free milk is inadequate. Very probably it is.  It was never intended that the State, by way of free grants, should provide an adequate supply of free milk to all the necessitous children in this country. Deputies who are disposed to criticise the adequacy of £90,000 per year out of central taxation for this purpose will at least remember that, before this Government came into office, no money was provided for this purpose&mdash;not a penny.  I do not want to labour that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>If the grant of £90,000 a year is not adequate for its purpose, <Col N="603" /> it seems to me that the local authority has not only the right but the duty to supplement that grant and to see that necessitous children get an adequate supply of milk.</P>
      <P>As I said at the outset, when it comes to supplying any commodity out of public funds the financial burden must be borne either by way of central taxation or by rates.  The local authority cannot supply milk or anything else free, unless it raises the necessary money by way of rate.  On more than one occasion, I have advanced in this House the thesis that the financing of such schemes by way of rate is a sounder social policy than such financing by way of central taxation.  The taxpayer will pay in accordance with his consumption of the goods that are taxed and in accordance with his income: the ratepayer will pay the money in accordance with the valuation of his actual property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hughes made a speech: I am making one now.  If a commodity in general consumption has to be taxed&mdash;whether it be tea, sugar, beer, tobacco or something else&mdash;the poor man will pay at least as much as the richest man in the land, if the money is raised in that way.  If the choice were given to the lower-incomed class to-morrow, as to whether there should be a reduction in the price of tobacco or an increase in the rate for the provision of some more milk, I believe they would say they would rather have cheaper tobacco.  However, we can afford to leave that point over.  The man of £100 valuation will pay 20 times as much by way of rate as the man with £5 valuation. Surely, it is more equitable and more in the interests of the poor that, if we have to raise money for these purposes, we should raise it by way of rate rather than by way of taxation?  Deputies may say we should save it on the Army or save it on this, that or the other. I reply that, if we can reduce taxation, the argument still holds&mdash;the relief should go to the classes of the community most in need of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="604" /> Apart from these considerations, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the central authority in this State is already contributing very substantially towards maintaining nutritional standards in this country.  The general question of nutrition has been mentioned here and it has been stated, in the course of this debate, that there is a substantial number of people actually suffering from starvation in this country.  I want to say quite definitely that I do not believe it.  If it is true, it ought not to be the case.  Nobody in this country should be starving, or even hungry, and if there are people without sufficient food to maintain themselves, then the local authorities are not doing their duty to the extent that the central authority is doing it.</P>
    <P>I do not think you, Sir, were here when these matters were raised. Strictly speaking, I do not think they are in order at all.  The general question has been raised of the present nutritional state of our people and what the Government may have done towards relieving it.  A charge has been made and, with your permission, A Chinn Comhairle, I have to direct the attention of the House to certain facts regarding what the Government has done to ensure that, not only would the people be supplied with the necessaries of life by way of food, but that the food would be available to them. Under the heading of food subsidies, the estimated expenditure in the coming year is £3,070,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that include the local authorities' contribution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is food subsidies. Again, in order that another section of the community may be induced to provide the food that is necessary, if we are to avoid the starvation or the malnutrition to which Deputies have referred, we have agricultural produce subsidies, mainly to the dairying industry, in which Deputy Hughes is interested.  In order that farmers may be induced to produce milk for conversion, in the main, into butter&mdash;that being more profitable&mdash;£825,000 is being provided in the current year. In food vouchers, £582,000 is provided; in recoupment to local <Col N="605" /> authorities under the heading of food allowances, £170,000 is provided.</P>
      <P>Deputies have suggested that we should enable people in the lower-incomed groups to purchase food.  I suggest that the £2,230,000 we are providing by way of children's allowances in the current year enables children to secure food they would not otherwise secure, as their parents would not have the wherewithal to purchase it.</P>
      <P>Unemployment was mentioned, I think, by the mover of the motion, as a contributing factor to the undernourished state of the children of Dublin.  Undoubtedly, we have unemployment. Nothing in this motion will remedy that, but again I would mention that we are providing in the current year £1,020,000 by way of unemployment assistance.  It is not enough &mdash;every Deputy in the Opposition Benches will tell me it is not enough &mdash;but it is £1,020,000 more than any previous Government ever provided, and I think we are entitled to some credit for that.  Then there are supplemental allowances, school meals, and allowances under the heading of supplementary payments to certain beneficiaries under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act.  We get a grand total of £8,429,602, which is being provided by the State, by the Government, in order to maintain the nutritional status of our people.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that under these same headings the expenditure in 1931-32 was £14,838 10s. 0d.  I think, in the light of these figures, Deputies ought not to direct a complaint to the Government as to its efforts towards maintaining our people, and particularly the classes with lower incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nor is the entire milk distribution represented by the free milk grant. The Government is providing milk under various other schemes as well as through the instrumentality of the free milk grant.  In the City of Dublin, during the year 1943-44, 1,000,000 gallons of milk were provided under the food voucher scheme at a cost of £112,500; under the school meals scheme 250,000 gallons were provided at a cost of £29,166; under the maternity and child welfare scheme 4,079 gallons were <Col N="606" /> provided at an expenditure of £410 and under the free milk scheme 227,588 gallons were provided at a cost of £30,497, making a grand total, in relation to free milk distribution in the City of Dublin out of funds provided by the Government&mdash;excepting 50 per cent. under the maternity and child welfare scheme and the school meals scheme, which were only small amounts &mdash;of 1,481,667 gallons at a cost of £172,573.  Under these various headings, taking the State as a whole, the amount of milk distributed throughout the State in 1943/44 was 2,859,291 gallons at a cost of £313,457.  It is not merely a matter of the £90,000 grant for the provision of free milk; it becomes a matter of £313,457, in the year 1943/44, out of central taxation for the purpose of providing milk alone.  It may not be enough, but if it is not enough, I think it must become the responsibility of the local authority to make up any deficiency that may be there.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have mentioned&mdash;and Deputy Larkin, in particular, emphasised it&mdash;that the goal to be aimed at ought to be the organisation of a social order within which our people would be able to make the necessary provision for themselves and their dependents. That is the goal at which we should all aim; that is the condition of society we should like to see obtaining here, but it is a very difficult social order at which to arrive.  I hope we shall live to reach it, but we shall certainly have a long distance to travel. In the light of the facts that I have put before the House, I hope Deputies will not hesitate to reject the motion.  It is not that we have not sympathy with it&mdash;that is not the point.  We all have sympathy with any proposal that would provide milk for children who require it, but it cannot be done through the instrumentality of this motion.  It can be done by the local authorities themselves and, in so far as it rests with me, I am quite prepared to give the fullest encouragement to any and every local authority that will undertake additional expenditure under this heading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we can say that members of the Labour Party have <Col N="607" /> been, on more than one occasion, responsible for the view that the Parliamentary Secretary expressed to-night, and that is, that the remedy for the situation which gives rise to motions of this kind is to be obtained by endeavouring to put the parents and the children in such a position that they can do without such schemes.  One watching the whole gamut of events in this country in recent years is inclined to deplore the tendency in this direction and everybody who desires progress and self-respect among the people of the country would like to see the necessity for this obviated and a suitable alternative provided.</P>
      <P>I regret that the Parliamentary Secretary, when discussing this matter this evening, did not appear to be as optimistic as he used to be on former occasions.  I am sorry to note that he does not now believe that this idea could be realised.  I hope it is a temporary lapse on his part and that he will return to his old allegiance and the allegiance of his Party in this connection. If one could discriminate at all between services of this kind, one would be inclined to favour this particular service as the best of its kind until some suitable alternative is provided.  I feel, as a member of a local authority, that if the onus is put on local authorities to provide some additional contributions and to operate services of this kind as sympathetically and as broadly as possible, the local authorities, generally speaking, will not be behind in doing their part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I invite the Parliamentary Secretary to send a questionnaire to the local authorities or to provide some opportunity where this matter could be raised at the earliest possible date at meetings of local authorities.  In that way the whole subject could be thoroughly examined.  So long as we have to have schemes of this kind, I would like to see the basis of this scheme broadened, the stipulation that the scheme is to be confined to children under a certain age removed and a reversion to what I think was the original position, that children up to a much greater age could benefit under the scheme.  I would like to see the scheme supported by some general <Col N="608" /> policy in the schools for the purpose of providing milk, even if there has to be a small charge, for all the pupils of the school.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has put the onus of doing something further in this connection on the local authorities. I accept that and I think the local authorities will be quite prepared to do their part.  I am aware that in counties where the total amount available for supplementing old age pension allowances was exhausted, the local authorities cheerfully came to the rescue and provided a certain amount of money, pending the redemption of a promise made in this House that the local authorities would get 75 per cent. recoupment for every allowance provided in that respect.  I do not know whether it is intended that that promise should be fulfilled or not but the local authorities did their duty in that matter in certain counties where the need arose and, I have no doubt, will do their duty in this respect also.</P>
    <P>This matter ought to be approached from a broadly humanitarian point of view and it cannot be separated from whatever general policy there is in regard to public health.  While deploring the need for schemes of this kind and confidently believing that a situation can, and will ultimately, be realised in this country in which services of this kind may be dispensed with and the natural and proper alternative provided for the bread-winners, the parents of the children, I feel that this is one service which can be singled out as perhaps the best of its kind from the point of view of general health and the easement of the economic difficulties of many families.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In opposing this motion, the Parliamentary Secretary laboured at considerable length his contention that the Government had made very considerable advances in the matter of public services.  There is no doubt whatever that great progress has been made in regard to the amount of money provided for social services now as compared with 1930 and 1931, but the Parliamentary Secretary ignored the fact that the world has changed very much since those years.  In the last 15 years, we might safely say that more <Col N="609" /> than a century of history has been made, and perhaps many centuries.</P>
      <P>The world has changed and I would be quite safe in saying that the social services in this country compared as favourably with those of other countries in 1931 as they compare now.  As a matter of fact, I think the social services here compare less favourably with those of other countries now than they did in 1931.  If we have made considerable progress, other countries have made still more progress.  The world is perhaps becoming a little more enlightened.  The old idea that industry and trade and everything else should be assisted by keeping expenditure down, by keeping social services as cheap as possible, has been exploded, and we have universally a new approach to social problems, to economic problems and to the problems of governmental finance.</P>
      <P>This proposal does not ask for any increase in the volume of milk provided for the poor when the scheme was initiated.  It asks that the amount of milk provided when the scheme was introduced shall be maintained. The amount has had to be reduced because of the increase in the cost of producing milk and the increase in the cost of milk, and if there was a case for a sufficient quantity of milk when the scheme was introduced, there ought to be as good a case to-day at least for maintaining that quantity. Therefore, when the Parliamentary Secretary talks about economic progress, he must admit that, since the scheme was introduced, progress has not been made, that, as a matter of fact, there has been a movement in the opposite direction.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but this particular social service catered for a certain type of people, for children particularly, and I think a fair case has been made for maintaining the volume provided when the scheme was introduced.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary also sought to convince the House that it would be better to finance this scheme of free milk distribution entirely out of local funds.  He sought to make the extraordinary case that it would be more equitable if the local ratepayer, instead of the general taxpayer, were to bear the cost.  He apparently completely overlooked the fact that there is not, and never has been, any relationship between poor law valuations and the contribution which a local ratepayer has to make and the income of the local ratepayer.  These two things have never borne any relationship to one another.</P>
      <P>I had better make the case quite clear to the Parliamentary Secretary. Suppose he were engaged in black-marketing operations and had become very wealthy, and that I were a small farmer and that we lived on opposite sides of the same road.  The Parliamentary Secretary, as a successful black-marketeer, might have an income of £5,000 or £6,000 a year, while I, as a struggling farmer, might have an income of £100 a year.  Assuming that the Parliamentary Secretary was content to live in a moderate-sized detached residence, his rateable valuation might be exactly the same as mine.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Now the Parliamentary Secretary gets on to another aspect. The Parliamentary Secretary wants to take the burden of financing free milk distribution off the shoulders of the income-tax payer altogether.  He would exempt the income-tax payer from all responsibility for assisting in providing free milk for the poor and would place the entire burden on the shoulders of the struggling and harassed ratepayers. I am entirely in agreement with the principle that people should contribute to the services of the State according to their incomes, and you can only calculate that by finding out <Col N="611" /> their incomes and basing taxation on them, or by finding out what their outlay is and basing taxation on that. When I speak of basing taxation on outlay, I mean basing it on money spent particularly on non-essential luxuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see nothing wrong with the person who smokes heavily, who smokes two or three large packets of cigarettes in the day, when he can get them, making some little contribution towards helping to provide cheap or free milk for the poor.  I think it is quite equitable. It is a good principle for the State to tax a man who indulges excessively in luxuries in order to provide for deserving sections certain necessary commodities, and whatever the Parliamentary Secretary may say about the cost of <Col N="612" /> providing adequate supplies of milk for those who need them, there is one thing on which the Parliamentary Secretary will agree with me, that is, that for the children of families affected with T.B., children who live in surroundings in which they are very likely to contract the disease, children of delicate parents and children who are themselves delicate, no question of expense should deter the Parliamentary Secretary from providing an absolute sufficiency of milk.</P>
