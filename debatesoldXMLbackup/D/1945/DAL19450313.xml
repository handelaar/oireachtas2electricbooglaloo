      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state whether any estimate has been made, and the result of any such estimate, of the amount of money which may reasonably be expected to be available yearly for the next five years for the purpose of (i) increasing and improving agricultural production; (ii) increasing and improving industrial production, and (iii) the provision of housing, schools and other social equipment; and, if not, if he will take steps to have such an estimate made.</P>

      <P>No such estimate has been made and it is doubtful whether any attempt to do so would repay the time and labour required. The attempt would involve hazardous predictions, in respect of a period of five years, as to the essential requirements of the services mentioned by the Deputy, the other demands on the Government, and the resources available to meet the aggregate of public spending.  Moreover, so many assumptions would have to be made in relation to supplies, shipping, foreign exchange, internal and external demand, price levels, incomes and savings, that any estimate of the kind suggested by the Deputy would necessarily be highly speculative and hedged round with numerous qualifications and reservations.  Such an estimate would be of no value for practical purposes.</P>

      <P>Representations have been made to me regarding coal supplies for blacksmiths in certain districts in County Kerry. I have on many occasions explained in <Col N="1183" /> the Dáil that supplies of special smiths' coal are unobtainable at present and that blacksmiths must adapt themselves to the use of such coal as is available.  Arrangements have been made with local suppliers to enable the blacksmiths concerned to procure supplies of the most suitable coal which can be provided.</P>
      <P>I do not consider it practicable to fix a standard price for blacksmiths' or any other type of coal because of the varying prices at which this coal has to be purchased abroad or produced at home and of the varying costs involved in importing and distributing it throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that the present method of issuing information regarding maximum prices for commodities is unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever the maximum price of a commodity is fixed, the making of the <Col N="1184" /> relevant Order is announced in the Press by means of an advertisement and a publicity notice.  It is also announced over the radio.  In addition, a large-sized advertisement containing particulars of the maximum retail prices of a large range of commodities is published every fortnight in the four daily morning newspapers and in the evening papers published in Dublin and Cork.  These advertisements appear also in the 39 principal provincial newspapers.</P>
    <P>Apart from this publicity, a booklet on rationing and price control has been published for the guidance of shopkeepers. This booklet, which was first published in July, 1943, and of which four revised and up-to-date editions have appeared since, contains full particulars of the maximum prices of the principal commodities subject to price control.  A further revised edition has been prepared and will be published shortly.  This booklet is on sale at the Government Publications Sales Office, and other booksellers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that cutch is in short supply owing to the impossibility of importing it during the past three years.  In 1943 the directors of the Sea Fisheries Association, whose stock of cutch had dwindled to a fraction of actual requirements, sought the aid of the Scientific Research Bureau, with the result that a reasonably good substitute preservative for fishing nets was found.  I understand that the association can furnish particulars of this substitute to any fishermen seeking them.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware of the execution of court decrees against 33 leaseholders in Carndonagh for the non-payment of ground rents, and of the serious local unrest in the area as a result, and if he will state whether it is proposed to introduce legislation concerning the compulsory sale of ground rents to tenants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>I understand that the recent scenes in Carndonagh were the culmination of a concerted refusal on the part of a number of tenants to pay ground rents to persons legally entitled to those rents.  This refusal followed on the failure of the leaseholders and the ground landlords to agree on the terms for the purchase of the ground rents. The policy of non-recognition of the law has, in this case, been carried to the extent of making things as difficult as possible for the officers of the court.  Premises are barricaded against them, crowds are assembled to embarrass and intimidate them, and a campaign is carried on to deprive them of police protection.  The real question now at issue is whether organised obstruction or intimidation of the officers of the court in the discharge of their duty is to be tolerated.</P>
      <P>As regards the demands for further legislation on the subject of ground rents, I may point out that, so far as leaseholders generally are concerned, the present law as embodied in the Landlord and Tenant Acts, 1931 and 1943, represents a distinct advance on the position that obtained prior to 1931.  The demands of leaseholders for the further revision of the terms of the 1931 Act and for the introduction of a scheme for the compulsory sale of ground rents to leaseholders have been, and are at present, receiving careful consideration.  I cannot give any indication of what the Government's decision is likely to be on those questions nor can I, of course, say what, if any, further legislation on the subject may be approved by the Oireachtas.  It should be obvious, however, that no Government could allow itself to be coerced into taking precipitate decisions as regards this complicated and difficult matter by action such as has been reported from Carndonagh in the last week.</P>

James Bonner, parish priest, have appealed to the people that there will be no disturbance or intimidation so far as the execution of the decrees is concerned?

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state what action he intends to take regarding coast erosion on the Marshall estate at Callinafercy, Milltown, County Kerry; if he is aware that three holdings have been completely swept away by the incursion of the sea, two others partly destroyed and several others threatened; and, if so, if he will have the embankments restored at this point; and, in view of the fact that the people concerned have been so deprived of their holdings, if he is prepared to make a remission of annuities, with restrospective effect, in those cases.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission are not responsible for the repair or maintenance of the sea or river embankment on the Leeson Marshall estate at Callinafercy.  They have at present under consideration representations made on behalf of persons <Col N="1191" /> whose holdings at Callinafercy are stated to be subject to flooding as a result of the breaking of the embankments, and are having inquiries made with a view to determining what assistance, if any, they can give in the matter.  Should holdings or parts thereof be permanently submerged due to erosion, the question would arise of writing off as irrecoverable apportioned parts of the land purchase annuities applicable to the submerged areas, under Section 37 of the Land Act, 1933.</P>

      <P>I have received notice from the different Parties as to the matters to be discussed on this Vote on Account as follows:&mdash;Fine Gael: The economic situation and Government plans for dealing with it; Clann na Talmhan: Post-war agriculture; and Labour: (1) Planning for post-war reconstruction; (2) reorganisation of the social services with a view to promoting social security, and (3) recasting of the system of taxation and local rating so as to promote social justice.  In my opinion the last-mentioned is definitely a matter relating to taxation, which is not for discussion on this Vote&mdash; administration and expenditure being the subjects for discussion I think it must be deferred to the Budget debate.</P>

    <P>Is é an cuspóir atá leis an Vóta i gCuntas so, mar is eol do Theachtaí cheana, is dócha, ná airgead a chúr ar fáil chun na seirbhísí poiblí a choinneáil ar siúl le linn do na meastacháin do na seirbhísí ar leith á bheith á bplé go mion ag an Dáil.  Tógann sé, go hiondual, an chuid is mó de na céad cheithre míosa den bhliain airgeadais chun na Meastacháin a chríochnú agus an tAcht Leithreasa a rith.  Mar sin, is gá an méid airgid atá riachtanach chun íoc as na seirbhísí poiblí ar feadh na mí Abrán, Bealtaine, Meitheamh agus Iúl a sholáthar tríd an Vóta i gCuntas so.</P>
    <P>Tá £16,196,000 ag teastáil agus tá an tsuim seo comhdhéanta mar atá leagtha amach ar an bPáipéar Bán a chuir mé timpeall agus ar Chlár na hOibre.  I gcoitinne, iarrtar tuairim is trian den Mheastachán iomlán glan le haghaidh na bliana do gach Vóta.  Is é an t-iomlán atá uainn le haghaidh Seirbhísí Soláthair na bliana airgeadais seo romhainn ná £47,166,033, suim atá £1,035,344, níos mó ná an t-iomlán a soláthráodh, agus na Meastacháin Bhreise agus nua d'áireamh, don bhliain seo.  Ba é méid an tsoláthair sin ná £46,130,689.</P>
    <P>Is iad na fáthanna is mó atá leis an méadú so ar chostas na seirbhísí poiblí ná (1) soláthar breise de £1,223,935 do sholáthairtí le haghaidh cúnaimh airgid chun luach bídh agus ábhar teine a choinneáil gan ardú; (2) soláthar breise de bheagnach £700,000 do liúntais leanbhaí; agus (3) soláthar breise de £560,000 ag éirí as méaduithe ar bhónas, idir bhónas costais maireachtála agus bhónas éigeandála, a híoctar le Státsheirbhísigh.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1197" /> A Vote on Account is necessary, as Deputies are no doubt aware, to enable the various public services to be carried on while the individual Estimates for the Supply Services are being discussed in detail.  The greater part of the first four months of each financial year has usually elapsed before the consideration of the Estimates is completed and the Appropriation Act enacted.  Sufficient moneys to enable the various public services to be carried on up to the 31st July next have, therefore, to be provided by way of this Vote on Account.  The various items comprising the Vote on Account of £16,196,000 are set out on the Order Paper and in the White Paper which has been circulated.  In most cases, approximately one-third of the total net Estimate for the year is required.</P>
    <P>The total net sum required for the Supply Services for the coming financial year is £47,166,033, representing an increase of £1,035,344 on the net provision of £46,130,689 for the current year.  This latter sum includes all Supplementary and additional Estimates passed during 1944/45.  The original net provision for the current financial year was £44,982,644, and as compared with this figure, the 1945/46 provision has increased by £2,183,389. This increase of over £2,000,000 over the original Estimates for 1944/45 is mainly due to the following factors: (1) an increase of £1,223,935 in the Estimate for Supplies, due mainly to increased food and fuel subsidies; (2) an increase of £681,644 in the Estimate for Children's Allowance, owing to provision being made for a whole year as against only part of the current year, and (3) an increase arising from the grant of increased emergency bonus and bonus at 110 which combined account, so far as payments to civil servants are concerned, for £560,000 approximately.</P>
    <P>These increases are off-set to some extent by minor reductions and deductions on other Votes&mdash;by a reduction of £420,000 in the provision for the Army and by reduced provision in the Vote for Agriculture for fertilisers subsidies arising out of an anticipated reduction of supplies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1198" /> The usual explanatory details of the Army Estimates have again been omitted from the Estimates Volume as it would not be in the public interest to publish them.  As compared with the current year's Estimates, including Supplementaries, there are increases on 49 Estimates, decreases on 17, while five show no change.  The Estimates for the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau and the Railway Tribunal have disappeared.  The total of increases on the various Votes amounts to £2,285,805, while the total of the decreases is £1,250,461.</P>
    <P>I propose to refer to some of the principal differences in the Votes as compared with those in the 1944-45 Book of Estimates.  The first which appears is the Estimate for the Revenue Commissioners which shows an increase of £106,710.  Higher bonus and emergency bonus account for practically all of the increase. On Vote 16&mdash;Superannuation and Retired Allowances&mdash;there is an increase of £54,020, due to the extent of £6,000, approximately, to the recent decision to allow the application of a bonus figure of 110 to pensions granted on retirements since 1st July, 1940, with effect as from 1st January, 1945. The balance is due to an estimated increase in the number of pensions and gratuities payable.</P>
    <P>Vote 27&mdash;Widows' and Orphans' Pensions&mdash;shows a decrease of £200,000 due to a reduction in the State contribution to the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Fund consequent on an actuarial report that the annual statutory contributions had been in excess of the actuarial requirements necessary to maintain the present rates of pensions.  Vote 29&mdash;Agriculture&mdash;shows a decrease of £282,605.  This decrease is due almost entirely to a decrease of £335,361 on sub-head G (3)&mdash;Fertilisers Subsidies&mdash;offset to some extent by certain increases, the principal being sub-head A, £28,787, mostly bonus increase; E (2)&mdash;Veterinary Research&mdash; £8,065, due mostly to the acquisition of lands for a new Institute; F (2)&mdash; Grants to Private Agricultural Schools &mdash;£12,133, due, to the extent of £10,000 approximately, to refund of capital expenditure on Copsewood College; <Col N="1199" /> G (1)&mdash;Improvement of Milk Production&mdash;£7,103 (mostly in respect of supervisor staff); H&mdash;Grants to County Committees of Agriculture, £5,290 (<i>pro rata</i> with increase of local rates of contribution); M (9)&mdash;Farm Improvements Schemes&mdash;£5,652 (staff charges), and O (10)&mdash;Compulsory Tillage Operations&mdash;£9,323 (staff charges).</P>
    <P>Vote 30&mdash;Agricultural Produce Subsidies&mdash;decrease, £45,000.  The reduction is due mainly to the decreased provision for cold storage and other allowances.  Vote 33&mdash;Gárda Síochána &mdash;increase, £149,056.  This increase is due almost entirely to increases in the rates of pay of the force.</P>
    <P>Vote 46&mdash;Primary Education&mdash;Increase, £93,694.  This increase is due almost entirely to teachers' salaries&mdash; (sub-head C (1)&mdash;and is occasioned to the extent of £28,000 approximately by increased emergency bonus and to the extent of £62,000 approximately by the introduction of bimonthly payment of teachers.  The latter is, however, fictitious and nonrecurrent as it merely provides for the payment in mid-March, 1946, of half that month's salary bill which would otherwise have fallen to be paid in the next financial year under the monthly system of payment.  Vote 47&mdash;Secondary Education&mdash;increase, £35,460. The increase is due mainly to the following factors: (1) Increases in the numbers of pupils, teachers and schools qualifying for the various types of grants provided for in the Estimate.  (2) A partial restoration of cuts imposed in 1939 on certain grants (capitation and laboratory grants). Vote No. 48&mdash;Technical Instruction&mdash; increase, £51,728.  Vote No. 49&mdash; Science and Art&mdash;increase, £12,229. Vote No. 52&mdash;Lands&mdash;increase, £52,475. Vote No. 53&mdash;Forestry&mdash;increase, £93,061.  Sub-head C (1) (Acquisition of Land) and C (2) (Cultural Operations) combined with the falling off in item 1 of Appropriations-in-Aid (Large Sales of Timber) account for practically the whole of this increase. Vote No. 56&mdash;Transport and Meteorological services&mdash;increase, £140,574. <Col N="1200" /> Apart from sundry smaller increases, the main increases here can be regarded as falling under the head of Civil Airports and might be classified under (1) Staff (both personnel and bonus&mdash;sub-heads B (1) and E (1), and (2) Capital Works&mdash;sub-heads B (5) and B (3).  Certain staff and other charges hitherto provided under Vote 9 (Office of Public Works) and Vote 10 (Public Works and Buildings) have been transferred to this Vote.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to Vote No. 57&mdash;Children's Allowances.  The increase of £681,644 is due to the fact that provision is being made for a whole year as against only part of the current year.  Vote No. 59&mdash;Unemployment Insurance and Unemployment Assistance&mdash;decrease, £102,195.  A downward trend in numbers qualifying for unemployment assistance combined with the partial deletion of provision hitherto made for contingencies account for this decrease.  Vote No. 61&mdash;Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;increase, £160,470.  Higher bonus and emergency bonus account for practically the whole of this increase. Vote No. 63&mdash;Army&mdash;decrease, £420,420.  While this Estimate shows a decrease, estimation is necessarily conjectural.  Vote No. 64&mdash;Army Pensions&mdash;increase, £37,000.  Vote No. 68 &mdash;Supplies&mdash;increase, £431,935.  Food Subsidies (sub-head F) and Fuel Subsidy (sub-head G) account almost entirely for this increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing the Vote on Account to-day most Deputies are, no doubt, conscious of the fact that we are opening our financial discussions at a very important point in our history.  The facts that will be brought before us, and the manner in which they will be reviewed between now and the time that we are finished with the Budget, will probably mean a big lot in our social, economic and, perhaps, political history.  We may hope that the military struggle in Europe will be finished by, say, the end of this year, please God.  We will be then facing a new world relieved of the pressure of war as far as Europe and our immediate neighbour is concerned. In that post-war period we will be free to bring all our efforts and <Col N="1201" /> intelligence to bear on our social and economic problems here.  So far as our political relations with other peoples, and our methods of dealing with them, are concerned, we will no longer suffer the strain of having to deal with outside people in a world labouring under the difficulties of war. What we will be more particularly concerned with in this Parliament during the next few months is, how we are going to approach the discussion of our economic and financial problems.</P>
      <P>After the war broke out, and after the Army Reserve had been mobilised without reference to the other Parties in the House, we had occasion, as I said here before, to make representations to the Government on that subject: to represent particularly to them that the economic situation was the one that we, at that time particularly, feared would create difficulties for us here.  We urged the Government to set up a detached body that would keep our economic situation under review, that would watch the trend of things in this country and outside of it and that would keep the Government fully informed&mdash;by experts, trained people, such as were no doubt available&mdash;of how these trends were likely to affect us here.  We urged that so that the Government might leave nothing undone, as year followed year during the emergency, to be prepared to deal with any economic situation that might arise and to take advantage of the fortunate position that we might be in after the war to go ahead quickly with our economic improvements.  We were particularly influenced in that not only by our general review of the situation at that time but from our experience of the five years that had passed before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the five years that preceded the outbreak of war 48,000 male employees in agriculture in this country had vanished off our Irish fields.  Male employment in agriculture had fallen during the five years before war broke out by 48,000 men. We had a smaller acreage under corn and root crops in 1939 than we had in 1934.  Our total crops of all kinds were down, too.  During those five years the taxation of the country had <Col N="1202" /> increased by something like £2,000,000, while the rates had gone up by about £1,600,000.  Generally, you had a fall in agricultural employment and in our total acreage under crops, with a rise in rates and taxation, so that the annual increment in the general employment situation had been completely wiped out.  We were concerned that, starting off from a rather weak position economically, we were getting into rather difficult circumstances, and we thought they should be kept fully under review.  The Government explained to us at that time that it was not necessary to have a special machinery for that, that they had all the equipment necessary for it.  Now we find ourselves coming towards the end of the war and, naturally, having suffered economically as a result of the war, looking forward with hope and with a certain amount of faith, to what exactly is going to happen to us and to some of our economic problems. In so far as we look to the Government for information bearing on those problems and for suggestions as to how they propose to approach them, the more we get from the Government, the more our hope weakens.  With Parliament at our disposal, with the whole machinery of Government in our hands, it ought not to be necessary for us to face to-morrow without a fairly systematic and simple review of what our problems are, or without information as to whether they are big or small.</P>
    <P>It is impossible not to reflect on the position at this phase of the last war. The manhood of this country was under the threat of conscription at the beginning of the last year of the last war.  The unity of the country, the vigour, courage, faith and power of co-operation displayed by every class enabled us not only to overcome the difficulties of the year 1918 but to overcome another four years of very serious difficulties so successfully that we find ourselves to-day, in the spring of the last year of the present war, completely master of our own situation, in regard to ascertaining the facts of the situation and placing these facts before an Irish Parliament and discussing them fully here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1203" /> There is no reason why the facts of the present situation should not be put before us clearly, why we should not have free and frank discussion on them and why everybody should not accept that these matters were being discussed by men of goodwill, interested in their country and prepared to do everything in their power to get clear as to what the facts are and as to what the best solution of our difficulties is.  But the more we see of publications from the Government, the less faith we have in the situation.  We are entitled to feel a little distrustful of the present situation being handled by a Government that was dealing with the last five years before war broke out and under whose régime the position that I mention came about.  But, at any rate, the Government are there and they have no political difficulty in this House.  They have a complete majority in the House and they can be perfectly open and perfectly frank in putting any matters before us, indicating what their mind is on these problems and allowing us to discuss them in the fullest possible way, knowing that, when the discussions are over, if they find that they cannot accept any of the suggestions or cannot mend their hand as a result of any of the criticisms here, they have the political power in this House to go and do whatever they want to do.  Therefore, there is no reason at all why we should not have the fullest possible discussion.</P>
    <P>The Report of the Inquiry into the Housing of the Working-classes of the City of Dublin not only indicates the serious position of a large part of the working population in the city, but suggests, to me at any rate, the hopelessness of thinking that the Government are capable of dealing with that situation.  It has already been pointed out here that this report, both in the body and in the appendices, contains a very simple summary of the poverty under which some of the people in the city exist.  The report points out that after the conditions of 10,000 families who were looking for corporation houses were examined, it was found that, eliminating 1,000, because they were one-person families, 30 per cent. <Col N="1204" /> of 9,000 odd families, when they were allowed £1 a week to maintain the first two persons and 5/- a week to maintain each additional child, had nothing left of their income to pay for rent, not to talk of any other amenity outside what is called essential subsistence. In regard to &ldquo;essential subsistence&rdquo; the report says, in paragraph 151:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have taken an average of the minimum and maximum incomes given for each category.  In taking 20/- for the first two members and 5/- each for the other members of the family, as the minimum required for essential subsistence, we have deliberately taken the lowest figure which we have seen put forward for this purpose.  We have done this in order to show we are not straining the evidence and we do not wish to be taken as suggesting that this figure is a fair one.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In 1936, after examination of workers' incomes, and conditions in York, a subsistence level was fixed by Mr. Rowntree, I think he fixed 43/6 as the minimum subsistence income required for a family comprising five persons, that is, the parents and three children.  On the basis taken by the inquiry into housing in Dublin, the minimum would be 35/-.  So that it is quite true that they have been very conservative in fixing the figure for essential subsistence.  We are told that 30 per cent, after keeping body and soul together, had not a ½d. to pay for rent, not to talk of anything else.</P>
    <P>That was the condition of 2,794 families.  In the case of 675 families, they had 5/- over out of which they could pay for rent.  In the case of 788, they had 10/- over.  That gives a picture of the poverty that exists amongst certain sections of the community that are looking for houses. When the committee reported on their general proposal with regard to housing, they concluded by giving an estimate as to the cost of providing the houses that were required in the city. In paragraph 652 they say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We assume the adoption of a building programme of 2,300 dwellings <Col N="1205" /> per annum for 20 years, on capital at 3 per cent. for a 60-year repayment period, and we estimate the financial effects to be as under.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is, that this committee, shall I say, of experts, who reported on the housing position in this city and gave suggestions as to how it should be dealt with in future, suggested that 2,300 houses were required to be built every year over 20 years and they assume that we would be able to get money at the rate of 3 per cent. over a 60-year repayment period.  It seems to me that they were driven to make a proposal like that by reason of their appreciation of what rents meant to the working population of the City of Dublin.  But their very assumption, which we may read as a kind of suggested proposal, shows how bankrupt we are of any hope that that suggestion can be dealt with by the present approach to it.</P>
    <P>I think it has been the practice in financing housing schemes under local government regulations to borrow money for 35 years and to repay it by any fixed annuity.  If you borrow the money required for these 2,300 dwellings per annum for 20 years at 3 per cent. over a period of 60 years, how much will it cost in interest charges more than if that money were borrowed for 35 years?  It will cost over £16,000,000 additional in the payment of interest charges to carry out the housing programme that is considered there if you take a 60 years' repayment period instead of the 35 years which has been traditional with the Department of Local Government in the past.  As I say, it is an index of the poverty position, the wages position, and the difficult position in which workers are from the point of view of paying rent at present and the sense of oppression of interest charges in the cost of housing.  But to think that we can approach our problem to-day by burdening the people who will be living in 40, 50, 60 and 70 years' time with additional interest charges over and above what the 35 year period would require to the extent of £16,000,000 or more shows complete bankruptcy on the part of the Government <Col N="1206" /> in approaching one of the problems that they no doubt, as well as we, consider a vital problem, namely, the provision of housing at reasonable rents that the workers can pay and the handling of our finances in such a way as to provide these houses.</P>
    <P>Then we have had a couple of reports from the Committee of Inquiry Into Post-emergency Agricultural Policy, and I think that nothing in these reports suggests to us that the situation is being dealt with in any kind of progressive way.  One of the remarkable things about the information given on page 4 of the report on the cattle dairying industries is that, in the year 1929-30, our total exports were £48,180,000, of which £31,935,000 were agricultural exports so that something like £17,000,000 worth of our exports at that particular time were non-agricultural exports.  By the year 1938-39, that £17,000,000 of non-agricultural exports had been reduced to £4,000,000 worth.  In the proposals suggested, and they are very few, there is a suggestion or promise that the matter will be dealt with at greater length and in greater detail in subsequent reports.</P>
    <P>Now we are in March, 1945, and we have not any suggestions worth calling suggestions that would indicate how the Government intend to help the agricultural industry to increase production. That is the real problem which we have to face here because, while we all want to deal with the general conditions of those classes in the country who are below subsistence level and have no definite prospect of being able to find employment for some time, and while we are concerned with the increasing of our social services and the increase in general of the standard of living of our people and their feeling of security in that standard of living, these can only be provided out of increased production established in a stable way.</P>
    <P>What we are particularly insistent must emerge out of the financial discussions on the Estimates and other matters that will be reviewed by us during the financial period this year is in what way our Government are <Col N="1207" /> going to help additional production or going to allow the producers of this country to get down to their problem and to give us additional production. That applies to agriculture and it applies to industry.  On the agricultural side we want to know how the dairy farmers are going either to be helped to increase or allowed to increase their production of milk and butter.  What additional production can we expect in the cattle industry? We had a situation at the Ballsbridge Show a couple of weeks ago where pedigree bulls of first quality went to Dublin butchers in large quantities and at prices lower than those obtained in the cattle market that week.  If that is an indication as to what is before the cattle industry, we want to know what the Government interpretation of it is.  We want to know what prospect there is of increased production of cattle.  That also applies to bacon and pigs, eggs and poultry, and to our dead meat industry.  These are primary ways in which we can have additional production and in which we should be able to hope for additional production. We want to know what the Government plans are and in what way we can help to perfect these plans.  If the Government has any plans, the producers, who are the only people who can increase production and give us better social services and relieve poverty, should know how they stand to-day.  Just as the individual farmer is the man who increases production, given the opportunity and the help to do so, so on our manufacturing side our manufacturers want to know the Government's policy regarding them. They want to know if the Government has plans of any kind, or intends to do anything to open up opportunities of any kind, to increase manufacture here for consumption at home or to bring back our export figure in non-agricultural produce to the £17,000,000 figure at which it stood in 1929 or 1930.</P>
    <P>It is not unreasonable to ask that these matters be put fully and frankly before us here.  Wherever we turn in the world, we see people energetically planning, through their associations, <Col N="1208" /> organisations and Parliaments, to deal urgently and quickly with the various aspects of their people's lives.  They are doing that especially in regard to what is now accepted as meaning so much in the well-being of various peoples, that is, their mutual trade. The Swedish Government has just completed a financial and commercial agreement with Great Britain.  They have been in the fortunate position that, for political reasons of one kind or another, their large exports to Great Britain during the war have been paid for in gold.  They have now agreed that that can be discontinued and they are prepared to accept sterling credit in respect of the very large quantities of timber, iron and other materials they propose to export to Great Britain.  There is a definite financial and a definite commercial agreement there.</P>
    <P>Although our economy is much more closely linked with Great Britain and, from the point of view of our people, much more vitally linked with Great Britain in trade matters, we do not know what our trading policy with Great Britain is likely to be, even during the current year.  If Sweden can settle its trading policy with Great Britain to-day, why cannot we do so? If we are making any approach and settling anything, our manufacturers and agriculturists should certainly know it to-day, so that they may prepare to take the fullest possible advantage of it.  Various people in Great Britain have indicated that this country is the nearest and, in immediate circumstances, perhaps the only country out of which they can hope to get certain supplies of vital foodstuffs to-day.  However, the only commodity in which an export market seems to be exhorted by the Government is eggs, but even when the people are urged to produce more eggs for export and are coaxed by being told that the more they produce the higher the price will be, they are not told what the market is for which they are expected to produce the eggs.  In our trading policy and in our plans for trading, it is time we were realistic, outspoken and frank.  We should be able to discuss <Col N="1209" /> the goods in respect of which we hope to develop and increase opportunities for export to Great Britain.</P>
    <P>As the next couple of years pass it will be realised more and more that our hope of the industrial development or economic improvement of our people depends upon our capacity to increase the production of those agricultural goods for which we cannot find a market in Great Britain.  We are concerned from time to time as to whether we cannot get any money other than sterling with which to make our purchases.  One of the effects of the economic war was the crippling of our capacity to get any other kind of money but sterling.  Before the economic war affected the trading relations between here and Great Britain we were exporting to Great Britain annually in domestic produce £7,000,000 more in value than Great Britain was exporting to us of her domestic produce.  In our trading in goods alone at that particular time we had a yearly amount of £7,000,000 sterling which we were able to exchange for other moneys when we wanted to make purchases in dollars or other currencies.  The economic war wiped that out completely.  The attitude adopted to trading with Great Britain now seems to be that of being grateful for some kind of £ to £ arrangement.  Until we can increase the value of our production here for export we will not make ourselves independent of Great Britain, nor will we solve the problems under which we labour here in not having any great natural resources.</P>
    <P>The war has indicated to us that we require a very considerable amount of goods of various kinds and they must be paid for.  In the interest of the general well-being of our people, we must organise vigorously and actively to obtain efficiency in production and so take our place in the export market.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister to-day whether any estimate has been made as to the amount of money which would be available for construction purposes here in industry and agriculture and for general social amenities, such as <Col N="1210" /> housing or schools.  The Minister glossed over the situation by saying that it was quite impossible to make any kind of estimate, that it would only be misleading.  The fact is that we have and can get get all the money we require to do any work we require to do in this country, to employ the men and women we have and the resources we have.</P>
    <P>We have some leeway of mind to make up in that matter.  We exported a couple of hundred thousand of our people to Great Britain during the war and we also sent out, through our banking system alone, about £67,000,000, to be invested in British Government securities.  During this war, therefore, we sent over a couple of hundred thousand of our people and also £67,000,000 to support British War Loans.  Some attempt might have been made to utilise all that at home here to keep our people working. Our experience of the fact that that has happened should quicken our minds and make us discuss the particular problems and difficulties which make it impossible for us to use our financial resources to put our people working at home instead of sending them to other countries.</P>
    <P>Whatever may be the advisability of the Australian Government approaching its banking policy in the way it proposes to approach it, we must take cognisance of the spirit in which they are approaching it.  In dealing with the new Banking Bill, which proposes to take a larger amount of control over Australian banking, the policy the Australian Government has in mind has been briefly and clearly outlined. It is there stated that increased interest has always been associated with increased unemployment and that, therefore, interest rates have to be controlled.  We have not yet had any indication from the Government as to what their attitude is towards interest rates, particularly interest rates for Government or local authority loans. I hope, when we come to deal with the Central Fund Bill, the Minister will be able to tell us something about it.</P>
    <P>At the present moment our money is backed by about £22,000,000 worth of British securities that are the property <Col N="1211" /> of our Central Bank.  The average earning for the past 12 months on these securities is about 1.56 or 1.58 per cent. That, I think, would suggest to us what the average earnings of our commercial banks are on the British Government securities that they hold. The banks in this country increased their deposits, between October, 1939, and December, 1944, by £74,000,000. That amount has been added to their liabilities in respect of Irish depositors, but the assets that we hold against that include about £67,000,000 in Great Britain.  I suggest that these assets of the Irish banks are earning money at about 1½ per cent.  That is a matter we ought to know something about.  It may or may not have a bearing.  If it has, we ought to know what the bearing is on the rate at which the Irish banks should lend money to the Irish Government, if they are called upon to do so.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Australian Government is that they must control interest rates, because when interest rates are high there is unemployment.  As regards their economic condition, looking back, they declared that in the depression of 1929-1933 the Commonwealth Bank and the Australian banking system should have been able to do more to mitigate the difficulties and distresses that fell on the Australian people during these years.  The new Bill was to be directed to the stability of currency, the maintenance of full employment and the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia.</P>
    <P>The Swedes are using a trade policy with Great Britain; the Australians are using a financial policy; the Americans are using an export and investment policy.  There is no country in the world that we cannot turn to and learn something from as to the pattern upon which various people are facing their problems.  Our policy is increased agricultural and industrial production as the first and most important step in solving any of the problems that confront us.  It is probably three years since we tried to discuss these matters, opening on the Vote on Account and continuing the discussion <Col N="1212" /> through the Budget.  We discussed the spirit in which people in various parts of the world were approaching the new world.  Those people are saying to themselves that if they had realised how easy it was to face serious problems, how easy it was to organise themselves and face difficulties and use their finances and their energies in order to overcome these difficulties in days of peace, they might have been able to avoid the war.  They are declaring to themselves that, having seen how easy it is in war, they are not going to allow the problems of peace to overcome them in the future and they will not be found lazy in facing them.  The various peoples of the world have found that their administrators, their organisers of industry, their bankers, could not organise and build to meet war, but they will expect them to-morrow to be able to organise and build and work to give the people the same security, the same employment, in peace as they had in war.</P>
    <P>What is affecting the ordinary rank and file of the people in other countries will affect our people here. When the first Parliament was set up here in January, 1919, we made our declaration there as to what we stood for and hoped to do for the people generally.  We have failed in many ways to do these things, but when we look around us, I think we can say to ourselves that, thanks be to God, whatever our failures have been, our country has not been involved, even through our failures, in the shocking distresses and losses in which other countries have been involved.  I suggest that we are in a better position more calmly and resolutely to learn from their mistakes and the appalling losses that have overcome them, and that we can exert ourselves and work just as well as they can and that we can hope, better than they can, to be able to face more resolutely the problems of peace.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government, in the political strength they have in the House, to realise what this House is and what it was put up here for, and to put before the people, fully and freely, the facts of the situation.  I <Col N="1213" /> ask them to tolerate our criticisms and representations in the spirit in which they are meant, and to accept us as people of goodwill, in whatever Party we are, people with a keen sense of responsibility to the country and a keen sense of what the difficulties are, but no less resolute in their faith and determination to do their best to pull together and discuss ways of solving difficulties.  We have better opportunities of doing so than we had in the closing years of the last war.  We were not then in the position that, happily, we are in to-day.  We had not our own machinery of Government; we had not our own Parliament in which to meet and discuss things in an orderly way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We gave notice to the Chair that we would raise the question of post-war planning for agriculture. There is a tendency, or there has been during the past few years, to talk a good deal about post-war planning.  A few years ago, when the post-war period appeared to be in the fardistant future, talk about post-war planning was, to a great extent, a form of escape from the realities of the then grim present; but the post-war period to-day appears to be coming very close to hand.  It may happen that, before the money which is being voted here to-day has been expended, we will find ourselves in the post-war period and we are entitled to know what plans the Government have in regard to agriculture, which is our most important fundamental industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few weeks ago, this Party put down a motion in regard to future agricultural policy.  The Minister told us that he was in entire sympathy with our proposals, but unfortunately he was afraid that it might not be possible to carry them out, and he gave us to understand that the bugbear was the Minister for Finance.  Now that the Minister for Finance is here, I think the House would be interested to know what the bugbear has to say in <Col N="1214" /> regard to those plans.  I agree with Deputy Mulcahy that the entire future of this State depends upon the extent to which we can develop both our agricultural and our industrial arms.  We are at present spending more and still more on administration.  We are presented to-day with a bill for a sum which is more than £1,000,000 greater than last year, a bill which has been stepped up rapidly during the past 15 years.  In 1930, when the Minister was one of a virile and vigorous Opposition, the Estimate for Supply Services was somewhere in the region of £20,000,000, and to-day it is over £47,000,000.  At that time, the Minister and his colleagues denounced the Government for the high rate of public spending and the heavy burden they were imposing on the people.</P>
    <P>I believe that we can never hope to build up agriculture and industry unless we tackle this question of the cost of administration boldly and firmly.  The Minister will ask: in what way can we reduce public expenditure? It is the Minister's duty to explain to us why it is that the rate of expenditure has continued to increase from year to year.  All the money which is voted over and above what we spent in 1930 is not being devoted to such services as pensions for the aged and infirm or assistance for the poor and destitute.  A very large percentage of the increase in national expenditure is represented by the cost of administration, and that is the danger which the nation has to face.</P>
    <P>Not alone is there a danger in the fact that so great a proportion of our national income is being diverted to unproductive services, but there is a danger inherent in the fact that so large a percentage of our people are now being employed at work which adds nothing to the national wealth. The community must, and can only, live out of the wealth produced by the community, that is, the consumable goods which the people produce, and this expenditure of £47,000,000 odd adds very little to the sum total of industrial and agricultural production. It would be very difficult for the Minister to prove that even a tiny fraction <Col N="1215" /> of that expenditure was being directed to increasing production.</P>
    <P>We of the Farmers' Party are particularly concerned about agriculture. We are particularly concerned about the position of the industry in the immediate post-war period.  We remember how agricultural prices through after the last war.  We remember how agricultural prices were depressed, how agricultural wages were depressed and how the volume of agricultural production was reduced because the farmer, deprived of the opportunity of earning money out of his industry, unable to make a profit, had no capital with which to expand and increase production.  Thus, in the 20 years between the termination of the last war and the beginning of the present war, there was no increase whatever in the volume of agricultural production and practically no increase in efficiency in agriculture.</P>
    <P>If agriculture is to be made sound and productive, two things are essential: first, the people engaged in the industry must have sufficient capital to enable them to increase and expand production and, secondly, they must have an assurance of reasonably remunerative prices.  With regard to capital, it is only necessary to compare the capital invested in agriculture in Ireland with the capital invested in agriculture in progressive agricultural countries, such as Denmark, Poland and Belgium, to realise that in those countries the amount of capital invested in farm buildings, in agricultural implements and equipment of every kind is more than double the amount invested here.</P>
    <P>The agricultural industry in Ireland has been starved for capital over a very long period.  I could quote instances from my own personal knowledge to show how even progressive farmers have been deterred from investing more capital in their own farms because of the high rate of interest charged both by the banks and the Agricultural Credit Corporation for money advanced.  I have known farmers who were contemplating erecting out-buildings, cow-houses or hay <Col N="1216" /> barns, whose first question is whether they can raise the money by loan, and who find, on investigating the loan charges of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, that the amount which they would be called on to repay would be almost double the amount borrowed.  The ordinary practical farmer who is not inclined to throw money away is naturally slow to take advantage of credit facilities when he finds that he has to repay almost double the amount borrowed.</P>
    <P>I believe the first step towards putting agriculture on its feet is to provide the Agricultural Credit Corporation, or some similar body, with money at a much lower rate than that at which they can obtain it at present. The Minister will say that the Agricultural Credit Corporation has no source from which it can obtain money to advance to farmers, except the open market and that they have to get it at whatever price is charged, but I do not agree for one moment that there is no alternative source open to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
    <P>I believe that it is possible for this State to make money available at a nominal rate of interest for the development of agriculture.  All the money raised, whether by the banking institutions or by the Central Bank, is raised on security of the State and on that security alone.  There is nothing behind the money in circulation here except the security of the State.  That is quite ample security, because I believe that this State will survive, no matter what tribulations befall us.  The security which it gives to all money in circulation is, at least, as adequate as the security that was formerly given by the deposits of gold in the banks.  Since it is on security of the State that all money is issued, there is no reason why the State should be compelled to pay interest to private individuals or to private institutions for the money it requires, either for direct development work carried out by the State or for the purpose of making advances to agriculture or to industry.  I believe that is the first big question that must be <Col N="1217" /> tackled: the question of the State taking upon itself the power to raise money on its own security, free of the burden of interest charges, which crush and are crushing development work of all kinds, both in industry and in agriculture.  We know what it costs the State under the present system of financial administration to carry out housing schemes.  We know that the burden placed upon the taxpayers, and on the tenants of the houses provided, is more than double the actual cost of the houses so provided.  We know that more than 50 per cent. of the cost of every building scheme is represented by the interest charged on the money raised.  Therefore, if we are to develop agriculture, as we hope it will be developed, it is essential that the State should use its own powers of raising money for agricultural development and at the lowest possible cost and that, I believe, is simply the cost of book-keeping.</P>
    <P>After credit for agriculture the next important question that we have to consider is that of an assurance to those engaged in agricultural production of remunerative prices, and a remunerative market.  We know that the greater portion of our agricultural produce is consumed in the home market.  I know that there are some people who doubt that statement.  By taking a superficial view of our statistics they hold that the home market is not capable of consuming the greater portion of our agricultural produce.  I think that if anyone will take the trouble of looking into our shipping statistics, and into the figures relating to the volume of output here, they will find that we are consuming more than three-fourths of our total agricultural output.  Even in the prewar period the figures were somewhat similar, if we were to deduct from the value of our agricultural exports the value of agricultural imports.  Therefore, the home market is the first consideration in regard to the development of agriculture.  As far as the home market is concerned we can assure the agricultural producer of a reasonably remunerative price for produce. There may be, after the war, a demand for cheap food.  It might be a popular demand.  It would be a <Col N="1218" /> natural demand on the part of people not engaged in the production of food to get it as cheaply as possible.  We know what havoc was done to Great Britain by successive Governments there yielding to the clamour for cheap imported food.  We know that we may have a similar clamour here.  However, if the public are educated to the true facts of the situation, they will realise that cheap food is really dear food, because if the consuming public are provided with cheap food at the expense of the agricultural industry: if the production of cheap food results in the agricultural industry being forced into bankruptcy and in agricultural production going down steadily, if it results in the workers being driven off the land, then that popular cheap food will react upon the urban population in many ways.  It will react upon them, first of all, because an impoverished agricultural population cannot provide a market for the industrial products produced in urban areas.</P>
    <P>If the rural community are impoverished, sooner or later the urban population will also be impoverished, because they will have no market for the products of their industries.  In the same way an impoverished rural population will lead to the impoverishment of the commercial community, because, as we know, commerce exists mainly on the flow of trade from the rural areas to the cities and <i>vice versa.</i> Thus with the impoverishment of agriculture, we will have the entire economic structure brought into a condition of decay.  Hence it is not a sound policy to advocate cheap food for the urban population.  What the latter need and what they are entitled to demand, is agricultural produce at a reasonable price, based on the cost of production.  The urban population have no right to expect, and I do not think will expect, to be provided with food at less than what it costs to produce. For some years prior to the outbreak of war there is no doubt whatever, that the consuming public did receive agricultural produce and food supplies at far less than the cost of production.  But, was that <Col N="1219" /> of any service to the urban population or to the community generally? Did it not mean that the community were bankrupting the fundamental industry of the State?  Therefore, it is hoped that in the post-war period the Minister will see to it that those engaged in food production will receive a reasonable reward for their labour.  That is all that is asked.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the provision of reasonably economic prices for agricultural produce will benefit all sections of the community.  It will ensure, first of all, a home market for our secondary industries.  We who are engaged in agriculture are not in any way hostile to those engaged in industry. We recognise the industrialist as the farmer's brother.  Just as the farmer produces food which the people require, the industrialist provides clothing, machinery and implements which the farmer requires.  The danger which we see in the trend of Government policy up to the present is that too much money is being taken out of industrial and agricultural production and utilised in services, mainly State services, which add nothing to the real wealth of the nation.  That tendency must end.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that after the war there will not be the same wild scramble on the part of our young men and women to get into the Civil Service, to get into sheltered positions, to secure the pensions and various other gratuities which the State can provide.  We hope it will be the ambition of the young people to get into agriculture and industry.  We hope that boys and girls leaving the national and secondary schools will aim at getting employment on good progressive farms or in good progressive factories in this country.  We hope that the ambitious young men leaving the university and the college will be seeking not easy Government jobs but highly technical positions in industry and agriculture.  There is room both in agriculture and in industry for the best brains this country can produce.  We know that in the present war Irish brains have been <Col N="1220" /> active in almost every nation in the world, in productive industries that have been established as a result of the war.  Irish brains are directing the building of ships and the building of war machinery of every kind in all the great belligerent nations.  As Irishmen can distinguish themselves to this extent in other nations, there is no reason why they cannot distinguish themselves in agriculture and industry here.</P>
    <P>There is, I believe, a great future for both agriculture and industry in the post-war period, provided the State gives the right direction.  If, however, the view is taken by the Government that the farmer in this country should be able to compete against any type of opposition that he may meet in the market to which we must export, even against produce dumped there and subsidised, perhaps, by the particular Government concerned, if the view is taken that the farmer is not entitled to any protection whatever but must fend for himself, as he had to do during the 20 years preceding the present war, then there is no future for agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say: &ldquo;If we are going to protect agriculture we may be bolstering up inefficiency&rdquo;.  We often hear that argument.  I do not believe that any Government should bolster up in efficiency.  I think the farmer is entitled to a just price for his produce, which must be ascertained on the basis of costings taken out on the most efficient method of production.  If the farmer's costings are based on efficient production and if prices are based on those costings, there will be no question whatever of bolstering up inefficiency.  The farmer must be reasonably efficient in order to survive.  What we fear is that agricultural prices may be depressed far below the cost of the most efficient production possible.  That happened before and we are always faced with the danger of its happening again.</P>
    <P>I had a very interesting experience a few days ago.  A friend of mine told me that he was discussing the future of agricultural land values with a Dublin businessman.  The <Col N="1221" /> Dublin businessman expressed the opinion that agricultural land would hold its value after the war.  He said one of his main reasons for that opinion was that the farmers are alive to their interests; that they sent an independent Party into the Dáil and were not going to allow themselves to be cheated, as they were cheated after the last war.  I hope that Dublin businessman is right.</P>
    <P>It is only by the exercise of reasoned judgment in planning for agriculture that we can hope to avert the evils which befell the agricultural industry in the past.  This Party is determined to ensure that the Government will not adopt the same slipshod, haphazard attitude to agriculture that the present Government and its predecessors adopted before the war.  The Minister for Agriculture said that the Minister for Finance would not agree to a long-term policy for agriculture guaranteeing remunerative prices for the farmers. I do not see how the Minister for Finance can justify such an attitude. Agriculture is not a year-to-year industry; it is a long-term industry and a Government in an agricultural country must have a long-term financial policy.  They must not allow themselves to be influenced by old-fashioned ideas in regard to finance and credit.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is prepared to assure the House that, first of all, the peak point has been reached in regard to unproductive national expenditure if he is prepared to assure the House that from now on there is to be a steady cutting down of expenditure on administration, if he assures us that rigid and strict economy is to be enforced in all Government Departments, he will be giving the general community some hope for the future. But that is not enough.  He must also be prepared to assure us that he will see to it that agriculture has at its disposal the credit facilities which that industry urgently needs to enable the farmer to equip his holding with the most efficient machinery, with the best type of live stock, and with the most up-to-date farm buildings.  He must also give us an assurance that credit <Col N="1222" /> facilities will be available to enable the farmer to restore and increase the fertility of the soil, because, without that, up-to-date equipment and the best type of live stock and farm buildings will be of no avail.</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary and significant fact in regard to the Estimate before us that the only worth-while reduction in the volume of expenditure has been in regard to agriculture and I think the reduction occurs in a cutting down of the subsidy for fertilisers. That may be explained by the fact that fertilisers are not available to the same extent as heretofore; but it is just the one reduction that is undesirable at present.  If it is not possible or desirable to subsidise the price of fertilisers for the agricultural industry, surely some alternative means should have been found to assist the farmer to restore the fertility of his land.  If the money which has been saved in respect of subsidies on fertilisers had been directed to extending the Farm Improvements Scheme, thereby helping the farmer to improve his holding, it would be well spent.  But in an Estimate which provides for an increase of over £1,000,000 we have only that one economy which I have mentioned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that there is a reduction in regard to the Army.  Here we have the position that we have a very large reduction in the subsidy for fertilisers and that is not offset in any <Col N="1223" /> way by any increase in any grant for agriculture.  I have just indicated one way in which that reduction could have been offset.  There may be other ways which may suggest themselves to other Deputies.  But I think it is most undesirable, having regard to the extent to which the fertility of the soil has been depleted during the past five years, that we should have one of the largest economies at the expense of agriculture and, particularly, at the expense of the fertility of the soil. That indicates our attitude towards this Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hold that too much money is being devoted to unproductive services. Sooner or later there will have to be a reduction; sooner or later there will have to be economies in the national services and in the local services also.  But there has also got to be, in addition to that, a wide expansion in agriculture.  I have indicated that that expansion can be assisted to a great extent by the provision of credit facilities for agriculture at a nominal rate of interest, credit facilities to enable the farmer to re-equip and improve his holding.  In addition to that, we must have security of price.  The Minister for Agriculture has agreed to security of price in principle; he has agreed that it is a good thing, but he has indicated that the Minister for Finance would not support him.  I am anxious to hear what the Minister for Finance has to say.  I have indicated that security of price, so far as the majority of the products of the land is concerned, can be obtained in the home market.  It is also true that a considerable measure of security can be achieved in regard to our external markets if proper steps are taken by the Government to regulate and direct the marketing of our surplus agricultural produce.  It is essential that our Government, first of all, should meet the Government of Great Britain and endeavour to ascertain what their needs will be in the post-war period in regard to agricultural products and, having ascertained their needs, seek to make a deal with them covering a considerable period of years.  As I suggested <Col N="1224" /> on another occasion, it may not be possible to get down exactly to prices in dealing with the British Government but, at least, we should find out what they want, what they are prepared to take, and what they are prepared to give us preference for in their market.  In that way, we can secure a fair portion of that market.</P>
    <P>International trade in the post-war period will be on a more or less reciprocal basis and each nation will be more inclined to accept goods only from those nations which accept goods in return. We are in the happy position that we can offer the British people a good market for some of their surplus exports and we are entitled to demand a reasonable share of their market for our surplus.  In our dealings with other nations in the past, we have had a somewhat one-sided system of trade, under which we imported extensively and exported very little. That is a bad system and it should not be continued in the future.  We imported goods extensively from the farthest part of the earth, even from the Far East; but those nations took very little of our exportable surplus in exchange.  We have got to deal chiefly with the nations that buy from us and I think that can be arranged and should form the basis of a sound export trade.</P>
    <P>In planning the post-war period, it is desirable also that our Government should see that, to a larger extent, our exportable surplus as well as the goods that we import are carried in our own ships.  We must increase, extend and enlarge our mercantile marine.  Our own ships have proved their value during the present emergency and that should convince us that we should control the transport of goods from this country to other nations and, in the same way, take our share in the importing of goods here.  We are an island nation and there is no reason why we should not take a large part in the shipping trade of the world.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would say that it is highly desirable in the marketing of our agricultural produce that all overlapping, profiteering and interference should be eliminated.  It costs too much to convey our produce to Great <Col N="1225" /> Britain and it costs far too much to convey it to our own consumers.  One of the reasons why I am keen on the stabilising of agricultural prices at a remunerative level is that that will reduce the opportunities for profiteering in the distribution of agricultural goods.  When everybody knows what the farmer is getting for his produce, it will be less easy to profiteer in marketing. When we have an assurance of reasonably remunerative prices for agricultural produce, it will be more easy for farmers to establish proper co-operative societies for the marketing of goods.  One of the great difficulties about co-operative marketing of agricultural produce in the past was the violent fluctuation of prices.  They sometimes fluctuated so violently that a co-operative society with the best intentions in the world might find itself in complete bankruptcy in a year or two.  If the prices are stabilised, it will be possible for farmers to organise co-operatively to market their produce.</P>
    <P>The general lines along which I believe agriculture should be developed are the provision of better credit facilities, assured markets and assured prices. That will lead to efficiency in production and to an expansion in the volume of output, which is an all-important consideration.  We as a nation are producing far too little in relation to our population and our resources. The volume of agricultural and industrial output is far too low and it must be raised.  I hope that the Minister, in his reply, will indicate the ways and means by which he proposes to raise the volume of both our agricultural and our industrial output.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a number of figures from the Minister to-day and, speaking as an ordinary Deputy and as an ordinary citizen, I am appalled by the high cost of government at present.  We know that during these war years we are living in a period when to do anything costs more.  Running a country is bound, to a certain extent, to cost more.  I say that in all fairness to the Minister, as I do not want&mdash;and I am sure no Deputy wants&mdash;to blame the Minister for <Col N="1226" /> what is not his fault; but there are certain things which the Minister ought to have done to cut down the cost of government.  These are very difficult things for a member of the Opposition to talk about, but the fact remains that, by and large, the Government has not made the effort it ought to have made in that respect.</P>
      <P>Various Deputies here to-day talked about post-war planning.  As Deputy Mulcahy said, post-war planning is a subject that sometimes it is only too easy to talk about.  In other words, people talk about it in an effort to escape.  There is, however, a difference between hot air and genuine planning.  One of the things that must have struck every thinking person in this country is that, in these days, we are living in an age of planning, whether we like it or not.  Indeed, you can call it an age of Governmental interference, if you like.  Many people do not like Governmental interference. In some ways, I am not at all in love with it myself, but I can see no escape from it.  It is the age in which we live.  We cannot get away from it any more than we can get away from aeroplanes, motor cars and the internal combustion engine.  We cannot carry on modern civilisation without the Government interfering in the lives of the citizens and interfering in trade and agriculture.</P>
      <P>I have used the word &ldquo;interfering&rdquo; definitely to show that I am not in my heart of hearts a great lover of what I would call Government interference. But there must be Government planning.  If the Government carry it too far, it becomes interference; if they stop at the legitimate point at which they ought to stop, we can call it by the more sensible and more acceptable name, to many of us in this country, of Government planning. That has come to stay.  What evidence have we here that the Government have intelligently planned the productivity and the marketing of the products of this country?  I do not think they have planned that at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was last year that I asked a question of the Minister for Agriculture concerning the long-term agreements <Col N="1227" /> that the Governments of New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and Canada had made with the British Government. Those long-term agreements were for the sale of agricultural products. I got from the Minister for Agriculture what I would call a negative reply.  I think he said that they had accepted prices that were unacceptable to us.  I am not anxious that this Government would make contracts for the farming community which would be bad contracts.  Nobody would be.  But the British market is overwhelmingly the largest market that we have in which to sell our agricultural produce.</P>
    <P>I am sorry, if the Governments of New Zealand, Australia, Canada and South Africa have made contracts with the British Government, that those contracts will have an unfortunate effect on agricultural prices in this country and, apparently, the Minister for Agriculture has done nothing about it.  Supposing, after the war, we have no agricultural agreement with Great Britain, what will be the position of the individual farmer or farming group?  If the Government do not make a trade agreement that is advantageous, how can much smaller and less efficiently organised private bodies make anything like a proper agreement?  That is an aspect of the situation that I put to the Government in all seriousness and sincerity.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of our national budget that comes to mind is the very large amount of money that we spend on social services.  We are all glad to see social services carried on.  No one wants to see poverty or hunger or destitution.  What we do want to make sure of is that we get the best value for the money we spend.  I do not think we are getting the best value for the money we spend.  I will go still further and say that it is very difficult for anybody to know what degree of value we are getting, because the whole subject of social services in this country has never been scientifically examined.  Last year we had children's allowances introduced in the Dáil.  I <Col N="1228" /> think everybody was glad that children were to get allowances, but I felt at the time that that whole measure was just a step in the dark. I was in favour of it, but neither I nor anybody else in the Dáil knew the precise effect that the sum of money we voted for children's allowances would have, and I am not very certain now that we know the sociological results of the large sum of money which we are expending.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the whole system of our social services&mdash;that is to say, our old age pensions, home assistance, the outdoor relief grants made by local bodies, and the money advanced to tuberculosis patients&mdash;carefully examined by a commission and all the social services codified, or amalgamated under one separate Ministry.  We are spending millions and millions on social services and we just do not know exactly what value we are getting.  What we do know is that, on the one hand, we have people who are on the borderline of poverty, and, on the other hand, there are certain groups getting money which, perhaps, they do not need as much as other members of the community.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister for Finance, who deals with exact figures&mdash;he is the man in the Government who, I presume, says to the other members of the Cabinet: &ldquo;This is going to cost so much&rdquo;, or else when they ask him is he in favour of something, he queries: &ldquo;How much will it cost&rdquo;; he is the man who deals with the figures and looks for exact things&mdash;to use whatever influence he has to demand a scientific investigation of our social services and let us see exactly where we stand.  We are spending vast sums of money, but we just do not know where we are.  These social services in other countries have been made the subject of exact investigation.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I was just going to mention that; I was going to say to the Minister that in other countries outside bodies have <Col N="1229" /> carried out these investigations.  I think that Mr. Seebohm Rowntree in England carried out very exact investigations over a number of years in regard to various classes of the community in and around the City of York, but we here have not got the voluntary bodies which can carry out these investigations, or, at any rate, they do not carry them out.  It is vital for this country to have that statistical information and I put it to the Minister that it would pay us to carry out the investigations at our own cost.</P>

      <P>I would appeal, in short, for greater investigation, and for greater codification and unification of all the social services in this country. In conclusion, I say that we have been presented to-day with a very high cost and we have not seen the effort, which the ordinary citizens expect, to reduce the amount.  We have high taxation, high cost of living amounting to inflation, and we have not seen the Government taking the steps they ought to take.  I do not propose to go into the question of emigrants' remittances and so on, but other countries have adopted the policy of encouraging their citizens to save.  We have done so late in the day, and in a very small and, I might say, ineffective manner.  I should like again to emphasise that we live in an age of planning, in an age when the Government will examine into the affairs of the ordinary citizen in an increasing degree.  We want to see <Col N="1230" /> that done properly; we want to see it done well, and, in the case of social services, scientifically.  I plead for more information on all those subjects and, above all, for more intelligent planning for the future, because unless the Government comes to the assistance of industry and agriculture in the difficult post-war years, we shall be left at the post.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the viewpoint expressed by a number of close observers of the war situation is to be accepted as even tolerably accurate, this year may well witness the end of the holocaust in Europe and other parts of the world.  It must be clear to every clear-thinking person that the termination of the holocaust will not usher in a period of prosperity either here or elsewhere, but if the symptoms are read aright, rather a period of depression, a period of chaos and a period of commercial disorganisation which is bound to bring very serious consequences in its train.</P>
      <P>On the occasion of a debate of this kind at this particular juncture we are quite entitled to ask the Government to reveal without further delay its post-war plans so far as our own internal economy is concerned and its post-war plans for integrating our external trade with whatever world pattern of external trade is likely to arise following the war; but, although on many occasions during the past 18 months, and particularly during the past six months, the Government has been asked to reveal its post-war plans, there has so far been a decided reluctance on the part of the Government to indicate in what direction its mind is travelling in the various fields of national activity or the field of foreign policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether we like it or not&mdash;and in this matter we are almost powerless to influence the flow of world events and still more powerless to shape the course of the world's thoughts in economic matters&mdash;we are living in a world which very soon will be a planned world, if the statements made by the statesmen of various nations are to be relied upon, in a world which is going to hitch its destiny to a <Col N="1231" /> planning star and we have to make up our minds whether we are going to plan at home, or whether we are going to be a survival, and to exist as a survival, of the period of pre-war muddling.  It is impossible to imagine that we can have any satisfactory external trade on the basis of an unplanned economy at home, and, quite obviously, if we are to get even a tiny place in the international markets for such goods as are surplus to our own requirements, it is essential to plan our economy at home, because the method of planning, the basis of organisation and the whole price structure at home will depend upon our chances of being able to sell what might be described as our exportable surplus in a keenly competitive international market.</P>
    <P>Here in the short period of our existence as an independent nation various efforts have been made to develop the industrial and agricultural potentialities of the country, and in pre-war years we could measure with some accuracy the degree of success or failure which accompanied our efforts.  Since the outbreak of the war in 1939, the industrial fabric has been pretty badly shattered, and, while our agricultural fabric has stood up well to the shocks of the war, one can nevertheless see evidence that the industrial fabric is probably not likely to be able to continue, in the years of peace, under the same tension as was developed in respect of agriculture during the period of war.</P>
    <P>I should like to ascertain from the Minister at this stage what are the Government's post-war industrial plans.  Up to 1938, the Government's policy was one of a high rate of protection for native industry.  Unfortunately, that high rate of protection was not accompanied by a policy of ensuring (1) protection for the consumer, and (2) protection for those engaged in the manufacture of the protected goods.  The Government's policy in the pre-war years appeared to be to impose a tariff in respect of the importation of certain articles in order to encourage an industry here and <Col N="1232" /> then to wait to see what happened. There was no adequate protection for the consumer and no adequate protection for the conditions and wage levels of those engaged in the industry.  The Government seemed to be content with a policy of clapping on a very high tariff, without taking the necessary precautions which ought to accompany the prudent application of a tariff policy here or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Then 1938 arrived and the Government negotiated an agreement with Britain, under which it bound itself to review its own tariff policy on representations which could be made to it by manufacturing interests in Britain, and in quite a considerable number of cases the tariffs imposed by the Government were forced down as a result of the hearing of cases before what might be described as a Tariff Commission. It was quite evident from the character of the agreement then negotiated, from the hearing of the cases before the Tariff Commission and from the result of the commission's report that the Government were being, to some extent, forced off their policy of deciding as a Government the measure of protection they would afford to any particular industry.</P>
    <P>I should like to ascertain from the Minister whether it is the Government's post-war policy, whether it is part of their post-war plans, to continue to encourage the development of industries in Ireland by the imposition of tariffs; whether the degree of tariffs to be imposed is to be a matter for examination by a commission; and whether external trading interests are to be entitled to give evidence for the purpose of limiting the extent of the tariffs we may desire to impose on the importation of goods in order to help the development of an industry here, or will there be complete internal freedom to impose any tariff that may be necessary, if the purpose of the imposition of the tariff is to encourage the establishment of any industry here.  The Government have had some opportunity of examining the effects of their tariff policy in the past.</P>
    <P>Among the two most notable blemishes on that policy was the <Col N="1233" /> failure to protect the interests of the workers engaged in the protected industries.  Where the workers were able to get anything like tolerable conditions, these conditions were secured by them only because of persistent trade union action, but the Government, for its own part, took no steps whatever to ensure that if the investing public got substantial tariffs against competition from abroad they would be compelled to pay decent wages and to recognise decent conditions in the highly protected industries thus established.  While the worker was probably able, because of the character of the action which he could take, to protect himself to some degree against the ravages of some of those industrialists, many of whom were quite unscrupulous when it came to the payment of decent wages and the observance of fair conditions of employment, the ordinary consuming public had no protection whatever. One has only to recall the prices at which certain goods were sold in 1938 and 1939, and to compare them with the position ten years previously, to realise the extent to which the public were salted by some of those folk who unscrupulously charged high prices for their commodities because of the protection they had in the form of high tariffs.</P>
    <P>What, I ask the Minister, is to be the Government's post-war policy in that respect?  Our people have got to manufacture goods, to exploit their agricultural possibilities and to provide services as a way of living.  The provision of employment here for our people is a matter that vitally concerns the Government and the whole nation.  We could absorb in employment a considerable number of our unemployed people, and keep in employment those now employed if we took steps efficiently to reorganise our whole industrial organisation.  That is the first essential in order to maintain existing employment.</P>
    <P>If there is to be an absorption of our unemployed people and an avoidance of the criminal waste that goes hand in hand with unemployed people, it is essential that the Government <Col N="1234" /> must survey the industrial possibilities of the country and come to a decision as to what industries are suitable for development here.  The Government ought to reveal to the House what its proposals are, and tell us in what sphere of industrial development its mind is travelling.  So far we have got no detailed information on that subject from the Government.  Now and again the Minister for Supplies and Minister for Industry and Commerce, at a meeting of Fianna Fáil Cumainn, pulls the curtain aside, and, to some extent, you may get a fleeting glance at the future.  His speeches are made in places where it is not possible to get any detailed examination from him as to what his future policy is.  They are not made in this House, so that one is not in a position to ask him to develop any particular aspect of his post-war policy.  His speeches are made to selected audiences.  Unless one is a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, a Deputy is prevented from ascertaining from the Minister, by way of question and answer, what exactly his post-war policy is.</P>

      <P>With respect to the Government's agricultural policy, I think that, everything considered, our farmers and agricultural workers generally have made a marvellous contribution to the surmounting of our agricultural and food difficulties over the past five years.  It is quite true, of course, that we never really reached the cultivation of 3,000,000 acres of land out of the 12,000,000 acres of arable land that we have, but then one has to remember that over very large portions of the country the policy of spade labour still continues. We have not here a highly-mechanised agricultural community.  In the past <Col N="1235" /> we have relied to a very considerable extent on the policy of importing fertilisers, often to the neglect of using organic manures here.  But, taking the lean with the fat, I think that our agricultural community have made very substantial contributions to the nation's welfare over the past five years, not merely from the point of view of the farmer but from that of the agricultural worker as well.  So far as the agricultural worker is concerned, he was neither encouraged nor enthused to give of his best by the payment of low rates of wages to him during the war period.  If we go back to the period 1934 to 1939 we can see that, during it our agricultural production was pretty stagnant, and that if the war had not occurred we, probably, would have been able to show no substantial increase in the area under cultivation in 1945 as compared with 1935. It was the artificial stimulus of war that was responsible even for the present cultivated acreage, and my fear is that the moment the war tension is relieved, the moment there is freedom to import commodities from other countries, the moment actual fear is removed by the cessation of the conflict on land, on sea and in the air, inevitably there will be a slip back to the stagnant agricultural position of pre-war years.</P>
      <P>I think that would be a fatal agricultural mistake for us to make.  We ought to recognise that the land of this country is a very valuable source of wealth.  Many countries in Europe would give a good deal for the fertile Irish land.  If we are to avoid the mistake of allowing agriculture to slip back into its pre-war stagnant position, certain obvious precautions must be taken.  The farmer has made an indisputable claim for assistance from the State, not the type of <i>ad misericordiam</i> assistance, but the type of assistance to which he is entitled and which the industrialist gets in many respects by the imposition of high tariffs against his competitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the difficulties of the farming community is, of course, the fact that the great majority of farms are small and the owners of them are not equipped <Col N="1236" /> with sufficient capital.  It is of no use to offer a farmer, who has no capital, money at the rate of 5 per cent. because the farmer is unable to pay 5 per cent., having regard to the unfortunately low standard of living associated with agricultural production here.  If agriculture is to be assisted, I think it can be assisted only by the State making loans available to credit-worthy farmers at a normal rate of interest, not on the basis of paying dividends of 4 or 5 per cent. to bond holders, but merely at the cost of keeping the accounts of the loan.  Financed in that way, the farmer will be able to stock his land, to merchandise his farm, to provide agricultural implements required for the proper production of food and, probably, to get more and more away from spade labour which, unfortunately, is the ruination of agriculture and is capable of giving the farmer only a hopelessly inadequate return for his investment in the land and an intolerably low rate of wages to the agricultural worker.</P>
    <P>The State must recognise&mdash;and in this matter our financial stability will not be assailed in the slightest&mdash; that we must assist agriculture to rehabilitate itself in the post-war world.  That can be done, as I said, by giving the credit-worthy farmers financial assistance in the form of loans at a rate of interest to cover merely account-keeping.  These loans ought to be made available to the farmer to enable him to stock his land, to purchase implements, to fence and drain, and generally to make his land much more efficient in the production of food and a greater unit of wealth creation for the country.</P>
    <P>Have the Government any plans in that direction?  Is the farmer in future going to be placed in the position that in a highly competitive world, with one Minister screeching from time to time that everybody must work harder, with another Minister screeching that production costs must be cut down, he will have to take his deeds to the bank and try to borrow money at 5, 6 and, perhaps, 7 per cent., as the banks may decide to charge, or must he make an application, for <Col N="1237" /> instance, to an agricultural credit corporation which will lend him money at 4½ or 5 per cent?  I think the farmer ought to know where he stands in that matter.  I think he ought to know what State assistance will be given to him to enable him to restore the fertility of his land in the post-war period and to repair the ravages which a continuous tillage policy, unaccompanied by the importation of sufficient artificial fertilisers, has inevitably caused.</P>
    <P>We have also a very serious situation to face in respect of employment. During the past five years, approximately 160,000 of our people, I think, found employment in the Six Counties and in Britain.  When this war ends, some of them may get employment in Britain on certain types of work, mainly, I should think, building work.  Large numbers of them will not get that type of employment or any alternative employment because Britain will have the problem of rehabilitating her own people who are now scattered on the far-flung battlefields of the world.  In the pre-war period Britain was a workshop for the world but will a post-war Britain be a workshop for the world?  Sir Stafford Cripps said the other day that British output will have to be stepped up by 150 per cent. on its pre-war production in order to maintain the existing standard of living in Britain.  That is a high target and the fact that the British Government have already recognised that fact shows how concerned they are about production policy in the post-war period.</P>
    <P>Where is Britain going to sell in the post-war period?  Many of the nations to whom she sold goods in the past have been so impoverished by war that they may not be able to buy those goods at the prices at which it will be necessary to sell them in order to maintain a decent standard of living for the workers engaged in their production in Britain.  Many of the nations may not be able to buy from Britain because Britain will not buy from them.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not, Britain's position in the post-war period may be one in which opportunities for work on a large scale will not be available <Col N="1238" /> to our people.  It is all, of course, a matter for speculation.  Many emigrants may come home.  Many of them may say that, having spent four or five years in Britain, they are going to assert their God-given right to come back to the land of their birth, to live with their wives and children.  Boat loads of these people may sail in from day to day and these people may say to the Government: &ldquo;We have come back for our heritage.  We have the right to live in Ireland and to produce wealth in Ireland.  We have the right to live with our wives and children. We are not going to work in exile for the rest of our lives.&rdquo;  Suppose 100,000 of them came back.  Suppose 100,000 ask for their birthright, to work in their own land, and say that they are prepared to work in Ireland and that they are not prepared to work anywhere else.  Will not the Government be faced with a pretty problem then? Will not it be a nice situation to have 100,000 people who have been working in a bomb-ridden country for five years, suddenly presenting themselves here and saying: &ldquo;We want work and we are not going to work on rotational schemes; we are not going to work for two, three or four days a week; we are not going to be sent to the home assistance officer or to the employment exchange.&rdquo;  Suppose they say: &ldquo;We want work and we want to get decent rates of wages.  We have seen a country at war able to pay decent rates of wages.  We want our own people to pay us decent rates of wages.  We have been paid decent rates of wages for destroying wealth. Now pay us decent rates of wages for creating wealth.&rdquo;  I think the Government will be faced with a pretty problem if that should happen.  If all of that does not happen, a very substantial proportion of it will happen.</P>
    <P>Here, we are entitled to ask what is the Government's policy for dealing with a situation of that kind.  Supposing the British Government, the moment the war is over, says to its own people: &ldquo;We are going now to put you into employment at home and, in order to do that, everybody who was not born on British soil is going to leave Britain with the utmost expedition,&rdquo;<Col N="1239" /> and suppose, because of that, these migrants are sent back here, whether we like it or not, the Government will have to deal with that situation.  They can hardly evolve a policy by ignoring a possibility of that kind.  They can hardly adopt a Rip Van Winkle policy of saying: &ldquo;Let us sleep on that problem.  It may not arise but, in any case, we will get fewer headaches if we are asleep when it does arise.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What are the Government's proposals for dealing with that situation? This is 1945.  Everybody who reads the papers can see the direction in which the war is moving and see the prophecies by eminent statesmen, wielding tremendous power in their own highly-militarised countries, that the war may end soon.  If the war ends soon, we may be confronted with a problem such as I have adverted to. We ought to know what is the Government's policy for dealing with that situation.  I do not know what it is. I do not think the Government can tell these people that they are all covered by the unemployment insurance benefits.  I do not think they can tell them to go to the home assistance officer.  These people have put up with enough in the past five years and they will not take kindly to that kind of mendicant advice.  They will not want to be mendicants, nor will they allow anyone to make mendicants out of them.  They will insist on a decent standard of living.  They have lived in a country which, in the last five years, has had to tolerate many a grievous situation, and the toleration of these has burned a new sense of values into the people of that country and those who work there.  These folk who come back here may not be as easily fobbed off with empty promises as they were before they were tested in the crucible of experience in a bomb-ridden country.</P>
    <P>Then we have another situation.  We have a substantial number of persons in the Army.  I need not mention the number in a public debate of this kind. But many thousands of these will probably be demobilised when the war <Col N="1240" /> is over.  What are the Government going to do with them?  Some of them may have employment to go back to; others may have no employment. They have served the nation for the past five years.  What is the measure of our gratitude to be?  What are we going to do for them?  We cannot tell them to go to the labour exchange, that they are not wanted any longer. They were willing to risk their lives during the past five years.  Many of them neglected their own interests and the possibility of employment during the past five years in order to join the Army.  Many of them could have gone to Great Britain and earned very good wages were it not for the fact that they preferred to join the Army.  We have two choices to make in regard to these people.  We can tell them to go to the labour exchange and get whatever benefit they are entitled to.  We can show by doing that how callous we can be to people who stood by the nation in its hour of trial.  On the other hand, we can say to these people: &ldquo;We recognise the tremendous sacrifice which you made when you joined the Army and the rigour of the discipline which you had to undergo during the past four or five years.&rdquo;  We can say to them: &ldquo;Because of that, we are going to make plans for your future which will assure you of a decent income for the maintenance of yourselves and those dependent on you.&rdquo;  Which are we going to do?  Are we going to tell them to go to the labour exchange or the home assistance officer or plan a future for them which will represent, in some measure, our gratitude for their contribution to the nation during the past five years?  I should like the Minister to tell us that.</P>
    <P>Even if none of the emigrants comes back, even if not a single person is demobilised from the Army, we still have 76,000 persons registered to-day as unemployed.  That is a problem which obviously we, cannot tolerate, unless we are satisfied to continue to indulge in the criminal waste of having men and women idle in a relatively undeveloped country; idle when there is an abundance of work to be done and when there is no difficulty  <Col N="1241" /> in finding the need for the work and the necessary credits in order to finance it.  Suppose we get the impact of all three of these.  Suppose we get tens of thousands of emigrants back and large-scale demobilisation from the Army and the impact of these two on the fact that we have 76,000 unemployed to-day, can anybody picture the situation which we will have in the country?  Can anybody see the potential dangers in a situation of that kind?  Can anybody see the hopeless deterioration there can be in wage levels, in the condition of the workers, and in the whole industrial and agricultural fabric if you have the impact of these three factors producing an immediate deterioration and a rapidly and ever-widening deterioration as the days and weeks pass by?</P>
    <P>I should like to ascertain what the Government are planning in that connection. Have these problems occurred to the Government?  I am sure they have.  But they are not merely governmental problems; they are problems which affect the well-being of the whole nation.  In a matter of this kind the Government ought to share responsibility with this Parliament and with the nation to the extent, at least, of telling us in what direction their minds are travelling, what plans they are proposing to make, and what steps they intend to take in order to grapple with the very serious situation which is likely to arise after the war.  I saw a cartoon the other day which, probably, reflects the difference between our situation to-day and our post-war situation, in which one person was saying that he was enjoying the war as much as possible because the peace was going to be damned awful.  That is probably the position with us.  The war will be a spree almost compared with the situation we have confronting us in the post-war period.</P>
    <P>I should like to ascertain on an occasion like this what the Government propose to do to deal with that situation.  There is a vast amount of work which can be done, work in afforesting the country which is the most timber-denuded country in Europe; work in the provision of the <Col N="1242" /> tens of thousands of houses which are needed properly to house our people; work in the provision of schools and the elimination of those barns which are masquerading as schools so as to give our children a chance of learning under tolerable conditions.  There is still a large amount of work which could be usefully done in respect of draining the low-lying land in the country with a view to improving the fertility of the soil.  This vista of work opens up immense possibilities for the people and can be capable of providing a large measure of employment for the unemployed, whether they are at home to-day or whether they come home on the termination of the emergency.</P>
    <P>What is the Government's policy for dealing with a situation of that kind? The Minister did not indicate any of the Government's plans in his introductory statement.  He contented himself with the recital of figures as to the cost of the various Departments. I hope the Minister will avail of the opportunity to reveal to us and to the nation at large what the Government's policy is for dealing with a situation of that kind, for dealing with the very serious post-war situation.  I hope the Minister will find it possible to give the House an assurance that the Government have plans, that these plans will be revealed, that the nation's resources in the spheres of Industry and agriculture, large-scale schemes of public works and otherwise will be utilised to the fullest and that the nation's credit will be utilised to the fullest in order to finance new types of industrial and agricultural activities and new types of large-scale schemes of public works so as to absorb our people in the process of creating wealth and providing a decent livelihood for themselves, and not permit to develop here an unemployed State within the very State itself.</P>
    <P>I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again to-day.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Committee on Finance. - Defence Forces (Temporary" RHead="Provisions) Bill, 1945&mdash;Second Stage">
    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Bill, 1945&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a <Col N="1243" /> Second Time.  This is the annual Defence Forces Bill and its first purpose, therefore, is to continue the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts, 1923 to 1944, in force for another year&mdash;that is, up to the 31st March, 1946.  This is being done by Section 2 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>This year, however, I find it necessary to introduce some amendments of the existing Acts.  The principal amendments&mdash;those contained in Sections 3, 4 and 5&mdash;are necessitated by circumstances which will arise whenever we find ourselves in the fortunate position of being able to transfer the Defence Forces from an emergency to a peace-time footing.</P>
      <P>I shall first deal with Sections 3 and 4 of the Bill.  Section 3 provides that a non-commissioned officer or man enlisted for the duration of the emergency may, with his own consent, be transferred from his emergency engagement, without the necessity for formal discharge, to an ordinary engagement under Section 144 of the Act of 1923.  This new engagement will be deemed to have commenced on the date on which he entered upon his emergency engagement.  Section 4 makes somewhat similar provision in relation to non-commissioned officers and men of the reserve on permanent service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without going into figures which the House would not expect me to supply in present circumstances, I may say that in the past 5½ years there has naturally been a preponderance of enlistments for the duration of the emergency over enlistments for regular service.  This, coupled with the fact that many non-commissioned officers and men of the regular Army have become time-expired or due for transfer to the reserve and are being held in Army service only by virtue of the existence of the emergency, has brought about the position&mdash; inevitable in the circumstances&mdash;that the regular Army will be smaller at the end of the emergency, when demobilisation of reservists and durationists will have to be effected, <Col N="1244" /> than it was when the emergency commenced.</P>
    <P>In considering the question of building up the post-emergency regular Army, it is obvious that, amongst the thousands of young men who enlisted in the Defence Forces during the emergency, there must be many who have acquired a taste for Army life and who, if suitable from the points of view of age, fitness and so on, would be the most natural choice.  The Government have given this matter considerable thought and, as a result, I hope to be able to announce, in the near future, the conditions which will be offered to suitable men who are prepared to offer their services and are selected.  For a man proposing to take up the Army as a career, a very important consideration would be that the service which he had already given during the emergency would not be wasted for pension purposes.  This, accordingly, will be one of the attractions which will be offered.  The procedure will be, as I have already mentioned, to re-enlist the man on a regular engagement&mdash;from the date on which his emergency service commenced, if he is a durationist, or, if he is a reservist on permanent service, from the date on which he last reported for permanent service.  This will have the effect of making his emergency service portion of his regular engagement and of bringing it within the provisions of the Defence Forces (Pensions) Scheme.</P>
    <P>I may forestall questions by adding that it is also proposed to give suitable temporary and reserve officers an opportunity of taking commissions in the post-emergency regular Army, as vacancies will also exist in the officer corps owing to retirements, etc. In their cases, however, legislative measures are not necessary apart from the amendment of the Defence Forces (Pensions) Scheme to bring their emergency service within the provisions of the scheme.  Recruitment to the post-emergency reserve will also be necessary.  As I have said, I hope to announce full particulars of the various schemes very soon.</P>
    <P>As regards Section 5, I should <Col N="1245" /> explain that the great majority of recruits are enlisted for general service, that is, they offer themselves unconditionally for service in any corps, although they may have a preference for a particular corps and such preferences may be taken into consideration if circumstances permit. The main point is, however, that they have no rights as regards the corps to which they may be posted on completion of their recruit training.  Up to the present, however, they have had a general entitlement, when once assigned to a corps, to remain in that corps, unless during a period of emergency, when they were liable to be transferred to any other corps. They may, of course, also be transferred at their own request or with their own consent or, in certain cases, as a disciplinary measure.</P>
    <P>While a provision of this nature may have its merits in relation to larger armies than ours, it is unsuitable and, in fact, rather unnecessary in the case of our Army, where the conditions of service in the majority of the corps are almost similar and a transfer from one to another would not, as a rule, involve any particular hardship.  It is likely to give rise to practical difficulties when demobilisation commences and Army establishments have to be revised.  Changes in organisation will then occur which may make it necessary for the military authorities to be able to remove men from the corps in which their services are no longer required or to transfer men to units to fill up gaps caused by the demobilisation of emergency personnel.</P>
    <P>Section 5, accordingly, has been drafted so as to enable a man enlisted for general service to be transferred from one corps to another, unless he has had ten years' or more service in a particular corps, in which event he will not be transferred unless with his own consent or when a proclamation ordering the Reserve out on permanent service is in force.  Briefly, therefore, the new position introduced is that a man with less than ten years' service in a corps may be transferred from that corps.</P>
    <P>Deputies will notice that it is being provided that men specially enlisted <Col N="1246" /> for service in a particular corps will not be transferred therefrom except with their own consent.  This is in accordance with the existing position.</P>
    <P>I need not detain the House long with explanations of Sections 6 and 7. The existing <i>Defence Force Gazette</i> is published in the Department of Defence, but not by the Stationery Office.  In the case of court proceedings, therefore, it is not evidence of the status, ranks and appointments of officers, within the provisions of Section 55 of the No. 2 Act of 1940.  Section 6 rectifies this matter.  Section 7 proposes to remove the present requirement that directions by the Minister for Defence for the reversion of officers from acting higher ranks to their substantive ranks shall be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  It is intended that, in future, matters of this nature will be published in General Routine Orders for the information of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say why that change has been made, under Section 7?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There are a number of reasons, but the main one is that it will save a large amount of office administration.  I just cannot think what the other ones are at the moment, but there are one or two simple matters which do not involve anything in the nature of hardship, or anything like that.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that the Minister is not in a position to give a little more information than he has been able to give the House as to what is intended, particularly in regard to those people likely to be demobilised soon from the Army.  The Bill provides that a number of them who would normally be due for demobilisation at the end of the emergency can go into the Army and carry their service with them.  Everybody will agree with that.  But when you look at the type of economic situation that the men who went into the Army for the emergency are likely to face, it would be more fair to them that they would know under what conditions it is proposed to demobilise them in the immediate future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1247" /> At the present moment there are large numbers of men in the Army who are anxious to get out, and they feel that if they have to look for employment now, or accept employment now, they may be deprived of certain grants or gratuities that they expect the State will give them in recognition of the fact that they have spent three, four or five years in the emergency service.  At a time when the British Army are able to publish the general lines of their demobilisation scheme, it is extraordinary that we, so far removed from the actual scene of conflict, and with so many men anxious to get back to civilian employment, would not know where we stand.</P>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister when he expects to be able to make a statement so that the House, the emergency officers and the men in the Army will know where they stand with regard to the Government's provision for their future, either in the matter of grants or gratuities or facilities for prosecuting the educational courses that many of them interrupted when joining the emergency services or special facilities for getting into employment.  The Minister indicated that he will soon publish the terms of employment in the regular army of men who will transfer from the emergency services to the regular Army.  I take it these terms will include a statement of what the pension scheme in respect of such men will be.</P>
    <P>Moving as we are towards demobilisation point, I would like to point out that there are large numbers of men in the Army who have given a full period of service.  They entered the National Forces in 1922, 1923 or 1924, and a number of these men, for one reason or another, when they leave the forces, will find themselves in a shocking position from the point of view of maintaining their wives and families in the light of the present pension scheme.  I do not know when the present pension scheme was drafted, but the position with regard to the cost of living has moved forward very seriously since then, and I think it would be an advantage if the Minister were to review the pension scheme <Col N="1248" /> from the point of view of men who will now transfer from the emergency services into the Army and join the Army under new conditions.  I think it will inevitably be that the House will wish to apply the scheme now being drafted to men who have given full service in the Army from the time it started.  I would like some information on that matter from the Minister.</P>
    <P>I should like to know when the men who joined the Army during the emergency can expect to know where they stand and when they can expect to be released.  The matter is particularly important, in the first place, from the point of view of the cost of the Army and, in the second place, because you have voluntary services there, particularly the L.D.F.  You have the L.D.F. standing there able to assist the Army if the Army were reduced in numbers and if they were wanted. The members of the L.D.F. will naturally tend to fall away, as they have been falling away.  I think an appeal to the L.D.F. to stand-to and to maintain their organisation and their devotion to duty for a period until the Army could be demobilised, at least to a fair extent, would be most desirable and such an appeal should be made at the present time. It would be more effective if made in the light of definite demobilisation plans.  I suggest that before the L.D.F., or any great number of them, feel that they have done their duty, some kind of an outline of demobilisation plans should be issued and the L.D.F. should be asked to stand-to until the end and until it can be completely shown that the L.D.F. have, in fact, done their duty.  The men who joined the Army for the emergency, a lot of them, sacrificed a considerable amount, years of opportunity, when they joined and they are the people who ought to be considered.  I think the L.D.F. as a whole would be perfectly satisfied to stand-to if it was brought home to them how much is due to the men who joined the Army for the emergency and who are now anxious to get away.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill appears to contemplate a situation in which a <Col N="1249" /> person who attested for the emergency may be continued in the Army, if he so desires, after the emergency, and his emergency service will be reckoned for pension purposes.  Another section of the Bill appears to contemplate a situation in which a person who previously served in the Army and was called up for service in the reserve, may also continue in the Army, having his emergency service reckoned for the purpose of a pension.  I am not clear whether the Bill provides for continuing in the Army persons who joined the Army for a certain period before the emergency, whose time expired during the emergency.  Will such persons have an opportunity of continuing in the Army, and will their pre-emergency and emergency services be reckoned for pension purposes on their retirement under the Defence Forces Pensions Scheme?  It is not clear to me that persons of that kind are covered.</P>
      <P>There is another matter, and that is the Government's intentions regarding the demobilisation of what might be described as the temporary Army, the Army constituted of persons who joined various ranks between the outbreak of the emergency and its termination.  Certain sections of the Bill and the Minister's speech clearly indicate that the Government's Army policy is moving in a particular direction. The Minister's speech makes reference to demobilisation plans.  I think we may frankly face it&mdash;we are not far away from demobilisation, or, at all events, the Government is not far away from implementing an Army demobilisation policy.  If there is to be Army demobilisation, the longest possible notice of it should be given to those serving in the Army, so that they will be told at the earliest possible moment what is contemplated, so that they will have an opportunity of thinking over the situation in which they will find themselves when demobilised and of making some plans for rehabilitating themselves in private employment when the demobilisation scheme is made operative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far, the Government has not given any indication of what its policy <Col N="1250" /> in that respect is, and what I fear will happen is that an intimation will be given that it has been decided to demobilise a certain section of the Army&mdash;probably a substantial proportion&mdash;and that that policy will be implemented with a haste which will cause serious hardship to many of those suddenly demobilised.  I do not think that ought to happen and I do not think it ought to be allowed to happen.  Those who joined the Army for the emergency made a very considerable sacrifice.  They worked at Army rates of pay, which are not the most ideal in the world, and a person would be a long time getting rich on Army rates of pay here.  I have seen soldiers' families, their wives and children, and it is just a very tough existence on the present Army rates of pay.  There is no bank account at the end of it, and there is very little for luxury spending on the rates we pay to soldiers and the allowances we make to their wives and dependents.</P>
    <P>These folk have served the nation well during the past five years.  They might, like others, have gone to Britain and got good employment at good rates of wages, but they preferred to join the Army here and to put up with all the grilling that inevitably goes with army life here and elsewhere.  If they are now to be demobilised, they ought to get the longest possible notice of the intended demobilisation, but, more important, this House ought to know, and the Army personnel to be demobilised ought to know, how the Government will treat them when they are being demobilised.</P>
    <P>It is scarcely contemplated that these people should be sent to the employment exchange or the home assistance officers, that they should be told that they have stamps to their credit and can draw benefit at the employment exchange.  That would be a callous indifference to their needs and the sheerest ingratitude for the magnificent service they have rendered over the past five years.  If we do not contemplate sending them to the labour exchange, we contemplate doing something else, and the Minister ought to tell us what that something <Col N="1251" /> else is.  Is it proposed to pay them special allowances until such time as they can get into private employment? How long is it proposed to pay them the allowances and what scale of allowances will be available for them? These men are entitled to expect that a grateful nation, having escaped the ravages of war, will express its appreciation of their willingness to sacrifice themselves by treating those discharged from the Army fairly.</P>
    <P>If the Minister in his reply cannot give us detailed information as to the manner in which it is proposed to treat those demobilised from the Army, he at least ought to give us some rough sketch of what he has in mind and of whatever proposals the Government have under consideration.  I know from close constituency contact with Army personnel the concern which many of them express with regard to the provision for their future welfare on demobilisation, and the Minister would be rendering a very valuable service to the nation and to the Army if, at this stage, or, if that is not possible, at the earliest opportunity, he indicated what the Government's proposals are.  One thing, in any case, the Minister ought to say at this stage, that is, that the Government will treat those demobilised generously and that they will not be cast adrift to fend in any way they can after having served the nation during the very trying period of the past five years.</P>

    <P>In welcoming this Bill, I would say that it gives, in great measure, satisfaction to those who joined the Army during the emergency, for the reason that I think there is no danger of what Deputy Norton anticipates happening so suddenly because the Estimate <Col N="1252" /> for the coming year is being reduced by only one-twentieth, or 5 per cent.  That is an indication of the policy of the Government for the coming 12 months and there will be ample time then to prepare for the future. I join with Deputy Norton in asking the Minister to see that adequate provision is made within the resources of the country and to the extent to which the services given by these men may be considered deserving of recognition in any pension scheme that may be devised for them, but more especially do I ask the Minister to give special consideration to the young men of 1920 and 1921 who joined the Army for the emergency during these formative years.  They joined, perhaps not thinking that the emergency would last so long, but still they were prepared to serve their country and give whatever active service might be demanded from them.  As the Minister said in his opening speech, it may be that during those formative years they have developed a taste for Army life. Without prejudice to those who may have a prior claim, perhaps the Minister would give special consideration to those young men who desire to continue to serve their country in their present capacity.  We all know that entrance to the Army is now, more or less, on a Civil Service basis.  Therefore, I think that in the circumstances those men should get special consideration. In general, I think the Bill will be welcomed by those who joined the Army and have been serving their country during the emergency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to ask the Minister to give the House a definite indication as to what it is intended to do with those who have been serving in the Army during the emergency, how it is intended to treat them, and to secure employment for them in industry.  I feel that a grave injustice would be done to the young men who freely joined the National Army during a time of grave danger if they were now to be thrown on the employment exchange.  An injustice would be done to them even if a fairly generous allowance were made to them in respect of their period of <Col N="1253" /> unemployment.  Many of those young men joined the Army at a comparatively early age, at a time when they had received very little training in ordinary civilian employment.  If they were now to be turned out on the labour market, after spending four or five years in the Army, they would be forced to complete with men who have acquired considerable training in perhaps many types of civilian employment. Before there is any general demobilisation I feel that the first step to be taken by the Minister and the Army authorities should be to provide, as far as possible; some form of technical training for those men at the particular type of work in which it may be possible for them to find employment.  The Minister should discuss with the Ministers in charge of other Departments schemes for absorbing those men in employment.</P>
      <P>I am speaking now of the ordinary rank and file of the Army.  It may be possible, as a result of big development schemes in regard to road making, general construction work and building, to find an expansion of employment coinciding with the demobilisation of those men, and to fit them into such employment.  I think that if the best results are to be obtained in the development of those schemes, and in giving greater satisfaction to those men, it is desirable that they should get a period of training even before they leave the Army. Men in the Army are subject to a certain amount of organisation and discipline, and the suggestion I make is that it might be more easy to organise technical training for them while they are in the Army than take the chance that they will be able to get such training outside themselves. I do not know if it would be possible to implement that proposal, but I think it should receive consideration. Men ought not to be demobilised until work is available for them, and they ought not to be put to the work which is available for them until they have been given some training to enable them to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand there are strong rumours in circulation to the effect that it is the intention of the Minister <Col N="1254" /> and the Government to introduce a system of universal military training after the emergency.  That has been suggested as one means by which a section of Army personnel will obtain permanent employment as instructors. I do not know what foundation there is for the rumour, but it is being freely circulated.  I think that, apart from the rank and file of the Army, a very serious problem arises in regard to the commissioned ranks.  For the most part, they are men of education who for the past five or six years have been in what may prove to be a blind alley occupation inasmuch as they possibly entered the Army immediately after leaving school or college and are now no better equipped for civilian employment than they were when they left school or college.  It would be a very serious thing if they were to be left with a meagre and inadequate means of living.  Many of them got married during their period of Army service, and have entered into heavy commitments, so that if their remuneration in civilian employment is not somewhat similar to what they had in the Army, they will be faced with the very much lowered standard of living.  From every point of view, I think that that would be undesirable. It might create a considerable amount of unrest and dissatisfaction which no one would like to look forward to.  I think that this problem of securing decent employment for the demobilised personnel of the Army, both commissioned and non-commissioned, is a problem which deserves not only very careful consideration by the Minister, but exhaustive co-operation and collaboration between the Minister and the Ministers of other Departments with a view to finding a solution for it.  I think that those men certainly have a prior claim on the nation. Everything possible should be done to ensure that there will be no prolonged period of unemployment for them after they have been demobilised.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand the necessity for preserving all this secrecy in dealing with the Army and with demobilisation generally.  It would appear that the Minister and <Col N="1255" /> the Government are trying to insist, both in this House and outside so far as the public generally are concerned, that we are still in danger, and that the emergency, so far as the defence of the country is concerned, is still with us.  The position appears to be that the Government cannot risk giving the House any detailed information so far as numbers and other matters are concerned.  I am sure it is appreciated by everyone that the danger, so far as this country is concerned, has completely disappeared. Hence, we should be free to discuss a matter like this fully and frankly.  If the British Government feel that they are justified in making public their policy of demobilisation, it would appear to me that we, in our circumstances, should be in a position to do the same.  This is a very important matter for thousands of men who are in the Army.</P>

      <P>I know that there are a great many men in the Army who feel that they ought to be given some information now as to what the intentions of the Government are, what its plans are for dealing with the Army and its demobilisation.  I support the representations that have been made by other Deputies in that respect.  It is very unfair to keep men in the dark and the sooner plans are formulated and announced the better it will be for all concerned.  We should face up to the reality that we cannot continue to spend on the Army a sum which constitutes a very heavy and substantial burden for this country&mdash; £8,000,000.  I do not want to belittle the services that have been given by those who offered their services to the nation in an emergency.  I appreciate <Col N="1256" /> what that meant to these young men at the time, and I am sure every Deputy appreciates the services that have been given.  Those services should not be forgotten and, whatever is to be done about demobilisation and for settling them back into civilian life, ought to be done in a generous measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the fact that there are certain individuals in the Army who can go back to their civil positions.  They are in a comparatively secure position, but there are thousands of young men who joined the Defence Forces at a very formative period of their lives, when they were just leaving school.  They have spent four or five years in the Army and have no particular training for civilian life.  It is essential that careful consideration should be given to their future and to the manner of dealing with them.  The Minister indicated that this is the normal measure that comes before the House annually to deal with the Defence Forces and that, in addition, there is special provision for allowing volunteers who have been in the emergency services to join the regular services.  The Minister, of course, felt that even at this time he could not give any information to the House regarding the numbers engaged in the various services.  The farthest he would go was to state that there was a preponderance of men in the emergency services and that in fact the regular Army at the end of the emergency is going to be smaller than it was at the beginning of the emergency. The Minister gave no indication as to what ideas the Government have in regard to the regular Army in the post-war period, as to the size of the Army the Government intend to maintain in the post-war period, as to whether or not any census was taken of the emergency services in order to determine how many men are desirous of joining the permanent Army and, if any number of men are given an opportunity of joining the regular Army, what the strength of the regular Army is likely to be in the post-war period.  I think these are very important considerations for this House and that we are entitled to get <Col N="1257" /> some information with regard to them.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult for a Deputy to make up his mind about this matter in view of the very meagre information we have been given.  I cannot understand why it is necessary, at this stage, to be so secretive about it.  The problem is not by any means an easy one and I do not want to minimise it in any way.  I have no doubt that the wisest course in the matter of demobilisation will be followed, that is, to ensure that no man will be discharged from the Army until it is certain that he is going straight into a job, so that thousands of young men will not be thrown on the labour market without hope of fitting them into civilian life. Possibly, the purpose behind the section is to ensure that they will remain in the Army until an opportunity is provided of fitting them into civilian life.  I should like the Minister to be clearer and, if possible, to give us further information about the percentages that are likely to be absorbed into the regular Army and as to the anticipated cost of the regular Army in post-war years.</P>
    <P>I again press for full and frank information in regard to the numbers who want to come out of the Army.  I believe there is a big number of men who are anxious to come out now. What are the demobilisation plans so far as they are concerned?  I would suggest that, when any individual applies for indefinite leave or discharge from the Army, it should be granted immediately.  Every individual who leaves and for whom there is a job waiting will represent a reduction of the final problem of demobilisation. I think every Deputy has experienced difficulty at times in getting men out of the Army, especially for agricultural work.  Sometimes in the case of skilled agricultural workers serving in the Army representations have to be made for their discharge or to secure indefinite leave for them.  That is absurd at the present time.  Every individual in the Army who is anxious to leave, and who can show clearly that there is a job waiting for him and that he is a skilled man as far as that job is concerned, should have no difficulty about getting indefinite leave or discharge.  I suggest it should be <Col N="1258" /> discharge, because the country cannot continue for many more years to meet this burden of taxation.  The Minister has not given us any information about what the Government propose to do about the L.D.F.  I suppose he does not intend to give the House any further information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably the Minister will strongly object to the suggestion made by members of other Parties in the House that this Bill is disappointing, but I cannot see that the Minister is entitled to sustain his objection to that point of view when I recall that over a considerable period there has been almost persistent pressure from members of the House for information from the Minister on matters which would probably be dealt with in the present Bill.  While the Dáil and citizens generally are anxious to obtain the information that has been sought of the Minister to-night, I submit that there is a body of citizens who are even more anxious and more particularly concerned to know what is in the mind of the Government and the responsible Minister, namely, the actual serving soldiers in the Army in the various services.  It is quite true that during the four or five years' period of service which these men have given, many of them have acquired, as the Minister has said, a taste for military life, but I think it would be very interesting to calculate exactly what percentage they represent of the total number of men in the Defence Forces.  I have had very wide contact with them on many occasions, and, with somewhat rare exceptions, the average soldier seems to be most deeply concerned about being allowed to return to what he considers to be normal civilian life at the first possible opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only the other day a soldier who was speaking to me on this general matter referred to the present arrangement for granting indefinite leave.  I tried to explain that it was difficult to allow any large scale discharge from the Army until such time as there was some undertaking or some possibility of providing employment for a large number of men.  He expressed the view that a great number of men in the Army <Col N="1259" /> to-day were not concerned at all with what plans were being made to provide them with employment on their discharge, but were anxious merely to get out of the service.  They were prepared to take their chance on the labour market and trust either to their good luck or to their special abilities, technical training, etc., to be able to secure employment.  Then there is the other factor, that quite a number of them feel that, if they were completely free and in the same position as civilians and not subject to the restrictions attached to indefinite leave, they would have opportunities of seeking work across the water, as many other workers are still doing.  This whole atmosphere of anxiety is one that I think the Government are under some obligation to try to allay.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the fact that we are a neutral country, and yet we have not made any appreciable approach to formulating plans for the discharge of this large body of men or forming any conception as to what we think should be the place into which they will fit on return to civilian life. Yet other nations, who are engaged even yet in vital life-and-death struggles, with millions of men enrolled in the armed services, and with the problems and anxieties of the actual waging of war, can tell us in very considerable detail of the general terms of demobilisation, of the gratuities they propose to provide for the men and women leaving the armed forces, and even the general lines upon which they expect to be able to absorb them back into the various forms of civilian employment. We are out of physical range of the conflict.  Even though we may hold different views as to whether the danger has completely passed or not, we are still only engaged on a very small scale problem from the point of view of the conduct of a military force as compared with a nation engaged in actual warfare.  Yet we are unable to find the time to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>One could understand the Minister coming here and stating: &ldquo;While we are in a position to give you a very general view of what we think should be the lines along which demobilisation <Col N="1260" /> should take place and the proposals we should make to meet these men's special claims on the nation, we are under the difficulty of not being able to go into exact detail.  You will have to bear with us and make allowance for that.&rdquo;  But, when we get no information whatever, when we are left in the position, as Deputy McCarthy says, of having the same Estimate continued for a further year with a small reduction, and therefore, apparently, a conclusion to be drawn, as he has drawn it, that we are to continue for the next 12 months as we have in the past 12 months, I think we are entitled and, above all, that the serving soldier is fully entitled to express disappointment.</P>
    <P>If we are to continue on the basis of the figures set down in this year's Estimate and hostilities do end within a period of months&mdash;and to speak of hostilities ending within a period of months is not using one's imagination, because I believe it is definitely considered by men who have a very close knowledge of the matter that hostilities are within a reasonable reach of termination&mdash;suppose they terminate on 1st of June, 1st of July, or 1st August, after they are terminated we are still left with the same military forces and the same financial commitments we had when hostilities were actually proceeding.  We will be told by the Minister and by other military experts who speak for the Government in this House that, merely because hostilities have ceased, therefore automatically all danger has not passed for this country.  But, if that is so, then we are entitled to have something more to go upon than merely the bald statements frequently made in this House by spokesmen for the Government in that regard.  We are entitled to be able to measure to what extent the same degree of preparedness, the same degree of military organisation and the same degree of financial expenditure are required after the cessation of hostilities as, apparently, are required to-day.  That is also something as to which we can still only hazard an opinion.  We have nothing definite to go upon.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1261" /> If, on the other hand, there is a feeling in the mind of the Government that, with an early cessation of hostilities, the whole atmosphere and the whole requirements in regard to defence in this country will change and, therefore, certain other proposals will be required to utilise this large amount of man power which will still be in the Army in the form of peaceful pursuits, even though these men may be still under military control, we are entitled to know that.  These are not far-fetched propositions; they are not questions of long-scale plans, they are immediately on our door-step.  I think the Minister should realise that if, within two or three months, hostilities should cease, then we will have to answer to the men in the Army as to why they are still retained.  While these men joined the Army and were prepared to give service in defence of their country and what they regarded as our danger, a great many of them will not be satisfied to continue forms of activity and of life which to many of them are normally not very pleasant and which they only accepted under a feeling of stern duty to their country. Once they feel that the particular danger has passed, they will claim their ordinary right as citizens to be released and to be allowed to return to civilian spheres of life.</P>
    <P>This question of demobilisation is not an academic question.  So far as this House is concerned, it may be a somewhat general political question, something on which those who speak for sections of citizens feel they are entitled to express a point of view. Certainly, for the soldiers in the various branches of the Defence Forces it is a burning and immediate practical question on which they are fully entitled to press, either directly or through those who speak in this House, for something more definite than they have been given in this Bill.</P>
    <P>So far as the Bill is concerned, in the first place, it is the ordinary automatic Bill we must receive every year, with some very slight additions to arrange for some internal changes inside the Defence Forces.  Not one single line of it has any particular reference to the problem of the men who <Col N="1262" /> have to come out of the Defence Forces.  The soldiers, in particular, are interested in very definite questions, some of which have been referred to. If they cannot be told when they may expect to be demobilised, at least they are entitled to know generally the lines along which that demobilisation may take place.  I referred to the fact that even in belligerent countries definite plans and priorities have been laid down with regard to demobilisation. It is all very well to tell us that we need not bother about what other countries are doing.  But, when we are not doing anything at all, when we are not even thinking about plans, at least we should pay tribute to those who are in a far different position and who can give thought to the problem and work out plans.  The soldiers are asking what gratuity on demobilisation the Government hope to be able to provide.  That, again, has been worked out definitely elsewhere.  We may be in very different financial circumstances, but at least we should know what is running through the mind of the Government and what these men may expect to have as a means of assisting them over this particular break when they change from one activity to another.  Here again, we are not only dealing with the problem of tens of thousands of men coming out from the armed forces.  What is to be the order of priority, for such employment as may be available, as between those coming out of the Defence Forces, those who are already employed here still&mdash;and that is quite a number&mdash;and those who will be returning from across the water?</P>
    <P>Are we going to throw our soldiers out on the labour market and let them fight it out with others who have not given the service that they have given? Should no consideration be given in regard to the securing not of employment on the scale of relief works and what that implies, but of employment which will allow many of them to take their place in civilian life and establish families and homes on a little higher basis than we allow them as serving members of the forces?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1263" /> Deputy Coogan, in the course of his remarks, referred to the technical training of members of the Defence Forces in preparation for their release to civilian life.  That is a problem which we need to be very careful in dealing with.  The Minister is already embarking on little experiments of that kind, and I think he realises the reaction it is having in many quarters. Suppose we have trained a large number of men in the Army, either as various forms of tradesmen, bricklayers, carpenters, electricians, or printers, and release them on the labour market, what is going to be the effect not so much&mdash;let us take it from the selfish viewpoint&mdash;from the point of view of the men in civilian employment already, but from the point of view of men in the Army who have been given that course of a craft training and then released on the labour market without any proper protection? I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cogan gave the impression to the House that the only Deputies who are the watchdogs and custodians of agricultural interests are those in Clann na Talmhan.  I believe there are many Deputies who know at least as much about agriculture, and who are as concerned about its interests, on all sides of the House, however we may differ as to policy and method.  I would not be inclined to question the sincerity of their motives. I believe that we, the Deputies who are drawn from the agricultural classes and who are sent in here to represent agriculture, should have before us at all times the aim of trying individually to set a high standard, so far as we ourselves are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should try to emulate the best methods in agriculture and adopt the best technique to secure as far as it is humanly possible that we are getting results and applying our technical knowledge in the right direction.  In that way, we might be an example to <Col N="1264" /> the people in our immediate locality. If that idea were applied generally, we might come in here and talk more effectively and be listened to with greater care.  I do not want to go too far with it, but I would say that sometimes I have to listen to Deputies who very often do not know what they are talking about.</P>
    <P>We are asked to vote a sum of £16,000,000, which represents an instalment of a very big sum of £47,000,000 for the public services of this country. It is an unprecedented and staggering figure, so far as this country is concerned. But for the fact that prices have appreciated to their present level, and that there is a big amount of money in circulation, a sum of that magnitude could not be sustained for a moment.  Very severe restrictions are imposed on the people during the emergency, but no attempt has been made to curb expenditure.  On a few occasions in the past, the Minister has expressed the desirability of trying to set a limit to expenditure, and has expressed some concern about that, but the spiral still continues.  The sum is substantially bigger than the amount mentioned.  If we add the appropriations of over £2,000,000 and the Supplementary Estimates that probably will come in the usual way during the coming year, and local government expenditure, which is about £8,000,000, we have an aggregate figure, including the Central Fund, of over £60,000,000.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the national income here is, and we have no estimate of it at the present time.  We know that, for some years before the war, it was estimated at something like £150,000,000.  If we take it as being £180,000,000 or £190,000,000 at the present time, the taxation we are imposing is approximately one-third of the national income. That is a very severe burden. I know the Minister appreciates that those increases are throwing back considerable hardships, that they may intensify unemployment, and will undoubtedly increase the cost of production.</P>
    <P>They will destroy the incentive to development and efficiency and have a retarding effect on production.  I want <Col N="1265" /> to stress that aspect of it, which is a very essential consideration.  No matter how desirable all the services we have may be, we must consider the cost.  Many of those social services are very desirable, and I do not want to oppose the provision of such services which improve the general standard of our people, but I say we cannot run away socially without ensuring that our economic position affords it.  That is the real problem before us.</P>
    <P>A lot has been said and written about freedom from want and social security.  That is all very desirable, but it can only be effected by ensuring that the national income is sufficient to provide that security.  We must examine the position and satisfy ourselves that the country can afford the amount being asked at present.  Can the country be run efficiently on less? Above all, we must ensure that we get value for the money the people are called upon to pay.  The most alarming aspect of our present position is that the curve of expenditure has an upward trend all the time, while our production curve has a downward trend.  We cannot be complacent about that.  I do not believe that the Minister is complacent about it.  I know he will reply that every Party is asking for increased services, for more and more social services.  I do not say we should not have those social services.  They are essential and desirable, but side by side with the provision of them we must ensure that the national income can afford them.</P>
    <P>We can only have that income by more work and more production.  At this juncture, with the world struggle in all likelihood running towards its termination within the next few months, the mind of every Deputy in the House, and every thinking person in the country turns towards the future. What does the future hold?  Are we sufficiently prepared for the future? What can be done to ensure the best possible conditions for our people in the post-war period?  What plans can be laid down to ensure that proper development will take place, that whatever stagnation is there will be eliminated, and that we will be in a <Col N="1266" /> position to make the best possible use of our resources and opportunities?</P>
    <P>The contraction and derangement of trade were inevitable during this emergency.  Our trade has very seriously and alarmingly contracted; the contraction, not merely in agricultural production, but in agricultural exports, during this emergency, during the most favourable period for the primary producer, is extraordinary in our circumstances here.  The fact that our position has remained stagnant over that period will make it all the more difficult in the post-war period.  I submit that, taking all our circumstances into account, and with the appreciation in sterling assets that Deputy Mulcahy has referred to, the greatest problem we have to face concerns our purchasing power in the post-war period&mdash;how are we to secure the necessary imports?  If we had that solved, then I think our position would be a very happy one, indeed, compared to countries generally throughout the world.  If we were satisfied that we had the free use of our sterling assets, that we could purchase to an unlimited extent our essential requirements, our machinery replacements both for industry and agriculture and the raw material for both industries&mdash;if we felt certain we were in a position to secure these out of our credits, then our position would be a very happy one and planning for the post-war period would be a comparatively simple matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce referred to that a couple of months ago when he said that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...Disordered post-war international trade conditions will make it impracticable for us to use our external financial resources to acquire freely abroad the equipment and materials we will need and only ability to export produce that the other countries need and are prepared to accept in barter for their own goods will enable us to trade at all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that is the kernel of our whole problem, not merely trade with our next-door neighbour, Great Britain, <Col N="1267" /> but to find the foreign exchange in order to trade with other countries and get the goods that originate in these countries.  Take the year 1938, when our imports totalled £41,000,000 odd, and £20,000,000 of those imports originated in Great Britain and slightly more than 50 per cent. originated in countries other than Great Britain.  From America, all the American countries, our imports aggregated something over £8,000,000. From the United States the amount was over £4,000,000.  If we have any difficulty about the conversion of sterling into dollars and other currencies, we will be facing a very acute problem.  We all appreciate that if we do not get the essential raw material there is little use in talking about planning, and we will be up against a terrible position that will detrimentally affect industry and employment and our whole standard of living.</P>
    <P>In order to get a true picture of this problem, it might be well to understand our position in pre-war years. If we take the five years 1935 to 1939, we had an adverse trade balance on the average of £19,000,000.  The lowest in the five years was £17,000,000 odd, and the highest £21,000,000 odd.  Our exports paid for only 55 per cent of our imports and the balance of our imports, 45 per cent., was paid for out of our sterling credits.  We will appreciate that our position in the post-war period, if we had free use of those assets, would enable us to have a higher trade balance than in pre-war years.  Our exports have declined and our requirements will be greater than in pre-war years.  We will want more artificial manures to correct any damage done to the fertility of the soil.  That has to be repaired as early as possible.  Worn out industrial and agricultural machinery must be replaced. All the transport we have&mdash; lorries, buses; cars, and even for railway reorganisation it may be essential to import locomotives&mdash;will have to be either replaced or reconditioned and all that will require a substantially higher capital expenditure than in pre-war years.</P>
    <P>If we are to secure these essential <Col N="1268" /> requirements we must plan for a greater post-war expenditure.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has raised this difficulty about purchasing goods in the post-war period.  What sort of limitation will be put on the use of those credits?  It is difficult for me to say, and I do not know whether the Minister has information on the matter; neither do I think we should say publicly and definitely that they will be frozen.  But we should be alive to the danger there.  If there is a limitation put to their use we must make the difference good in exports.  I suggest that it is vital to our whole future that we must expand production and step-up our exports.  Exports are a vital national asset, not merely in providing our requirements in imported goods, but in providing employment in the production of those exports as well. In order to do all that we must have a survey of our production position, develop plans, have the necessary technical knowledge disseminated among our people, and also have not merely equipment in the form of machinery, but financial equipment as well.</P>
    <P>Some plans have already been produced. A housing plan has recently been published which contemplates an expenditure of £100,000,000.  It is really only a plan to show that there is an immediate need for the expenditure of £100,000,000 by private individuals, by local authorities and by the Government in a limited way.  There is no financial provision in the plan and no indication as to what amounts will be provided by the State or what direct responsibility for the implementation of the plan will rest on the Government. There is definitely no mention in the plan of agriculture, no mention of what is to be done in the way of providing not merely dwelling houses for the agricultural community, and many of them are in a rather poor condition, as the Minister knows, but, possibly worse still, essential out-offices. In our climate, these are vital to the live-stock industry, and possibly in another programme provision may be made for them, but it is something which must not be overlooked.</P>
    <P>There is a committee sitting at present, a committee planning for post-war <Col N="1269" /> agriculture, and I feel that it is hampered in its investigations because it has not got the necessary information in regard to trade.  A complete plan means not merely a plan in regard to production but a plan in regard to sale, and sale at an economic price and to the best advantage.  No attempt has been made to plumb external markets, to ascertain British requirements, and, as a matter of fact, I charge the Government with absolute failure to discover what are our opportunities in the post-war British markets, what type of goods they expect us to produce, what shape our trading in the post-war period will take, what processing will be necessary here and what opportunities will exist here for processing goods in the post-war period.  Surely no committee can plan wisely or well if it has not got that vital information.</P>
    <P>Planning in a back room in Merrion Street, without the necessary contacts as between our Government and the British Government on trade matters having been made beforehand, is worthless, and, so far as the House knows, no direct contact has been made.  The Minister may say that contacts have been made through Civil Service channels, but I do not think that is the best way to secure favourable trade deals.  We should be alive to our interests in that respect. The Minister, in his capacity as Minister for Finance, must appreciate, more now than ever before, how vital to our whole future welfare is the development of a good export trade in the post-war period.  The opportunity is still there.  According to the programme announced in the last few days, the British Government are switching over to live-stock production, to the production of the protected foods, and, in view of our circumstances, our climatic conditions, our proximity to that market, our opportunities and our knowledge in relation to the production of these goods, we should not allow a development to take place in Great Britain which ignores this country as an important source of supply.</P>
    <P>Mr. Hudson, the British Minister of Agriculture, is all out for improving <Col N="1270" /> and perfecting the live-stock industry, and for providing a better standard of live stock all round.  That is already reflected in the statistics published this year, which show that calves and heifers in milk increased by 90,000, cows in calf and not in milk by 171,000, heifers in calf by 210,000, and cattle under one year old by 113,000, while the numbers of other cattle remain approximately the same, because this programme has started only in the last couple of years, the result being younger stock, but there will be a progressive improvement all round as the years go on.</P>
    <P>We might possibly consider that every calf reared, every animal produced in Great Britain might eventually eliminate an Irish beast from shipment, but I do not think we need go so far as that, because Britain is definitely planning a more intensified agricultural industry.  Britain realises that her world resources have undergone a profound change, that her external assets are completely liquidated, that she will be thrown back much more on her own resources, that her ability to sell manufactured goods in practically every country in the world in exchange for cheap food has gone, and that the day when she was the workshop of the world is past history; and she is alive not merely to the desirability but the necessity of ensuring that her agricultural industry will be preserved in its present vigorous state.</P>
    <P>Our live-stock industry in the past has been to a large extent interlocked with the British live-stock industry, and that interlocking has worked very well.  Let us hope that it will continue, but I want to say that if Mr. Hudson is planning a live-stock industry for Great Britain which ignores this country as a source of supply, we may be very sorry for not intervening to ensure that our live-stock supplies, our animals exported on foot, will be part and parcel of their economy.</P>
    <P>Figures were published recently about which we might be a little alarmed in that connection.  For the first time since immediately before the war our trade figures were published, showing that in 1939 we exported 783,872, and in 1944 445,407 live cattle. <Col N="1271" /> It is true that our dead meat trade increased in those years, and that only 39,000 cattle were slaughtered for the dead meat trade in 1939, while 129,000 were slaughtered in 1944; but the aggregate figure of live animals and dead meat in 1939 was 822,945 as against 674,788 in 1944, a reduction of something like 140,000 in the number of animals exported in that year as against 1939.</P>
    <P>Statistics show that our cattle population has been maintained fairly well round the 4,000,000 figure, but nevertheless the trade figures show a reduction in exports, taking the dead meat trade into account, of 140,000 cattle.  I think that figure can be corrected to some extent because of the smuggling across the Border, but you could not put the number down at more than 40,000 or 50,000.  That leaves a figure of approximately 100,000.  That is a very big figure.  It is a very serious matter for the live-stock industry of the country.  It is important, not only from the point of view of exchange but from the point of view of production as well, because God ordained that animal life and plant life should be combined.  One is complementary to the other.  You cannot produce plant life without maintaining the necessary live stock to keep up fertility.</P>
    <P>I am merely stressing for the Minister the importance of a trade deal at the present time.  The Government ought to face up to their responsibilities in that respect.  I know they have a very able trade representative in London, and that he is fully alive to our interests.  I do not want to reflect on the work that he has done, but I do say that a trade deal is essentially a Minister's job.  I call the Minister's attention to this, that they are proceeding with their plans in Great Britain. Their plans have already borne fruit as reflected in the statistics. Above all, I want to impress on the Minister that all over Britain to-day there is an appreciation of the Irish store.  Some months ago I was talking to an Irishman, a medical officer of health, who is living on the east coast of England where, in addition to his <Col N="1272" /> professional practice he is farming in a large way.  He told me that even in that part of England the farmers appreciate the value of Irish store cattle. I am not pessimistic about the future of our trade, provided the Government accepts responsibility and ensures that, in whatever plans are being evolved for British agriculture our interests and our supplies will not be lost sight of.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Planning Committee that has been sitting here has already published an interim report dealing with poultry and dairying.  I do not want to be critical about the work of that committee.  It may be that what I am going to refer to will be dealt with by the committee in a later report.  But it does seem extraordinary that our dairying industry, cow population and breeding stock generally appear to have been lost sight of by the committee.  In my opinion, the most valuable part of the trade is the export trade in dairy stock&mdash;in maiden heifers suitable for dairy purposes. The public health authorities in Britain seem to be alive to the necessity for stepping up milk production. They have been gradually doing that even during the war.  There has been a substantial increase in milk production in Britain.  In pre-war years, the average consumption of milk there was in or about half a pint per individual daily.  That was considered to be well below the safety mark, so that the effort now is to double consumption&mdash; to get it up to a pint per day per individual. In the effort to do that they must double the number of their dairy stock.  This is the only country in the world where they can get basic stock for that purpose.  Because of our peculiar conditions, of the qualities of our soil, we are the only country in the world than can grow good animals. We can produce animals at all times which are superior to theirs.  This is their only source of supply.  If the British Government were to plan that the British farmers should produce their own supplies of dairy stock, then it might very well happen that we would be left out of their plan altogether.  That would be a disastrous thing for this country.  As I <Col N="1273" /> have said, the value of our Irish heifers is now appreciated all over England.  We are able to produce finer animals than British farmers.</P>
    <P>We should plan not only to supply Britain but as well to help in the re-stocking of Europe.  If the Minister were to cast his eye over the map of the world and ask himself, what countries can afford to release basic stock for the re-stocking of Europe, he would appreciate that there are very few countries with a surplus of that type of stock.  We are one of the few countries in the world in that happy position.  There is this difference between that type of stock and ordinary beef cattle, that in the sale of beef we have to compete against the greatest beef-producing country in the world&mdash;the Argentine.  As regards the production of dairy stock, we have a monopoly of that trade, and, personally, I should prefer to go after the monopoly.  In my opinion the foundation should be laid now for the development of that type of trade.  We may plan as much as we like socially, but our whole future economic position rests upon the one net problem that we have to face in this country, namely, our capacity to import.</P>
    <P>If we can solve that, then I think a solution of all our economic problems will be comparatively simple and that we will be one of the happiest countries in the world.  If we are able to have the free use of our external assets to buy essential imports, then I think any body can produce the plan for the remainder of our problems.  The solution of that question, however, is going to be an immense problem if we have an exchange problem in the post-war period.  As regards the £300,000,000 that we have in sterling assets in Great Britain, if we cannot touch them for some years, then our problem is going to be an immense one.  I do not suggest that the British have any desire to dishonour their obligations in that respect.  I firmly believe that they will honour them at some date.  It may be that, because of their financial position, they cannot at the moment permit us free access to those assets, but if we can use a substantial portion of them <Col N="1274" /> in the post-war period to procure capital and essential goods to meet our requirements&mdash;and not bother too much about our exports&mdash;I am just wondering will our position be as happy or as lucky as that.  I do not think that we should take it for granted.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has issued a warning already and suggested that we may have to try other countries in which to market our manufactured goods.  He was very careful not to mention the names of the manufactures that we might sell outside the sterling group.  It is true that we may be able to work up a substantial trade in the sale of whiskey in America, and some stout, possibly.  It may be that we will be able to sell racehorses and stallions and develop a trade in the sale of pure-bred bulls and, possibly, a trade in greyhounds. In recent years our trade in greyhounds has substantially increased. Above all, we must be vigilant about our trade.  I think that one of the characteristics of our trade in the past has been that, so far as our primary industry is concerned, we have devoted all our attention to production, and then handed our goods over to somebody else to market them for us.  Our marketing of our goods has never been satisfactory.  We have never made any attempt to provide super-salesmen to look after our interests on the markets across the Channel.  We should have followed the example of the Scandinavian countries in the pre-war period. They had their representatives there to ensure that their goods were marketed to the best advantage.  They spent large sums entertaining big business with that object in view.  If there was a glut on the market they took care to see that their goods got a preference. Their men were on the spot to see to that.  We sent our goods across, and left it to luck to dispose of them when opportunity offered.</P>
    <P>We must learn now that we have to be on our toes about our interests. This war has produced a greater standard of efficiency, and will produce an even greater standard of efficiency, not merely in production, in new methods, new technique, greater application of science, but also in keener <Col N="1275" /> marketing, transport and everything else.  We must be alert if we are to hold our own against competition in the post-war period.  That is the kernel of our problem.</P>
    <P>There has been a conflict of interests in the past between industry and agriculture. Deputy Cogan suggested that there was not.  I say that definitely there has been conflict of interests in certain respects.  For example, there was a subsidy of £10 a ton on artificial manure, immediately, before the war. There were 1,000 men employed in the manure industry.  That subsidy was costing us £100,000, and represented a burden on the primary industry of this country to provide work for 1,000 men. There ought to be some guiding principle, a unifying principle, so far as agriculture and industry are concerned. Let the aim be security for all, or, I would suggest, in our circumstances, maximum production from the land.  If that is the guiding principle, all other considerations should be subordinated to it.  That should be applied to any problem that arises, and decisions should be governed by that principle.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan said that we were consuming 75 per cent. of our total production at the present time.  That is true, but does anyone question that our production could be expanded enormously, and that we could provide the very things that the world will be most in need of during the post-war period?  The Hot Springs conference called the attention of the world to the fact that more than 50 per cent. of the people of the world are undernourished. Many of them fill their bellies, but they do not get nutritious food, and they do not get a balanced diet.  There is an abundance of the calories and of carbohydrate foods in the world.  In fact some countries have tried to devise plans to destroy its surplus of carbohydrates in order to ensure an economic price.  But the world never had sufficient of the protective foods, the proteins and vitamins that come from animal production.  If there was any sincerity in the suggestion that was made at the Hot Springs conference that an attempt should be <Col N="1276" /> made to provide a proper standard of living for all the people of the world&mdash; some people may suggest that there was no sincerity in it; I think there was, although it may not be possible of achievement&mdash;it means a vast increase in the production of protective foods, and in our circumstances we are ideally equipped for the production of protective foods.  We ought not to let the opportunity slip now.  We ought to ensure that trade agreements are entered into.</P>
    <P>Clann na Talmhan Deputies have been stressing the necessity of guaranteed prices.  Guaranteed prices are most desirable and very useful and would be a definite incentive to production, but in our circumstances it would be a difficult matter, unless we enter into agreements and secure an understanding as to the requirements of the market and, having got that, plan production on costings to meet whatever demand there may be.  I think it is well that we should have a full and frank discussion of our economic problems in the post-war period. I hope the Minister will try to convince his colleagues of the necessity of facing the realities of the position and realising that we cannot live in isolation. Providence ordained that there should be trade and exchange of goods.  Many countries have succeeded already in making plans for post-war trade covering four, five, six and seven years. The Canadians have already entered into a trade agreement with Great Britain for the supply of bacon, We are keenly interested in the production of that commodity, and I would ask the Minister to tell the House frankly why the Government has not done something about it.  We must appreciate how essential our trade is and we must restore our export position at the earliest possible moment if we are to preserve decent standards in this country, if we are to hope, not for better conditions, but for the standard that obtained pre-war.  If we are to march forward, if we are to get the wheels of industry going, if we are to attempt to provide employment for our people and a decent standard of living and security for all, that must be done immediately.  I would ask the Minister <Col N="1277" /> to be frank with the House and to tell us what has been done and what the Government propose to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the various criticisms and I agree with Deputy Cogan that administration charges are too high.  If the burden must fall on agriculture, it must be reduced to what agriculture can bear. If we work on that basis, we know where we are.  I cannot agree with Deputy Cogan's suggestion about the system of credit to farmers.  He says that interest charges are too high at 4 to 5 per cent.  If agriculture cannot afford to pay 4 or 5 per cent. profit on its industry, then the man who is going to invest capital in agriculture is a mug, when he can get 6 per cent. by putting his money into the sugar company or any other industry that has been established in this country. We must consider agriculture from that point of view and agriculture cannot pay at present even 4 to 5 per cent. on capital invested.  That is what we have to face up to.</P>
      <P>My main interest in agriculture is that I do not want to revert to the pre-war position.  I say that frankly. I do not want to revert to the period when the agricultural labourer in this country was paid a slave wage and when the difference between the agricultural labourer and any person in any kind of job in industry was the difference between the collar and tie and the clogs.  After this war are we going to be able to maintain the present minimum wage for the agricultural labourer?  If we are, what are we going to produce and what is going to be the price of that produce to pay that wage?  It will not be done by Deputy Hughes's plan.  I do not want to get back to the export position that obtained pre-war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go back to the time when we had to subsidise our butter in the English market to the extent of £700,000 or £800,000 a year; when the price of butter in the English market only allowed us to pay 3d. per gallon for milk in the creameries.  We cannot afford to go back to that.  The guarantee I am looking for is that the market we have at present for agricultural <Col N="1278" /> produce will remain the market of the Irish farmer and that we shall not have any outside competition in that market.  The lesson this country should learn from this war is that we have to depend upon our own people and the production from our own land.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes cannot have it both ways.  Deputy Hughes, on the one hand, cannot have a protected home market for our farmers and, at the same time, the right to import into this country everything that the farmer requires.  I think he mentioned artificial manures, an industry in which 1,000 men are employed.  What is Deputy Hughes's policy in regard to that?  Suppose in 1937 we said that we were not going to protect that industry and that the plant and machinery for the manufacture of these manures should be got rid of altogether.  How could the raw materials for these manures which were brought into this country be put into a state in which the farmers could use them, if we had not the factories here?  Let us look at this matter in an honest fashion and from the point of view that industry and agriculture in this country will have to work side by side.  Whatever post-war planning we do, the main planning in regard to agriculture must be that we will retain the home market.  It is the only market in which we can be guaranteed a price.  Beyond that, you have to take whatever you get.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes spoke about dairying and said that we should go out to get a monopoly in dairy herds.  Deputy Hughes, and other Deputies like him, advocated year after year and month after month the maintenance of our store cattle trade with Britain, to which we sacrificed the dairy heifer. When I hear about rationed butter, I always have before my mind what the late Minister for Agriculture said in this House in 1933 after the present Minister had taken up office.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;One word of warning I want to give my successor in office is that, if the Livestock Breeding Act is operated in this country as it has been operated during the past six years, we may have very fine looking cattle, but it will be practically impossible <Col N="1279" /> to get a decent milking cow&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The milch cow in this country was sacrificed in the effort to provide beef for Britain, beef that, as Deputy Hughes told us, has to compete with Argentine beef.  It is an extraordinary position that, after spending millions on the improvement of live stock, one breed of cattle in this country earned universal opprobrium, so that any agricultural inspector looking at them would cock up his nose and walk out, namely, the Friesian cattle, and yet a three-year-old Friesian heifer in calf will make £15 more than any Shorthorn heifer in calf.  That is the difference in price on the English market between the Friesian heifer and the animal on which we spent millions in improving the breed.</P>

You cannot get anything out of an animal that you breed for beef one year and milk the next year&mdash;trying to please John Bull with beef one year and milk the next year.  That is what happened our dairy heards.  That is why, although we have more cows in this country than we had in 1932, we cannot provide sufficient butter for our people, and we have to ration them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only a month ago since I assisted in allotting money provided by the Minister for Finance for premiums.  None of that money went to Friesian breeders.  When Deputy Hughes, after spending many years preaching about the store cattle trade in Great Britain, admits now that that store cattle trade in future will have to be carried on in competition with Argentine beef, and says that we cannot hope to compete and that our only hope is to provide dairy heifers for Europe, it is a bit of a change.  I am <Col N="1280" /> glad to see that he is learning something. I am sure he did not learn that from books.  Our main market, whether for industry or agriculture, is the home market.  I think even the most stupid farmer has learned his lesson in regard to that.  Bad and all as was the supply of steel from Haulbowline, if we had not got it we would have been in a very bad way during the past four years, even though we had to pay through the nose for it.  The old horses would be bare-footed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The same thing applies to our market for agriculture.  I do not think that the agricultural labourer or the ordinary farmer is prepared to go back to the position in which he was before the war.  To be honest about it, I do not think he should be asked.  Men who start out on Monday morning and work until Monday morning again, as do farm labourers and farmers working on the farm, are worth at least £2 a week, which is the minimum agricultural wage to-day.  If we have to pay £2 a week, the Minister will have to revise some of his figures as regards some of our farm products.  If beet was worth 80/- a ton in 1942, when the agricultural labourer was paid 5/- a week less, and when there was a better percentage of sugar in the beet than there is at present, 80/- to-day is not a fair price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to the next proposition, namely, that we should have a costings board, something like a prices commission, before which the farmer could make his case, whether it be on the cost of production of milk or wheat or beet.  That would be far more satisfactory for everybody.  Such a body was there for the industrialist. We own the biggest industry in the country and we are surely entitled to some board before which we can <Col N="1281" /> argue on the costings of our production. The flour miller can argue on his costings, the steel man can argue on the price of steel or iron, the implement manufacturer can argue on his costings; and it should be just the same in regard to the farm.  I feel keenly that, if the agricultural community, even at present, is to be kept on the land, they will require at least the present conditions and not the conditions they had pre-war.  If any country should have learned a lesson about the absolute necessity of the agricultural community producing everything required in the line of food for the people, this country should have learned it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes still has his eye on the export market.  In any export market that can be found outside this country for agricultural produce, the price is what you can get, and no more, and in every case you have to enter into competition with a country which can afford to produce more cheaply than you can.  Different conditions lower the overhead charges.  As a matter of fact, our position in regard to overhead charges is a very worrying one.  At present, the position of the farmer is that his rates and annuities are higher than they were in 1933. When the 1933 Act came in, 50 per cent. was taken off the annuities.  If you combine the rates and annuities now, they are higher than the double annuity and the rates that were then paid.</P>
    <P>I found this year that our rates in Cork are up 1/4 in the £, and I found that that was largely caused by insufficient money being allowed by the Department as its share of the social services they initiated.  I think that is wrong.  If the Government brings in any scheme, proper provision should be made for payment.  I admit that the services are necessary: I would like to see more of them and I have no objection to them at all.  As a representative of the ratepayers, I say that the ratepayers are prepared to pay their share. However, you are told that there is half-a-crown extra for the old age pensioners, that that is to be paid by the relieving officer now and that a percentage of it will be refunded; but you <Col N="1282" /> find only a certain sum is allowed to cover the old age pensioners in your district.  Then you get the admission of a county manager that the old age pensioners have to queue up, as it were, inasmuch as one fellow is waiting until the other dies, in order to get his half-a-crown.  That is not a position any of us likes to see.</P>
    <P>Our position as regards these schemes in the South Cork area of Cork County, on account of our keeping the drones alive in the city, is that our rates this year, on that account alone, have been increased by 8½d. in the £.</P>

      <P>The reason for the increase is here.  However, I do not want to raise it, but would just point out that our position at the moment is that our combined rate and annuity, even though there was a 50 per cent. reduction, is higher than the combined rate and annuity was in 1933.</P>
      <P>As I have said, I have no objection to social services, nor do I think anybody has.  If an old man or woman has got through all the inquiries which are made into his means by the Minister's inspectors, and has been found entitled to 10s. a week, he should get his extra 2/6 without any more noise about it, and without any more penal inquiries into his means.  I am more anxious on that account than anything else, because those people are the poorest section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as post-war planning is concerned, it is up in the air.  We do not know what we are to plan for.  There is only one certain thing we can plan for at the moment: as regards agriculture we can plan for the home market of the future.  As regards other things, we will have to plan for the enormous number of our people at present serving <Col N="1283" /> with the armed forces, and for the enormous number temporarily employed abroad.  We must plan to bring them into some employment when they come back.  We have to face that, so let us face it as a people prepared to face their obligations.  I consider that any man who is drawing the dole for five years, or even for three years, is a useless member of society for the rest for his life, and is good for nothing.</P>
    <P>In regard to the definite guaranteed dividends that are being paid, or that are guaranteed to certain practically Government owned companies in this country, I say that they should be put on the basis of the farmers.  Nobody guarantees us any dividend out of the capital that we have invested in our lands.  I do not believe any farmer draws 2 per cent. on the full capital invested in his land.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot of talk about farmers having money in the banks.  Who owns that money?  Is it the farmers?  Take any farmer with three or four sons and a couple of daughters.  When his children reach the age of 15 years they are shoved on to the land and they work on it until they are 30, 40 or 45 years of age.  They are unpaid labourers on that land.  If there is any money made on the farm it is put into the bank for division among the members of the family afterwards.  It is not the farmer's money; he earns it off his family and that is a thing that is completely ignored in this country, particularly by people who talk about all the millions the farmers have in the banks.  The majority of those farmers' sons and daughters are working at a wage that the farmers would not dare offer any labourer.  Whatever profits are made at the end of the year they are put into the bank for the members of the family.</P>
    <P>Those are facts that will bear looking into.  When that farmer reaches the age of 70 years and looks for an old age pension, some inspector will say: &ldquo;Oh, he had £700 in the bank last year.  What did he do with it and to whom did he give it?  He did away with it in order to get 10/- a week from the State.&rdquo;  He forgets that the £700 was the earnings of Jack and <Col N="1284" /> Mick and Mary and Kate, who are now from 30 years to 45 years. and who are considered to be of a marriageable age and who must get a few pounds between them before they go off.  That is what is playing the dickens with this country, that system of unpaid labour on the land.  It has led to bad prices, to contracts being taken for beet at uneconomic prices; it has led to all those evils&mdash;the fact that the farmer has Jack and Mary and Kate and if they work for nothing he might be able to knock £1 or £2 an acre off the beet crop.  Those are the things which enable the sugar companies to pay 6 per cent. to their shareholders&mdash;the fact that Jack and Mick and Kate and Harry work for no percentage at all.</P>

      <P>I am pointing out some of the difficulties and I would like the Minister to give them his serious consideration. I am glad and proud of the policy that we enunciated here and that was enunciated by our Party from the Start, the policy of reserving the home market for the Irish farmer.  Even though we have rows about prices and all the rest of it, that policy has saved this nation from the horrors of starvation during the past five years.  Whatever little sacrifices might be needed in the way of extra prices, just, as we have to pay a little extra for our artificial manure and we have to pay a lot extra for Irish agricultural machinery, and just as we have to pay those things extra in order to provide employment at home for our own people, so should we also consider that the agricultural labourer is at least worthy of his hire and that his master, if he can be called his master&mdash;the man who works side by side with him, the old farmer&mdash;is also worthy of a fair &ldquo;do&rdquo;.  I would like the Minister to keep that in view and to place us at least on an equal footing with industrialists.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cogan alluded to credit. The credit facilities afforded by the Agricultural Credit Corporation to agriculturists and the facilities afforded by the Industrial Credit Corporation to industrialists show a great difference in the rate of interest and I would like the Minister to examine that matter in his spare time. All we want is a fair &ldquo;do&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>That is straight, and I agreed to that from the start.  If, as is generally considered and as I consider, I had money in the morning, I would not stick it into agriculture.  My friends here say they cannot pay 4½ per cent.  I can get 6 per cent. if I bought a few shares from the Minister in the sugar company and I need not be worrying my head about anything, because the Minister will look after it for me.  He will see I get my 6 per cent., no matter what the farmer gets for the beet.  It is a much easier way of making sure of your income.  That is one thing I would like the Minister to look into.  Another thing that we should have, in common with industry, is a costings board, a prices commission, before whom the agricultural community or their representatives could go to prove their costings and get their prices, just the same as the industrialists can get.</P>
      <P>I wonder will the Minister agree with that side of the picture as well as he agrees with the credit side?  We are not looking for anything but a fair &ldquo;do&rdquo;.  The Minister, surely, will admit that if a certain price was a fair price in 1942, and if since then the cost of producing the article has, by Government intervention, been increased&mdash;for instance, agricultural wages, the price of agricultural machinery, the price of artificial manure and the shortage of sugar content owing to the absence of potash&mdash;it is not a fair price in 1945.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If £4 a ton for beet was sufficient in 1942, he will admit that it could not be sufficient in 1945.  All we are looking for is a body before which we can go and fight our case just as the Cork Milling Company, the National Flour Mills, or the Flour Millers' Association, can go to their Prices <Col N="1287" /> Commission and say: &ldquo;You have raised the price of wheat by so much and the cost of flour should go up by that amount.&rdquo;  Give us a fair deal and you will have less dissatisfaction and less trouble with the agricultural community. I regard our policy for agriculture as absolutely right, with the exception of these few matters I have dealt with.  These, however, are minor differences which we can settle between ourselves.</P>
    <P>So long as we can hold our home market for our own people, so long are we safe and so long have we some basis upon which to operate; but once we are dependent on the export market, either of England or any other country, we must take what we get. I have heard complaints all over the country, and there is no farmer but will agree with me, that the price of cattle for the past six months has been worse than pre-war.  Yet it was only last September or October that I heard one of the high priests of agriculture standing up here and advising the farming community to hold their cattle. &ldquo;I prophesy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that there will be a grand price for your cattle during the winter months if you only hold them now.&rdquo;  These are the things which people should have regard to.</P>
    <P>No man knows what the price on a foreign market will be from week to week, and that is my objection to all this talk of an export policy and of more production.  Let us have more production certainly to fill the home market, but are we to put ourselves in the position in which we found ourselves when we had to bring in a Bill to stabilise the price of butter in order to ensure that the farmer got even 3½d. per gallon for his milk at the creamery? In order to give him 3½d. per gallon we had to pay between £400,000 and £500,000 when butter was 70/- a cwt. in Britain, the market we are all looking to.</P>
    <P>Stick to your home market and keep it before your eyes.  Hold it, and let nobody ever again bring Chinese eggs and foreign bacon into this country. Put an end to that kind of thing and let us not be Johnnies-looking-two-ways, <Col N="1288" /> like Deputy Hughes a few moments ago.  &ldquo;Abolish the artificial manure industry; abolish the agricultural machinery industry; and let us get in cheaper manure and cheaper agricultural machinery from abroad&rdquo;&mdash; we are to do all these things and then try to have a protected market.</P>
    <P>We cannot have it both ways.  If Irish industry is to be protected, Irish agriculture must also be protected. Finally, I should like the Minister to tell us what he thinks of the position of the man who got a price in 1942, who saw a jump in his costings for two years after and who was then offered the same price by the principal shareholder in the sugar company.</P>

There is no doubt we shall have to export a certain amount of goods, or have to face a very much lower standard of living.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry seems to be sincere in his endeavour to go fifty-fifty with the industrialists, but I should like to point out some of the snags.  He wants to have a costings board for agriculture, before whom he could argue what it took to produce a certain commodity, but what would happen to Deputy Corry with the splendid herd of Friesian milking cows which he has had for the last 15 years, when he went before that body, is this: he would be told &ldquo;You cannot take the standard prices.  Produce your books <Col N="1289" /> and show us what you made,&rdquo; and 70 per cent. of his profits for the year would be taken from him.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the Minister's calculation is, but I suppose we can say that we are in the sixth year of war.  If one can rely on what one sees in the news, already in America they are getting ready for victory celebrations and arranging their regulation.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that you have to catch your hare, but the hare will be caught some time. Is the Minister ready for a change of front when he does catch his hare?</P>
      <P>At the present time this country broadly rests on three classes: the agricultural people, the industrial community and a class&mdash;we never thought of it some years ago&mdash;which provides men and women for export.  In the last few years it has become a major industry if one is to judge by the returns. That class has been making a solid contribution to the revenue of the country.  I am sure no one will think that is a desirable state of affairs.  In fact, one hears at the present time of people in certain industries being sent back from Britain and Northern Ireland when they become redundant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the outlook for the manufacturer at the present time?  He would like to know from the Minister what his position is as regards supplies of raw materials.  The Minister is in a better position to know than the individual manufacturer what is the position as regards supplies in each industry, and how far those supplies are likely to be available.  The Government have issued one report on the building industry.  Certainly, at the present time the outlook facing the manufacturer is obscure.  He is faced with giving up 70 per cent. of his profits when they reach a certain point above his standard allowance.  The Minister may argue that is as it should be in wartime, that nobody should be allowed to make undue profits out of the community.  Remember, however, that the moment the war is over an entirely different position will arise. First of all, the manufacturer will have <Col N="1290" /> to replace a whole lot of machinery. If the Minister knows what a 10 per cent. reduction is, I do not think that the revenue people do because, as well as I remember, what happens is this: if a machine is purchased at £100, in the first year the manufacturer gets 10 per cent. off it; that reduces the figure to £90.  He then gets 10 per cent. off the £90, which reduces it to £81, and in the following year he gets about 8 per cent. off, and so on.  At the moment there are many firms carrying large items for machinery in their accounts.  Those machines, especially motor cars, are simply scrap.  I would ask the Minister to consider their position in the post-war period.</P>
    <P>Another thing which is rather unfair is this, that at the time the standstill Order for wages was brought in by the Government a standstill was brought in on directors' fees and on the dividends that companies were permitted to pay.  A junior tradesman, for instance, could get his wage increase in each year, but junior directors could not get their annual increments.  While that may have been perfectly fair for the first year or two of the war, I suggest to the Minister that, at the end of almost six years of war, it has become grossly unfair and requires looking into.  We would be glad if, on other matters, the Government could give some light, because in the post-war period manufacturers will have to re-equip their premises with new machinery and try to get materials in places where they had not previously made purchases.  There may be the temptation for them to wait for the Government to make a pronouncement. If that is going to be the position, how is it that in England the population can be told after the war the country will have to double its exports and that industry will have to become more efficient?  Does the Minister think that the same sort of conditions will apply here?  This country, in agriculture and in industry, will have to become a little bit more efficient.  People will have to work possibly a little bit harder and a little longer hours, and they will have to take lower profits.  This will be <Col N="1291" /> a poorer and a more hungry world at the end of the war, and I suggest that we should not live in a fool's paradise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether we are to take Deputy Corry's view of our economic position, or whether we are with other countries to take our part in international trading.  Deputy Corry suggested that the export of agricultural produce of any kind was a futile policy to pursue.  Deputy Dockrell, speaking as an industrialist, disagreed. Apart from our agricultural exports, the export trade that we have been engaged in up to this has been almost negligible.  If we make up our minds to follow Deputy Corry's policy, then we shall have to examine what the consequences of that policy will be. Deputy Dockrell suggested that it would mean living under somewhat prehistoric conditions.  For one thing, many of our industries would be unable to procure the necessary raw materials. I do not think that would appeal to the people in general.  We must argue from the position that we must export goods of some kind if we are to import the things we require to maintain the industries we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would have expected, in an agricultural country such as this, that in the situation in which we found ourselves during the last four years, unhampered by war, spared providentially the difficulties of war, we should have been making preparations to expand agricultural production so that when the war would end we would be far in advance of any other country and, at least, be in a position to export considerably more than we exported before the war.  Unfortunately, we have lost the bus.  It is lamentable that a country which exported huge quantities of agricultural produce in pre-war days has been unable during this emergency to supply the needs of our own people. The most important agricultural commodities that we used to export were cattle, pigs, bacon, butter, poultry and eggs.  Three of those items have disappeared off the market&mdash;pigs, bacon, butter, and we still export cattle, poultry and eggs, but if we refer to the figures for 1944, we see that we <Col N="1292" /> exported in that year 43 per cent. less live cattle than we exported in 1939. The figures for cattle in the country have remained more or less stable.  If that is correct we should certainly be able to maintain our export of cattle at the original figure or possibly to exceed it.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that it is impossible to expand agricultural production in this country.  If everybody in the House&mdash;industrialists, farmers, workers&mdash;believes, as I do, and as I think the Minister for Finance believes, that exports of some kind are necessary and that, as far as we can foresee, the main exports would be of agricultural produce, particularly live stock, then everybody in the House must be alive to the necessity of increasing exports of live stock and subsidiary products&mdash;butter and dairy produce.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry said that it became necessary for us to subsidise the export of butter.  We must not forget that every country that exported butter to the British market subsidised it.  Being in the same position as we are in of having to sell in order to buy, they found it necessary to create a market and even to sell at a price under the cost of production.  It may pay us to pursue that policy to a greater extent than we have hitherto pursued it.  We might have embarked, in the last four or five years of war, on a great expenditure of money on agriculture so as to expand production in every direction, of cattle, milk, butter, pigs, eggs, poultry. We might have spent money on the expansion of the only industry that can afford us an opportunity of exporting on a large scale when the emergency ceases.  As I have said, most countries, even in peace time, had to subsidise agricultural exports in order to enable them to purchase the raw materials that they needed for industry and for their other requirements. We allowed our exports to lapse.  We might have maintained our butter exports if there had been a fairly liberal expenditure of money on the protection and expansion of the dairying industry.  It is not perhaps too late yet to embark on some policy of expansion of the dairying industry. If Deputies agree with me, as I see <Col N="1293" /> the Minister for Finance does, that we must export, we must come to the conclusion that the only large-scale export available to us is live cattle and stock.</P>
    <P>The position in the dairying industry at the present time is that, where we used to produce sufficient for our own people and, in addition, produce a great quantity for export, in this fifth year of the war and in fact for the last two years, the consumers in this country are rationed to 6 ozs. per week of butter and the Minister has offered no hope that the allowance will be increased even during the summer months, when one would think there would be an additional supply.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry suggested&mdash;and I am glad to see the Minister did not like his argument&mdash;that Fricsian cattle might solve the problem in giving us a greater supply of milk and butter and thereby extend his policy of living on ourselves.  I do not think the Minister altogether agreed with that. I was glad that he elicited the fact from Deputy Corry that he has got rid of his shorthorn cattle and has substituted Friesian.  It may be that Deputy Corry is making money out of the supply of milk to Cobh and Cork as a result of having Friesian cattle, but I hope Deputy Corry's suggestion will not be accepted generally by the farmers of this country or by, any section of the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>If we intend to pursue a policy of the export of live stock, which I believe we must do, it comes to this, that we have to use the breed of cattle that we have been accustomed to use, that is the shorthorn, and the least taint we have on our breed of shorthorns the better it will be for this country if we are to survive as an agricultural country.  But there is this snag.  We are not going to produce the same quantity of butter or milk as the people of other countries, such as New Zealand and Denmark, produce. We have to remember that these countries did not embark on the export of live stock.  They have collared the British market in butter by subsidising <Col N="1294" /> it to such an extent that they knocked us out of the market.  We are nearer to that market and our transport charges are lower, and if we had the foresight ten or 20 years ago and subsidised our butter industry, we might easily have run them out of the market and to-day we could get a fair price for our export of butter to Great Britain and also for the export of our live stock.  But we missed the bus, particularly in the last five years.</P>
      <P>In this debate we are discussing post-war planning in regard to the expansion of industries and increased production all round.  It is idle to talk of expanding our other industries if we do not expand our agricultural industry. As I said, our cattle exports have been reduced in four years by 43 per cent.  If they continue to reduce at the same rate, one can easily envisage what our export trade will be in 1950 and what the position of this country will be so far as its raw materials for industry and the commodities that Deputy Dockrell spoke about, such as tea and other items which we can never produce here, are concerned.  We are slowly but surely drifting in that direction.</P>

    <P>Deputy Corry spoke about the tremendous slump in cattle prices in the late autumn.  Prices were bad and that position continued until this week.  Owing to a variety of circumstances, young cattle became unsaleable. At the end of last year calves could hardly be sold at all.  When they were sold, they had to be sold at giving-away prices.  This spring many dairy farmers find it impossible to sell dropped calves.  I have been given to understand that calves are actually being sold at 2/6, 5/- or 7/6 to be canned and exported to another country.  If that is true, and if the Minister for Agriculture was aware of it, steps should have been taken to prevent it, even if it necessitated the expenditure of public money and it became necessary for the Minister for Agriculture to appeal to the Minister for Finance for aid in the matter.  At one period in an emergency in this country the Government found it necessary, through the Minister for <Col N="1295" /> Agriculture, to subsidise the slaughter of calves because it appeared to them necessary.  Surely if it was necessary at one period to expend money in the slaughter of animals which might have been useful, it would be wise now to expend money in saving animals which we all know will be useful in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan spoke of credit, which is a difficult matter, and one which I am not going to pursue very far.  I hope this House will not accept Deputy Cogan's argument that all that is needed to provide credit is for the Minister for Finance to wave his hand and create it automatically.  Intentionally or unintentionally, Deputy Cogan gave me to understand that the Government could produce money without anyone having to pay interest on it, that all that was necessary was the overhead expense of producing it.</P>

      <P>I hope Deputy Flanagan, as the representative of a particular brand of economists, will argue on better lines than that. Deputy Cogan certainly gave me to understand that the Government could create credit for farmers or others without paying any interest, which is equivalent to printing notes. I do not see in what other way it can be done.</P>

      <P>Yes.  There are certain trends of thought in the world which are going in the direction that Deputy Cogan attempted to outline.  They do not go altogether as far as Deputy Cogan went, but there is a trend in that direction which I believe is dangerous for this country.  I believe that the nearer we can anchor ourselves to British sterling in existing circumstances the better it will be.  We know that other countries which did not pursue that policy now find that, if they are to engage in international trade, it is a good thing to have a certain margin of British credit available <Col N="1296" /> to them.  I see no disadvantage to us in having a couple of hundred millions in Great Britain which we can use in the lean years to come in purchasing materials.  I have no fear that the British credit will not be universally accepted; perhaps it will be accepted even more readily than our credit will be.  Somebody remarked to me the other day that there was £200,000,000 of our money held up in London which we would never get.  I said to that gentleman: &ldquo;Do you not wish you had £20,000,000 or £30,000,000 of that money&rdquo;?  He did not say that he would not take £20,000,000 of that money on the chance of getting some portion of it back.  I believe that the person who argued that the £200,000,000 has gone would consider himself to be on velvet if he had a couple of millions of it.  However, I did not get up to pursue a discussion on financial and currency problems in general.  There will be another day for that, either in this House or somewhere else.</P>
      <P>As I have said, our live-stock cattle exports have been reduced by 43 per cent.  There has been a great reduction in the purchase of agricultural machinery, manures, cattle foods and other things that we do not produce ourselves and which we will have to purchase largely in post-war days.  As Deputy Dockrell said, it will be necessary for industrial concerns in this country to replace their worn-out machinery and to purchase raw materials which they could not get for the last four or five years to any great extent.  If we have to do these things and if we are to provide employment not only for the unemployed we have here, but for those demobilised from the Army and the emigrants who will return here, then we have to expand our exports and to increase our production generally.  The only way we can expand our exports is by increased production.</P>
      <P>I move to report progress.</P>
