      <P>While private flying must be regarded as a matter for development primarily by private enterprise, steps have been taken to assist it by giving facilities to the Irish Aviation Club at the Dublin and Shannon Airports, and the club is given some financial assistance by Aer Rianta, Tta.  A subsidy from State funds is not, however, contemplated.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy refers to additional duties performed by assistance officers in connection with the administration of the supplementary cash allowances scheme, the scheme of assistance in kind to recipients of home assistance, and the footwear scheme for children, I may say that there has been no avoidable delay in dealing with the question of their remuneration for such duties. Local authorities have already been advised as to the amounts payable in respect of the supplementary cash allowances scheme and the scheme of assistance in kind to recipients of home assistance.  The review of the work involved in connection with the footwear scheme for children is not finally completed, but a decision will be communicated to local authorities very shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister advert to the fact that some superannuated teachers have pensions based on the pre-1920 scale of salaries and would he consider, without considering the general question of pensions, asking the Department of Finance to make some concession to that very limited class of persons in view of the dire distress in which they now find themselves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt very much if it is possible to make a reasonable division of pensioned teachers into categories on the lines suggested by <Col N="2232" /> the Deputy.  Even if it were possible, I doubt very much if the concession could be granted to one particular small class without opening the question as to why it should not be extended to all classes of superannuated teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister could distinguish between those whose pensions are based on the post-1920 scale and those whose pensions are based on the pre-1920 scale?  Those on the pre-1920 scale are receiving only a few shillings per week.  The pre-1920 class are receiving a very much more exiguous pension than the worst-paid teachers of the post-1920 category.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the schools at Drimnagh cannot accommodate all the children of school-going age at present in the district.  There are two large assembly halls attached to these schools and I hope that arrangements will be made shortly to have them used as temporary classrooms. There is accommodation in Goldenbridge Convent National School and the Christian Brothers' School in Keogh Square for extra pupils and I have made representations to the city manager to have a temporary bridge erected across the Grand Canal so that children from the Drimnagh district might have easier access to these schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply of the 20th June, 1945, to a previous question <Col N="2235" /> regarding the National Blood Donation Centre, details were given regarding the publicity campaign being conducted for the recruitment of donors.  Since then, an advertising scheme has been initiated in the Dublin daily Press and a broadcast talk has been given.  The question of intensifying the present efforts to secure further donors will be examined in the light of the results of the current campaign.  The majority of donors find the afternoon a more suitable time, since they are then free to call to the centre and are afforded an opportunity of having a period of rest afterwards&mdash;a very desirable factor from the medical point of view.  For this reason, the advantages to be gained from having the centre opened in the forenoon would be very small. The medical registrar of the centre is a civilian doctor, but only Army medical officers attend for blood withdrawals. Consideration has been given to the question of operating a mobile unit in proximity to Dublin but, in view of the amount and expensive nature of equipment required and the disproportionate overhead charges likely to be incurred, it is considered that such a scheme would not be practicable.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state whether the allotment and dwelling-house of Mr. O'Sullivan on the Cane Estate, Loughlinstown, and Ballyoulster, Celbridge, was vested in him when no other allottee on the estate was similarly vested; and, if so, why Mr. O'Sullivan received preferential treatment, and whether he still retains possession of the holding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take together the Deputy's three questions relative to the Cane Estate.  This estate was acquired by the Land Commission in two portions&mdash;the first on 13/5/1932 and the second on 1/2/1935 for a total purchase price of £5,650. Approximately £2,018 (of which £1,180 was by way of free grant) was devoted to development, etc.  The lands on the estate were divided among 16 allottees on varying dates&mdash;four on 13th May, 1932, 11 on 11th March, 1935, and one on 1st October, 1935.  The parcels of four of the allottees have been already vested in them.  It is not the practice of the Land Commission to publish particulars of individual allotments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Commission sanctioned the sale of the parcel of Michael O'Neill (who had been in possession for nine years) subject to their approval <Col N="2237" /> of the purchaser and to the refund by the allottee of the sum of £150 expended by the Land Commission on buildings on the parcel by way of free grant.  The amount realised by the sale of the parcel is a matter between vendor and purchaser.</P>
    <P>In Mr. O'Sullivan's case, he had been in occupation of his allotment for over eight years and, ordinarily, the lands would have been vested in him in that period.  He applied to the Land Commission for vesting to enable him to raise credit for the improvement of the holding and the Land Commission, as they frequently do in such circumstances, arranged to have vesting completed.  It is understood that he has since disposed of the parcel, but this is not a matter within the control of the Land Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it in accordance with the policy of the Land Commission to permit allottees to cash in on valuable gifts which they got from the State, to the amount of £2,800 and £2,400?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out that the procedure in the cases of Messrs. O'Neill and O'Sullivan was carried out according to the usual Land Commission policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Then it is the policy of the Land Commission to permit allottees to cash in on allotments that were provided for them for the specific purpose of farming the land and living on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>What particular circumstances were there in this case?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given them in the answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have put down a question in an effort to elucidate the problems which are worrying a number of people down in Kildare, because they cannot understand why the State should provide a substantial piece of property for an individual and then permit that individual to cash in on <Col N="2238" /> it and put the money in his pocket. Is that the policy of the Land Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission are confronted with multifarious problems in regard to the division and acquisition of land.  It is very difficult for me to give the Deputy any more facts, without exposing certain private information which it would be unfair to expose here.  I do not wish to go into matters which would affect the interests of private individuals and which do not affect Land Commission policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that.  Will the Minister then say why the allotments of four tenants were vested in them and why the other 12 remain unvested?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are about 45,000 of these allottees throughout the country who await revesting, and, during the past few years, it was very difficult to carry on with revesting. Last year the Land Commission set up a special revesting section and increased substantially the number of cases revested.  This year we have doubled the number of revesting cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Land Commission deal with these matters on an estate basis and not on the basis of individual tenants.  Why was the whole estate not vested in the tenants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not always be possible to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know why preferential treatment was given to four tenants and the interests of the other tenants ignored?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>These people, through their solicitors, made application to the Land Commission for vesting or for permission to purchase and the Land Commission, having considered all the circumstances of each case, acted as they did act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, is the situation this, that the Land Commission vested in the case of four, and only for four, ignoring the interests of 12, and afterwards permitted two of the four to cash <Col N="2239" /> in on a State gift to the tune of £2,800 and £2,400?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only had they to ignore 12 cases, but they have had to ignore the case of 45,000 allottees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the procedure then that the Land Commission vests two or three tenants on an estate and then goes to another estate?  Surely the Minister does not contend that that is the normal procedure of the Land Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">

      <P>Last night, when speaking on this Vote, I omitted to notice that provision was made for a scholarship or scholarships.  It was so placed that it did not appear that preference was being given to the provision of scholarships, and as far as one could discover from the Minister's statement most of the money was to be spent on a display, on a memorial to Thomas Davis, and on various ceremonies. I think far better results would accrue from the provision of a scholarship or scholarships.  This is a very large sum of money to spend merely on laying wreaths, and on erecting <Col N="2251" /> memorials which serve little purpose beyond bringing to people's minds, on the day or days on which those displays are held, the person commemorated.  I should prefer to see proper provision made so that students could study the literature or works of Davis, and contribute in some way to a better appreciation of his writings and a better development of his teachings, not alone from their own point of view but from the point of view of the country generally.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister will agree that we have not yet reached the ideal form of government in this country, and it would be a very welcome gain from the point of view of the country generally if students, as a result of a scholarship, could procure facilities to study the works of Davis.  That would put us in a more advantageous position as far as public administration is concerned. As far as I can gather from the Minister's statement, most of the money provided in this Supplementary Estimate is to be spent on a form of gaiety, or a form of transient commemoration. It is proposed to spend £9,000 on a memorial, on the laying of wreaths on the grave of Davis and on his memorial in the City Hall, and it is also proposed to hold a ceilidhe. I think we could hold a ceilidhe at any time, at any place in the country, and get a large gathering there, instead of spending public money in this manner.  It is proposed to spend the sum of £9,000 in commemorating the memory of Thomas Davis, and I think that could be done far more advantageously by providing scholarships which would enable the humblest citizens of this country to study his works, free from financial worries, so that they might contribute in a real way to a better knowledge and appreciation of those works.  I should be glad if the Minister would indicate precisely to whom this money is to be allocated, what provision is to be made for the expenditure of the money, and after what examination this expenditure has been decided upon in the manner set out by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>One would have expected in a matter of this kind that <Col N="2252" /> prior consultation would have taken place between the various Parties in this House.  The first intimation that we on these benches had of this matter was the introduction of this Estimate yesterday.  I do not know whether Fianna Fáil claims to be the lineal descendants of the tradition of '48, the tradition laid down by Thomas Davis. But I want to say this as regards Thomas Davis, apart from what he may have done for Irish literature. His greatest contribution to the political philosophy of this country was that throughout his entire life he preached unity.  His doctrine was to unite under the common name of Irishmen every section of the community, every creed of the community, to unite orange and green, red, white and blue, green, white and yellow, Protestant and Catholic, and to put them all under the common name of Irishmen. I should prefer to see some movement coming from the opposite benches which would have for its object the inculcation into the minds of our people, and in particular into the minds of our youths, that particular doctrine of Thomas Davis.  We on this side of the House can at least lay claim to as good a national tradition as the people on the opposite benches, and I claim that we should have had some prior consultation on these matters.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Government Party, if they are going to commemorate the memory of Davis, please not to make it a Party affair.  You have not the national tradition; the mantle of Thomas Davis has not fallen upon your shoulders, and I want to put it to the Government Party that if they want to perpetuate the memory of Thomas Davis in a manner befitting the occasion, let it be a commemoration in which all Parties in this House can unite.  I notice that the foundation stone is to be laid this week.  That is news to the House.</P>

Let all Parties who have some national aspirations in the country be given an opportunity of uniting on this particular occasion.  I will go further and say that if you do wish to perpetuate the memory of Davis most of this money should be spent, not on jollifications, ceilidhes, parades, book fairs or anything of that kind.  It would be much more befitting to the memory of Davis that the bulk of the money should be spent on the cause for which he stood, the education of Irishmen, and that it should be funded by way of a grant to some university for research into the life and work of Davis.</P>

I would also like to point out that celebrations in regard to Thomas Davis are being carried out in Cork.  A rather representative committee has been formed for that purpose.

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>My normal instinct, largely because of the way in <Col N="2254" /> which this matter has been approached, would be to oppose the Estimate.  I think, however, that the Estimate itself and the idea put before the Dáil by the Government contain the germ of a valuable idea, and for that reason I have no intention of opposing it.  We, however, think that the Government is making this a purely Party matter.  We have in mind the fact that not so many years ago, when Easter Week was being celebrated, with the great national celebrations, you had your military parades, speeches and declarations, and that here in the heart of the City of Dublin all that was made the occasion of a flag-day for the Fianna Fáil Party.  We have had similar episodes in connection with demonstrations for the emergency Defence Forces in various parts of the country. I think the idea enshrined in this proposal, if developed in a proper way, could be made most useful.  After all, there is nothing more important to develop in our people to-day than a sense of individual personal dignity, capacity and greatness.  In the course of our history we have had men of great stature, great courage and great ability.  If it were not for them we would not be standing here to-day in a world torn by war&mdash;standing here as a sovereign nation, even if a partitioned one, untouched by any of the serious ravages of war.  We have, therefore, something to look back to in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be an admirable idea if, in a better thought-out way, a certain amount of money were voted from time to time to carry out&mdash;and this because of the destruction of our records and of the chequered nature of the history of our people&mdash;historical work on the stature and types of our national personalities, all of which has been obscured.  It would be a good thing, in my opinion, if a certain amount of money could be granted periodically to take one of these personalities and by the systematical work of scholarships go back on their history and on their doings, and in that way display their personalities to the nation, particularly in regard to the qualities and principles that inspired their work as well as the reactions that their work had on holding <Col N="2255" /> the ordinary Irish people together, in strengthening them to advance along the road to the achievement of nationhood.  I do not think that a simple isolated episode of voting something for a blow-out in one particular year will do that.  Let a three-year period be selected.  In that period, take some particular character of an outstanding kind in our history, ancient or modern, and have studious and constructive work done around it. When the work has been done by students and research workers, there could then be a national commemoration in various kinds of ways, so that our people could contemplate that character and learn about him from the material that had already been carefully guarded.</P>
    <P>We are being asked to vote £9,000 for a commemoration of Davis this year.  I think that a very considerable amount of that money is going to be wasted.  I suggest that, if the idea I have put forward could be got to sink in, all this money would not be wasted, and that some constructive work could be undertaken.  I can imagine what a most useful thing it would be if, after a certain amount of preparation, documentation and the getting together of all the known facts about his history, his writings and of the traditions we have about him in our literature, in, say, the case of Cormac Mac Airt, he was made a national personage and was brought in a foremost way into the public mind over a three-year period.  Because of the excellence of his administration and of his virtues he got the grace of the Christian faith some centuries before St. Patrick ever came to Ireland.  When, owing to his incapacity and his blindness his son took up the running of the kingdom, he went to his father for advice as to how a kingdom should be run.  If only we could get stamped on the minds of our people the advice that Cormac Mac Airt gave to his son it would be well worth while spending £9,000.  It would be well worth that if the mind of the nation could be brought to bear on the principles that were established there at the very thereshold of our history as to how a State should be <Col N="2256" /> run.  &ldquo;Cad a théann chunn tairbh dhúiche?&rdquo; (&ldquo;What is it that promotes the advantage of a kingdom?&rdquo;) &ldquo;Daoine ciallmhara do thabhairt le chéile i gehomhthionól chun gnóthaí na tíre do scrúdú, chun na maitheasa do choimeád, chun an oilc do dhíbirt agus chun an tseanchais do léiriú.&rdquo;  (&ldquo;To bring sensible people together in an assembly, to discuss the affairs of the nation, to get rid of what is bad, to hold what is good and to interpret history.&rdquo;)</P>
    <P>Because the expenditure of this money represents some kind of an attempt to interpret our history&mdash;I do not know how it will work out because of the way in which it is being handled &mdash;I am not opposing this motion.  I hope that this Estimate is the beginning of a better thought-out and more constructive plan for dealing with this matter.  Can the Minister tell us if it is the spirit of Davis and the Young Irelanders that is going to be, as it were, made to appear before the eyes of our people and that will affect our people in their attitude of mind and in their daily work, for the national good?  Can the Minister tell us why, if that is the intention, a committee broadly representing the nation, was not brought together to stand over, to patronise and to supervise the affairs that are going to take place between this and the week and during the week?  Can the Minister tell us who has been brought together to do these things and, in particular, in connection with the scholarly and artistic work that is contemplated, who is advising in that particular matter?  To my point of view, nothing could more propitiously start this particular type of commemoration than that the Government would invite a certain number of people, as generally representing the nation, to stand over, to patronise and to direct this work.</P>
    <P>We are just getting into the position that there is no organisation more anathema to, or more out of spirit with, anything that Davis ever thought or wrote or that the men around him ever thought than the present Government or the present Government Party.  I will just ask you to begin contemplation of some of the things that Davis stood <Col N="2257" /> for in his time by listening to some of the things that have been gathered from his writings and from his mind by the late Arthur Griffith, who was the great interpreter of Thomas Davis to our generation.  I would ask you to listen to a couple of things contained in the first 18 pages of Griffith's volume on &ldquo;Thomas Davis: The Thinker and Teacher&rdquo;.

      <P>On page 9 of Griffith's collection, under the heading &ldquo;Our Nationality&rdquo;, we get this from Davis:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Some, dazzled by visions of pagan splendour and the pretensions of pedigree, and won by the passions and romance of the olden races, continued to speak in the 19th century of an Irish nation as they might have done in the tenth.  They forgot the English Pale, the Ulster Settlement, and the filtered colonisation of men and ideas.  A Celtic kingdom with the old names and the old language, without the old quarrels, was their hope; and, <Col N="2258" /> though they would not repeat O'Neill's comment, as he passed Barrett's castle on his march to Kinsale, and heard it belonged to a Strongbownian, that.  He hated the Norman churl as if he came yesterday'; yet they quietly assumed that the Norman and Saxon elements would disappear under the Gaelic genius like the tracks of cavalry under a fresh crop.</P>
    <P>The nationality of Swift and Grattan was equally partial.  They saw that the Government and laws of the settlers had extended to the island&mdash;that Donegal and Kerry were in the Pale; they heard the English tongue in Dublin, and London opinions in Dublin&mdash;they mistook Ireland for a colony wronged, and great enough to be a nation.</P>
    <P>A lower form of nationhood was before the minds of those who saw in it nothing but a parliament in College Green.  They had not erred in judging, for they had not tried to estimate the moral elements and tendencies of the country.  They were as narrow bigots to the omni-potency of an institution as any Cockney Radical.  Could they, by any accumulation of English stupidity and Irish laziness, have got possession of an Irish Government, they would soon have distressed everyone by their laws whom they had not provoked by their administration or disgusted by their dulness.</P>
    <P>Far healthier with all its defects, was the idea of those who saw in Scotland a perfect model&mdash;who longed for a literary and artistic nationality&mdash;who prized the oratory of Grattan and Curran, the novels of Griffin and Carleton, the pictures of Maclise and Burton, the ancient music, as much as any, and far more than most, of the political nationalists, but who regarded political independence as a dangerous dream. Unknowingly, they fostered it.  Their writings, their patronage, their talk was of Ireland; yet it hardly occurred to them that the ideal would flow into the practical, or that they, with their dread of agitation, were forwarding a revolution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2259" /> We too in our day depended upon the people and their ideas in language, in literature and in the advancing of agriculture, for the strength that brought us through to our independence here.  We at the present moment have got into a position in which the omnipotence of an institution, the Fianna Fáil Party and the Fianna Fáil Government, has dazzled the minds or gripped the spirits or the will of the Government Party and many of its followers.</P>

      <P>While expressing myself as not wishing to nip in the bud a line of action and thought that can be constructively used, with the co-operation of all Parties in the House, I am asking to be allowed to point out to the House what the real Davis was, so that we can watch the way in which things will develop <Col N="2261" /> and can prevent national money being expended upon misleading the country, by a false interpretation of history.  I will give just one other quotation, on Democracy and Centralisation, which Davis also wrote, and is taken from page 4 of Griffith's book:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Democracy has only kept half the promise given by its apostles. Centralisation is at least as great a foe to freedom, to spirit, and to prosperity, as aristocracy.  In fact, centralisation, when there are no independent powers to check it, creates an official despotism, uniting the costliness and faction of an aristocracy with the iron grasp of mere monarchy.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I quote these paragraphs because I consider them appropriate to any kind of a discussion on an Estimate brought in to recall the memory of Davis and presuming to recall with greater clearance and force the personality of Davis and his associates when it is brought in by the Government, who gave no other Party in the House any idea of what they had in mind, who asked in no way for any co-operation from any Party in the House or, as far as I know, from anybody outside themselves and their Party.  I want to suggest to them by these quotations that they are acting utterly and completely out of spirit with the outlook and principles and work of the man they ask the country to commemorate and I ask them to be warned, by the voices that we raise here, that we will not accept the situation in which Ireland is to be given a new version of Davis to suit Fianna Fáil ascendancy in this country.</P>

      <P>I understand these celebrations are designed to coincide with the founding of the nation.  I suppose it will be permitted, in the rarefied atmosphere of modern patriotism, for a grandson of one of the men who founded the nation to say a word in regard to this matter.  I sympathise with the hopes of the Leader of the Opposition, because I think he finds it hard to persuade himself that noble things could be brought so low, that he puts from him the thought that this <Col N="2262" /> is going to be a Fianna Fáil corroboree. What else does he think it will be but a day out, to show that de Valera is the reincarnation of Young Ireland?  Let the dead rest: if Davis and his colleagues beheld the realisation of their dream, they would turn in their graves.  Let the dead rest: do not desecrate their memories by pretending that a Party which understands Davis and his colleagues as much as a flea understands an elephant is the repository of the things they stood for.  God forbid that those we see about us should ever be deemed by anybody, in our country or outside it, to be a realisation of their dreams. Their dreams have yet to come true in this country and there would need to be a mighty change in Fianna Fáil before they would ever be capable of taking the place of the men that Davis thought of when he wrote:&mdash;</P>

Do not attempt to use their memory for the purpose of representing the political leader of one Party in this country as the sole repository of nationality.  Whatever the cost, you will not be allowed to get away with that, you will not be allowed to use their memory for your own purpose, you will not be allowed to fool our people into the belief that that Party represents what they stood for.</P>

I never had any doubt, when this proposal was adumbrated, that it was merely another stunt to represent to our people that the only patriot in Ireland was the present Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Anything that can be done to prevent that fraud on our people, whether it be done out of private or public funds, will be done. It would be a source of profound regret to me if, having used public money and private money to that end, they should now stop so low as to use the memory of the dead for so unworthy a purpose.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the spectacle here to-day is that we are not fit to honour our worthy dead.  Unfortunately, in the present generation our minds are warped in narrow politics. If we want to honour a man like Davis we must be broadminded and noble as he was.  Davis was one of those who believed in all the people, not merely in a political few.  He believed in orange and green being blended together in the Ireland of his dreams. He was a true Irishman&mdash;first, last and all the time.  It is only fitting to honour all our great patriots and that our nation should show throughout the country its appreciation of those who helped it in its trials and troubles.  We are a sentimental people and honour our great men, but the day has come when a fitting memorial should be erected, such as a park in the centre of the capital city where they would be given due honour.  I am afraid this whole thing is being promoted in a narrow Party spirit and it is the irony of fate that the present Government, which stands for narrow politics, should have the handling of this affair to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as memorials are concerned, is it not only just and right that we should erect one to the great Being who has watched over our country in this and in past generations, who has held our people together at all times? Is it not only right that we should <Col N="2264" /> erect, in the heart of our capital, a memorial worthy of Christ Our King? Here we are fighting over politics and patriots, but Christ Our King is above them all.  He has preserved our people and our country.  It would be only fitting if we erected, in our capital, a great memorial that can be floodlit at night, so that it will be clearly visible to ships coming to our country from all parts of the world. That would be one way of uniting our people.  It might help to put an end to all the fighting and bickering over men, who are very small indeed, when compared with Christ Our King, who is above us all.</P>

      <P>The Deputy who spoke last, who has shown his contempt for order in this House and has insulted the occupant of the Chair, can claim that he got a lead from the Deputies who spoke before him and who had to raise their voices and work themselves into a state of agitation over the proposal that is before the House. The position last night was that Deputy Cosgrave welcomed this Vote. He expressed the wish that more money ought to be spent upon scholarships and educational projects.  I explained the position to him in the short time at my disposal.  I had no desire to interrupt him, but it was obvious that he had not read my statement or he would have seen that provision was made for scholarships.  It was quite obvious that the Deputy was accepting the Estimate and the proposals of the Government in the same spirit in which we were putting them forward; that is, as a genuine and sincere attempt to commemorate the memory of the Young Ireland Movement and, in particular, of Thomas Davis, in a worthy and fitting manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently, if the Party opposite had been associated with the project, it would have been quite all right, but because it comes from the Government there is something entirely wrong about it, something suspicious about it, and Deputies, while on the one hand suggesting that it may have something of good in it, cannot say that the Government, when they go out to honour Irishmen who have occupied a prominent place in our country, are doing anything disgraceful. <Col N="2266" /> But they practically say that in other words when they accuse us of doing this for Party purposes.</P>
    <P>In all countries it is the custom to honour great men of the past on suitable occasions.  There is not a proper spirit in this country about that.  If there is an attempt to change the name of a street to commemorate the memory of an Irish patriot, there has to be an agitation and a popular movement may not be successful.  We are not depending now on popular movement to commemorate the memories of heroes and patriots and scholars and statesmen of the past. We have a Government, and the initiative in this case has come from the Government, and rightly so.</P>
    <P>It is quite possible to set up a committee. The municipality is dealing with one portion of this celebration. The proceedings on the first Sunday will be under their control when there will be the laying of a wreath on the Davis statue at the City Hall. That will be the municipal part of the week's functions.  In order that these be done in a worthy manner, we consider that the Army and the Defence Forces could very rightly be brought into them.  On the second Sunday there will be a military parade and a wreath will be laid on Davis's grave at Mount Jerome.  That military parade, or anything akin to it, can be undertaken only by the Government. There is no representative committee or no representatives of Parties who can make such arrangements.  Only the Government, through the Minister for Defence, can make these arrangements. It was considered also that, in addition to the function for which the municipality will be responsible, and the military parade, there are other matters to be considered and it would not be sufficient to commemorate the memory of Davis merely by parades&mdash;that something more substantial ought to be done.</P>
    <P>May I say at this point that the Government Party, to which Deputies have addressed themselves&mdash;a new form of address in this House, by the way&mdash;had nothing whatever to do with these proposals and has heard nothing <Col N="2267" /> about them?  For some of these functions Deputies of all Parties will receive invitations.  All Deputies will be treated on the same basis so far as we are concerned.  If Deputies will regard the different things that are being done, they will see that, in the long run, even if there were a committee, considerations arise such as what Parties or bodies are to be represented on such a committee and what bodies are to be excluded&mdash;is it to be confined merely to Parties in this House, or are Parties outside to be included and where will we stop? But, whether we have this committee or not, the responsibility for the carrying out of certain of the arrangements must, as I have indicated with regard to the military parades, come from the Government, through the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>We have then the question of the bust&mdash;the question of the statue of Davis.  The Government decided to take responsibility for this.  An order was given for the bust, and I think that while it is open to any other committee to commemorate the memory of Davis in another way, or through statuary if they wish, I think it is more appropriate that the Government, through the proper Department, the Board of Works, should make an arrangement of that nature.  It is the body best fitted and most likely to view the whole matter in an objective manner as to what is fitting and proper, not what is best from the political point of view.</P>
    <P>We have then the question of the ceilidhe.  I do not know whether the Deputy who referred to jollification has any justification for suggesting that ceilidh the are sources of jollification. I should not think they are.  I think that, as regards dancing festivals, ceilidh the are probably much less sources of jollification than any other type of dancing.  There is no justification for suggesting that anything beyond what is necessary and proper and meet will take place at ceilidhthe.  If, for example, the representatives of foreign states in this capital are invited to these entertainments, what is fitting and proper in <Col N="2268" /> the circumstances in their regard will be done, no more and no less&mdash;just what is customary.  The same applies to any other guests who may be there. I think it comes very badly from Deputies to suggest that there is any question of jollification or anything else.  They know very well that the great majority of persons invited to these functions are invited purely on account of the position they hold&mdash;in their official capacity&mdash;and not on account of themselves personally, and, to a much lesser extent, on account of their political persuasions.  Cómdhail Náisiúnta na Gaedhilge was asked to undertake the work in connection with Irish Day.  A ceilidhe mór will be entrusted to them, and also the aeridheacht on the second Sunday.  Is there anything political about that?  We are all supposed to be interested in Coláiste Náisiúnta na Gaedhilge.  We have spoken on the same platforms.  Occasionally I do not know whether Deputy Mulcahy has any qualms about Coláiste Náisiúnta na Gaedhilge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I also questioned why we should give public money to an organisation like that, when the Taoiseach and the Minister were on the platform and said that we must get rid of English and things as silly as that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody can say that this is a political organisation.  Anybody can go in to Coláiste Náisiúnta na Gaedhilge, and, no doubt, the <Col N="2269" /> reason the Taoiseach and others were asked to speak on the platform, as representing the Government of the Irish people, was that they would like to have them give a lead in the matter, and would expect, when we are going to revive the Irish language, that it would be necessary for the Taoiseach or Minister not alone to do what is necessary through the usual Government channel, but to tell the public that they have certain work to do, and how they should do it. That was my understanding of the position.  There is a question about the Book Fair.  That has been an annual event organised by the Dublin publishers and booksellers and on this occasion it has been organised by them also.  We gave them certain assistance.  I daresay the majority of the booksellers are not politically the same way of thinking as the Government. That question has not arisen. We come then to the question of the purchase of pictures.  A committee has been set up consisting of the heads of the institutions associated with art as well as a number of other persons, members of the Board of the National Gallery, to prepare a scheme to deal with the purchase of pictures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Are these new pictures or existing pictures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy.  I suggest that this committee has no political affiliations whatever. It is a purely official one.  Coming to the question of scholarships, one would imagine from Deputy Cosgrave's statement that the whole of this money was being spent on wreaths and memorials.  The fact is that if a scholarship, somewhat on the lines of the travelling scholarships awarded by the universities, is founded&mdash;which is our intention &mdash; to be awarded each year, provision is only made for one scholarship, and perhaps not one in the present Estimate.  Anybody can see that the capitalised value of a scholarship or studentship of £200 or £250 a year runs into several thousand pounds, since it will be continued. Obviously it will be necessary to have the university authorities come into the matter.  The intention is that in the matter of awarding scholarships <Col N="2270" /> those fitted to deal with the question will undertake the framing of the scheme.  My Department is getting into touch with the university authorities through the appropriate channels to frame this scholarship.</P>
      <P>Last year we agreed to subsidise the National Film Institute of Ireland.  We have taken steps for that body&mdash;which cannot be represented as a Fianna Fáil body &mdash; to undertake the preparation of a suitable film worthy of the occasion.  It is quite possible that the cost of the film will run to nearly half the amount provided.  It all depends on what the film will be.  As regards expenditure, the position is that about one-sixth, £1,500, will be spent on the encouragement of Irish paintings. The capital figure for the annual scholarship may run up to £4,000 and of the film it may run up to £3,000 or £4,000.  It all depends on the extent to which facilities can be provided in the time to turn out a decent national film, worthy of the occasion.</P>
      <P>As to sculpture, provision is only made in the present Estimate for a bust and plaque, a partial provision of £500 for the public memorial, the amount comes to some £850; literature £775; encouragement of the language, and entertainments and functions in connection with that £476.  We see that the money is being distributed in order to bring home to our people the activities in which Young Ireland was interested, and to re-awaken, if that is necessary, greater interest amongst the people in these activities at the present time.  It will be admitted by any person who examines the question and approaches it in an unprejudiced way, that any steps that have been taken are purely official.  The matter has been dealt with in a purely objective way.  Committees have been set up without any regard to political affiliations, and solely because there was a body there already or an institution, which seemed the appropriate one to deal with the particular scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The citizens of Mallow took steps some years ago to have a commemoration of their own in regard to Thomas Davis, and they selected&mdash;and were they not entitled to select?&mdash;the leader of the Irish people, the person who was regarded as the spokesman of <Col N="2271" /> Ireland, not only at home, but throughout the world, to come down and address them.  Who is better fitted or better entitled to speak for Young Ireland, who is more worthy to represent the spirit of Young Ireland in the world to-day than Eamon de Valera?  The citizens of Mallow, of their own free will and voluntarily, organised a function there and brought the Taoiseach down there. They recognised him as the appropriate person for the occasion.  Let us take the people of Mallow as a cross-section of the people of this country, and we can soon know whether their feelings in the matter are more closely in accord with the feelings and wishes of the Irish people as a whole than those whose diatribes we have listened to to-day from the other side of the House.  The Irish people have given these gentlemen their answer time and time again, and still they cannot learn the lesson. Why, we have to have a general election almost every six months, and still we cannot teach them manners.</P>
    <P>It is the intention of the committee that in Waterford, Mallow, Newry and in any other centre with which the Young Irelanders were associated similar celebrations, on a local scale, of course, should be undertaken, and if local committees like the committee in Cork are set up to deal with the matter we shall be very happy to give them any assistance possible.  We should like if more were done in that direction, but I should like now to take the opportunity to say that wherever an effort is being made locally, while we would like it to be spontaneous and would like the people themselves to undertake it and carry it through as they have done in Mallow, we are prepared to give them any assistance we can, consistent with the fact that our chief obligation is to make the Dublin celebration thoroughly worthy of the occasion; not only worthy of the people whom it proposes to commemorate&mdash;those great spirits of the Young Ireland movement&mdash;but worthy of a people that has attained, in very substantial measure, at any rate, the objectives which the Young Irelanders set before them.  In the last 100 years <Col N="2272" /> we have made advances.  We are not denying credit: we give credit and we give thanks to all those in the present time, no matter to what Party they belong, who helped in the achievement of these objectives, and I hope they will all participate, and I am sure they will see, if they examine the question in a calm mood, that there is no effort at political propaganda or seeking for Party advantage, but that it was a spontaneous coming forward of the Government to do what they felt they were in the best position to do; to do what they felt rested upon them to do; to do what they felt the Irish people would expect them to do, because whatever other committees would have been set up, am I not correct in saying that the public would have looked to the Government to give a lead in the matter and would have expected the Government to make definite arrangements, to give, perhaps, certain entertainments, to have certain things done, not only from the point of view of awakening public interest, which is important, but also to bring out the meaning and spirit of young Ireland?</P>
    <P>There is no use in unveiling statues or laying wreaths, I agree, if we cannot awaken in the public mind the meaning of these symbolic events, and we are trying to do that.  These processions, monuments, and so on are really symbolic, and we are really trying to call to the minds of our young people what these great men of the Young Ireland movement did, and I hope, as I have said, that when the time comes, we shall have the co-operation of all Parties.  In spite of what has taken place here to-day, I can assure the people opposite that we are very anxious to have their co-operation.  We should like to have them all represented, and particularly those related to the Young Irelanders by blood.  We should like to have them prominent and to be seen and associate themselves with the celebrations. If they do not choose to do that, then that is a matter for themselves, but I think, a Chinn Comhairle, the House will realise that from the Head of the Government down to the most junior member of the Cabinet we all have only one <Col N="2273" /> desire, and that is to honour the dead in a befitting manner, and we feel that, for the time being at any rate, we represent the nation in a way that no committee, no matter how representative it may be, could represent it; that we, as a Government, are in a position to do things in a way that no private committee could do them, or that even a public committee could do them, no matter how representative it might be, and I hope that these celebrations will be welcomed in the spirit in which we have undertaken them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a question.  With regard to pictures or paintings by artists of Irish blood or Irish origin, is it the intention to purchase pictures already existing or to commission painters or artists to paint Irish historical scenes or events, as was urged by Thomas Davis himself?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter upon which we have not come to a final decision.  The committee is dealing with the matter and we are discussing with them at the moment what is the best kind of scheme to undertake.  The intention is to deal with Irish historical events from, roughly, 1840 up to the present time.  Many people would like to see the history of our own days adequately portrayed, but there are difficulties in dealing with big historical events in a worthy manner.  The persons who are dealing with this matter are in touch with the artists and with the institutions of art, and I think they are competent to give us a good scheme.  I cannot say more at the moment than that while the intention is that the subjects should be of historical interest the painters would be given freedom to illustrate the particular event either symbolically or otherwise, as they wish.  We should leave it to the painter himself to decide in what way he can best represent the period or the event.  With regard to the question of artists of Irish birth or origin, we hope that artists from all parts of Ireland will participate in the scheme, and probably artists from outside Ireland who have any Irish association.  That is <Col N="2274" /> really the intention of the scheme, but the details have not been worked out. Probably, there will be an exhibition some time next year, and pictures which are exhibited there, if considered suitable by an advisory body, by a body of judges, may be purchased by the Government.  I think that that is really all that I can say on that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  On the 3rd January, 1944, a communication was received by the Government intimating that Mr. Maurice Victor Lakin, of Horetown, Foulksmills, County Wexford, who had shortly before inherited Johnstown Castle and demesne, proposed to make a gift of the property to the nation. In the offer of the gift, he expressed a desire that it should be used as a State lay agricultural college.  The Government accepted the gift with thanks and were advised that this acceptance should be regularised by an Act of the Oireachtas. Johnstown Castle is a well-known and historic residence in South Wexford. Its buildings are very fine and the estate is very suitable for the purposes of an agricultural college.  It consists of about 1,000 acres.  Leaving out of calculation a considerable portion which is under timber and a portion which is now, more or less, waste but which we hope to reclaim, there are about 600 arable acres in the holding.  It is very well suited, as I have said, for the purposes of an agricultural college and also for the purposes of agricultural research, which we propose to carry out there to a much larger extent than is done at any other of our agricultural colleges at the moment.  The castle itself is not eminently suitable as a college.  Nevertheless, it can be used in its entirety; in fact, every room in the castle can be used and, by making certain adaptations it can be made very suitable for resident students. There are very fine gardens attached to the castle which will be suitable for the training of horticultural students. There are also many houses for workmen and farm buildings which, on the whole, are in very good condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was dealing with my Estimate I spoke of the necessity for providing additional agricultural colleges. I do not want to go over that ground again, but I want to give a brief resumé of the position.  We have three State agricultural colleges &mdash;one at Athenry, one at Ballyhaise <Col N="2276" /> and one at Clonakilty.  In addition, there are four colleges run by religious institutions which receive help from the State&mdash;two by the Salesian Fathers in Limerick and Meath; one in Mount Bellew by the Franciscan Brothers, and one in Monaghan by the diocesan clergy.  This college, when added to the list, will make eight in all.  In addition, there is provision for students at the Albert College, Glasnevin, which is conducted by the National University.  It has been felt for a long time that we required more accommodation of this kind, particularly in the south-eastern part of Ireland, so that, geographically, Johnstown Castle is very well placed for our needs.</P>
    <P>It will be realised by the Dáil, from what they have already learned and from what I am saying now, that the gift is a very valuable one so far as the nation is concerned.  I should like at this stage to express to Mr. Lakin and to Mrs. D.V. Jeffries, of Carrigbyrne, who has an interest in the land and is associated with Mr. Lakin in making the gift, the appreciation of the Dáil of their generosity in making this gift, which can be devoted to such a useful purpose.</P>
    <P>The gift of Johnstown Castle is subject to certain conditions which are laid down in the Bill.  These relate to the making of provision for existing employees on the estate, the preservation of the general ornamental nature of the grounds, the maintenance of the right-of-way to the private cemetery where the Fitzgerald family have been buried, the reservation of the fishing and sporting rights to Mr. Lakin and the release of death duties already paid on this estate &mdash;and on this estate only.  I mention that because there was some misunderstanding about it.  A number of small matters are also dealt with. The Bill contains sections providing for these conditions and implementing them generally.  The preliminary arrangements for the transfer of the property were embodied in an agreement and a copy of the agreement is attached to the Bill.  A copy of the conveyance by which the property will be conveyed is also attached.  This has been executed by the owners and the <Col N="2277" /> Bill seeks authority from the Dáil to have it executed by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of this Party, I join with the Minister in expressing appreciation of the generous and practical gift to the nation by Mr. Lakin and his sister, Mrs. Jeffries.  It is a very useful gift and I hope it will be used to good purposes.  I agree with the Minister that there is one thing in which we are seriously lacking&mdash; educational facilities for the agricultural community.  On occasions here, we stressed that aspect of the problem in the past.  When we speak about competition in outside markets, this question is definitely forced upon us. We are handicapped to a considerable extent because other countries have the advantage of a high standard of agricultural education, notably Denmark. It is computed that, in Denmark, one in five of the agricultural population gets a special course in agricultural education.  The Minister has pointed out that we have three other State colleges &mdash; Athenry, Ballyhaise and Clonakilty.  Of course the Albert College is a State college also under the control of the National University.  There are a number of other colleges in the country but when one compares the number of colleges here, where our primary industry is agriculture, with the number in Great Britain&mdash;quite a number of counties in Britain have colleges of their own&mdash;one realises the lack of educational facilities in this country.</P>
      <P>There is very little in this Bill beyond the necessity to indicate acceptance of the gift and our principal duty in accepting the gift is to express our deep appreciation of the generosity of the donors.  The Minister has not given the House any information as to how he proposes to constitute the college.  He might say now whether it is his intention to bring in a further Bill or whether he proposes to operate and constitute the college under Section 3 of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the acceptance of the gift and the conditions <Col N="2278" /> relating to it are concerned, we are in absolute agreement with the Minister. We are very lucky to have such generous citizens in this country, especially people who appreciate the necessity of providing educational facilities of this sort.  It comprises a very desirable farm of a substantial acreage and, as the Minister has pointed out, it is situated in the southeast corner of the country where such facilities were not available heretofore.</P>
      <P>I cannot agree with the Minister that a second Bill is not necessary.  I think that the facilities provided in the college should be limited to a particular area.  What is really wrong with our educational facilities, so far as agriculture is concerned, is that we try to lay down general principles for the whole country when, in fact, these general principles are not applicable at all to certain areas.  If we take Sweden as an example, they got over that difficulty of trying to apply general principles throughout the country by setting up right along the whole length of the country six or seven agricultural colleges with research facilities that were suitable to the localities in which the colleges were situated.  We can appreciate immediately the enormous value that was to the agricultural community, because it afforded an opportunity of studying problems peculiar to the particular district in which a college was situated.  It seems ridiculous to expect that the scheme of this particular Bill, even under the most favourable conditions, is going to solve many of the soil and fungoid problems that are peculiar to certain parts of the country.  I want to suggest to the Minister&mdash;it is my idea and I do not know whether he agrees with it or not&mdash;that the facilities in this college should be limited to the investigation of problems which are typical of the area in which the college is situated.  Our aim in the provision of colleges of this sort should be to provide an institution to solve problems that are typical of that particular area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as control is concerned, the Minister is taking wide powers here to <Col N="2279" /> constitute this institution according to his ideas and the ideas of the Department without consulting anyone. Whether he intends merely to appoint one director and run the college in the ordinary way, I do not know, but I think the time has come when we should change our ideas in this respect. I think it is absurd to rely on one director.  He may be a very efficient director and he may make it a very successful institution but I do not think it should be run by one director.  I suggest that it should have three directors, one representing the Minister's Department, another representing the scientific side of agriculture and a third representing the practical side of agriculture&mdash;a man who has a knowledge of the agricultural problems awaiting solution in that particular area.  If we are going to get research in this institution carried out in a really earnest way, we want that particular type of man to engage in research work.  Sir Edward Hall, who was responsible for setting up the research institute at Rickmansworth, stressed that aspect, as to the characteristics of the type of man wanted for that purpose.  He pointed out that he should not be worried by the problems associated with teaching, that he should be in a position to devote his entire attention to research and, if necessary, to bring in students occasionally and to explain to the students what his work involved and the solutions that he hoped to achieve.</P>
    <P>So far as the constitution and the control of the institution are concerned, I very strongly appeal to the Minister now that he should bring in a second Bill to deal with that matter, that we should have three directors, one representing the Minister and his Department, another representing the scentific side of agriculture and a third representing the practical side of the industry.  I suggest to him that it is not wise to appoint only one director. He may prove to be a good, middling or indifferent man but once you appoint him it is rather difficult to remove him from office.  If we are going to take full advantage of this very generous and practical gift and show that we fully appreciate the spirit <Col N="2280" /> which prompted it, much will depend on the control and the constitution of the college.  There is nothing of a contentious nature in the Bill.  The conditions that are applicable to the gift are just the normal conditions that the donors are entitled to insist upon &mdash;conditions relating to the pensions of old servants, the provision of housing facilities for the district nurse, etc. These are merely the normal facilities that you would expect a generous donor to put forward in order to satisfy himself that these old people who have served him well would be looked after for the rest of their lives. I am surprised that the Minister has informed the House that he intends to bring in no other Bill.  I would ask him to reconsider that matter so that we may have some measure relating to the constitution and the government of this institution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with other Deputies in thanking the donors of this estate for the generous gift which they have given to the Minister and, through the Minister, to the nation.  I feel that very valuable work can be achieved through this new college but there is need in setting up a new college to see if it is possible to approach the problem of education from perhaps a different angle than that of the existing colleges.  The Minister has indicated that he considers that there are not a sufficient number of agricultural colleges in the country.  He has also indicated, and quite rightly, that he believes that the place where this proposed college is situated is admirably suitable.  Since the Minister claims that this Bill gives him full authority to go ahead and constitute the college, I want to ask if this new college will be exactly similar to the colleges already in existence, or will it seek to specialise in some particular branch of agricultural education or to cater for a particular type of agricultural student?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that one of the defects of agricultural education through the various agricultural colleges is that most of the pupils enter these colleges with a view to securing a job of some kind, with a view to becoming civil <Col N="2281" /> servants in the Minister's Department or inspectors in some Government Department. Would it not be desirable to make it clear from the very outset that the fundamental object of these colleges is to educate the best possible type of young farmers and to send the students who qualify in the college back to the farms to become the best possible practical farmers?  If the college, from its inception, were to have that ideal before it and were to inculcate that ideal into the minds of the students and to establish the tradition that it was mainly, if not purely, intended to be a college for boys whose intention it is to take up agriculture as a means of living, it might be a step in advance of any of the agricultural colleges already established.</P>
    <P>The Minister takes fairly wide powers in this Bill.  The section which gives the Minister authority to set up the college is very brief and very vague, and I assume that the Minister will claim that it gives him all the power he requires, but I think he should in his reply give us some indication as to the lines along which he intends to conduct this new addition to our agricultural colleges.  There is no doubt that the situation of the college is very good.  Wexford is a good agricultural county and it adjoins a number of good agricultural counties, and no doubt the Minister will have no difficulty in securing for it the best possible type of students, but it is very desirable that the material which will be available should be moulded in the best possible way.</P>
    <P>I thoroughly agree with Deputy Hughes when he suggested, I think, that the Minister should bring into the directorship of the college people outside his Department.  There should be at least one thoroughly experienced practical farmer on the governing body.  Such a farmer might not have a detailed knowledge of the running of a college, but he would at least be able to give very sound advice as to the manner in which agricultural education should be conducted and able to keep a very close eye on the practical side of the running of the college farm and the manner in which the various subjects were <Col N="2282" /> taught.  I think it an admirable suggestion which should be accepted by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone, I have no doubt, welcomes the establishment of an agricultural college in Johnstown, which is primarily designed to educate farmers.  Year after year, at the Public Accounts Committee, we used to discuss the adequacy of the accommodation available for farmers' sons who wanted to be trained, and year after year we were obliged to reach the conclusion that, although there were some independent colleges and some State-controlled colleges, there were far more applicants for admission than there were vacancies available. What was even worse was that the experience of the college authorities was that the bulk of the students presenting themselves did not aspire to be farmers at all, but hoped to become inspectors in the Department of Agriculture or under some local authority.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies may know that recently the diocesan authorities of the diocese of Clogher established outside the town of Monaghan an agricultural school, because, in their experience, a great many students coming up to their diocesan college wanted the kind of education they could get in what might be described as an agricultural secondary school and there were no vacancies in the existing establishments wherein to accommodate them.  I believe that at present dozens of young fellows, for whom their parents want some education better than they can get in the primary schools, are being sent into the diocesan colleges and other secondary colleges to learn academic subjects because there is no place to which they can go to learn scientific agriculture.  I find it hard to understand how, in a society such as we have here in Ireland, after 25 years of self-government, we still find ourselves unable to provide accommodation for the girls who want to be taught how to run a home and for the boys who want to learn how to run a farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Johnstown is excellent, but are we to understand from what the Minister has said that he proposes to rest on <Col N="2283" /> his oars once Johnstown has been set up?  Would I be unreasonable in suggesting that if we had an academic secondary school in every diocese in Ireland we ought to have an agricultural secondary school as well?  I know that lots of people blame parents for sending boys into secondary schools and say they would be much better employed in sending them to business or giving them some practical type of education rather than in thrusting an elaborate academic education on boys who manifestly will never make full use of it; but the dilemma of parents is that there is no place to send children, and if they do not send them to a secondary school for an academic course, the children must be content with what they have been able to pick up in the primary school.</P>
    <P>I am not asking for the expenditure of money.  I believe that if you established a good agricultural college in every diocese in Ireland, on a modest scale to begin with, but in such form that you could easily expand it as the demand for admission grew, you would find that they would be self-supporting units very quickly.  I believe you could run an agricultural college in this country at a rate of £40 a pupil.  I think that such a pension per annum would make the institute pay, more especially as you would be growing all the food consumed in the institution on the premises, largely with the labour of the students who were themselves learning technical agriculture. Then the county councils, I have no doubt&mdash;I see the chairman of the Roscommon County Council over there, looking very interested&mdash;would help by increasing the number of county council scholarships available to the students of primary schools who want to study agriculture.  That would be good business from their point of view, because if the holdings in their respective counties can be improved and an increased revenue extracted from them they may reasonably anticipate in years to come that a larger revenue for the local authorities can be derived from the improved holdings, and the people living on them.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is concluding <Col N="2284" /> to-day I hope he will tell us that he regards Johnstown as the first step in his plan to provide an agricultural college for every diocese in Ireland. I choose the diocese, because it is common knowledge to us all that at present the vast majority of farmers' sons seeking secondary education go to the diocesan college, and it will be convenient administratively from every point of view if we make the area upon which the college draws for its pupils the diocese in which the college is situated.  It has this additional advantage, that if you can make the boys from one parochial or diocesan unit associate with one another in childhood, and make school friendships in the course of their education, you are laying the foundation for the kind of parochial co-operation which was envisaged by those who have tried to establish parish councils in this country.  I think parish councils are good things. Furthermore, if neighbours' sons, side by side in an agricultural college, learn there the advantages of co-operation for the production and sale of their produce, it facilitates the promotion of that co-operation thereafter if you preach it to individuals who know one another well, who have learned to understand one another, and to trust one another.  One of the great difficulties of getting co-operative plans to work in rural Ireland&mdash; the co-operative user of machinery, schemes for co-operative selling, schemes for co-operative marketing&mdash; is that traditionally, unfortunately, particularly in the West of Ireland, where holdings are small and history has played its part, neighbours are not very trustful of one another's <i>bona fides</i> in any pooling plan.  Everybody is very vigilant to see that his neighbour does not get more out of the pool than he gets himself and all are solicitous to be sure that they are not persuaded to put more into the pool than the other fellow.  That makes co-operation very difficult. Amongst friends, it would be very easy.  That kind of intelligent friendship can be established in the diocesan colleges which I have in mind.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2285" /> If Johnstown is a new point of departure for a wide and courageous programme on those lines, it will become a monument more enduring than bronze as the point from which really successful agriculture in this country started.  One could talk for an hour on the necessity for this, on the importance of it not only to those who live upon the land but to every other creature who earns his living in this country.  If we have upon the land of this country educated farmers, who know the best methods and who know the means whereby they can acquire the most efficient tools, in the widest sense of that word, for the profitable and economic exploitation of their holdings, then the standard of living of everybody in this country will ultimately rise.  Should we face the post-war world endeavouring to work the land of this country by pre-war methods, we are going to become a very poor and miserable country. You cannot educate the people in a quinquennium.  It will take a generation to put upon the land of this country a fully educated population of farmers.  We have the duty to place within the reach of those men the resources that they are pre-eminently fitted to exploit if they once have them.  Those colleges are the most effective means of doing so.  Will the Minister tell us, in winding up this debate, that he regards Johnstown only as a start, and that he has plans to put a similar institution, albeit perhaps in the initial stages a more modest institution, in every diocese in Ireland?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Deputy Hughes is on very firm ground when <Col N="2286" /> he talks about further legislation, because this legislation is only necessary in order to accept the gift.  If we bought that particular property, I do not think any legislation would be necessary, because it would just be taken over and given to the Department of Agriculture to administer as a college.  All the things that Deputy Hughes advocated here can be done under existing legislation, if it is thought desirable to do them.  I must say that my mind is running in the same way as Deputy Hughes' mind on some of the points that he mentioned at least.  Deputy Hughes and other Deputies will have an opportunity, of course, from year to year, of discussing how Johnstown is being run, because Johnstown Castle will now be in the Estimates like all the other colleges, giving the costs by way of staff and other things, and, under Appropriations-in-Aid, the receipts from the college.  If it should be necessary to do anything special with regard to this college, I take it there may be even separate heads, or perhaps separate Supplementary Estimates. I am not sure, but it may be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as administration goes, the authority for administration and so on is the same as it is for the other colleges.  It will be administered in the same way, though perhaps with a somewhat different policy or on somewhat different lines.  For instance, as I have mentioned already, we intend to have more research done there than at the other colleges.  In fact, in time anyway, we intend to have a special soil science research department there. We hope to have almost immediately facilities for soil analysis there, and to proceed then to soil research.  The soil research that is done in Johnstown may not be applicable to the whole country&mdash;Deputy Hughes is right in that&mdash;but any knowledge that may be gained from soil research there will be useful, with the necessary modifications for any other part of the country.  Wherever we settle down to do soil research there will be the difficulty that we will not have exactly the same kind of soil elsewhere, but still <Col N="2287" /> any knowledge we will get will be useful. Deputy Hughes suggested that this college should be confined to students from a certain area.  Assuming, I think, that we have a certain type of farming conditions there, with regard to climate and soil, he suggested that we should draw the students from the surrounding counties where the soil and climate are roughly the same.  Well, without having to agree entirely with Deputy Hughes that the soil is the same in the four or five counties around, the college will, in fact, be confined to students from the four or five counties around.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be misrepresented.  The soil is not the same, but, generally speaking, the general conditions are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Hughes that if we take a farmer's son from Carlow or Kilkenny he is more likely, generally speaking, to meet with much the same soil in Johnstown as he is familiar with in his own county than he would be in Ballyhaise or Athenry.  As a rule, students from surrounding counties go to the nearest college, although I do not think we have ever made an absolute rule about that.  It is possible, of course, that you might find a student from Donegal in Clonakilty, and a student even from Cork not in Clonakilty but in Ballyhaise. Generally speaking, the students go to the nearest college.  If we had enough colleges we might, if we thought it advisable, be more strict about that, but as we have had only three colleges up to this we could not make any such ruling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose Deputies are fairly familiar with the staffing in the present colleges.  There is a director or a principal; he has a house master or two with him; they, of course, are qualified men, like himself, and they do the teaching part of the business. The principal looks after the farm as any farmer would.  He manages it. He looks after the students as the president of a college would, so that he is fully in charge both as regards <Col N="2288" /> the farm and the students.  The house masters act under him in training the students.  There is also, as a rule, a horticultural teacher.  He teaches the boys some gardening. There is a poultry instructress who teaches the boys something about poultry.  She also does some dairying and teaches the boys how butter should be made.  All the staff is under the principal.  I am afraid that whatever we may call the man in charge in Johnstown, one man must be in charge.  We are hoping to have a much bigger staff there than in the other colleges.  We have put a rather ambitious programme before the Department of Finance, for which we are hoping to get approval.  We will have there a research staff dealing with soils as well as the ordinary staff, such as that which deals with the students in the other colleges.  In addition, we intend to have there a bigger horticultural school than we have in any of the other colleges, for the reason that we have very good gardens in Johnstown.  That means that we will have to have two staffs there as compared with one staff in the other colleges.  Even while that is so one man will have to take charge. It would not be possible to have, as it were, three directors, each one having authority.  There will be one man, of course, in charge of research, one man in charge of teaching the students, but one man would have to be in full charge of all.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that would raise further difficulties.  I am not in a position yet to say how far we may succeed with the programme we have put before the Minister for Finance. I am afraid we will have to wait until the Estimate comes along from the Department of Agriculture before the staffing of Johnstown can be fully discussed.  All that I have mentioned can and will be done without a Bill. It will be done in the ordinary administrative way, but it will come up here for discussion year after year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid that it will not be possible this year&mdash;that is, starting in <Col N="2289" /> September next&mdash;to do more than make a start with the horticultural school at Johnstown.  The reason is that we have found it impossible to get certain alterations carried out and certain amenities installed that would be necessary before we could bring a number of students there.  We could probably bring in eight or ten students without making the alterations we have in mind.  In view of that, we think the best thing to do is to make a start with the horticultural school in September next, with, say, eight or ten students, and hope to make a start with the agricultural school in the following year.  In the meantime, the research part of the business could be got going.  There is no electric light, for instance, in Johnstown Castle, and we are finding it very difficult to get electric light installed there.  If we were to contemplate having a large number of students there is not sufficient or adequate sanitation.</P>

      <P>It is gone.  They had an old engine which was driven by water power.  The place was only partially lighted and the system that was there is useless.  As Deputies know there is not in these old castles sufficient sanitation for a big school.  It will take some time to put that right.  In addition, there is no central heating there.  I think that to run a school, such as we have in mind for Johnstown, it is almost essential to have central heating.  You could, of course, accommodate a small number of students without those amenities.  If you had, say, one teacher and eight or ten students you could improvise in regard to light, central heating and so on.  But what I have said represents the best that we will be able to do in the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to one question that was put by Deputy Dillon, I do not think that the proposal in this Bill represents the end, or that the establishment of this college is by any means going to make college accommodation generally adequate.  The experience is that more and more boys are each <Col N="2290" /> year looking for places in these agricultural colleges.  I do not mean to say that there is a big surplus awaiting places.  The number disappointed each year is small, but at the same time the number is increasing.  I think we should look forward to the time when we will be able to fill three or four more colleges if they are available. I think that Deputy Dillon has given very good advice to some of the diocesan authorities in Ireland, and I hope that some of them may adopt his advice, as they have already adopted it in the Diocese of Clogher.  If not, it will be up to the Department to do something special by way of the provision of colleges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Definitely.  With regard to the point that was raised by Deputy O'Leary, I think that it is hardly necessary at this time to impress on any Minister the necessity for looking after employees in case any changes take place in Johnstown &mdash;there are not likely to be any&mdash;in the way of looking after employees working there for years who, for any reason, have to be laid off.  As a matter of fact, when they come to a certain age they are provided for by way of pension or gratuity, and during a period of sickness it may be assumed that they will be treated with every consideration.</P>

      <P>The only objection I have is that, on the Committee Stage, I want to raise the matter of control. I am anxious to have control not merely centred in one individual but to have control in the hands of three directors.  I want to have the practical mind brought to bear in the direction and control of the institution. I think that if the Minister were to turn that idea over in his mind he <Col N="2291" /> would see the advantage of it.  Simply because a precedent has been established in the case of some of the other colleges, I do not think we should continue to follow that system.  If you are depending on one man, he may be an exceptionally fine man and may do his job exceptionally well; then everything is all right; but if we are unlucky in our choice we may find it very difficult to get rid of a man who is mediocre.  I suggest that we should not centralise the control in one individual.  Will the Minister undertake to look into that aspect and do something about it?</P>

He is, rightly, the supreme authority in the school, but at regular intervals he meets his board &mdash;quarterly or half-yearly&mdash;and reports to them and, if they are not satisfied, they can take action.  In this case, where the Minister is the ultimate authority, I would imagine the appropriate action for the board, if they were dissatisfied with the way the director was running the school, would be to acquaint the Minister that they were uneasy.</P>

I want, above all, that there should be three representatives &mdash;a representative of the Minister's Department, a representative of the scientific side of agriculture, and a representative of the practical side of agriculture, to watch and to be satisfied that things are being done properly in the agricultural interests of the district.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister considered the arguments that were presented to him on the Second Stage of this Bill in regard to this matter of withdrawing from the labourer his right to sue for arrears of wages for a greater period than two years?  I cannot think of any conceivable reason why that right should be withdrawn so long as Section 5 of this Bill is passed.  One could have conceived, under the original Act, that a farmer might have employed an incapacitated workman without realising that he should have got a certificate before he took him on and then, having that fellow in his employment for 15 or 20 years, that man could sue the farmer on the ground that he was bound to pay him the full agricultural wage, despite his incapacity, over the whole period of 15 or 20 years and, in the absence of a certificate, the court would have to decree accordingly. But, under the proposed Section 5 here, in such a case as I envisage the court is entitled to say: &ldquo;We are satisfied that if this farmer had applied for a disability certificate when he employed the plaintiff, he would have got it and, therefore, we are going to deem that he did apply and did get it and is, therefore, not liable for the moneys for which he is sued now.&rdquo;  But, apart from the case of a farmer who underpaid his labourer through a misapprehension, what justification is there for indemnifying a farmer who has deliberately <Col N="2295" /> defrauded the labourer of his hire?</P>
      <P>I make no apology, despite the fact that it appears to grate on the ears of some of my colleagues, when I say that I was taught, as the Minister was taught and as, I suppose, most other Deputies in this House were taught, in the penny catechism, that one of the sins that cry to Heaven for vengeance is defrauding the labourer of his hire. Were not we all taught it?  If that is true, and I believe it is true, and I think every Deputy sitting in the House at present agrees with me that it is true, why should we debar the labourer who is thus injured by his employer from recovering from his employer what was his due?  I have no sympathy whatever with the employer who withholds from his labourer a payment to which he is entitled. I have no desire to mitigate the burden that man will have to bear. I have no desire to withdraw from the labourer any part of his power to put right what is wrong, and I do not think any other Deputy here has.  Why then do we do it?  I urge on the Minister most strongly to withdraw Section 4 and let the original Act stand, subject to the amendment proposed in Section 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Deputy is arguing entirely on moral grounds.  If he is, I am afraid I cannot follow him in the argument. The reason I brought in this Bill was that the Agricultural Wages Board asked me to put in a clause of this kind, as well as three or four other clauses.  The agricultural wages committees all through the country&mdash;as I explained to the House on the last stage of the Bill&mdash;are composed of employers' representatives and employees' representatives, a number from each county.  There are five different regional committees and I was told by the board that they unanimously asked for a provision of this kind and then the board itself approved of that recommendation.  The only difference was that they said they wanted one year, whereas I thought one year a bit short and I put two years into the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2296" /> Very few Deputies have realised that we are not preventing a man from suing for arrears of wages on his agreement. In other words, if the wage is 40/- now and a labourer has agreed to work for 37/6, and if there is anything due on that, there is nothing here to prevent him from getting it.  So, as far as he agreed to work, he will get his arrears of wages.  All we are providing is that the difference between what he agreed to work for and the minimum wage fixed by Order will be recoverable by him only over a period of two years and not more.  I argued the last time that we should discourage an employee from continuing to work very long for less than the minimum wage, as that would have a bad effect on the whole area.  Farmers around would hear that such and such a farmer was able to get men to work for less than the minimum wage and they would be tempted to try the same thing.  I do not say that they do so, as I suppose there is as good a proportion of law-abiding citizens amongest farmers as in any other class, but when a neighbouring farmer gets away with it, they are likely to try it, too.  It is bad for the farmer and it is bad for the employee's brother-employees as, if this is going on, they find it difficult to get the full wage.  Therefore, in the interest of both employers and employees, we should not encourage this thing, and I do not see how we can discourage it unless we put some limit to the time during which a person can get the difference.</P>
    <P>I think Deputies will remember that, when the Act came before the Dáil in 1936, Deputies pointed out to me that it was an offence for an employer to disobey the Order but it was not an offence for the employee; and some Deputies held that it should be an offence for both.  I resisted that, as I said: &ldquo;If we make it an offence for both, neither will ever report it, but if we do not make it an offence for the employee he may come along and complain and so have it made right.&rdquo;  We might, in all justice, have made it an offence for the employee to work for less.  Therefore, it is not clearly a moral issue, as Deputy Dillon tries to make it.  I do not think the employee is morally due this difference in pay for all time.  It is really not a matter <Col N="2297" /> of principle but one of expediency, as to how far one can go to make the Act work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the exact point joined between us&mdash;the Minister says it is not a matter of principle and I think it is.  You have the case of the Truck Acts, which were designed to prevent the exploitation of the working-man by industrialists in England. The whole trend of that legislation is &mdash;and always was&mdash;that no matter what contract is entered into by the workman, no matter how elaborately drawn, no matter how skilfully disguised, the moment the court sees that the contract was designed to circumnavigate the Truck Acts, they simply say: &ldquo;Sweep it aside, it does not matter how clever the man was who tried that; we are of opinion that it is a violation of the Truck Acts and it is not binding on the workman.  All the rights he would have had, had he never signed that contract, are still his. We will award compensation on that basis and we will not hear the presentation that he forswore those rights as a result of the document which the employer produces.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not take the view that the employer and his workman are simply two contracting parties.  I am sure that, on reflection, the Minister would not take that view either.  I think the obligations of the employer are heavier than those of the employee.  The employee has certain clear obligations which he is bound in justice to perform; while the employer also has clear duties which he is bound in justice and charity to perform, over and above the cold written word of the contract of employment that exists between the two parties.  I am not trying to hold up the Minister as a kind of agnostic who attaches no value to moral principles. I am quite sure he attaches to them just as much value as I do.  It is a mistake to allow the representations of the Wages Board, based purely on grounds of expediency, to prevail over what seems to be a clear principle.  If the Minister had come in and said that the wages Board had made the case to him that the whole scheme would break down if some adjustment were not made to meet the practical difficulties <Col N="2298" /> that arose and that the lesser of the two evils would be to forswear this principle rather than see the whole system of wage fixation collapse, there might be something to be said.  I do not see that we have grave grounds here for abandoning this principle.</P>
    <P>The only argument I have heard is that, if we leave this right with the labouring man, it would be an inducement to him to take a lower wage, to the detriment of other workers in the area.  I cannot feel that that is a very real danger.  I want to create in the minds of the employing farmers that there is no use in their prevailing on a workman to work for a lower wage, as, the first time he has to check that fellow or sack him, the fellow will sue him at once for arrears and no argument that he puts forward about any agreement will prevail against the workman's right under the Act.  All of us know that, if we should pay £2 a week under the Act, it is very much easier to find the last 2/6 every Saturday night than it would be to pay 37/6 and find 520 half-crowns if we had to sack that fellow ten years after he first entered into employment.  No one likes to put his hand in his pocket and throw out £20 or £30, no one likes to put himself in the position that somebody whom it may be his duty to check will have that hold over him that he cannot afford to put his hand in his pocket and pay out that money.  After all, we all know that every employer in the country insures himself against workmen's compensation, just to avoid that contingency.</P>
    <P>I feel that, far from making the operation of the Act more difficult, the deletion of Section 4 would make it more easy and effective.  Furthermore, I think the deletion of Section 4 would rehabilitate the important principle that, in so far as lies within our power in this House, we will not depart from moral principles where effective legislative effect can be given to them.  I am not one of those who believe that you ought to make people good by law, or even try to make them good by law. But I think you can go too far in the opposite direction and simply say that where it is not convenient to be good we ought to legislate to be bad.  If we <Col N="2299" /> cannot legislate to be good, let us at least forbear from indemnifying a person who commits a sin crying to Heaven for vengeance against the temporary worldly consequences of that dereliction of duty.</P>
    <P>That is the way the case presents itself to me, and unless the Minister makes a stronger case on behalf of the Agricultural Wages Board, I have heard nothing which persuades me that I ought to change my opposition, and I think Deputy Corish agreed with me the last time we discussed this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the fact that the Agricultural Wages Board unanimously recommended that this section should be included ought to bear very strongly with Deputies.  The fact that representatives of the workers, who are diligent in looking after the workers' interests, have suggested that a time limit should be fixed, would indicate that there is, even from the workers' point of view, strong reason why this section should be included.</P>
      <P>It is foolish and senseless to contend that there would be any higher moral principle involved in the enforcement of this Act than is involved in any other Act.  It is, as we know, the moral obligation of every citizen to obey the law.  If a citizen defaults in the payment of his dog licence, or any other duty of that kind, it is not suggested that a more severe penalty should be imposed on him than would be imposed if this section were not included.  The contention that has been put forward that there is a higher moral principle involved here cannot be sustained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the duty of the employer to pay his worker a fair wage, but even the Agricultural Wages Board has never contended that the wage which it fixes is in all cases a fair wage.  It is a wage fixed by compromise, fixed on the basis of expediency, not on the basis of justice.  While the wage which it fixes should, in certain circumstances, be a fair wage it does not follow that it is always fair.  For example, you take a man who has been employed perhaps from the time he leaves school and who has no experience in agriculture. <Col N="2300" /> If he goes to a farmer and agrees that because he is inexperienced he will work for something less than the minimum wage, an agreement can be entered into between the farmer and the employee which will be absolutely fair to both sides, even though it may be below the minimum wage; with this exception, of course, that the farmer is violating the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>A very important consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, of course, but there is no greater moral default on the part of the farmer who violates the law in that respect than there is on the part of the farmer who goes out without a light on his bicycle or commits some other offence.  Undoubtedly, he commits an offence.  On the other hand, a highly experienced agricultural worker who is forced by circumstances to accept this wage fixed by the State, may not be getting a fair wage either.  The wage may be too low.  The point is that the Agricultural Wages Act never set out to fix a fair wage, because the board never apparently had the power to do it.  All it has is the power to compromise as between the farmer's income and what is considered as fair as possible to the worker in the circumstances.  If we were to accept what was put forward by the head of the State yesterday, that it is in the power of the State to fix the remuneration of the farmer under certain conditions, then it might be possible to fix an absolutely just wage for all types of workers.  That has not been attempted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I contend that is the weakness of the Act and one of the reasons why this section should be included. The farmer in many cases is only a very small step above the agricultural labourer.  As a matter of fact, his average weekly income may be lower than that of the agricultural labourer.  If you divide the total income of this country among the total number engaged in agriculture, the weekly income of each person would be very slightly over the wage fixed by the Wages Board.  Therefore, I think there is no big moral principle involved.  It is merely a question of doing what is expedient and fair.  It would be very unfair, particularly to the very small farmer, to allow a huge debt to accumulate which he might not be able to meet.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister's case is very weak on this, but, bad as his case was, Deputy Cogan's reaches the limit.  He puts forward the suggestion that because a farmer goes out without a light on his bicycle it is a moral offence, and because he defrauds his labourer of his wages it is also morally an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>They are both on the same level, both technical breaches of the law.  It cannot be suggested, either on moral or legal grounds, that the offence of going without a light on a bicycle and the offence of defrauding a labourer of his wages&mdash;not paying him the full wage laid down by the Agricultural Wages Board&mdash;are on the same level?  Does not the Deputy realise that even on legal grounds there is a vast difference between cutting down a neighbour's tree and beating a neighbour up?  They are both offences, but they differ in degree, morally and legally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's sole reason is that the Agricultural Wages Board, as a result of the unanimous representations they have received from regional committees, <Col N="2302" /> have come to the decision that the period in which an agricultural labourer can sue should be limited to two years.  That is supported by Deputy Cogan, because the whole basis on which agricultural labourers' wages should be fixed is one of expediency and not to arrive at some measure of a fair wage or a wage which would meet the workers' needs and at the same time be consistent with the income of the farmer.  I think this is a very weak case and I am constrained to support Deputy Dillon's contention that there is a moral principle involved and, while it may not be possible to legislate to make people good, at any rate we ought not to legislate in such a way as to condone badness or defalcations or defrauding labourers of their rights.  So far as I can see, it is merely a question of facilitating the Agricultural Wages Board in administering the Act.</P>
    <P>I have heard time and again from the Labour and other benches that the Agricultural Wages Board is not satisfactory.  We are not going to improve the position by limiting the period within which labourers can sue for wages.  Irrespective of the moral principle involved, the period of the ordinary statute concerning recovery of debts is being considerably reduced. Even if the moral principle was not there, I think the period should not be reduced further than the statutory limitation of six years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the practical experience of the board that operated the Act for some years might be of some use to the House.  We should face up to this question in a realistic way, because as far as I can see there is no intention of defrauding any body of their rights.  I could understand the contention if there were men who did not know their rights, but I am well aware of the fact that every worker knows what agricultural wages he is entitled to.  He is only being compelled to look for his rights within two years, so that arrears will not be allowed to be built up over a long period.  That is simply what is being done here.  The board had good reasons for not allowing arrears to be <Col N="2303" /> built up.  It would be a bad example and would have a bad influence on employers in some districts if that were permitted.  It is right to compel a man, who knew his rights, but who agreed to work at a wage below what he was entitled, to take steps to do so within a certain period.  Why should it not be made obligatory on a workman to look for his rights within a specified period?</P>

Having regard to the experience of a board composed of employers and employees, we should accept their recommendations.  They gave sound reasons why this provision should be inserted.  I listened to the Minister's statement on the Second Reading, and I support the Bill, because I think this proposal a practical one.  We should not tolerate men, deliberately over a long period, building up arrears against poor, struggling farmers, if they fall for another proposal, or who may not be able to pay £2 a week.</P>

According to Deputy Hughes, Dáil Eireann should rush in <Col N="2304" /> in sympathy with him.  Let us look on the other side of the picture, the side which induced the British House of Commons to pass the whole code of Truck Acts.  Take the case where the farmer knows his duty, but does not like to pay £2 a week, and tells the man that he would be well off with 35/-</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy told us all about the poor struggling farmer who fell for such a proposition.  There is another picture, that of the labouring man with considerable family responsibilities who, when he looks for a job, is told that there are plenty of fellows who would be glad to take 35/- a week, and that if he does not take that he can go back on the dole.  That man takes the job at 35/- a week, and when he is asked why he did not assert his rights for the larger amount, he points out that there are plenty of good men idle in his part of the country and that on Saturday night, when his five children would ask him where was the 35/-, he would have to tell them that he had got the sack for asserting his rights.  If Deputy Hughes had to make a choice between asserting his rights in satisfaction for getting some weeks' arrears of wages, or of losing his job, what would he do?  Would he keep the job or would he assert his rights?  If I was a labouring man I would keep the job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing one could not be got.  Remember that there are often many more labourers than jobs.  At the end of two years, if the underpayments amounted to 2/- a week, the labourer could claim arrears under this Act amounting to £10.  At the end of 20 years of 2/- a week underpayment <Col N="2305" /> he can still only claim £10.  Deputy Hughes said: &ldquo;The devil mend him; why did he not claim it in time?&rdquo; The answer is that if he did so he would lose his job.  That was why the Truck Act was passed in England many years ago.  Up to that time labourers in England were compelled to take their wages in whatever form it was given to them by their employer.  When a labourer went to look for his wages, or his arrears of wages, the employer offered him 70 left-foot boots, and if the labourer refused to take them he was sacked, with the result that the vast majority of labourers in England were paid, very often, in left-foot boots.  If he asked his employer what he was to do with them or how he could sell them, the employer's answer was that he would buy them back from him at half the cost.</P>
      <P>That is what happened.  Where there was a contract between the employer and the employee requiring the employer to pay his employee £3 a week, the employer gave the employee 70 left-foot boots, knowing that he could not sell them, and the employer took them back from his employee at half the cost, which meant that instead of paying his employee £3 a week he was only paying him 30/- a week.  Up to the time that the Truck.  Act was passed, it was the case that no matter what happened between an employer and his employee, having undertaken to pay £3 a week, he actually only had to pay 30/- a week.  Up to the time that that law was passed and operated, an employer, whether he were the Lord Chief Justice or the smallest employer in the land, could give his employee, with whom he had contracted to pay £3 a week, 30/- by means of such devices, and the unfortunate employee was defrauded, by one means or another, of the other 30/- that were due to him.  According to Deputy Hughes, the whole object of this Bill is to prevent an effort being made to withhold from the employees part of the wages to which they are entitled&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that a maximum <Col N="2306" /> period should be left to the employee for recovering.  Surely, if the Agricultural Wages Board have an argument, they could put it up here.  The best argument put forward by the Minister is to allow the present system to go on, and to encourage the working man to take less wages.  If that argument prevailed, the Truck Act would never have been passed.  The kind of thing to which I have referred prevailed in England until the passing into law of the Truck Act, which was regarded as the charter of the workingman in England up to the time of the growth of the trade union movement to its present strength.  For the reasons I have given, this is a section to which I cannot assent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Will Deputy Dillon tell us why the British Parliament, for instance, found it necessary to pass Lord Tetterden's Act or why they found it necessary to put a limitation of six years on the collection of ordinary contract debts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Moran will read the debates on the Second Reading, he will find that we discussed that matter fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>We must have some limitation here, just as in the case of any other Acts.  Take the matter of the collection of ordinary debts&mdash;the case of a shop-keeper down through the country&mdash;there is a duty on him to issue a claim for his debt within a period of six years, and if he does not do so, he cannot recover that debt by law, and quite rightly.  There is that duty upon him, as the Deputy is well aware, to take action within a period of six years.  Let us take also the case of the Workmen's Compensation Act.  Under that Act a workingman must lodge his claim within six months, and the reason for that is that, if he does not do it within the prescribed period, he might prejudice the employer, and if he were allowed to leave it over for a number of years it might mean that he could completely ruin the employer.  In the same way, why should a workingman be allowed to sit down for a number of years and then bring an action against his employer <Col N="2307" />&mdash;a farmer, in this instance&mdash;and put him out of business as a result of that delay?  Deputy Dillon knows quite well that some limitation must be laid down in all these cases.  For instance, if somebody sits down on a man's land for a period of 12 years, he can take possession of the land.  That is the fault of the individual concerned, the owner who did not put him out within that time.  In this Bill, the workingman knows that he has a certain period within which to bring an action, and that it is his duty under the law to bring the action within that time.  You have similar limitations in connection with other Acts, not alone in this country but in other countries, and there is an obligation on the working man to bring his action within a specified time.  I think we should not allow such a man as Deputy Dillon is talking about to sit down, knowing his rights and knowing the amount of money that might accumulate after a certain number of years, and then make a claim on his employer&mdash;a claim that, possibly, the employer could not pay when the day of reckoning came, and which might mean his ruin.  There should be some restriction on this.  Whether it be for a period of one year, two years or six years, certainly there should be some restriction on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess that I have a certain amount of sympathy with the point of view expressed by Deputy Dillon in arguing the position of the worker in this particular matter.  If I saw anything in this particular section that was against the interests of the workingmen, I should certainly take Deputy Dillon's point of view and ask for its deletion, but the last speaker, Deputy Moran, has somewhat anticipated what I intended to say.  There is a limitation in the Act, to which Deputy Dillon referred, and there is also a limitation of time in connection with the Workmen's Compensation Acts, and the other Acts to which Deputy Moran referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is a limitation in the Truck Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, there is a limitation <Col N="2308" /> of time in connection with Acts dealing with shop-keepers' debts, for instance, and in other Acts.  I think it is six years.  It was fixed at six years because it suited all the people connected with the matter, in that particular case.  There is also a limitation of time in connection with certain insurance Acts, in the case of injuries. I think that in some cases you have to lodge a claim within three days, because, obviously, it would be difficult to prove the claim afterwards if some limit were not put upon the time for making an application.  In this particular case, I think that the limitation of two years was not put in without grave consideration, and I cannot see that the position of the labouring man is worsened at all by the insertion of a two years' limitation. Deputy Dillon spoke at length of the horrible position in which the working man might be put by the rapacious and greedy farmer bamboozling him into accepting a lower wage, and alleged that the working man is prevented by the operation of this section from claiming his rights.  Now, we all agree that the law is contravened in many respects both in this country and in many other countries.  In this particular case, the law is violated by different people occasionally, sometimes severely and sometimes very trivially.  I doubt if there is any Deputy in this House who is not aware that in certain circumstances there are what you might call compassionate cases, such as where a man is delicate or temporarily disabled, and not able to do full work.  That man may happen to be employed by a sympathetic farmer, and there may be an agreement between the farmer and himself that the labourer will work at a lesser wage than an ordinary able-bodied man would get.  Now, both of them deliberately contravene the law. The farmer knows that he is giving less than the recognised wage, and the wage-earner knows full well that he is accepting that lower wage owing to the peculiar circumstances.  There is a two years' limit which would cover that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the difficulty would be to extend that to three, four or five years, because it might be very difficult to prove the case after such a lapse of time.  Perhaps I might be permitted to take the case of Deputy Dillon himself who, unfortunately, was afflicted with a lame ankle a few months ago.  Compassionately, I engage Deputy Dillon.  Deputy Dillon agrees with me that he is not a fully competent man, able to work a ten or twelve hour day.  He says that he is not worth the minimum wage and that he will work for £1 a week and his &ldquo;grub.&rdquo;  We are giving Deputy Dillon two years in which to prove that.  We do not want to give him more, for the reason that his leg would be healed before two years and it would be very difficult for me to prove that Deputy Dillon was not capable of working a full day at the time of his engagement. That is one aspect of the case.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, those infringements of the law are carried out by the connivance of both parties.  There may be occasions when the labourer is forced into acceptance of a low wage but I do not believe that that is general.  If there is any breach of the Wages Order, I believe it is with the consent of both parties.  Both the employer and the labourer know that they are breaking the law and do it with their eyes open, in circumstances which suit both of them.  There will always be cases of an old lady or an old man employing a person who is on the point of passing out at a lower wage than the minimum wage.  If a longer period were allowed than two years, a claim might be brought for six years' arrears of the balance of the legal wage at a time when the unfortunate people would not be able to meet it.  I think that it is better that the section should stand inasmuch as it seeks to do justice between both parties.  The labourer is not wronged by the section.  If he thinks he has suffered injustice, he has two years in which to get a decision in his favour. I do not think that there is anything more wrong in fixing two years as the limit than there is in fixing the limit under the Workmen's Compensation Act or in general commercial practice.</P>

      <P>They are much better than were the tyrannical employers of England in the early 19th century when these Truck Acts were found necessary.  The &ldquo;Mother of Parliaments&rdquo; did not consider it necessary to put them into operation here.  I cannot see what injustice is being done by this Bill.  I do not think that any member of the House&mdash;even Deputy Dillon, who has a kink and thinks that he is a greater moralist than any other Deputy&mdash;believes that any injustice is being done to the agricultural worker under this section.  It is just a warning to agricultural workers that, if they are employed at less than the minimum wage, they must claim for the legal wage within two years; otherwise, they will not get more than two years' arrears.  Under the Children's Allowances Act, if a person does not claim within three months, the amount to which he is entitled is forfeited to the State.  A tyrannical State refuses to pay a widow with perhaps seven or ten children the allowance if she does not claim her rights within three months.  That law was set out by the Dáil within the past year, and I did not hear Deputy Dillon telling the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Finance that he was proposing to act callously towards a widow with seven or ten children.  A number of people came to me and stated that, because they had not claimed the allowance within the <Col N="2311" /> specified period, they could not obtain it.  There was no redress for them. This section warns the agricultural worker who is receiving less than the minimum wage that he cannot continue to work for the reduced wage for longer than two years and hope to recover the whole of the arrears.  No member of the House would do injustice to any agricultural worker, and Deputy Dillon knows that very well. Deputy Bennett mentioned an example to show that a claim could be made against a widow for arrears of the agricultural wage after a long period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, immediately after she becomes a widow.  The agricultural labourer might have been working for her husband for ten years at less than the legal rate of wages and his claim against the estate might be so large that it would not be able to bear it.  All farmers are not so affluent as Deputy Dillon.  Their farms are not so large as his.  Five years' arrears of 10/- a week might, in some cases, be more than a farm would be worth.  Greater injustice might in that way be done to the farmer than would otherwise be done to the labourer.</P>

      <P>One aspect of this question has not been touched upon though the matter has been exhaustively debated&mdash;the difficulty of procuring evidence after a long number of years. The wage agreement between a farm worker and a farmer is usually a verbal agreement.  It might happen that a farmer would employ a worker for six years.  For three or four years, he might pay him below the minimum wage and then, realising that he was violating the law, he might raise the wage to the legal amount.  After a further couple of years, the man might leave his employment and proceed to claim the arrears due him in respect of the first three or four years of his employment. The whole question might turn on the date on which the agreement was entered into and the date on which the man's wages were raised to the proper level.  As the farmer does not keep books in the same way as the business man or industrialist, it <Col N="2312" /> would be impossible for the court, after such a lapse of time, fairly to decide between the employer and the worker.</P>

It would be very hard for the court to decide what would be fair in that case.  The court would probably come to a decision in favour of the worker.  It might or it might not, but, at any rate, in the interests of justice it would be unfair even to the court to have to take on the job of deciding a case of that kind which occured four or five years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a very long debate on this point.  I do not say the time has been ill-spent, because it is a very important point, but, listening to the debate, it occurs to me that it reduces itself to this: You have two people involved in a case, the employer and the employee.  Who is likely to be the more wronged in leaving the law as it is, or in making this change?  I must admit that the cases that come before me are cases where the employer is at a great disadvantage, if not labouring under a great injustice, as the law stands.  The employee, anyway, has two years to make up his mind to get out and make a claim, or he can make the claim if he likes without getting out.  After all, I do not think there is any great injustice in his case.  He has two years to make his claim and to get any arrears of wages that are due.  Deputy Dillon has another kind of case in mind, I think&mdash;perhaps the ordinary case of a labourer going to work for a farmer, and they agree on a wage somewhat lower than the minimum wage, perhaps by 2/- or 3/- a week.  I shall give two or three cases from a number which I have before me.  I find that, first of all, you can divide employees into two categories, the first being where the employee is mentally or physically incapacitated.  Such employees are covered by Section 5. There are then those who are not <Col N="2313" /> either mentally or physically incapacitated, and they again fall roughly into two categories.  That is where the trouble arises.  In the first category you have the case where the employee is related to the employer, and in the second category the case where an employee is working for an employer who is not altogether a farmer.  We have many cases in these two categories. Deputy Bennett had something to say about the case of the widow, but I should like to tell Deputies a very pitiable story of a widower.  The widower, who was a small farmer with 40 acres, found himself with nobody in the house.  A relative came along, and he asked him to come to work for him.  As far as I can learn, neither of them worked very hard, and the employee was not very well paid.  They fell out after five or six years, and then the employee put in a claim for £343.  We all know of cases of that kind.  What really happened was that the widower said to his relative: &ldquo;I am very lonely; come along and live with me.&rdquo;  Things went grand for about six years.</P>

      <P>We have a number of cases of that kind in which relatives give a lot of trouble.  I do not see how you can cover them very well.  Another case was that in which a lady had 10 or 11 acres and a shop&mdash;I think a publichouse. I have always noticed that men in the country are prepared to work for a lower wage for a publican than for anybody else; I suppose they have what they call &ldquo;chance&rdquo;.  Anyway, they are prepared to work for a lower wage.  In this case, the employee again worked four or five years and then he put in a claim for £227.  The question there was whether he was an agricultural worker or not, because he had been working in the shop as well. In that particular case it was decided that he was an agricultural worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Although he worked in the shop?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He worked in both places as a matter of fact.  As the Act stands, if an employee does agricultural work to any extent, I think the court would have to come to a decision that he is an agricultural worker.  There again that man was quite happy to take a lower wage as long as things went well.  The third case I need not go into, because it is the same as the second.  Again it was the case of a person with a small holding of land&mdash; seven acres&mdash;and a shop and the claim was for £250.  We are not really dealing with the type of case that Deputy Hughes and Deputy Dillon had in mind.  We are, of course, covering such cases but these cases do not arise to the same extent as the type of case I have mentioned&mdash;the case of the man working with a relative and the case of the man working with a small farmer who has also a shop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the types of cases which cause a great deal of trouble, firstly, on the question as to whether it was agricultural work, and, secondly, whether there was a proper contract of <Col N="2315" /> service or some other consideration involved. If these cases are decided in the employee's favour, it has the effect of ruining the employer.  The employee absolutely ruins the employer if he wins on the first two points.  I think Deputies will agree that it is rather hard luck on the employer, in such cases.  I think if we give the employee two years' arrears, he will come out of it fairly well.  Such cases, I am afraid, cannot be covered in any other way. We did try to frame other legislation but we found it was a hopeless job and we had to give it up.  We thought the fairest thing on the whole was to adopt the recommendation of the Agricultural Wages Board, except, as I explained, that we modified it from one year to two years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that the case we are trying to cover is very different from the cases we first had put forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The real dilemma which the Minister now represents himself as being in, is that the interpretation of the Act by the courts tends to be somewhat uncertain and that the real hardship arises in cases where there was a genuine misunderstanding as to the true nature of the employment. You have fellows taking speculative actions to try to get themselves declared as having been agricultural labourers, whereas the commonsense view is that they were handy men about a shop.  I see that there is a difficulty there but that could have been met in another way, by giving the court a wider discretion to determine whether in fact a man was or was not an agricultural labourer and not by laying down that if a man did any substantial amount of agricultural labour, he was therefore deemed to be an agricultural labourer for the purposes of the Act.  The cases mentioned by Deputy Moran bear no relation to the position, because, so far as the contract debt is concerned, the shopkeeper need not give credit, if he does not want to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another story. The Deputy says that the labourer can work for somebody else, but that is just the difference.  Suppose he cannot? That is the whole kernel of the problem. Circumstances are sometimes such that he must work for that man or work for nobody at all, and that is why you get cases in which an employer can get a man to work for him for less than the employee is entitled to get. We must bear in mind that we are dealing with a microscopic minority of employers. Ninety-nine per cent. of the farmers pay their labourers wages honestly and fairly and I think 99 per cent. of the labourers deal honestly and fairly with their employers; but there is a microscopic minority of unscrupulous employers, as there is a microscopic minority of unscrupulous employees, and this whole code of legislation was designed to deal with them.</P>
      <P>If there was never a minimum wage law, I believe that the vast majority of farmers would pay their labourers a fair wage, but the whole purpose of a minimum wage law is to provide against the individual who would not pay it if he could get out of paying it. We must keep present to our minds the fact that we are not legislating for the average farmer, but for the farmers who require legislation of this kind, and they are a very small minority.  I see at once that there is a difficulty when the Minister quotes these cases, but I think that difficulty is to be met by giving the court wide discretion in the matter of determining, according to common sense, whether a man was or was not employed as an agricultural labourer.</P>

      <P>Very well; why not join with me?  I will give the Deputy a chance to join with me in making them pay.  I am trying to show the Deputy that a situation can obtain in parts of the country which he does not fully understand.  In that set-up which I describe, you may get somebody who will employ a fellow behind the bar&mdash; tapping barrels and carrying sacks&mdash; and at farm work, such as milking the cow.</P>

That is the position.  You may get cases of such men trying to prove that they are agricultural labourers, and in such cases let the court decide whether they were or not, and not put on the court the obligation to deem them agricultural labourers if they did any substantial amount of agricultural work and not deprive the really aggrieved agricultural labourer of the remedy he ought to have and the only effective remedy we can possibly give him, of extracting from the unscrupulous employer, the very small minority, the wages to which he is entitled.  I will not say any more about it, but I am going to ask for a division on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>When trying to convince Deputy Dillon, I imagined certain <Col N="2318" /> cases which I suggested would justify the retention of this section.  I will now quote a fact.  I know of a widow&mdash;fortunately in good circumstances&mdash;who employed three workmen within the last five years, believing she was paying them the full wages. One day the inspector called to her place and interviewed the men, who told him they were all satisfied and had no complaints to make.  The thought occured to the lady that she should interview the inspector herself. She did so, and to her amazement discovered that while she was paying one man nearly the correct wage, she was paying a second man £33 a year more than the proper wage, and the third man £29 a year too little.  He had been in her employment for about two and a half years and she had been paying him the wages he had asked for and which she understood were the right wages.</P>
      <P>This man could go back over the years and recover a sum of money from her.  She went immediately to the man and handed him something over £40.  He did not want to take it, but she said that he would have to take it.  To that lady, in very good circumstances, £40 did not mean very much, but one of the widows whom I imagined when I was speaking might have been involved, and to her £29 would mean a great lot.  In that particular case, the mistake might not have been discovered for a number of years and we might have a position in which the representatives of this lady might be responsible for this amount for a number of years beyond the two-year period.  The Minister's section in all the circumstances should be allowed to stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by the Minister, that there might be a difficulty in deciding whether a man was engaged in farm work or not, that difficulty would be aggravated by the extension of the period beyond two years, because it would be very difficult to go back over the years and decide what kind of work a man was doing.  Another point has emerged from the debate, and it is that the wealthy publican in a rural or urban area is not subject to any minimum <Col N="2319" /> wage, while the struggling farmer is compelled to pay a minimum wage.  That may shake Deputy Dillon on his high moral horse.</P>

    <P>I cannot see any reason why the Minister should have power to lease any part of the stud farm to anyone other than the people who are going to control and operate the national stud.  I wonder would the Minister give any reason as to why he is taking that particular power?  I might say that if at the moment there is a lease, or any part of the land let on the 11-months' system, that will hold until the contract expires, but once the present contract expires I do not see why the Minister should have any further power to lease any part of the national stud farm to anybody other than the company.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether legally it could be covered as easily as Deputy Hughes has suggested in his concluding remarks. That is the difficulty we have at the moment.  First of all, generally speaking, there is provision in Section 29 of the Act for winding up the company. In that case, I suppose we will have to lease to somebody else.  I admit that in that case we may come to the Dáil again for further legislation; so I do not want to make a strong point of that.  The other point is that, as I mentioned on the Second Reading of the Bill, there is a man who occupies a small part of the estate, at a rent of £4 10s. per annum.  He had rented this part from the British Government before we got possession. He is an old employee.  There is also a second employee who has a cottage.  I am not clear as to the legal position yet&mdash;I have not been advised &mdash;but I think it is possible that in making the lease to the company we may have to exempt these.  If possible, I would lease the whole lot to the company and let those people become tenants of the company.</P>

      <P>I moved amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), before paragraph (d), to insert the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2323" />&ldquo;the Articles shall provide that for the purposes of constituting the company, the Bloodstock Breeders' and Horse Owners' Association of Ireland shall select and provide a panel of 12 persons who are in the opinion of the Association persons suitable to act as directors of the company and appointments to the Board shall only be made from this panel.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of filling any vacancy or vacancies that may arise from time to time the Association shall submit a panel of three names for each such vacancy and the responsible Minister shall select a person or persons from the panel to fill such vacancy or vacancies.</P>
    <P>It is our anxiety to ensure that the people who are going to benefit from this national stud will take some active share in its control and operation, and will accept some responsibility at all events for the direction of the company. We feel that the democratic way of doing it is that those people should get the opportunity of helping the Minister to constitute the board.  In this amendment we suggest that the Bloodstock Breeders' and Horse Owners' Association of Ireland should provide a panel of 12 persons who in their opinion are suitable to act as directors of the company, and that the board shall be appointed by the Minister from that panel.  I feel that that will give this very important association a direct interest in the matter.  It will give them an opportunity of selecting the best material possible, while providing the Minister with a substantial number from which to pick his board, whether it is three or five.  I think it is most desirable that people who are conversant with and engaged in horse breeding, and who know the qualifications necessary for the proper conduct of this stud, should be given that opportunity.  They feel that they should have a hand in the selection of the board.  In addition, they may select some people about whom the Minister and his advisers may not have heard.  I have no doubt that there will be found on the panel very useful material so far as the constitution of <Col N="2324" /> the board is concerned.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>

I think the Minister agrees that this association is one which has done a lot of good work both from the point of view of providing a complete roll of all the people engaged in the bloodstock trade and from the point of view of assisting bloodstock owners and breeders when selling horses both here and abroad.  The association facilities foreign buyers, who come over here, in getting in touch with the various breeders.  If they want a particular type of animal or want information about a breeder or his stock, they are able to procure that information from the Bloodstock Breeders' Association. In fact, I read at least one foreword to the Bloodstock Breeders' Report signed by the Minister.  I think he signed a couple of others, but the report they brought out last year was very full, and in every way a most creditable production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I do not want to advert to the objections which we raised on the Second Stage concerning the type of company envisaged in the Bill, I think the Minister should give us some indication&mdash;so far he has not done so&mdash;of the type of people he has in mind for the Board.  I think, on a Bill of this kind, we ought to get some such indication. At any rate, I think the Minister should say that a representative association, such as the Bloodstock Breeders' Association, will be consulted.  Practically all bloodstock breeders are members of it.  If all of them are not members, the vast majority are, and there is no reason why they should not all be members. It is not an association which has any axe to grind, or which operates specifically for one area of the country. There is also, I believe, a west of Ireland or south and west of Ireland bloodstock breeders' or horse owners' association, and if this amendment does not cover them it will be easy to redraft it for that purpose.  In the case of a Bill of this kind, the prime consideration is to procure suitable personnel to administer the affairs of the company.  As far as I can see, you <Col N="2325" /> could not get any more suitable personnel than is to be found among the members of that association.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave said that I did not give any indication of who the members of the board might be, or of what type of members it might be composed.  Deputies know from the Bill that it is the Minister for Finance who appoints the directors, after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture.  I have not discussed the matter with the Minister for Finance, but I am quite sure he will agree with me that the board should be composed of men who know everything that is to be known about the breeding of thoroughbreds.  That is the business that will have to be done in that particular place.  It is another thing, however, to say that in appointing members to the board we must take recommendations from the Bloodstock Breeders' and Horse Owners' Association.  Deputy Cosgrave was quite right in saying that I have every admiration for the work done by the members of that association. The principle that has been followed so far, where a Minister has the appointment of directors of a board of this kind, is that he must have the best and the widest possible choice. If we were to agree to this amendment and if, by any chance, both the Minister for Finance and myself came to the conclusion that one particular man was one of the best men in the country to be appointed on the board, and suppose he was not on the list sent up by this association, well, we would be very disappointed.  If things did not go well, we probably might think that if our particular nominee had been on the board things would be much better.  I think that the Minister should have the widest possible choice.  I do not think it would be right to limit his choice by making him take members from any particular panel or organisation.  The same sort of argument could be put up in regard to many other Bills that come before the House.  You have associations of different kinds, and yet we do not limit the Minister's choice in such matters.  You had a similar provision in Bills dealing with the <Col N="2326" /> Electricity Supply Board and with the Central Bank.  The bankers sent up a panel in regard to the appointment of certain members on the Bank Board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The bankers did that, I suppose, because they were a little bit apprehensive that the board of the Central Bank, which would have so much dealings with them, might be composed of men who were altogether hostile.  In the case of this Bill I do not think anybody could possibly claim that you are going to have a board set up that will be hostile in any way to this particular association, to its interests or to private interests either, because it will be put there for the purpose for which this association is in existence, namely, to help horse breeding and especially the breeding of thoroughbreds.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not suggesting that the board would be hostile to horse breeding.  It would be ridiculous to suggest that.  What we are claiming is that, without this amendment, the association will not get the type of representation that it otherwise would get.  After all, the association embraces the vast majority of horse breeders in the country, and we suggest that this is the democratic way of appointing members to the board.  The board will have control of the national stud, whose object is to serve the horse breeders of the country.  In view of that we think it is reasonable that the association should have some say in the selection and control of the board.  We want to limit the Minister's power to select members for the board.  We have no guarantee as to where he is going to draw his material from.  It may be that some of his material would not be representative at all, and that all the members of the board might be drawn from an area close to the city here&mdash; from the Curragh and the County Kildare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2327" /> I would remind the Minister that horse breeding is a very extensive and very important branch of agriculture, and that the majority of the members of the Horse-breeders' Association come from the horse-breeding counties in the south.  I think it is unreasonable for him to suggest that the Minister for Finance should have the widest possible choice.  This association has a very large membership, and is in a much better position to select material for the board than the Minister for Finance.  What does he know about the personnel that is available throughout the country?  I think that on the Second Reading of the Bill the Minister himself admitted that the Minister for Finance will possibly have to rely, to a very great extent, on the Civil Service for advice as to the personnel. Where you have a fine organisation like this representing the particular interests that are involved, why should you not make use of it, and say to the members of it: &ldquo;Give me the material that you think is suitable for the board that is going to control the national stud, which, I hope, will be of great benefit to the horse-breeding industry that you are engaged in; I want you to give me the very best material.  Give me a panel from which I can select directors&rdquo;?  That, surely, would be the democratic way of doing it.  If we want to get away from that principle, and if we give the Minister absolute power to make his own selection, then we are only giving lip service to democracy.  The Minister for Finance will have a very wide choice if he uses an organisation such as this in making his selections.  We are not suggesting that the Minister should be confined to the number that he would select from the panel sent up by the association.  He can pick a certain number from the panel.  I think that if the Minister wants to do this thing properly he should make use of an efficient organisation such as this.  Its business is to look after the interests of a large body of horse-breeders.  It has the machinery there, and that ought to be availed of in the setting up of a board of this kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in his argument against this type of representation <Col N="2328" /> on the board, referred to the example of the Electricity Supply Board which, of course, is totally different from the board that we are speaking of now.  The members of the Electricity Supply Board have a very technical job to do.  Only a small number of people in the country know anything about electrical development or kindred activities.</P>
      <P>There is really no analogy between it and the horse-breeding industry, in which there is a large number of bloodstock breeders and bloodstock owners who have a full knowledge of every aspect of this question.  I can give the Minister a case which is more or less analogous, that is the recently established Racing Board, where the directors were taken, and had to be taken under the Act, from the Turf Club or from the National Hunt Steeplechase Committee.  In that way the Minister for Finance bound himself to the personnel, if not to the nominees, of the Turf Club and the National Hunt Steeplechase Committee. Not alone did he bind himself, but he ensured that they would have a majority of one on the board.  I think if there is any case at all to be made for consulting interests in establishing boards of this kind, this is a case where it may be made strongly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says he has no doubt that the Minister for Finance will act on good information and on the best advice.  It is not unreasonable to ask, what advice is he going to get or who has he that will advise him as to the most suitable personnel for a board of this kind other than the Minister for Agriculture and, while the Minister's advice may be good, will it be better or even as good as the advice or recommendations of the Bloodstock Breeders' Association?  If there is not a case to make for selecting the entire board from the Bloodstock Breeders' Association, at any rate they should be guaranteed one representative on it.  Will the Minister meet us in that respect?  I certainly strongly put forward the case that an association of this kind, which is concerned with every aspect of bloodstock breeding and which draws its members from both large and small owners from all parts of the country, and which is representing <Col N="2329" /> their interests adequately so far as is possible in the short time they have been working, should be consulted and should be given some representation.</P>

He is invited to Newmarket every month in his capacity as veterinary surgeon and as a great consultant on breeding.  I do not know if this man would like to serve on the board or not.  I will give the Minister his name in confidence. Within five miles of where I live we bred three Grand National winners.</P>

      <P>I say that if the majority of the Dáil say it, it is democracy, and that is all right.  It can be argued, of course, that the circumstances in the Electricity Supply Board are different from the national stud.  Naturally, because electricity is different from horses.  But, whatever example one may give, the same thing <Col N="2331" /> may be said.  The Racing Board, for instance, was quoted by somebody else. Perhaps the Racing Board is analogous in some ways and, under that Act, the Minister had to appoint six members of the Turf Club and the National Hunt Steeplechase Committee, but he was not bound to accept any panel from these particular organisations.  He had to appoint members of these organisations. The reason for that was fairly obvious.  Just as I mentioned before about the Central Bank, the business was interlocked.  This Racing Board was taking over certain executive functions, if you like, in racecourses and the whole government of racecourses. It was quite obvious that there should be a certain amount of co-ordination between the old bodies and the new and it was laid down, therefore, that there should be certain members from these organisations.</P>
      <P>I think this is quite a different case. I do not think the Minister should be limited in his choice.  On the other hand, from what I know of the membership of that particular association, I think it would be difficult for the Minister to avoid taking members of it, even if he tried, because practically every breeder in the country and every authority on thoroughbred horse breeding is a member of that association. That is as far as I know.  At the same time, I do not think we should be limited in our choice.  Very awkward positions might arise, if there was any misunderstanding as between the association and the directors of this company. For instance, if this association were dissatisfied with the way things were going it might be possible that they would expel the directors of this company from their association, and make it impossible to carry on. Therefore, I think the Bill should be left as it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that the Blood-stock Breeders' Association is very representative and that there is a possibility that their members would be selected as members of this board, apart from the association altogether, but I had in mind that, it being such an important body, it should be represented <Col N="2332" /> on the national stud board. That is the point I wanted to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows my views on the constitution of this body. The Minister's idea is that we should set up an autonomous body not responsible to this House for any of its actions and that is the issue between us.  We are very vigorously opposed to the idea of an autonomous body to deal with State property and particularly with the national stud.  The Vocational Commission has already condemned very vigorously&mdash;as did the Banking Commission before that&mdash;the constitution of autonomous bodies to control the national property and not responsible to this House or to the Comptroller and Auditor-General and the Committee of Public Accounts for the expenditure of State funds.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the condemnation of those two commissions set up by the Government, we have the worst example of all of the application of this principle of a State company in this particular case.  One may talk about the Electricity Supply Board and the Turf Board, but none of them is so wide open to corruption as this company may be thrown open.  The operations of the company will be cloaked and no Deputy will be able to raise a matter by way of Parliamentary Question or motion.  The Electricity Supply Board generates and supplies current to everyone, and there is no great danger of corruption there, but in this case we are setting up a national stud board which will provide sires for selected mares all over the country.  This company has to make the selection on the basis of a mare having won three or four races, but even so, it will be making a selection between three or four neighbours. It possibly will be releasing stud fillies for racing purposes, to return to the stud for breeding purposes, and they may select fillies to lease to sire horses in any part of the country. Whether we approve or disapprove of the action of the company, we get no opportunity, the moment this board is set up, to question the policy, the efficiency or the honesty of the company.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>But I do not know whether the Minister is going to accept those amendments or not.  In various amendments set down here to this Bill, we have tried to ensure that the national stud will be operated honestly and efficiently.  I represent an important horse-breeding constituency&mdash; County Kildare.  When we talk about corruption we must not forget that horse racing is very often associated with that word.  That is all the more reason why we should be particularly careful to eliminate corruption, wirepulling and political influence as far as it is humanly possible to do so in connection with this company.  I say, emphatically, that if the Minister sticks to his proposals, he is leaving this company wide open to the worst possible form of corruption, and it is inevitable that corruption will occur,</P>
      <P>The Minister has not told us what is wrong in asking the representative organisation that is there to put up to the Minister for Finance or himself a panel from which the board will be selected.  Why should the board be hand-picked by the Minister for Finance, who knows nothing about the material available in the country for the personnel of the national stud board?  Surely the proper procedure is to ask an organisation that is truly representative of the horse-breeding interests to put up a panel to the responsible Minister and let him pick the board?  There is no use in talking about analogies between this board and the Electricity Supply Board, as there is no analogy whatever between the operations of the two boards.  I warn the Minister to be particularly careful, if he is to avoid corruption in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister realises the outcry that attended the operations of this stud when it was run by the British.  They had a habit of leasing fillies&mdash;particularly fillies, because they sold the colts&mdash;to one particular owner.  The owner died subsequently and there was very considerable fuss and a good deal of dissatisfaction, which they got out of by leasing <Col N="2334" /> the horses afterwards to the King. They had that easy way out of it, but we have no easy way to silence criticism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That would hardly have the same effect as in the other case.  That is an indication to the Minister of the possibility of corruption. This stud was run, according to public opinion at the time, quite efficiently and honestly, and it was only when they discovered the manner in which the leases were made and the way in which the whole business was run that they realised what was going on.</P>
      <P>The Minister argues that the board is solely concerned with running the stud, whereas the other boards he mentioned had interests affected, they being other banks in the case of the Central Bank.  That was the very reason why the members of the Racing Board were drawn from the Turf Club and from the National Hunt Stewards &mdash;in order that they would have adequate representation.  The Minister asks what would happen if the association differed with the company, if it would force him to scrap the whole business.  What happens if the Racing Board disagrees with the Turf Club? Can the Turf Club refuse to allow the Racing Board to continue?  If there is representation from the associated banks, in the case of the Central Bank, because their interests are affected, there is a stronger case here, as you have rival concerns competing with private individuals.  Surely, if these people are affected by the operation of this company they should not be forced into less favourable circumstances, but should have the right to representation on the board.</P>

      <P>What is the necessity for the amendment?  We do not know in what way that organisation, which is a new organisation, may turn out in three or four years' time.  Deputy Hughes has talked about the necessity for honesty and straight dealing and I quite agree with him, but I do not think this amendment will give any more assurance on that point.  It will be quite possible to get four or five honest men who know a good deal about horse racing and breeding.  The Deputy will realise that and admit that it is one of the big considerations the Minister will have in mind in appointing the board.  The Minister will try to get men who will not be influenced by bribery or anything of that kind, but who will be straight and honest with horse breeders in general.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am altogether in sympathy with the movers of the amendment, from my own point of view I can see one fault in it.  I believe that when the Minister comes to select the board it will be almost impossible to constitute it without selecting someone from the Bloodstock Breeders' and Horseowners' Association of Ireland. I cannot see that he can select the board without having some members of that association on it.  To that extent he will have to meet, in part, the wishes of Deputy Hughes and Deputy Cosgrave and, indeed, all of us who sit on these benches.  However, in the drafting of the amendment I feel they drafted it too conservatively.  As the amendment stands, it would be tantamount to handing over control of the board to the Bloodstock Breeders' and Horseowners' Association.  That may be a good thing or it may not.  If the Minister had originally proposed that the company was to be handed over to the Bloodstock Breeders' and Horse-owners' Association, probably there would have been a controversy about it and it might have been argued that it would have been better to have an open board than a board consisting of members of any existing body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the one danger I see in the amendment and I would like Deputy Hughes and Deputy Cosgrave to see if they could not arrange a wider amendment.  This present amendment <Col N="2336" /> would be tantamount to giving the Bloodstock Breeders' and Horse-owners' Association complete control of the company, because the Minister would have no option but to select persons suggested by them.  There may be people outside this body who are very competent in this particular direction of bloodstock breeding and other activities.  While I am in entire sympathy with the views expressed by Deputy Hughes and Deputy Cosgrave, that this body should have a say in the matter, I should like them to consider the point to which I have referred.  It would be impossible for the Minister to omit asking representatives of this body to be members of the board when he is picking the directors; it would be imperative on him to select some of them.  I think he should have power to select persons from outside.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 4, which, in the form in which it is drafted, would impose a charge on public funds, is out of order.  Deputy <Col N="2337" /> Hughes has, however, submitted a redraft which is acceptable and which he will read to the House.  Amendments Nos. 5, 6 and 7 gave me food for considerable thought.  The intention of the Bill is to from a State-sponsored company which is to be largely autonomous in regard to its activities within its statutory functions.  Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 are designed to make the company subject to the control of the Minister who will, in turn, be answerable to Parliament for the company's activities.  A very important technical point of order arises for consideration, namely, whether the autonomy of the company is not a major principle which should be deemed to have been affirmed on the Second Reading and, if so deemed, whether those amendments are not inadmissible.  There is much to be said in favour of that point of view.  Against that, however, the Bill provides that all the directors of the company are appointed by and removable by the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, so that factually, if not specifically, those Ministers will be in a position to exert influence over the company's activities.</P>
      <P>I incline to the view that amendments seeking to make the Minister for Agriculture responsible to the Oireachtas for the policy of the company are in order, and, while I am dubious about amendments making the Minister responsible to the Oireachtas for the conduct of the company's affairs, if that should imply responsibility for the details of administration, I have decided rather reluctantly to admit those amendments, fully conscious of the fact that my present action may be cited against me on future occasions.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 not moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4A:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), to delete paragraph (d), and substitute therefor the following new paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;the said Articles shall provide that the chairman and other directors of the company shall be remunerated only to the extent of actual out of pocket expenses <Col N="2338" /> incurred by them in connection with the business of the company.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I take it that in the ordinary way this company will employ a manager and to a very great extent the responsibility of running the national stud will rest on his shoulders.  He will have to be a man fully qualified for that position and the board will meet occasionally to supervise his work and see that the national stud is properly and efficiently, run&mdash;run according to their ideas&mdash;and that their policy is operated and applied.  For that reason, I feel&mdash;rather, Deputy Cosgrave and I feel&mdash;that there is no necessity to have on the board directors who are paid a salary, or directors' fees.  I think there are sufficient public-spirited men in this country who are most anxious to give service on a board of this sort and who are keenly interested in the live-stock or the bloodstock industries. They are men experienced in every possible way.  I suggest that the very best material will be got on a voluntary basis.  Men who are prepared to serve on a voluntary basis will give the best service.  It is for that reason we put down this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument put up by Deputy Hughes could equally well apply to other companies.  Undoubtedly the person who is prepared to serve for love rather than for pay is likely to be the best person.  The same applies to every public company.  I do not see why an exception should be made in the case of this company to the position in other State owned companies. In all State companies the directors are paid, except in the case of the Racing Board, the members of which are not paid.  In companies managing ordinary businesses like the beet company and other companies the directors are paid.  I do not see why we should make an exception here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument used by Deputy Hughes could be used to the effect that no directors of any of these companies should get fees.  I think that would be unfair.  There will be a good deal of work in this company, even outside meetings of the board of directors, because directors of this stud will have to keep themselves well informed with regard to horses, form, <Col N="2339" /> and the breeding industry.  If they do their business well I take it that they will do a good deal of reading in reference to horse breeding generally, and there will be other work, possibly visiting places where certain mares may be under discussion to see whether they should get nominations. There is just as good a case for the payment of directors in this company as for the payment of directors on other boards.  I think it would be very unfair to have a provision such as is suggested by the amendment in the Bill.  I have not considered the matter, but the likely time and labour that will be involved in becoming a member of the board has to be considered. We must also keep in mind the fact that it is a comparatively small concern, and that the total amount that will be paid as directors' fees will be small.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 13 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is the most important section in the Bill, as the running of the stud will depend on the articles of association.  It occurred to me to put in an amendment to this section, but as it would be difficult to deal with it, I prefer to raise the matter now, and to draw the Minister's attention to it.  The desire of the majority of Deputies is that the national stud should be run on lines that would be of greatest benefit to small breeders.  Every step that can be taken in that direction should be taken, and the best way to do that would be for the Minister to insert in the articles of association something which would make it imperative on the board to give paramount consideration to the claims of small breeders.  I am perfectly satisfied to leave it to the discretion of the Minister, if he assures the House that he will see that a provision is inserted making it obligatory on the directors of the company to give foremost consideration to small breeders.  It might be something on lines that I suggested on the Second Reading, that the majority, or whatever proportion the Minister wishes, of <Col N="2340" /> the nominations for particular sires would be allotted to small breeders, and provision made for the retention of fillies reared in the stud for transfer amongst small breeders.  I will be satisfied if the Minister will make provision of some sort making it obligatory on the company to look on the stud as being instituted by this House to help small rather than rich breeders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When that matter arose, I had no hesitation in saying that, in the direction to be given to the company, special consideration will be given to small breeders.  I am not yet in a position to say in what way we can do that.  Deputy Bennett suggested that the majority of the nominations for the best stallions should be given to small breeders.  That might be a dangerous regulation, because, as I mentioned on the Second Reading, we might find ourselves in the position that more than half should be given large breeders who get better value and better foals.  Generally, I can assure the House that special consideration should be given the small breeders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer that it should be considered from another viewpoint, that the stud should be made pay.  It might not be possible to make it pay with small breeders.  As to the suggestion that the fees will be high, I am satisfied that the Minister will safeguard the position, so that rich breeders who get nominations will pay the fees that the services of the sire would command in the open market.  It is my opinion that rich breeders, in so far as they <Col N="2341" /> get nominations, should at least pay the fees that they would pay for similar sires in ordinary circumstances, and, in fact, would make some return to the State for the money expended and the loss incurred because of the fees charged to small breeders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>While everybody realises that both large and small owners are necessary for blood-stock breeding, many breeders with large capital have combined into syndicates and own first-class horses.  There may be two or three large syndicates, and they allot amongst themselves whatever number of mares they want for a sire, and, as a <i>quid pro quo</i>, grant to another syndicate whatever facilities they are offering for the remaining services.</P>
      <P>Now, the small stud owners can never compete with them.  While they might be able to compete, or might be willing to sacrifice the actual expenditure, they are not able to get a nomination because, first of all, they are limited by the number they have for themselves, and then they give the others to a syndicate or to a number of large breeders.  For that reason, I think the Minister should give protection to the small breeders.  It is not entirely a monetary question, although the matter of finance enters into it, but there is the question of getting inside the syndicate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the section, the company is responsible only for its activities.  Now, while that word, possibly, may cover the words that we have put in in the amendments, we suggest that the company should be responsible to the Minister for its policy, activities and decisions and for <Col N="2343" /> the proper and efficient conduct of its business, and the final amendment, No. 7, says that the Minister shall at all times be responsible to both Houses of the Oireachtas for the policy of the company and the conduct of its affairs. This House is the final authority so far as the administration of the affairs of this country is concerned, and we suggest that the House should not abrogate its powers and confer them on a private company&mdash;a nominal or autonomous company, which is not responsible to this House.  In conection with the administration of this national stud, or of national affairs of any kind in this country, we think that the responsibility for the conduct of those affairs, and the control and authority over them, should rest in the House of the Oireachtas.  We believe that that is fundamental to the proper administration of such affairs, and the amendments on the Order Paper are designed to ensure that that control remains vested in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A moment ago, we discussed the question of fees, how mares are to be selected, how small owners or breeders will get preference over big owners, or why syndicates and big or powerful owners, in some cases, should be entitled to the same treatment as the small farmer or breeder down the country.  These are matters of vital importance from the point of view of policy, which ought to be discussed from time to time in this House, and if members of the House are dissatisfied with the policy pursued by the company, they should be entitled to have the matter raised in this House. I think it would be an extraordinary action on the part of the House to hand over its control and authority to three or four men to operate a company according to their own ideas.  If we once constitute this company&mdash;a nominal private company&mdash;to look after an important piece of national property, to administer a national stud in the interests of an important branch of agriculture, it appears to me to be an extraordinary proposal that this House could no longer discuss the policy, activities or decisions of that company with regard to its affairs, and <Col N="2344" /> we want to ensure that the control and authority that rightly belong to this House, and are rightly vested in this House, should still belong there.  That is the reason for these amendments.  I do not see why an autonomous company outside this House should be given these powers, and I feel that in connection with the particular business that pertains to a national stud, such as the selection of mares, the leasing of mares, and all that sort of thing, we should be particularly careful to reserve the control of that matter here, and that we should have the right to question the policy, activities and decisions of the company, particularly in regard to the administration of its affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment, because I think that most Deputies realise that one of the most important aspects of public administration is to ensure that the Dáil will have full power and control over the expenditure of public money. One of the most effective methods by which the Dáil ensures that these powers are implemented is, first of all, that any Department of State that is associated with any company like this is answerable to this House and, subsequently, answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts.  As this particular section is framed, with the exception of whatever information the Minister may look for, the company can run amok so far as expenditure is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is bad at any time for a company, and particularly a company that is dealing with public moneys, such as this, to have complete autonomy so far as expenditure is concerned, but this is a company which is associated with a business which, if it does not lend itself to corruption, exactly, certainly can lend itself to all kinds of undesirable practices.  I have already instanced the kind of scandalous activities that went on in the past, the manner in which fillies were leased, and the resulting complete public distrust that afterwards attended the activities of that stud.  I am quite sure that the Minister does not want that to happen in this case.  Now, I do not want to be understood as imputing unworthy <Col N="2345" /> motives to the Minister, but it must be remembered that he has a number of other very important duties to attend to, and a company of this kind could not be effectively administered by a Minister who has a number of other duties to attend to, in my opinion, and who has not a close and detailed knowledge, and could not be expected to have a close and detailed knowledge, of the activities of such a concern as this.  We strenuously oppose the idea that a company of this kind should be set up and should be entirely free from any effective control by the Dáil.  We consider that all this company's affairs, but especially its accounts, should be not only laid on the Table of the House but subjected to the scrutiny of the Comptroller and Auditor-General and examined by the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that amendments Nos. 5, 6 and 7 are being taken together.  As regards amendment No. 5, I am advised that what it is sought to achieve is already achieved by the provision in the Bill.  If Deputies would prefer to have their own words inserted, I have no objection.  With regard to amendments Nos. 6 and 7, I do not want to enter into the arguments again because I should be only going back on the Second Reading debate.  We debated fully whether this company should be independent of criticism in the Dáil.  I still adhere to the attitude I adopted on the Second Reading, and I shall ask the House to vote against amendments Nos. 6 and 7.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is becoming the practice in this House to say that a matter has been discussed on a previous occasion, and that it is not necessary to say more about it.  Of course, we cannot make a Minister say more.  But it is right, when amendments Nos. 6 and 7 are before the House, that Deputies should call to mind what these amendments are designed to do. I presided over the Public Accounts <Col N="2346" /> Committee for seven years.  Deputy Cosgrave is now presiding over that committee.  Deputies on that committee represent themselves and their colleagues as watching over the public finances on behalf of the House.  When they sign their report and present it to the House, as I recently did, Deputies are entitled to assume that every relevant matter in regard to the expenditure of public money has been carefully examined, and that, if there is any impropriety or misuse of public money, that committee will draw attention to it, invite the Minister for Finance to exercise his powers, and, in the event of his failing to do what the committee considers necessary for the proper protection of public funds, the House expects that the chairman of that committee will come before the House, ask for a day on which the report can be discussed, and raise on the floor of the House the impropriety which has transpired in the course of taking evidence at that committee. Since Fianna Fáil came into office, a very remarkable development has begun to manifest itself.  When Fianna Fáil first came into this House, they were like wasps on the Public Accounts Committee.  They raised every conceivable question that they could think of at that committee.  They made every allegation that they could conceive, and they used that committee as a forum from which to attack the Government of the day.  We all remember that there used to be streamer headlines in the papers when the Report of the Public Accounts Committee would be published, setting out to advantage the wild and whirling allegations that had been made. Of course, the more wild and whirling they were, the more publicity they got.  Then Fianna Fáil came into office and the chairmanship of that committee passed to the Opposition. That is the usual convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that Deputies will agree that, for the past 13 years, the Reports of the Public Accounts Committee have been sober, unemotional and unsensational documents.  There have been occasions on which grave exception has had to be taken to certain procedure. There have been occasions on <Col N="2347" /> which the Minister for Finance has had to intervene and take certain measures.  There have been occasions on which the committee differed from the Minister for Finance, each Party adhering to its own view.  But on no occasion was any extravagant or wild allegation made.  One would imagine that, with all that before their eyes, the Government of the day, far from desiring to withhold information from the committee run on those lines, would be anxious to avail of the services of that committee and of the Comptroller and Auditor General to watch over the expenditure of public money, because Deputies must readily realise, when they peruse the Estimate of the Minister for Agriculture, that no individual could conceivably give to every item of expenditure for which he is responsible, in a big Government Department his personal attention. He has to depend very largely on the large mechanism of his Department to give effect to the general policy he has laid down.  But, far from welcoming the sober surveillance of the Committee of Public Accounts, Fianna Fáil Ministers have more and more tended to bring in Bills designed to avoid the control of the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>So far as I am aware, the first piece of legislation which did effectively avoid the Comptroller and Auditor-General and the Committee of Public Accounts was the Electricity Supply Act, introduced by Deputy Patrick McGilligan.  When that Bill was brought in, Fianna Fáil was not in the House at all.  They were out chasing the Republic over the daisies.  When they came in, they used to deliver philippics in this House about the awful iniquity of allowing the Electricity Supply Board to handle public money without submission of their accounts and particulars of all they did to the vigilant eye of Deputy Seán MacEntee, who was then chairman of the Public Accounts Committee. Then, they themselves came into office.  We had the Irish Shipping Bill; we had the Alcohol Bill; we have this Bill and we had half a dozen other Bills, all of which were designed to set up semi-autonomous companies to <Col N="2348" /> which Dáil Éireann was asked to pass over large sums of public money. Having passed the money over, Dáil Éireann was told to keep its nose out of the business.  What happens as a result of that?  An Estimate comes before the House for, say, £250,000, and we pass it, whereupon the Department of Finance issues a cheque in favour of that company for that sum. If the Comptroller and Auditor General asks the company what it did with the money, he is told to mind his business, that his sole responsibility is to see that they got the money and, after that, to shut his trap.</P>
    <P>If the Committee of Public Accounts or any Deputy on the Committee of Public Accounts asks a question about it and Deputy Cosgrave or I am in the Chair, we are obliged to tell him to shut his trap, that it is a matter of accounting and that he must not inquire into it.  We are obliged to instruct the accounting officer not to answer the question or deal with the matter further.  The only relevant question a Deputy can ask the accounting officer when he appears before the Committee of Public Accounts is &ldquo;Did you pay over the money?&rdquo; and when he says: &ldquo;Yes, I did&rdquo;, that is day-day.  That is the last you will ever hear of it.  So far as I know they could take that money and kindle their pipes with it, and there is no public officer in this country has a right to inquire why, when, or where.  It is like the birth of the Republic&mdash;shrouded in mystery.  Does the House want that?</P>
    <P>Some years ago, while the gestation of the Republic was going on, we set up a commission known as the Vocational Organisation Commission.  The Taoiseach took it under his own wing and provided a special building for it.  He gave it a telephone number and asked the Bishop of Galway to accept the Chair.  He asked men of all political and religious persuasions and beliefs to sit on that committee.  We had men on that commission from the Protestant Bishop to Jim Larkin.  They sat hatching a scheme of vocational organisation for this country until we were all sick of looking at them.  When the country had forgotten that they were in existence, there emerged a monumental <Col N="2349" /> report.  I do not suppose many of the Fianna Fáil Deputies read that report.  They said: &ldquo;Let de Valera read it, whatever he says about it, goes with us&rdquo;, but I ask those Deputies who did read the report: do they remember the most outstanding recommendation that was in it, one that had reference to the everyday life of our people, the one agreed recommendation that they said should be put into effect here and now, whether we decided on a general vocational organisation of society or not?  That was that an end should be put to the practice of setting up semi-autonomous corporations to which public moneys would be passed without supervision of any kind by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
    <P>There may be some Deputies in this House who are inclined to say to themselves: &ldquo;What is the use of having a Comptroller and Auditor-General looking into these matters, because after all he is a civil servant and he will not readily hold up the Government of which he is a servant to public odium by denouncing their practices&rdquo;? Deputies who would say that would be quite mistaken.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General is an officer of the Constitution.  He stands outside the Government, independent of the Government, and holds his office virtually by a tenure analogous to that of a High Court judge.  He cannot be removed from office except by a resolution of this House and for cause stated.  So that no matter in whose Department an impropriety may occur, the Comptroller and Auditor-General is in a position to note it, to comment upon it and to demand that this House should be acquainted with the nature of the misfeasance and that adequate steps be taken to put it right.  The Vocational Organisation Commission says that that is a valuable safeguard, not only for the Treasury but for public morality.  They say: &ldquo;We see in these companies the possibility of very grave abuses developing&rdquo;.  I think they went so far as to say that they were not altogether satisfied that abuses or quasi-abuses had not begun to manifest themselves.  They certainly said that this system was well calculated to give rise to very serious abuses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2350" /> They were told by Ministers of State that their report was slovenly, that it was ignorant, that it was based on misconceptions that could have been corrected by five minutes' conversation on the telephone with the appropriate Department.  I do not blame Ministers for saying that after reading the report. It was only natural that they should say that, but do Deputies in this House believe that that was a slovenly report, based on misconception, designed to enshrine falsehoods which could have been corrected by a conversation on the telephone with the relevant Department?</P>

      <P>I am making an appropriate relevant speech to these two amendments.  I want to make it clear that this point was well debated on the Second Stage and that we fixed the Minister with notice that the necessary amendments would be put down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Hold your horses.  If I put down a substantive amendment relating to the principle of the Bill for this stage without giving due notice on the Second Stage, I would have been told that I should have raised the matter then and I would have been asked: &ldquo;Why did you not take the precaution necessary to permit you to put down an amendment?&rdquo; We warned the Minister that this principle regarding the formation of this company was not being decided.  The principle decided on on Second Stage was that we wanted a national stud.  In any case, we made the point on the Second Stage that we all wanted a <Col N="2351" /> national stud but we did not want to have this company spending our money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The report of the Vocational Organisation Commission is far away from the national stud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>So it is, but in this particular case it assists us to be ready in the stable to make a frantic effort to close the stable door before the horse is gone.  The Minister's proposal is that we should be restricted rigorously to closing the door long after the hide and the hair of the horse have gone.  That is the purpose of this amendment, to provide this House with a hasp that will keep the horse inside.  The purpose of the Minister's plan is to provide the company with a general licence to decamp with the horse and the four shoes whenever he feels inclined to do so.  That is the purpose of these two amendments.</P>
      <P>Here is one of the first Bills introduced since the report of the Vocational Commission was published.  The Minister cannot say that his attention was not fully directed to that on the Second Stage.  It was.  He complains now that it was too fully directed to it.  Here is the Minister coming before us simply because he says it is more convenient to propose to leave this company out of the jurisdiction of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, the constitutional officer appointed for the very purpose we have in mind.  What is to prevent this company going out to spend £100,000 on a jennet?  If they do, is there any Deputy in this House who can get up and say: &ldquo;I saw Martin McDonagh buy that jennet for 13/9, and he sold it to the national stud for £100,000.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is to prevent the national stud employing the money which we are giving them in buying a mule?  If they do, no Deputy can dare refer to the fact.  If any member of the Public Accounts Committee says he saw the mule, Deputy Cosgrave will have to say: &ldquo;That is not a matter of account; you cannot refer to it&rdquo;.  And though the Deputy asks: &ldquo;Is it argued <Col N="2352" /> that Dáil Eireann voted £250,000 to the national stud to buy mules?&rdquo;, Deputy Cosgrave must reply: &ldquo;That is not a matter of account and you cannot inquire into it,&rdquo; and unless and until the Minister for Agriculture changes the law, the matter cannot be discussed in Dáil Eireann at all.</P>
    <P>Is that not so?  Some Deputies are tossing their heads and saying: &ldquo;Nonsense. Can you not raise it on the next Agricultural Estimate which comes before the House?  There will be a sum of £250,000 for the national stud and you can then raise it?&rdquo; But not a bit of it.  The Minister will make exactly the same answer as the Minister for Industry and Commerce makes in regard to Irish Shipping or the Tourist Board.  He will say: &ldquo;I am not going to discuss their business in the House.  The House has decided that this matter must be left in the absolute discretion of the board appointed and there can be no interference&rdquo;. He will go on to say: &ldquo;I want to remind Deputies that the gentlemen who have accepted appointments on this board are very sensitive men, men who are not accustomed to the low, dirty trade of politics.  They are high-up gentlemen and if anyone talked about them in Dáil Eireann, they would all quit and leave us, and we would not be able to get on at all.&rdquo; But the same gentlemen will take mighty good care that they will be well paid for every hour's work they do. Sensitive and all as they are, they will not be too sensitive for that.</P>
    <P>I think we can find in this country a body of men who are not so sensitive, but, if we cannot, there is an alternative plan.  We can avail of the services of the sensitive creatures, the delicate highly-bred racehorses who are going to advise us in this matter.  They need not be drawn into it at all.  If we appoint a director and authorise him to have an advisory council, on the clear understanding that the decisions must be his and that he must answer for them to the Minister, that lets the sensitive gentlemen out.  Nobody need ever know what advice the sensitive boys give to the director.</P>
    <P>The decisions will be the director's; <Col N="2353" /> he will be responsible to the Minister; and the Minister will be responsible to us.  What conceivable objection is there to a plan of that kind, or does the Minister say that it is desirable that public moneys should habitually be handed over to these bodies and the House denied the opportunity of ever investigating what has become of them?  If the House is going to admit that principle in connection with this Bill, where are we to draw the line?</P>
    <P>It is a very handy way from the Minister's point of view.  It exonerates him for ever from having to follow the debate on his Estimate.  I wish Deputies knew the rounds to which Ministers will go to open extra sub-heads in their Estimates in the currency of the financial year, in order to make some payment with Ministry of Finance sanction, so that they will not be required to bring in a Supplementary Estimate and face debate in the House on the particular payment they want to make.  If Deputies could realise how Ministers hate answering to this House in respect of expenditure for which they are responsible, they would understand the passion which Ministers have for semi-autonomous corporations to whom they can pass the public money and trust to God.</P>
    <P>How many corporations of this kind are we going to have?  Is every form of public activity to be taken out of the hands of civil servants and passed over to semi-autonomous companies? Some Deputies imagine that semi-autonomous companies mean bodies of persons who are not civil servants. Nothing could be further from the truth.  Usually, you will find on the board of a semi-autonomous company a civil servant, but he has this advantage, that he is no longer acting as a civil servant and so is not answerable to this House and to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
    <P>I know of two cases which I can call to mind at once: one is Irish Shipping, presided over by the Secretary of the Department of Industry and Commerce, and the other is the Irish Flourmillers' Committee&mdash;what might properly be described as the gang that divides up the spoils&mdash;which is also <Col N="2354" /> presided over by the Secretary of the Department of Industry and Commerce, but not as Secretary of that Department.  No one may pursue him into that hallowed sanctum.  When he goes in there, he sheds the raiment of the civil servant and becomes an amorphous being whose exact nature nobody knows.  The Public Accounts Committee cannot follow him in there and the Comptroller and Auditor-General cannot follow him in there. The only person who ever makes contact with him in there is the Minister, and what he hears is on the q.t.</P>
    <P>How many more of this kind of company are we to have?  Are we advancing to the position in which all public affairs will be conducted by companies of that kind, and in which the only function Dáil Eireann will have will be to provide the dough and look pleasant?  I do not look forward with any anticipation to any such arrangement. If this Dáil is a Parliament at all, it will learn from the experience of other Parliaments and will realise that the day it lets go control of the money, it might as well shut up shop. The last control which a Parliament in modern times has over the Executive is its power to refuse supply.  The last control a Parliament has from day to day is its power to question a Minister as to his plans, his intentions and his past Acts when he comes to ask Parliament for money. If we lose that power, we lose all our effective power.</P>
    <P>Useful as is the Parliamentary Question, it is comparatively impotent beside the power of control, the power to debate supply.  On a Parliamentary Question, the Minister always has the last word.  In a debate on the question of supply, the Opposition gets at least an opportunity of speaking so formidable a word that the Minister's prerogative of reply is incapable of burying.  What we are deciding on this amendment is whether the power of control, the power to control supply, is to be maintained or not.  If we are prepared to abandon that control in regard to this stud, no logical reason can be advanced why we should not abandon it in respect of every other activity of government in due course.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2355" /> I am quite satisfied that, far from adding to the list of semi-autonomous companies at present in existence, we ought deliberately to seek to limit it. We ought not only to vote resolutely against this proposal, but we should bring effective pressure to bear on the Government to abandon all analogous companies, and restore to Parliament the right which it is meant to have, and the right which people believe it has, that is, to control public expenditure and to ascertain from time to time how the money it has voted, the money it has taxed the people to raise, has been used, so that from time to time it can reconsider whether it is right and just to raise the taxes in order to get that money again and again for the purpose alleged.</P>
    <P>At present, if we give money to this stud, we do not know from year to year how it will be used, but we are going to impose taxes on our people in order to get it.  I think that is wrong and every conscientious Deputy must know that it is wrong.  How many Deputies on the Fianna Fáil benches will get up and defend it?  There are seven of them there watching the public purse. Is there any one of the seven who will get up and defend this system of autonomous companies not answerable to Dáil Éireann on its merits, or will they all sit silent like the mules?</P>

He is a solicitor, a man accustomed to handling moneys, accustomed to insisting that the persons who handle them will render an account to him as to how they use them, a man accustomed to using surveillance and insisting upon an account being rendered.  Will he not come to our aid and tell the Minister for Agriculture, from his experience, <Col N="2356" /> how necessary it is to insist that moneys for which one is trustee will be properly accounted for?  I have no doubt that if he sets the good example the other six Deputies present will do their part as well, and tell us, when they are trustees of public money, do they believe they have discharged the obligations of their trust by just handing the money away in lumps and trusting to God that it will all come out in the washing.  Come now; the whole seven cannot be dumb.  Let us give them a chance.</P>

      <P>When I read the proposals in the National Stud Bill, and when I realised that the Minister's idea was to provide another nominal company, to add one more nominal, semi-autonomous company to the list of companies already there, I put down a Parliamentary Question to the Minister for Finance.  I think it might be of some interest to the House to know the information I got with regard to those companies.  I want to ask the House whether it is prepared to add one more nominal company to this list. I asked the Minister for Finance:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If he will state in relation to all companies set up by the State the following particulars in each case (a) the total capital; (b) the amount of State funds subscribed; (c) the number, salaries and names of State appointed directors and the number otherwise appointed; (d) the amount of capital prescribed by legislation to be subscribed by State appointed directors; (e) where a civil servant is so appointed, particulars regarding his director's fee, and other such fees, and his Civil Service salary and allowances; (f) whether the finances of the company are accounted for to the Comptroller and Auditor-General and the Committee of Public Accounts; and (g) whether any Minister of State is responsible to Dáil Eireann for the proper conduct of such company.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reply I got was: &ldquo;The particulars requested are given in the following statement.&rdquo;  The first company was Aer-Rianta, Teoranta.  The authorised capital there is £500,000, and the amount issued and paid up is <Col N="2357" /> £117,011.  That is all paid up by the State.  There are four directors, who are paid £300 each.  Two of the directors are civil servants, the salary and bonus in one case being £1,500 and £292 16s. 0d., respectively, and in the other case £1,000 and £322 3s. 0d., respectively.  No accounts are submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor-General and no Minister is responsible to the Oireachtas for the proper conduct of the affairs of the company.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus, Teoranta, has an authorised capital of £100,000; £80,000 is subscribed by Aer-Rianta, and the directors are the same as for Aer-Rianta. The accounts have not to be submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor-General or the Public Accounts Committee, and the Minister is not responsible to this House.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation has £1,000,000 authorised capital.  The amount of State funds subscribed is £292,118.  There are three directors, Messrs.  Barton, Quirke and Walsh. The remuneration of the directors is £800, £300 and £300 per annum, respectively.  There is no legislative provision as to the amount of capital to be subscribed to any of those companies by the State appointed directors. In this case, none of the directors is a civil servant, and the accounts have not to be submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
    <P>Comhlucht Siúicre, Éireann, Teoranta, has £2,000,000 authorised capital, and the amount of State funds subscribed is £500,000.  There are four directors, Messrs Cahill, Lalor, Odlum and O'Mahony.  The remuneration of the directors is £300 each.  No director is a civil servant.  The accounts are not submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor-General or the Public Accounts Committee and no Minister is responsible to this House for the conduct of the company's affairs.  The Dairy Disposal Company has an authorised capital of £10.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three directors, with remuneration of £200, £100 and £100, per annum, respectively. The three directors are civil servants, and their Civil Service salaries and <Col N="2358" /> bonus are, respectively: £1,200 and £321 17s.; £600 and £277 3s.; and £700 and £294 2s.  The accounts are not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  The Flax Development Board has £5 authorised capital. There are three directors, whose remuneration is £500, £100 and £100 per annum, respectively.  One of the directors is a civil servant.  His salary is £680, with a bonus of £304 11s.  The Industrial Credit Company has an authorised capital of £5,000,000.  The amount subscribed by the State is £804,517.  There are three directors, Messrs. Colbert, Kettle and O'Reilly. The directors' remuneration is £1,600, £300 and £300, per annum, respectively. None of the directors is a civil servant.  Irish Shipping, Limited, has an authorised capital of £200,000, issued and paid up.  The amount contributed by the State is £101,993. There are six directors, Messrs. Leydon, Flynn, Gordon, Roycroft, Stafford and Hallinan.  Remuneration at the rate of £500 per annum was fixed for the non-civil servant directors. Of these directors one has accepted remuneration from 1st July, 1945.  Messrs. Leydon and Flynn are civil servants.  The company has no responsibility to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mianraí, Teoranta, has £200 authorised capital.  The amount contributed by the State is £200.  There are seven directors.  The amount of capital prescribed by legislation to be subscribed by the State-appointed directors is one share.  None of the directors is a civil servant, and the accounts are not submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  Monarchana Alcóil na hÉireann, Teoranta, has £500,000 authorised capital, and the amount subscribed from State funds is £275,756.  There are two directors, whose remuneration is £100 and £1,200, per annum, respectively.  One director is a civil servant, on a salary of £900 plus £316 bonus.  Finally, there is the Turf Development Board, with an authorised capital of £10.  There are four directors, Messrs. Barton, Andrews, O'Rahilly and Quirke.  Their remuneration is £150, £200, £100 and £100, per annum, respectively.  None <Col N="2359" /> of those companies is responsible to the House.  That is a list of 11 nominal companies, to which we are now adding one more.  Deputy Dillon has dealt with the matter very effectively.</P>
    <P>The Vocational Organisation Commission that was set up by the Government, apart altogether from its recommendations regarding vocational organisation in this country, made one recommendation which they felt should be implemented immediately, namely, that it was time to depart from this whole system of the Dáil voting substantial capital sums of money to be put into semi-autonomous companies that were not responsible to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, to the Public Accounts Committee or to this House.  Notwithstanding the strong recommendation made by a body of people set up by the Government itself, the Government completely ignored the recommendation and on the first opportunity they had of departing from that system are now setting up this company as they have set up other companies.  We take very strong exception to that proposal.  The amendment has been put down for the purpose of retaining the power of control that should properly be vested in this House.  It is for the House now to decide.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon runs away with himself, as we all know, because he has that unfortunate trait of being very eloquent without having very much to say.  There was no reason whatever why Deputy Dillon should, for instance, say that the Public Accounts Committee has been going on a more even keel or has been taking a lower key since he became chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said that when Fianna Fáil were in opposition there was nothing but scare headlines in the newspapers in regard to the reports of that committee.  When we came in here I was Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee in the first year, and I guarantee that if anybody looks up the report of the committee <Col N="2360" /> he will find that it did not give rise to scare headlines any more than did the report that Deputy Dillon has brought in from time to time as Chairman. Certainly, there was not any great rhetoric in our reports such as Deputy Dillon has treated us to on occasions in regard to the Public Accounts Committee.</P>

He also said that Ministers go hunting around for new sub-heads so as to avoid coming to the Dáil with a Supplementary Estimate.

He knows very well that a Minister cannot make a sub-head without coming to the Dáil with a Supplementary Estimate.  He should know that after his 13 years on the Public Accounts Committee.  Deputies have heard what he said.  I said here on the Second Reading of the Bill that it was not advisable to have the activities of this company open to public discussion here or open to discussion at all.  Will not every Deputy agree with me in this, that if the unfortunate director of that stud bought a wrong horse&mdash;he might pay £100,000 for a horse that proved to be no good, and everyone knows that such a thing may happen &mdash;that in order to score off us Deputy Dillon would come in here and say that he had bought a mule.</P>

      <P>Everybody knows that in order to get a laugh Deputy Dillon would come in here and say that the man had paid £100,000 for a mule.  If Deputies like him cannot conduct themselves, then, naturally, we will have to get a company to manage this particular stud.  It is the only way it can be run.  It is the only way in which a director of a stud like this can carry on.  He could not possibly carry on if his actions were to be dealt with in this Dáil as Deputies, like Deputy Dillon, would deal with them.  Every Deputy knows it could not be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to follow up the Minister on that.  The Minister says that, if the director made a mistake I would be the first to come into the Dáil and charge him with incompetence, and say that he had paid too much money for a horse that did not turn out well.  That is the allegation. I direct the Minister's attention to the Official Debates, Column 1796, Volume 97, No. 7.  On the Second Reading of the Bill I said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We would make an egregious mistake if, when we are setting Tully Stud on foot, we excluded from our minds the possibility of going to the very top price necessary in order to get the very best blood that could be purchased.  I know this much about horse breeding.  Sometimes, a man may pay £70,000 or £80,000 for an untried sire, believing that on its breeding and performance its progeny ought to be superb, only to discover that, in fact, its progeny is practically worthless.  That is one of the risks of breeding.  There is the great danger that, in a State-controlled or State-managed institution of that kind, its director will not dare take that kind of risk, lest furious criticism, founded on false ideas, should assail him.  Therefore, in passing a Bill of this kind&mdash;</P>
      <P>Now, remember, this is Deputy Dillon talking on the Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;we should boldly face the fact that, if a stud of this character is to be operated successfully at all, the director of it should have the assurance that, provided he uses reasonable prudence, fault will never be <Col N="2362" /> found with him for making the kind of mistake that no man conceivably could have avoided making when he bought a sire horse in the hope that he was securing for the breeders of this country quite exceptional blood.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is what Deputy Dillon said on the Second Stage, and the Minister who was listening to Deputy Dillon saying it prayed to God that Deputy Dillon would not have a copy of the Official Report in his bag, and thought he would get away with what he has now said to the House.  But, unfortunately for him, Deputy Dillon did have a copy of the Official Report in his bag, and he has given the Minister day, date, line and column of the original of what he said. Is not that true?  Look at his face getting red now.  There may be some doubt, seeing that the Minister cannot remember from Thursday to Wednesday what I said in Dáil Eireann, that he may have forgotten what the Vocational Commission said about companies of this kind.  Here is what it said four months ago.</P>

      <P>We know that only too well.  The Report of the Vocational Organisation Commission says&mdash;paragraph 486:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Dairy Disposal Company, Limited, was incorporated as a private company in 1927, without statutory authority.  Certain functions discharged by it were validated <Col N="2365" /> by the Creamery Act, 1928.  It was founded for the purpose of acquiring certain proprietary creameries which were producing uneconomic conditions in the industry.  The intention was&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mark what the intention was&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;The intention was to close such of the creameries as were redundant and to dispose of the remainder to co-operative societies.  The company is a nominal one, solely responsible to the Minister for Agriculture.  It is entirely dependent on the State for its finances, which are issued with the sanction of the Ministers for Finance and Agriculture.  Its accounts are not submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor-General and are not subject to parliamentary revision.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>What has the Dairy Disposal Company to do with the Stud Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That Dairy Disposal Company is identical in its constitution with the Tully Stud Farm Company which it is proposed to set up under this Bill, and the Dairy Disposal Company, having been set up by Parliament, with the consent of the Creamery Act, 1928, to purchase creameries for the purpose of conveying them to co-operative societies, in 1928, still has creameries, and if any Deputy gets up to argue in this House that it ought not to have the creameries, he will be told to mind his business and if the Public Accounts Committee tries to pursue the matter further than to ascertain did the Dairy Disposal Company get the money that they stipulated for, they will be told that it is none of their business.  It took three or four years to persuade the Dairy Disposal Company to render any accounts to the Public Accounts Committee at all.  The constitution of this Stud Company is going to be identical with the Dairy Disposal Company, and I have read to the House what the Vocational Commission say about that company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How are we, who know what these bodies are like, to communicate to the House what impartial observers have found such bodies to be, if we do not <Col N="2366" /> tell them and give them the reference for the written word describing what these impartial observers have seen? Remember, we cannot find these things out.  Nobody in this State had the right to call in the Dairy Disposal Company and to cross-question it, until the Vocational Commission was set on foot and, before I finish with this, I will show the House that in certain cases where autonomous companies of this kind were brought before the commission, there came a point when they told the commission to go to blazes, that they would give them no more information, and there was nothing the commission could do about it.  They had to prepare their report on the basis of the information they could extract but there was no power in that commission or in anybody else to get the necessary information to determine whether this company was operating well or not.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The company is a nominal one, solely responsible to the Minister for Agriculture.  It is entirely dependent on the State for its finances, which are issued with the sanction of the Ministers for Finance and Agriculture.  Its accounts are not submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor-General and are not subject to parliamentary revision.  The directors are three civil servants, appointed by the Minister for Agriculture. Their salaries are borne on the Departmental Vote, and thus their emoluments do not depend upon the ability and success of their conduct of the affairs of the company. Much criticism has been directed at this body&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mark this&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;because it has abandoned the original policy of disposing of the acquired properties to co-operative societies and has continued operating them in at least partial competition with the latter and has actually built new creameries.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What guarantee have we, if we set up the national stud on exactly the same basis, that they will not set up an ancillary factory to manufacture ladies' bonnets and, if they do, who has the right to question them?  This Dairy Disposal Company was set up to dispose <Col N="2367" /> of creameries.  Now they have begun to build them.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The chairman of the company is an official entitled the controller of creamery development.  It is certainly extraordinary if the director of a commercial concern is endowed with governmental authority to control the business of its competitors. Only a consolidated balance sheet has been issued by the company to show the results of its working, and it is impossible to say whether any of the units are being worked at a loss.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Listen well to this&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Information on this matter was sought from witnesses by the commission and was refused.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And was refused.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I hope it will be in the report of the proceedings of this House, Sir.  The Minister himself refused even to give the commission, desirous of making a report to his own Government, the information which the commission said was necessary about just such an autonomous company as we are now asked to set on foot.  Is the Dáil going to set up another of these companies in the face of that fact and in the face of all the report&mdash;paragraphs 487, 488, 489, 490, 491, 492, 493, 494, 495&mdash;Irish Steel Limited&mdash;God bless the mark&mdash;not to speak of Comhlucht Lorgtha agus Forbartha Mianraí, Teoranta&mdash;that was the company that was established to find coal in one of Deputy Neil Blaney's constituent's back yards; I <Col N="2368" /> believe it has now been amalgamated with Comhlucht Gual-Láthrach Shliabh-Árdachadh, Teoranta, that is going to find coal in South Tipperary? None of these companies is ever going to answer to Dáil Éireann for the racket.  None of these companies is going to answer to Dáil Éireann for a penny of the public money they have got, Neither will the Tully Stud Company, unless we pass these amendments.</P>
      <P>Is money so flush in this country that we can afford to pass it out to all and sundry to do what they like with it? Are Deputies satisfied that all the moneys they have given companies of this kind have been prudently and economically spent?  We have been passing out very substantial sums to the Irish Tourist Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Tourist Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can never find out which and I can never find out which spends the most money.  The Irish Tourist Board.  We are lashing out money to that board on a magnificent scale.  Maybe, like the Republic, it is on the way, but, as yet, have we got very flattering results for the amount of money we have given and yet&mdash;I think the Chair will confirm what I say &mdash;I cannot ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce a question about that.  All our function in regard to that was to find the money and, having found it, never mention their name again because no one in this House has to answer for how the money is spent, no one need ever account for a penny so far as the people who vote the money are concerned.</P>
      <P>Do Deputies want a similar situation in regard to the Tully Stud or do they want to be entitled to get up here and ask the Minister why certain persons are being excluded from the amenities provided by that stud while others get them?  You all know that some of the foremost breeders in this country and Great Britain have been excluded from access to the best sires in Great Britain because small bodies of men have formed syndicates to keep the nominations for these sires for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2369" /> Now, we are told we are to have an autonomous body.  We do not know who will be on that body, but once it comes into existence we may not criticise its constitution, we may not question its status.  Suppose to-morrow any Deputy in this House receives a complaint from a constituent that he has a good brood mare and he wants to avail of the services of a particular sire in the Tully Stud and that he is informed that he will not be let have it on any terms.</P>
    <P>Suppose he comes to one of us and says: &ldquo;I happen to know that these services are being distributed on a favouritism basis, that only the friends of the directors of this company are allowed to bring their brood mares,&rdquo; what will any of us do?  If he is a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, he may be able to bring pressure to bear on the Minister for Agriculture, but suppose he has no means of doing that, what can he do?  It is true that he may go to the Minister for Agriculture and, if he can carry conviction to the Minister's mind, the Minister may act.  Whether he has any right to act or not, I think is doubtful, but he may make representations.</P>
    <P>It is only reasonable to say that if the Minister is to leave his office open to any Deputy who has a fancied grievance, he will not have time to do any other work for himself.  Let me be clear on this.  The Minister does not particularly appreciate my intervention in the debate.  I do not want to make any reflection on the integrity of the Minister.  That does not arise. But it is manifestly impossible for him to sit in his office and hear the fancied complaints of every Deputy in the House.  We all know we receive a great many complaints, some of which are well founded, while others are unfounded. We cannot expect the Minister for Agriculture to sift them all.</P>
    <P>So long as the Tully Stud director knows that if legitimate ground for complaint is given a debate can be initiated in this House, then the director will take very good care to ensure that no such legitimate ground is given.  Deputies should remember that the uses of the power of debate in this <Col N="2370" /> House are not only apparent when they are being used, but the uses of such power are very often most effective <i>in terrorem.</i>  If anybody knows that in the event of his doing some wrong his wrong-doing will be made the subject of debate here, in 99 per cent. of the cases he will refrain from wrong-doing.  But suppose somebody knows he can do wrong and is immune from public criticism, then the temptation to do wrong becomes very much stronger.</P>
    <P>I am arguing for decent, clean, open administration in this State.  I think the quotation I gave to-day from the speech which the Minister had so rapidly forgotten makes it perfectly clear that even those who appear to the Minister to be the most unreasonable Deputies will fully appreciate the ordinary difficulties that must confront the director of the stud in his day-to-day work.  There will be no captious criticism, no unreasonable demands made, but those responsible for the operating of the stud will realise that unless they are prepared to do their best and to do justice, their conduct will be called in question in the House. Is that a desirable thing?  We have 12 Fianna Fáil Deputies here now.  I could not get one of them to their feet&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am wondering if the Minister will see his way, not exactly to compromise on these amendments, but to provide in the Bill something that will meet the views of the Opposition&mdash;those who are supporting these amendments.  I have been a Deputy for a considerable number of years and I am very jealous of the rights of Parliament. I do not like to see them filched from us.  I have a feeling that if this Bill passes in the form in which it has been introduced, it will be an invasion of the rights of Parliament.  I feel that the Minister is cutting clean across the Constitution.  It must be remembered that our Committee of Public Accounts was really taken over from the Mother of Parliaments, as it has come to be known.  It was in the British Parliament that the idea of a Committee of Public Accounts was introduced for the first time.  Large numbers of the general public, including many supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party, do not know what are the functions of the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is because of this widespread ignorance that the Fianna Fáil Party are out to get away with matters of this kind and invade further the rights of Parliament, not to speak of the rights of the common people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Resolutions were passed by various county councils, county committees, and other local bodies&mdash;I remember that on many of them Fianna Fáil had a majority&mdash;calling attention to the managerial system and declaring that it was taking powers from the people.  Here is a case where the Parliament is taking away powers from the Committee of Public Accounts.  I was a member of the committee for years, and the procedure was, and still is, to have a member of the Opposition in the chair.  The various members who were interested in the country's finances were permitted to ask questions of the accounting officer for each Department.  The <Col N="2372" /> accounting officer was the principal witness, and there was one such officer for each Department, whether it was the Department of Local Government and Public Health, the Department of Defence, or any of the other Departments of State.  Any member of the committee was entitled to ask the accounting officer in what way public money was spent in each Department, and he could also comment on the remarks of the Comptroller and Auditor-General. I used to regard the Comptroller and Auditor-General as a buffer between the State and the spendthrifts of the various Departments.</P>
    <P>Over a long period of years we had a very fine system in operation in connection with the Committee of Public Accounts.  I am very grieved to learn that that system is about to be abolished by this Bill.  I suggest it is very necessary to have that position restored.  I think the Minister, perhaps unwittingly, destroyed, or attempted to destroy, that system in another measure relating to the disposal of the creameries.  If he perpetuates that policy under this Bill, then it is goodbye to democratic institutions here.  I regard the Committee of Public Accounts and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges as the most important bodies set up by this House. Under the first committee, we have access to the accounting officers of the various Departments and they can be cross-examined freely.  We will endanger that position unless these amendments are passed, or unless the Minister is prepared to meet the principle of the amendments in some way. He need not use the exact phraseology of the amendments as they appear on the paper, but at least he can adopt the spirit of the amendments and preserve the right of this Parliament to do the things it is entitled to do.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister not to invade the rights of Parliament.  The tendency appears to be to get further and further away from the people.  The tendency seems to be to set up a bureaucracy in this country.  If the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, the back benchers, were allowed to exercise freedom of thought in this matter, I believe they would go into the lobby <Col N="2373" /> in favour of these amendments.  But they will not be allowed to exercise their freedom of conscience or action. On one occasion I think they were referred to as dumb, driven cattle.  Instead of following their own consciences they will walk into the lobby and vote as they are directed.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to consider what effect this will have on the general public.  Is he prepared to embark further on a policy which seeks to take away the rights of the common people, because that is what it amounts to?  We represent the common people and we are entitled on the Committee of Public Accounts to question accounting officers as to how public money is spent.  We must know, too, when the Comptroller and Auditor-General makes comments on important incidents which concern the public very intimately.  We have had to inquire from time to time about petty larcenies and pilfering in various Departments and we got satisfactory explanations. We were told that those things did occur without the knowledge of certain officials, but that precautionary measures had been taken so as to avoid further incidents of that nature.  I do not want to go too closely into the conversations we had at the meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts. I regard what took place at those meetings as strictly confidential.</P>
    <P>I have the feeling, and it is shared by a good many people in this country, <Col N="2374" /> that we are establishing a bureaucracy. I do not blame the civil servant; he is paid for doing his job.  But, as Deputy Dillon pointed out, the Comptroller and Auditor-General is not a civil servant.  His appointment is provided for under our Constitution.  He cannot be rapped on the knuckles, even by Ministers.  He is responsible to this House.  Are we going to negative all that we were told would be done under our Constitution?</P>
    <P>We are told that the rights and privileges of public representatives are being filched from us every day, and it is the Minister's colleagues who are complaining most.  I took up a certain attitude in relation to county management and I found myself frequently in the minority, but the Minister's supporters, the members of the rank and file throughout the country, are now condemning the Fianna Fáil Government for the way they do things, and yet members of the Fianna Fáil Party come here and vote on amendments of this character against their consciences and against the wishes of the people who sent them here.  I sincerely hope the Minister will find some way out, some <i>via media</i> so as to meet the idea behind these amendments.  Let us see, at any rate, that the rights and privileges of the House are maintained and that there will be no further invasion of the rights of the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Local Government (Remission of Rates) Bill, 1940, applied to residences which were not erected under the Labourers Acts, or were not houses under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, as amended by the Housing Act, 1932, or houses in respect of which grants were made under the Housing Acts, 1924 and 1925, or under the Housing Acts, 1925 to 1931, or houses in respect of which a grant was made under the Housing Acts, 1932 to 1942, or houses to which relief of rates had been given under the (Gaeltacht Housing) Acts.  It provided for the remission of two-thirds of the rates for five years on any such residences as were erected in the period between the 1st October, 1939, and 30th September, 1942.  In 1943 an amending Act extended the period during which residences should be erected to qualify for remission up to the 31st March, 1945.  Due to the difficulties of securing building materials and supplies, residences which were scheduled to be completed in time to secure the remission have had their completion delayed, and accordingly it is felt, in the special circumstances of this time, that it would be equitable to extend the life of the Act for a further period, to the 31st March next, so that new dwelling houses or improvements to which the Principal Act applied completed in the current year may rank for remission.  The Bill contains no new principle</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this Bill I want to ascertain certain facts. Am I correct in saying that the purpose of the Bill is to extend the benefit of exemption from rates to houses which would have been exempted had they been completed before March 31st, 1945, and if that is a correct interpretation of the Bill, are houses which were built under the Housing Acts, and which have not been passed for grants deemed to have been completed within the meaning of this Act? I have directed the Minister's attention on divers occasions to what I conceive to be a very considerable abuse, which operates not only to deny to simple people down the country the benefits of this Rates Remission Act, but also access to the grants which they ought to receive under the Housing Acts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, Sir, if the Minister is civil, he gives the information that is asked for, and if he is not civil, he does not give it.  At the moment, of course, we are dealing with an uncivil Minister, and from experience we know how to deal with him.  If he will not give us the facilities that we ask for, then we will not give him the facilities that he may require.  I understand that this Bill provides for the remission of rates on some kind of houses in this country, and in that connection I want to direct the attention of the Minister to the desirability of expanding further the effect of the principal Remission of Rates Act, 1940. At the present time, if an enterprising farmer in this country improves his out-offices, the first caller to admire the architecture of these buildings is the rate collector, and the price of his admiration is an increased assessment on the farmer.  Now, some Deputies of this House will remember that the Land War in this country was fought for the Three F's, one of which was Fair Rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, Sir, the houses to which Deputy Dillon has been referring were constructed under the Housing Acts, and this Bill does not apply to the Housing Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  I am referring to houses that never got a penny grant of any kind.  I do not suppose the Minister knows anything about that kind of house, but those of us who were members of the Land League, or who are children of those who were members of the Land League, know very little of any other kind of house.  However, Sir, as I was saying, when the Land War was fought, one of the principal things that our people fought for was Fair Rent, and the reason they raised that issue was that in the old days, if a farmer tenant of a holding, by his own industry, accumulated a modest nest-egg and employed that modest nest-egg in improving his holding, either by way of enriching his land or by way of repairing his house, building an annex to it, or building a new out-office or byre, the first caller that he had was the landlord's bailiff, and that gentleman used <Col N="2379" /> to ramble in and initiate a discussion about the wealth of the farmer and his capacity to pay an increased rent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, Sir, on a point of order&mdash;or am I entitled to occupy the time of the House in raising points of order?  &mdash;this Bill deals with the remission of rates, and not with rents or landlords.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can readily understand, Sir, that the Minister does not realise that he has succeeded to the disagreeable office of Clanricarde in this country, but I trust to be able to prove to him that he has succeeded to that office, before I conclude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister even commented on the fact that new buildings had been erected and, borrowing the language of the modern rate collector, he said that it must be manifest to the simplest mind that if in the past you had two rooms in a house, and now you have three rooms, you have a better house than the one you formerly occupied, and just as the landlord's bailiff of 30 years ago raised the rent in such a case, so the modern rate collector raises the rent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, Sir, in the case of a man in County Mayo, who is paying an excess annual payment&mdash; whether you call it rates or rent, it is all the same to him whether he pays it to a rate collector or a landlord&mdash; it means that he has to work harder to pay the increased rates or rents? I am sure that the Ceann Comhairle, as a County Galway man himself, knows that it is not infrequent to find the common term of &ldquo;cess&rdquo; being applied by the country people to both types of payment, because they see no difference.  It does not matter to them where the money goes.  All they know is that it is going out of their pockets, and whither it goes makes no difference to the man who has to pay it. Now, if this House is not prepared to learn the lesson of our history, then it <Col N="2381" /> must be a much more obscurantist body than I thought it to be.  What will be the net result of teaching these people that if they spend their whole income in improvements on their holdings, it will mean an increased rent or rate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

      <P>Exactly, Sir, and I ask you what was the result of that kind of thing in the past?  What will be the result if we, in our day, proceed to do, through the county council, precisely what the landlord's bailiff used to do in the old days?  May we not expect a similar result?  Is it not true &mdash;who knows it better than a Deputy from Galway County&mdash;that, with the passage of the Birrell Land Act, which forced Clanricarde to sell and with the abolition of Clanricarde's bailiffs, the houses and holdings on the Clanricarde estate began to improve?  Is it not true that, driving through the Irish countryside 30 years ago, before the Birrell Land Act was passed, you could tell, as you passed through an area, whether you were driving through a bought-out estate or an estate on which the landlord's bailiffs still held sway?  Where there was a likelihood that the rents&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that, if we now permanently establish the principle that, if a farmer improves his holding, he is to be liable, the morning after, to have his valuation for the assessment of rates increased, the result will be exactly the same as was the result when landlords were permitted to increase their rents for the same purpose.</P>

      <P>Surely, on Second Stage, I can argue that it should.  On Fifth Stage I am confined to what is in the Bill, but on Second Stage I may advocate wider and better provision for the persons whom it is designed to benefit. If we are to establish the principle that, if a farmer improves his holding, from that day forward he is to be liable to pay a heavier cess upon his holding, what can we expect the farmer to do?</P>

This is a Bill to provide for remission of rates.  I ask that that remission be extended to new buildings and I point out that, if we do not do that, we shall create a situation closely analogous to one which we had before in which the homes of our people became a by-word for their wretched appearance and many persons, not understanding the intolerable conditions under which our people lived, blamed them for those conditions.

      <P>Again, on a point of order, this Bill deals with the remission of rates on a very narrow category of residences.  It does not apply to any cottage erected, before or after the passing of this Act, that is, the Act of 1943, under the Labourers Acts, 1883-1937. That is a wide category of houses to which it does not apply, because those houses are governed by another code.  It does not apply to houses erected under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, 1890-1931 as amended by the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932.  That covers practically all the houses built in the country during the last 20 years.  It does not apply to any house in respect of which any grant was made, before the passing of the Act of 1933, under the Housing Acts, 1924-1925.  It does not apply to any house in respect of which a grant was made under the Housing Acts, 1925-1931. It does not apply to any house in respect of which a grant was made, before the passing of this Act or is made after the passing of this Act, under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts, 1932-1942. It does not apply to any house in relation to which a grant was made under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts, 1929-39.  The category to which this Bill applies is very narrow.  But Deputy Dillon has covered a very wide field.  He has dealt with improvements to farm buildings and houses built under other Acts.  I suggest that, <Col N="2384" /> henceforth, he should be confined to the narrow scope of the Bill.</P>

I would hope that any legislation relating to the remission of rates enacted by this House would have the effect of helping those who wish to improve their holdings to do so.  I apprehend that the very restricted concession by way of remission of rates envisaged by this Bill, and the Acts which it amends, is not calculated to achieve that end at all.  I think the Minister might well have told us when he was introducing this Bill what purpose he has in mind.  Surely we do not remit rates just for fun?  Surely, when we undertake to remit rates, we do it for some purpose, not just for the purpose of gratifying an individual citizen?  I always understood that the whole purpose of the rates remission code was to ensure that those who sought to better themselves and the community at large would not be unduly penalised but that, by a remission of rates, they would be in some measure compensated for their superior industry and skill.  As I have seen this code operate, it appears to me that the very reverse purpose&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill proposes in <Col N="2388" /> Section 1 that sub-section (1) of Section 1 of the Local Government (Remission of Rates) Act, 1940, (No. 8 of 1940) as amended by the Local Government (Remission of Rates) Act, 1943 (No. 6 of 1943) be hereby amended. I look to the Minister to tell us why he desires to extend the operation of these Acts unless he hopes to promote the very purpose I have referred to. Surely, Sir, it is not irrelevant, if this House is asked to extend the operation of the two principal Acts as we are asked to-night, to inquire of the Minister, what have these Acts achieved in the periods in which they have been in operation?  How are we to know whether it is desirable to extend them unless we know what effect they have had while they have been in operation?  I am pressing the Minister to tell the House now whether in his judgment these Acts have resulted in an improvement of the people for whose benefit they were originally intended.  It seems it is an impertinence to inquire into that.  I do not see how any intelligent Deputy can bend his mind to the question as to whether the Bill should pass unless and until this question is answered.  I feel that the benefits conferred by these Acts have been quite insufficient.</P>
      <P>I want to take this occasion, when we propose to extend them for a further year, to improve them, to make it really worth while extending them, but the Minister recoils from that.  I want to remind you, Sir, that this is the kind of Bill on which representations of the kind I have to make, must be made on the Second Stage, because if I put down an amendment for the Committee Stage I shall be ruled out of order on the ground that the amendment would impose an additional charge on the Exchequer.  Unless we can prevail on the Minister himself to put down that amendment, once we pass the Second Stage, we are completely helpless, and I think it is reasonable for us to demand that the Minister will give us a review of how these Acts have worked and to ask that he will tell us what results he has to report as a result of the remissions that have been made in the past.</P>

He came into the House and spoke on the Bill without, apparently, knowing what the Bill is about.

      <P>If I were left alone, I could say what I have to say on the Bill in four minutes.  I take it that we are taking part in the work of an Assembly here for which generations of our people have worked and slaved and lost their lives, so that we might have an opportunity of discussing national affairs in a reasonable way.  I am trying to do it.  What I read from the Act of 1940 was intended <Col N="2393" /> to show what a residence within the meaning of that Act is.  I went on to say that from the things built to hold a separate family, including servants' accommodation, motor-house and garden-house and other outbuildings, there were excluded only those types of houses, classified in sub-section (1) of Section 1 of the 1940 Act and sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the 1943 Act, which had already received a subvention from the Government.  I got up to allay to some extent the doubts and fears of Deputy Dillon, and to make up for an omission for which the Minister was culpably responsible, that is that he did not tell the House in an intelligent way what this measure was about, and therefore, he was unable to guide the House in the reasonable and simple discussion which was all that was necessary on this Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy has occupied the time of the House explaining, not, I think, so clearly as I did, the very narrow class of residences to which this Bill applies.  He has endeavoured to mislead the House and the Chair by starting that I did not, in my opening remarks, sufficiently convey to Deputy Dillon how narrow the class of residences to which the Act which it is proposed to extend applies.  Well, Sir, you will have available to you, when you leave the Chair, the official report of my statement, and I would ask you to satisfy yourself when you read it that I told the House then what I am going to tell the House again now, that the Local Government (Remission of Rates) Bill applied to houses which were not cottages erected under the Labourers Acts &mdash; would Deputy Mulcahy consult, without answering me, for his own satisfaction the Act of 1943 and ascertain whether he will see there under reference letter (a) a provision excluding from the terms of the 1940 Bill cottages erected under the Labourers Acts?&mdash;also houses erected under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts as amended by the Housing Act, 1943; excluding also houses in respect of which a grant was made under the Housing Acts, 1924 and 1925; excluding also houses erected under the Housing Acts, 1925 to 1931; houses in <Col N="2394" /> respect of which a grant was made under the Housing Acts, 1932 to 1942, and houses which were relieved of rates in accordance with the terms of the Gaeltacht Housing Acts, 1929 to 1939. Those are the categories of houses which, in introducing this Bill, I told this House as plainly as I am telling it now were excluded from the benefits of the Acts of 1940 and 1943, and excluded because they benefit under other statutes.</P>
      <P>I am sure that most Deputies here, with one or two exceptions, were as well aware after I had made my opening statement as they are now of the fact that those broad categories of houses were not covered by the Act which we are now debating.  But for some reason, certainly not due, I submit, to any lack of clarity or audibility on my part, but due to a dullness of apprehension on the part of Deputy Dillon, a dullness which was apparently shared by the Leader of the Opposition, since both these gentlemen appear to have been in a sort of mental miasma since this debate started.</P>

As you remember, Sir, it was the original intention of the House to sit until next week, but at the request of a number of Deputies, of whom I think Deputy Dillon was one, who indicated that those members who had agricultural interests would be anxious to get away from Dublin as early as they possibly could to devote themselves to the work which requires their presence elsewhere, it was agreed that our Parliamentary programme for this session would be concluded to-night or to-morrow.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to provide funds for: (a) the purchase of Dunsink Observatory from Trinity College, Dublin, and (b) to meet payments out of voted moneys as required by Section 27 (2) (c) of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.</P>
      <P>As a result of negotiations entered into some time ago it was ascertained that the authorities of Trinity College, Dublin, were prepared to dispose of Dunsink Observatory, Co. Dublin.  The property comprises the Observatory House, Dunsink House, an anemometer house, a telescope house, a gate lodge and out-buildings standing on some 24 acres of land.  The College authorities are prepared to sell the property with the furniture, library, astronomical instruments and other technical equipment for £4,500, a price which is considered reasonable.</P>
      <P>There is under consideration a proposal to establish a new Constituent School of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, which it is provisionally contemplated would be called the School of Cosmic Physics, and in due course, if it be decided to adopt the proposal, the authority of the Oireachtas for the establishment of the school will be sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The observatory at Dunsink would provide facilities for the new school. If the school were already established, the purchase of the property could be effected by the Institute for Advanced Studies and the cost borne on its own funds, which are provided out of voted monies, but, owing to certain difficulties, it may be some time before the proposals for the new school can be submitted to the Oireachtas.  As the observatory property would be a <Col N="2399" /> valuable acquisition for State purposes in any event and apart from the question of the new school, it is proposed, in the special circumstances, to make the purchase as an ordinary purchase for State purposes and to bear the cost on the Vote for Public Works and Buildings.  The Supplementary Estimate provides for the grant of the necessary funds.</P>
    <P>It was enacted by the Barrow Drainage Acts, 1927 and 1933, that a sum equal to one-half of the total costs and expenses incurred by the Commissioners of Public Works in carrying out the River Barrow drainage scheme should be advanced by the commissioners out of moneys under their control and applicable to loans and that the amount so advanced, with interest thereon, should be repaid to the commissioners by the county councils concerned by an annual sum of such amount as should be fixed by the Minister for Finance.  The cost of the drainage scheme was £547,518, of which one half, i.e., £273,759, was advanced by the commissioners as provided in the Acts.  The annual sum for the repayment of this advance was fixed by the Minister for Finance at £21,570 12s. 10d., and was payable by the County Councils of Kildare, Laoighis and Offaly for a period of 35 financial years beginning on the 1st April, 1938, in two equal moieties, on the 30th September and 31st March in each financial year.  This annual sum has hitherto been paid to the Commismissioners of Public Works and credited by them to the Local Loans Fund established in 1935.  The figures for the three counties concerned were: Kildare, £7,322; Leix, £7,766, and Offaly, £6,483.</P>
    <P>Under Section 27 of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, it was enacted that, as from (and including) the financial year beginning after the Appointed Day fixed under that Act and for the balance of the 35-year period mentioned above, the said annual sum of £21,570 12s. 10d. should cease to be payable by the three county councils mentioned; and that in lieu thereof the said county councils should pay to the Commissioners of Public Works a sum of £7,154 per annum; and the balance of the said <Col N="2400" /> annual sum should be made good to the Commissioners&mdash;for the credit of the Local Loans Fund&mdash;out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas.  The 31st March, 1945, has been fixed as the Appointed Day under the Act, and, accordingly, as from the 1st April, 1945, and for a period of 28 years, a sum of £14,416 12s. 10d. will need to be made good out of voted moneys.  The Supplementary Estimate covers the payments falling due in the current year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This sum has been arrived at in full agreement with the authorities of Trinity College.  I take it that you would hardly find the State adopting the unusual course of offering to a vendor a price in excess of the price sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree, but I would imagine that, when the price named by the university was so manifestly inadequate, the Government would have taken the occasion of expressing the appreciation of the Oireachtas to the university in giving the property for so small a sum.  I may be quite mistaken as to the value of scientific instruments, but I should have thought that the equipment at Dunsink, never mind the buildings and the land there, would be worth the total sum that we have undertaken to pay the university.  If that is so I would have thought it an occasion on which the Parliamentary Secretary, on behalf of the Government, might <Col N="2401" /> have made some gracious acknowledgement to the university for its gesture.</P>
      <P>I want to direct the attention of the House to a new departure.  Heretofore, before we proceeded to buy equipment for a State institution, the courtesy used to be paid to Dáil Éireann of at least going through the form of inquiring as to whether the House approved of the erection of the institution or not.  We are now blandly informed that the Government has bought Dunsink, and all its equipment, with a view to establishing the School of Cosmic Physics and that, when they have time to get around to it, they will come and consult the House about the steps necessary to set on foot that institute.  Is there any precedent for that proceeding?  Are we to be told in future that, whether we like it or not, the Government are going to do something and that the business of putting the legislation through for the purpose of doing that thing does not depend in the very least on argument or discussion in this House?  I have directed the attention of the House more than once to the trend of Government policy in regard to these institutes.  Gradually, each faculty in our universities is to be thrown on one side and its functions are to be handed over to an institute created <i>ad hoc</i> by this House, apparently with the determination to turn our universities into technical schools, depriving them of all facility for research, depriving them of all ability to get grants which would enable the professors and students of those universities to do the work that would bring lustre and credit upon our universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In future, apparently, no Irishman need hope to get himself a great place in the world of learning if he has not access to the roster of members of the institutes of higher learning or cosmic physics.  Do Deputies realise what that means?  At present, any citizen of this State can present himself for the matriculation examination and has a right to proceed to a degree in our universities.  If funds are available, a man's own university will afford him an opportunity of pursuing research and post-graduate work in his own <Col N="2402" /> sphere and he can attain in our universities to the highest rank of international fame and reputation if he has the ability to do so.  But now this House appears deliberately, under the leadership of the Government, to be laying down the proposition that no further endowment is to go to either Trinity College, Dublin, or the National University of Ireland.  That hits both universities but it hits the National University far the harder. Trinity has huge endowments accumulated over the centuries out of which they can endow their students. National has nothing except what it gets from State funds and from students' fees.  The students of National are mostly poor men's sons and they cannot afford to pay big fees. Therefore, the university is more and more thrown back on such funds as the State will provide.  If we are going to set up in every branch of learning a rival institute to our own university how can that university hope to get the funds it must have if it is to cater for the ever-growing number of students entering its doors?</P>
    <P>It astonishes me that graduates of that university in this House have not a single word to say in defence of their own university.  Do the Deputies who have graduated in the National University look on with equanimity at that university being slowly destroyed?</P>

      <P>Well, Sir, Dunsink is being acquired, not for the National University of Ireland, but for a new institute although this House has heard nothing, until it is referred to casually by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, in the course of his announcement that he has purchased from Trinity College, Dublin, all this property for £4,500. Does not the Chair think that it is a queer thing to announce casually that we are going to start an institute of cosmic physics without ever mentioning it to the House?  It reminds one of the republic that turned up quite unexpectedly last night, just by the by. It certainly strikes me as very odd.  Is <Col N="2403" /> the Parliamentary Secretary in a position to tell us anything about the institute of cosmic physics?  Could he tell us what cosmic physics are?</P>

      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary answer the question now?  His backbenchers are whacking answers all over the place.  I suspect they are not very well informed.  The Parliamentary Secretary, presumably, knows.  Would he tell us is this institute of cosmic physics going to be staffed by University College, Dublin, by the National University, or by whom?  Are we going to bring in professors from abroad&mdash;that course could be justified&mdash;or are we going to give the directorship of this institute to some well-known scholar in our own country?  What additional expenditure does the purchase of Dunsink presage? Presumably somebody is going to hold Dunsink and maintain it.  I cannot picture the carpenters out of the Board of Works going up and putting Dunsink in order.  If we are going to acquire Dunsink, with all its instruments, presumably some organisation is going to be set up to maintain it. Could the Parliamentary Secretary forecast for us what the expenditure on such organisation is going to be, <Col N="2404" /> or what form the organisation is going to take?  All these questions would be very relevant to the matters under review.</P>
      <P>I frankly cannot follow closely the appropriation the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned in connection with the Barrow drainage, but this occurred to me&mdash;he says that he finds it incumbent upon him to bring in a Supplementary Estimate for this sum in lieu of rates levied on the three counties which he named consequential on legislation that was passed last year. Why is it necessary to bring in a Supplementary Estimate?  This was an ascertained sum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the provision made for girls by this admirable convent at Henrietta Street, I want to ask the Minister a few questions. We are all familiar with the suggestion when girls are before the district justice from time to time, that they should retire to this convent for a period on condition of being given the benefit of the Probation of Offenders Act.  But is there any obligation on these girls to stay in the convent?  I think not.  When girls give an undertaking to reform, the justices have reason to expect that some girls' fall from grace is due mainly to circumstances for which they are not primarily responsible, to bad company and to people who deliberately try to turn them from the ways of virtue.  When they mean to turn over a new leaf, and give an undertaking to go to the convent, they are very often drawn out of the convent, and the nuns, anxious as they are to retain them, find that they are not able to require them to stay there.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister intend to leave that situation as it is indefinitely, or does he think the time has come to consider a plan, where district justices deem it to be in the best interests of girls, that they should be vested with powers to commit them to an institution of this kind, as at present committals may be made to the Borstal? It seems to me that if the Minister, knowing the excellence of the work of the nuns, thinks it right to subsidise that work&mdash;with which I entirely agree &mdash;he might consider giving power compelling these girls to go to such institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <P>Is it envisaged that the girls make some contribution?  If this <Col N="2408" /> is the limited provision the Minister intends to make for this class of girl, it would be reasonable to inquire if he has anything of a more permanent character in mind.  I do not think the Minister or any Deputy feels that, if this was the limit of the provision we intended to make, we were doing enough.  Surely the Minister would not think it unreasonable to be asked if there was any permanent plan for this type of problem?  Is this all that is going to be done?</P>

    <P>This amendment is intended to implement the promise I made yesterday, in so far as it is practicable to do so. There is a point of some importance to which I did not advert yesterday and which has been brought to my notice. It is important to preserve the power we have at the present time to control the departure of persons from the State.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We have people leaving this country and going to Britain at the present time.  First of all, there are certain administrative arrangements which require control between the two countries.  Then, in the case of young persons, especially young girls of tender age, we want to have control to see that those going out are of an age at which they can look after themselves.  There is also the question of married women whose husbands go over and leave children behind.  There is the further question of the need we have for turf production, and there is the danger of allowing our agricultural workers to go out freely.  It would be wrong for us to deprive ourselves at the present time of the right to maintain these controls. Therefore, Deputies will notice that in the insertion of this new paragraph instead of paragraph (j), we have omitted the phrase &ldquo;other than natural-born Irish citizens&rdquo; in regard to departure from the State.  The control over entry and movement within the State is limited to non-nationals, but in the other case&mdash;that of departure out of the State&mdash;we want to maintain control even of natural-born Irish citizens.  It will be seen <Col N="2410" /> later that we are putting in a positive prohibition of any Emergency Order regulating these matters.  Our view has been that the words within the brackets are sufficient by themselves to exclude Irish citizens, but some apprehension was expressed by Deputies and the prohibition is being put in to meet the point.</P>

      <P>One of my points in moving the amendment that was inserted in the Bill on the Committee Stage yesterday was that I thought the time had come, among other things, to withdraw any power of prohibition that the Government might have or be exercising now on the exit of Irish nationals from this country if they wanted to go.  I think that it is entirely wrong under the present circumstances for the Government to maintain that kind of power and to that extent I resist the amendment in the form in which the Taoiseach puts it.  I submit that the form in which I was presenting it myself in amendment No. 2 on the Order Paper ought to be accepted.</P>
      <P>In July 1945, why should the Government be seeking power to interfere with the movement of people who want to leave this country?  If the conditions in this country are such that they want to leave it, whether they are young or whether they are married or whether they are workers that could be useful throughout the country, why should we interfere with the liberty of the individual citizen here and pin him to circumstances under which he does not want to exist?  It was all very well during the emergency to be holding these powers, but we have come now to the time when the Government should cease to require them.</P>

      <P>Is it not possible that the Government may use these powers unduly to stop young men, especially those demobilised from the army, from going away to England for work or for some other purpose?  Will the Government <Col N="2411" /> see that the power they take will not be used unnecessarily to prevent the departure of a young man of 21 who wants to go to England to get a job at £4 or £5 a week, in order to send something home to his mother?  Will they say to such a young man: &ldquo;You cannot go away; go and join the Construction Corps?&rdquo; The Construction Corps is paying only about one-fifth of the wage he could get abroad.  I have had cases of young men who wanted to help the household at home and who were willing to go away, but who were told they would not be let go as there was alternative employment at home.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that there is a Fianna Fáil majority here, it is quite possible that these powers will be given to the Government, so I ask that those in charge should not prevent young men from getting away to other countries.  I ask the Taoiseach for a guarantee that these powers will not be used unduly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been a very serious step that has been taken by the Government in interfering with citizens who wish to leave this country. We all realise the necessity for certain restrictions during the war, but now that the war in Europe has concluded the Government should be very slow to interfere with the rights of citizens who desire to leave the country.  The Taoiseach realises, no doubt, that a large percentage of our young men were forced during the war years to leave this country in search of work in England.  If any of those men have decided to establish their homes in England and to return to Ireland no more, on account of the guaranteed employment and good wages in England, and if they wish to bring their wives over to Great Britain, they should be allowed to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have drawn the attention of the Taoiseach and of his Department to several cases in my own constituency, where the wives of these workers are anxious to join their husbands and establish their homes in England, where they are guaranteed full-time employment and decent wages.  The Government should give sympathetic <Col N="2412" /> consideration to people of that nature, and I would be very glad if the Taoiseach, who undoubtedly realises the situation, would not stand in the way of any married man or young person who desires to live in decency with his family.  It would be wrong that any Government Order should prohibit a married woman from joining her husband.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach says that there may be a shortage of labour for turf production if there are no restrictions. Surely to goodness, no Deputy who has brains, commonsense and intelligence could stand in the way of any man who wants to better himself. There is nothing at the present time for anybody here&mdash;neither work nor wages&mdash;so why should a Government Order prevent any citizen from leaving? It is a disgraceful state of affairs that the Government should attempt to do so.  These men want food, work, clothing and shelter, and are entitled to seek it wherever they wish.  If there is a vote on this, I will vote against it.  The responsibility is on the Taoiseach's shoulders, and I hope he will see his way to have the amendment withdrawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Flanagan had not drifted from the point he started on, he had the kernel of an argument and would have his case placed more solidly.  It is proposed to insert in the measure a provision to continue the power to prohibit, restrict and control the departure of citizens from our country.  The rest of it does not matter, and it deals with people who may wish to come in and whom we may not want; but there is power under the Aliens Act, so that, even if they do get here, they can be interned and eventually sent back again.  I concentrate on the single point of special importance: we are now seeking power to prohibit, restrict and control the departure of our own citizens, and we are putting that into the framework of an Act which is to make provision for securing the public safety and the preservation of the State in time of war.  Of course, it is no longer a proper thing to put it into such a framework.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2413" /> In dealing with this matter the Taoiseach has not looked at it from the point of view of the national emergency. We all know there is a very serious problem facing the country and people are fleeing from it at the rate of 100 a day, mainly on account of the shockingly bad economic conditions here, in comparison with the expansion theories of production on the other side and the hope held out to everybody from the fructification of those measures.  In face of the draw these schemes have on the other side, in comparison to what is offered here, we are foolish enough to create a measure of coercion, to make it an offence for people to leave this country.  I think people should be induced to stay here, by proposals to make life better and by an appeal to them so that, with some little change in our material circumstances, their ordinary national pride and love of home and disinclination to leave the country may make them decide to stay here.  Apparently, the Government despairs of doing anything like that and proposes instead to take power to prohibit them from leaving,. making the pretence that that is for the preservation of public security in time of war.</P>
    <P>What is to be the sequel to that? If we make it an offence for a person to leave and if a person does leave, are we going to have an extradition treaty with England to get them back and, on getting them back, do we intend to deal with those who fled by putting them in jail?  Are we to have running through the courts the same thing as happened recently in regard to soldiers who fled from here and entered armies in other countries and came back when they thought their freedom was assured?  Is it right to brand as a criminal someone who wants to better himself and improve his conditions?  Although there is a serious economic problem here, we are resorting to the crudest methods and holding out a white flag and saying that the only thing we can do is to take power to make it a criminal offence for people to leave.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the difficulties confronting the Taoiseach and <Col N="2414" /> can understand the reason for the introduction of the amendment, but as a representative of a constituency from which many workers emigrate to Great Britain, I am bound to protest against this prohibition.  I have had to visit the Department of Industry and Commerce on a number of occasions and have always received reasonable consideration, but there have been times when men and women have been prohibited from emigrating when they wished to do so.</P>
      <P>If this amendment is accepted, those who are in bad economic circumstances may make representations through a Deputy to the Department of Industry and Commerce, but the representations will be of no avail.  I made representations a few days ago on behalf of a man who had some knowledge of turf-cutting and who was not in the best circumstances.  He went so far as to put his mother into a home, in order to go to England to secure money to clear a certain debt.  This man was prohibited from emigrating.  He had a small area of land, about three arable acres.  That is one way in which a man may suffer if this amendment is accepted.  Again, the Minister quotes to us his reason for the control of emigration. I entirely agree with one point that he made with regard to the control of emigration of young girls of a certain age.  I fully agree with that, and I think that these girls should reach a certain age before they should be allowed to leave the country.  Men, of course, are in a different category, and they can leave the country at 17 or 18 years of age.  But the Minister goes on from that and points out the danger of not having a sufficient number of men in this country for the saving of turf.  Well, it seems to me that the turf season is practically over at the moment, and if turf has not been saved up to this, it must be the people's own fault, and I do not think there is any reason why such people should be kept here merely for the production of turf, in this season at any rate.  For that reason, I do not think that the plea put forward by the Minister in that regard could carry its weight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, I know of several cases of young women whose husbands are <Col N="2415" /> living in England.  These young women have made efforts to get over there, to live with their husbands, set up homes there and settle down, and yet they are told that they cannot be permitted to go there.  They have been able to produce affidavits showing that their children will be taken care of by the grandmother or grandfathers, or other relations, while they are away, and still they cannot get permits to leave.  Now, in opposing this, I want to make it quite clear that I am not doing so merely for the sake of opposing it, but that I am opposing it from the point of view of the people I represent.  For that reason, I think, this control of emigration should be withdrawn or, at least, that it should be modified to some extent.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to understand the mentality of the people in opposition here.  Every week, we come in here and we find motions put down by the people on the opposite side, asking what the Government is doing to prevent the emigration of numbers of our people to other countries.  All that is pure propaganda against the Government, designed to demonstrate to numbers of people who find it necessary to go across the water to earn a livelihood that it is the Government's fault that they have to go.  Yet, now, when the Government brings in a clause in this Act to control emigration and to see that a sufficient number of people will be retained here to deal with agriculture and turf production, and to see that there will be sufficient labour left here to produce sufficient food and fuel for the people of this country, we have a terrible hullabaloo from that side of the House to the effect that the Taoiseach is interfering with the liberty of the people.  A great deal has been said from the other side of the House about the wives of people going across to join their husbands in England.  As far as I am aware, facilities have been given to these people, and it is the British Government, in the majority of cases, that has prevented the wives of workers in England going across to join their husbands.  Even if they are permitted to go across to join their <Col N="2416" /> husbands, I think there is no reason why they should not bring their families with them.  Deputy Cafferky has mentioned the production of affidavits to the effect that the grandmothers, grandfathers or other relations of the children will take care of them, but I think that if a woman wants to go across to England to join her husband, and if the husband intends to remain there and settle down for good, then she should bring her family across with her.</P>
      <P>So far as I know, there is a desire to facilitate people to go across the water to get work in England who, because of shortage of materials, such as building materials, and so on, are unable to get work here for the moment, and I quite agree that such people should be given facilities, sooner than having them wandering around here, drawing the dole and unable to earn a decent livelihood.  It was for that reason that the Government gave such people an opportunity to go across.  These people send back their earnings here in the shape of sterling assets which the Opposition told us were no good to us. Now, however, we have a terrible hullabaloo from Fine Gael, from the Labour Party and from Clann na Talmhan, that the Government is introducing a clause here, not to prevent emigration, but to control it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the fact that it is necessary to introduce such an amendment as we are now discussing is rather a strong indictment, not <Col N="2417" /> only of the present Government but of previous Governments.  In previous days we had always hoped that once we were given the control of our own affairs in this country we would be in a position to give to our people the opportunity of earning a reasonably good livelihood here.  In my early days, we always bemoaned the fate and the fact that so many of our young people had to emigrate from this country. Of course, we have to accept the situation as it stands, but I am sure it is a very great disillusionment to those of us who anticipated, 25 or 30 years ago, that a home Government would prevent the emigration of our people and provide employment for them at home, to find that we should now be presented with the same deplorable sight of our young people still leaving our shores to seek the employment abroad which they cannot find at home.  However, we must face up to the situation that after about 25 years of home government compulsory legislation must be introduced to prevent our people from leaving this country.</P>
      <P>Our people, ordinarily, do not leave this country for love of another country. They leave this country because they are forced to do so by necessity, and in spite of the criticisms that had been levelled from one side of the House or the other, inconvenience and hardship will be inflicted on certain sections of our community if this amendment is passed.  Is it not time to consider on broader lines how far this situation can be remedied?  We can pass legislation.  The majority in this House can do that, and I hope they will continue to do that, but legislation curtailing the liberty of the people, at the best, is unfortunate legislation and it is bad legislation.</P>
      <P>Surely the intelligence of the representatives in this House should be concentrated on seeing if an alternative method could be found of encouraging our people to remain in this country. I am not saying that a solution is easy or even possible, but I do think that this discussion to-night should arouse serious thinking in honest-minded people and make them seriously consider the best way of finding a solution to this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2418" /> I do resent, and strongly resent, the fact that these restrictions are confined primarily to agricultural workers. There is no doubt about the fact that, allied as we are to the earning capacity of our people working in England, under whatever conditions they work, they can command higher wages there than they can command here.  The money is as valuable to them in England or to the people at home as the money earned here.  Most of them send their money home.  Their earning capacity is greater than that of the people employed here and their earnings are of greater value to them than are the earnings of the people working here.  Then, why should such a restriction as this be placed upon the agricultural workers?  Those connected with agriculture have ever been a depressed section of the community, though they are an important section of the community and though their importance is recognised.  Their wages, hours of work and general conditions have never been on a par with those of workers engaged in commercial and industrial pursuits.  Under emergency conditions, we find them singled out because they are the most useful section of our people, though the most poorly paid.  I object to that.  Deputy McGilligan made a very able speech here on currency affairs as between Great Britain and ourselves.  I ask him to explain why he is prepared to widen the possibility of outflow of our people to earn big money and send that money back here.</P>

      <P>I am merely dealing with the points raised here this evening and in a recent debate.  I consider that it is very injudicious to allow this free movement of our people out of the country.  If what Deputy McGilligan said recently is correct&mdash; and I believe that it has a good deal of foundation&mdash;the influx of emergency currency here has an inflationary tendency. If it has that effect, as I am satisfied it has to some extent, then the more we allow people out of the country, the greater the increase in the inflow of sterling.  That position is bad and I am satisfied that the Government is only tinkering with the problem by these restrictions on sections of our people.  I think that the position will bring bad results both presently and in the future.  This matter is much more deeply rooted than the amendment would suggest.  The amendment is not sufficient as a method of tackling it.  This matter is fundamental to our existence and the amendment will, in no way, solve the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am impelled to speak as a result of listening to the very convincing case made by Deputy Maguire.  The case is all the more convincing because the Deputy was for so long a member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Not alone was he a member of it; he was chairman of that Party.  I noted with some interest the gloomy faces on the Fianna Fáil Benches when Deputy Maguire was speaking.  I am sure they felt that the case he made was a telling one.  His sincerity they could not question.  We have now had about 25 years of self-government.  The present Government had a plan to solve the unemployment problem.  Not alone had they a plan but they proposed, in their exuberance at one period of their career, to call back the emigrants by means of a bugle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the only method of keeping our people at home is by compulsion or, as it has been described by some Deputies, coercion.  It strikes me that <Col N="2420" /> that is the most telling indictment against our administration in the recent past.  For a number of years, we have been endeavouring to increase employment.  We have seen different methods employed by successive Governments and it should be possible now to estimate, as a result of those experiments and that experience, the relative benefits which have accrued. Irrespective of the difference in numbers put into employment by different Governments and irrespective of the signal failure which has attended Fianna Fáil, the deplorable fact is that the only means we have of retaining our people here is by what, in former times, would be described as a Coercion Act.  If there is anything degrading to our elected representatives, it is the fact that, at this period in our history, we have got to resort to coercive methods to retain our people at home.  I wish to restate in as strong a manner as I can the case made by Deputy Maguire and I support the opposition put forward to the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies have been unable to understand why Deputy McGilligan objected to this amendment.  Do I do him injustice when I say that he objected to it because he was labouring under the illusion that it was no crime in Ireland to wish to be free.  If Deputies were told to-morrow that the citizens of Belgium, Poland or Denmark were prohibited from leaving their country, what conclusion would they draw?  We all know that the Taoiseach is going to defend all this&mdash; and heaven, too-on the ground that there is an emergency.  When does the Taoiseach propose to abandon the right to control citizens of Ireland who desire to leave Ireland?  When does he propose to give up that right? Deputy McGilligan has pointed out that the majority of the people leaving this country for Great Britain do not go because they want to go.  They go because they cannot get a living here or they go because they think that what is called a living in Ireland, compared with the kind of living they can get in Great Britain, is insufferable, and they choose to go into exile for <Col N="2421" /> the sake of the material benefits exile will confer upon them.</P>
      <P>Do Deputies imagine that in our newly-born Republic for the next five or six years, we shall not be faced with problems of a higher standard of living abroad than we have at home unless we can do something at home substantially to raise the standard of living obtained in the new Republic? But suppose the best device that the Taoiseach can propound for restraining our people from leaving the new Republic, in search of the flesh-pots of the outer world, is to pass a law making it a crime to leave Ireland, has he thought of the answer to the dilemma suggested by Deputy McGilligan? Are we going to negotiate an extradition treaty with Great Britain to get them back again and, when we get them back, are we going to try them for the crime of refusing to go on the dole and preferring to earn their bread by the sweat of their brow?  It does not make sense to me. But one thing is significant and I ask the House again to bear it in mind&mdash;I ask the Opposition especially.  At a certain point on the Committee Stage of this Bill the Taoiseach suddenly became all conciliation.  Yes, he would meet the Opposition.  Why, certainly, he would be glad to do what the Deputy suggested in connection with another amendment.  In this whirl of cordiality, he undertook positively to prohibit himself from preventing Irish citizens from leaving Ireland under this code.  But when he thought it out, he determined he was going to take out of the promised amendment the only part of the amendment that mattered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He comes to us in all frankness to tell us he is about to divest himself of the power he has now got to prevent people from coming in here.  Why? Because he has abandoned the powers in other statutes to prevent their coming in.  He is not going to prevent us from moving about from place to place in our own country.  Benisons pour down upon his head for this great concession! But on the only question that really matters, whether the citizens of this State should be free to leave and come back to this country, <Col N="2422" /> the emergency is so great, the danger of war is so alarming he cannot consent to that.  Very well.  Suppose he says: &ldquo;I have got to get turf, to get fuel for the people and certain other things which we require.  I am not able to induce the farm labourers of this country to stay in the country.&rdquo; If he says: &ldquo;I have not got the resources to keep them, I must keep them by force or we must all starve,&rdquo; good and well, but let him tell us how long he wants that power.  Are we, under the new Republican dispensation, to be told that for evermore, before we leave this country we must get a licence from the Government of the day.  Is it any wonder that Deputy McGilligan gets so uneasy?</P>
    <P>Deputy Fogarty is shocked because we aspire to be free men.  That is the danger of these Emergency Powers Acts.  That is the danger of becoming accustomed to Emergency Powers legislation.  Is it a fact that we are all becoming accustomed to being slaves? Is it a fact that all the Deputies on that side of the House do not think there is anything strange about being forbidden to pass in and out of the country?  Do they think that that should be part of our ordinary law? Do they think that what is believed to be wrong in another country should be right in ours?  The Taoiseach can now make the case that he must get turf and the crops saved, but will he answer this question: when is he going to abandon the power and leave us free to pass and repass?  Does he remember that the power which he seeks is a power which, as Deputy Cafferky says, chiefly affects the labouring man and has little effect on the professional classes or those who have plenty of money whose labour is not deemed to be so essential as to prohibit their leaving the country?  I wonder whether any Deputy in this House will be prepared to distinguish clearly between slavery and being kept within the charmed circle where you must either work for the wages you can get or starve.  In the old days, if anybody sought to oppress a man by beating down his standard of living, that man's remedy was to fare forth into the new world.  How much would his oppressors have given in those days for such <Col N="2423" /> a power as is enshrined in this Bill? Beaten down as were our people in those days, their oppressors never dared to claim such power.  It may be the Taoiseach is justified in having that power during the threat of war or the emergency through which we have passed and possibly for a short time to come, but surely it is incumbent upon him to tell us, when he asks for its renewal, when he is going to make people in this country free men again.</P>

      <P>As a representative of workers, I would strongly appeal to the Taoiseach not to insist on this amendment.  Deputies representing rural Ireland know that we are getting letters day after day from men asking us to try to get them to Britain.  At the moment there are a number of workers who are not eligible for the dole.  They are told because they live in rural areas that there is work in the country.  I know myself that many of these men are obliged to go to relieving officers now because they are not in receipt of unemployment insurance or the dole.  We were all told that freedom was a great thing but to-day we have thousands of men who are anxious to return to Éire and they are afraid to come back&mdash;thousands of men who left the country to better the position of themselves, their wives and their families.  They will not be allowed to return.  There are thousands more who are anxious to get away.  I was surprised to hear Deputy Fogarty say that they were going.  I pass the Permit Office frequently on my way to Ballsbridge and what do I see?  Hundreds of young men and women queued up at the Permit Office&mdash;sometimes under the blazing sun but more often in rain and cold.  They come from all parts of the country to try to get passports.  I watched them there one day last week when the porter came out, let in a small number and stopped the remainder.  I know many people who came from the country and who had to stay overnight in the city because they could not get their passports on the day they arrived. Some of them were not very well supplied with pocket money.  I think the Taoiseach, as the Minister for External <Col N="2424" /> Affairs, should look into this matter and ensure that people, some of them returning to Britain, should get more facilities.</P>
      <P>We hear a lot of talk at present about a scarcity of labour in rural areas.  I come from the best agricultural county in Ireland and I know that we have plenty of labour and that there are many men in the country who cannot get work.  Last week we had thousands of unemployed.</P>

I should also like to know if he will allow wives to join their husbands who are in Great Britain. The wives of many of our men who left the country go up to meet their husbands in the North of Ireland and have to come back again.  I have a letter here from a young man in South Africa who served for years in the Irish Army and who, two months before his time, decided to join the R.A.F.  He is from my own constituency and in this letter he asks if he can return to his wife and family.  I asked a question about these men who left and got a sort of assurance from the Minister for Defence that no action would be taken against them, that the authorities were not bothering about them, but when some of them came back to Dublin they were arrested and court-martialled.  Will the Taoiseach tell the Dáil how many of these men are in that position to-day?</P>

On a previous occasion, when the question of Irishmen in Britain who were conscripted into the British Army arose, the Taoiseach said here that he had dealt with the matter two years ago.  I went back over the debates and found that if a man was in Britain for two years, he could be conscripted into the British Army, and I should like to know whether our men&mdash;I understand to the number of 40,000 or 50,000&mdash;who left the Irish Army can return.  Will we get any assurance for the mothers and fathers, the wives and children of <Col N="2426" /> these men that they can come back to their own country without running the risk of arrest?  I do not mind Deputies talking about a scarcity of labour because I see no scarcity of labour.  I get letters from these men every day in the week asking if I can do anything to get them away.  These men are not agricultural labourers, but, because they are not on the labour exchange, they will not be allowed to go to Britain.</P>

      <P>I think it very unfair of Fianna Fáil Deputies to be interrupting speakers on this side.  They must remember that we can adopt that attitude, if we like, when they are speaking.  It is surprising that people who are the first to call for order should interrupt a new Deputy who is not familiar with procedure.  They will not interrupt Deputies who have been here for longer periods, such as Deputy McGilligan or Deputy Dillon, because they would get their answer.</P>

      <P>The Minister took notice of them.  I ask the Taoiseach, <Col N="2427" /> in all sincerity, to repeal these regulations, if the Army is to be demobilised and no work provided for them.  Everyone of us was sent in here by the votes of the people, and it is up to each of us to say what the people want us to say and not to be mere yes-men. I have been in the House since 1943 and I notice that sometimes we cannot find ten Deputies to listen to the debates.  It would be better for the country, and for each and every one of us, if we would listen to one another, within reason.  I would ask the Taoiseach to abolish the emergency powers which are keeping the working classes and their families in misery and hardship.  The man in the rural areas, the man at the cross roads, is wanted only at election time, and the Fianna Fáil policy is: &ldquo;Stay where you are, whether you are working or not.&rdquo; The people in the towns have some privilege; if they are on the labour exchange they will get to Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were hundreds of men in the rural areas signing on at the police barracks.  To-day they are not allowed to sign; they are told there is plenty of work in the country.  As one who is constantly in touch with the working classes, I say that you will find the wives of those men going to the home assistance office at the end of the week.  I think it would be far better for everyone concerned if those men were free to leave the country. There was a war for freedom, but the class that I represent, the workers, have no freedom.  In the rural districts, they are compelled to remain at home, and that is a great injustice to the poor unemployed man who is trying to keep going on nothing.  It is all very fine for us to come in here in luxury, and have parties and all the rest of it.  A lot of people here have been here too long, and they have forgotten the people outside altogether.  Put them on the labour exchange or on national health insurance and see how long they will last. You would have another civil war or a revolution if that happened.  But the poor working man, especially in the rural areas, is compelled, when there is work for him, to work for the miserable <Col N="2428" /> wage of £1 19s. 6d. per week.  How can he keep his family on that?  Is it any wonder&mdash;perhaps this is not in order&mdash;that we have tuberculosis?  Is it any wonder that our people are dying in sanatoria?  I know that since this emergency even the people who are working have not been able to get the necessaries of life.</P>

I hope he will give those people every consideration, because they need it now more than ever before in view of the proposed demobilisation from the Army of thousands of men who, I suppose, will be thrown on the labour exchanges throughout the whole of Éire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to try to clarify the position somewhat.  I understand that we are discussing a motion by the Taoiseach to &ldquo;authorise and provide for the prohibition, restriction or control of the entry of persons (other than natural-born Irish citizens) into the State or the departure of persons out of the State and the movements of persons (other than natural-born Irish citizens) within the State.&rdquo; I want to get the position cleared up.  Some Deputies are discussing this matter as if we were going to impose a whole lot of restrictions on natural-born Irish <Col N="2429" /> citizens.  We are not.  In order to get that cleared up, I should like if the Taoiseach would explain it himself.  It would obviate a lot of looseness in discussion.</P>

      <P>It appears to me that all the speeches delivered to-night from the Opposition Benches have been based on one completely false hypothesis. All those speeches seemed to be based on the hypothesis that the Government is seeking powers which it is going to use tyrannically, and that there will be complete prohibition on the departure of any man, woman or child who proposes to leave the country.  All the speeches seemed to be based on that hypothesis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I will take the hypothesis down a peg, and I still hold that it is an absolutely false hypothesis to assume that the Government is to have a complete prohibition on every poor man, woman or child who wishes to leave the country.  I think the farmers of this country, particularly the tillage farmers, will have very little thanks for those members who seem to want the Government to encourage agricultural workers to flee from the country.  Those people who are interested in our fuel situation, <Col N="2430" /> and who are likely to suffer from a shortage of fuel, will have very little thanks for Clann na Talmhan, Labour or Fine Gael, for their speeches here to-night.  Agriculture and turf production have been referred to by several speakers.  I am particularly interested in the building trade.  I know that a big building scheme has been prepared, and that it is very necessary that that scheme should be put into operation in this City of Dublin.  My fear is that, when we get the necessary materials to enable us to proceed with that scheme, our chief difficulty will be shortage of labour, particularly of skilled labour.</P>
      <P>I think it is quite right that the Government should step in, in the interests of the country, and have a measure of control over the movements of the people from this country. It has been stated here to-night that the only reason why people leave this country to look for work abroad is that they cannot find it at home.  I can contradict that, from my own daily experience almost, and certainly from my weekly experience.  Not a week passes in which I do not find people ready to leave quite good situations in this country, apparently out of a spirit of adventure or a desire for change, to look for work on the other side.</P>
