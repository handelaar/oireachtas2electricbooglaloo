      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware of the hardships suffered by citizens of Dublin on account of their failure to secure adequate supplies of fuel during the past few weeks; and, if so, if he is prepared to ensure that in similar circumstances in the future when animal-drawn vehicles are unable to-deliver fuel, emergency transport is provided to carry supplies before undue and unnecessary hardships are caused.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible that there were individual cases of hardship, owing to the difficulties experienced in delivering fuel recently but, having regard to the very exceptional weather conditions, all concerned with the distribution of fuel are to be complimented on the manner in which they overcame these difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the question. I asked the Minister if he would see that vehicles will be made available if a frost occurs again and that hardships will not have to be borne such as were borne within the last few weeks in all parts of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider Deputy Byrne's proposal, inasmuch as Great Britain, which is engaged in a world war, can use military lorries to distribute fuel in London? If, as he admits, serious hardship accrues as a result of the difficulties <Col N="1984" /> of the last fortnight, surely the Minister would consider it good policy to ask his colleague, the Minister for Defence, to place similar facilities at his disposal.  Will he consider that, in the event of any similar crisis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what the Deputy asks.  He asks if, in the future, the Minister will give a hand out to the merchants when they are using their best endeavour and are overcome by unforeseen difficulties, such as there have been recently.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that people had to walk four and five miles from corporation housing schemes to look for small quantities of fuel in the City of Dublin and compete against others in Summerhill and other places who had not sufficient for themselves?  This has caused untold hardship on some people and I ask if the Minister will see that it does not occur again and that he will make petrol-drawn vehicles available in the event of another frost.</P>

      <P>Lime burners in the Carrickmacross area receive the same permit facilities to obtain culm for lime burning as those given to lime burners in other areas.  The procuring of the permitted quantities is a matter for arrangement between the permit holders and their fuel merchants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1985" /> No complaint has been made to my Department either by the lime burners of Carrickmacross or their fuel suppliers that difficulty is being experienced in obtaining culm.  I should say that lime burners in the area get the same facilities as those in other areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated on the 25th ultimo, the Bill which it is intended to introduce this Session will apply only to salaries which are variable in whole or in part by reference to the cost-of-living index figure.  The index figure on which bonus will be paid from the 1st January, 1945, will be 110 instead of 85. Inclusive salaries were fixed at amounts which would not vary with changes either downwards or upwards in the cost of living.  They do not, therefore, stand in any relation to remuneration fixed at a basic figure that carries a variable cost-of-living bonus.  Emergency bonus can be paid to local officers on inclusive salaries when the salaries do not exceed £500 a year in the case of whole-time officers and £365 a year in the case of part-time officers.  As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware, there has been no significant change in the cost of living in the past year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if his attention has been drawn to a complaint from the medical officer of health, County Clare, relative to the eviction from a cottage by the Clare County Council of Mr. J. Lowe, Clonoughter, Clonlara, his wife and ten children; if he is aware that it was alleged that the Clare County Council rent collector refused to accept the rent of the cottage from Lowe since March, 1944, and that the county council had failed to keep Lowe's cottage in repair; and, if so, if he will state what action he proposes to take in this matter, and in matters of this kind in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have obtained all the information possible in regard to this case, and I do not consider that any action on my part is necessary. The facts are as follows.  In September, <Col N="1987" /> 1942, the arrears of rent due by the tenant had accumulated to £21 14s. 3d. or more than five years' rent.  The Clare Board of Health and Public Assistance had got a decree for possession of the cottage he occupied and had unanimously resolved that the decree for possession be executed.</P>
      <P>When the commissioner was appointed the local residents requested him not to have the decree executed and a local farmer volunteered to pay the arrears provided the tenant was left in possession of the cottage.  That course was agreed to by the commissioner.</P>
      <P>The tenant is responsible for keeping the fences of the plot and the windows of the cottage in repair.  He failed to do this and the acting county engineer reported in May, 1944, that there were large gaps in the fence.  He further reported that the windows generally were in a bad state of repair and many panes of glass were broken.  The engineer also reported that the out-offices had been practically demolished and that the materials had disappeared. Notwithstanding the fact that the tenant was so unsatisfactory in carrying out his commitments in regard to rent and maintenance, the commissioner gave consideration to the question of repairing the cottage but was advised that it was incapable of being effectively repaired, and that a new cottage be built adjoining the site of the existing cottage which should then be demolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This course was followed and a contract entered into.  In the summer of 1944, however, when the new cottage was nearing completion, Mr. Lowe sued the Clare County Council for failing to keep his cottage in habitable repair and was awarded damages of £25 and costs.  Subsequently, when the tenant again fell seriously into arrears of rent and made no effort to pay his rent punctually, the commissioner sued for possession on the grounds of nonpayment of rent and got a decree for possession.  When the decree was executed the family wanted to enter the county home, but the husband being in receipt of weekly earnings, admission to the institution could not <Col N="1988" /> be authorised.  No other cottage was available, and the commissioner felt that as further legal proceedings might ensue, the tenant could not be readmitted as tenant.  The assistance officer for the area secured lodgings for the family in Limerick, which is only two miles distant.  The family refused to agree to that arrangement, and took up residence in a cowshed belonging to a local farmer.  The present family income appears to be £4 a week and the rent of the cottage is 1/7½d. per week.  The commissioner could not undertake to admit a family in receipt of such earnings to the county home.</P>
    <P>The completion of the new cottage has been somewhat delayed owing to difficulty in getting materials but it should be ready for occupation shortly. It is not correct to say that the rent collector refused to accept the rent of the cottage from the tenants since March, 1944.  The information which I obtained shows that a proportion of the rent was accepted from the tenant between March, 1944, and the time of eviction.</P>
    <P>I may add for the information of the House that this is the case to which Deputy Keyes referred in his speech on the widows' and orphans' pensions motion.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state, in respect of each administrative area in the country, and of the country as a whole, the total number of cases of tuberculosis, the number of cases awaiting admission for institutional treatment, the number of beds available for tuberculosis patients, and the number of such beds occupied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>A statement is being prepared and will be sent to the Deputy showing the total number of cases of tuberculosis in the country which received treatment under <Col N="1989" /> approved tuberculosis schemes in the year 1943, and the number of tuberculous cases awaiting admission for institutional treatment on the 30th September, 1944.  It is not possible to state the actual total number of cases of tuberculosis in the country.  As regards the number of beds available for tuberculous patients, it is not practicable to segregate these in respect of each administrative area in the country because there are three central institutions, namely, Peamount Sanatorium, Newcastle Sanatorium and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Dun Laoghaire, which provide accommodation for patients suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis from a number of the administrative areas.  The total number of beds in these institutions is 567. There are also five central institutions which receive cases of non-pulmonary tuberculosis from various areas in the country.  These institutions contain 407 beds.  In addition 1,876 beds are reserved or are available as required for tuberculous patients in local sanatoria, district hospitals, or general institutions throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The statement which is being prepared will show the actual number of beds provided by local authorities for tuberculous cases in local sanatoria and other institutions under their control. The total number of beds occupied at the 30th September, 1944, is recorded as 2,734 but for the reason already given it is not possible to make a segregation as between each administrative area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether his attention has been directed to published work directed to prove that the addition of fluorine to drinking water supplies reduces the incidence of dental caries in the community using the supply; and whether he will consider recommending local authorities to add fluorine to water supplies in selected cases, and to conduct the necessary surveys amongst the juvenile population of these areas to establish the value of such a procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. There is some evidence that in areas in which the water supply comes from wells sunk into geological formations of rock with salts of high fluorine content (such as fluorspar and apatite) the quality of the teeth of the inhabitants as regards freedom from dental caries is enhanced.  On the other hand an excess of fluorine, even if slight, causes a mottling and disfiguration of the teeth.  This usually occurs with a water content of fluorine of .3 parts per million of water.  At a level of fluorine of 1.5 parts per million of water a generalised thickening and hardening of the bones, known as osteosclerosis occurs.  Having regard to the difficulty of maintaining a suitable standard of fluorine content in water supplies, the danger likely to arise if an excess quantity of fluorine is added to such supplies and the fact that the effect of fluorine as to a reduction of the incidence of dental caries is not yet clear or proved, it is not proposed to take action on the lines suggested.  I may add that in connection with the proposed nutrition survey the chemical analysis of water supplies in the larger urban areas will be carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is satisfied that the description of potato starch as cornflour is in the public interest; and, if not, whether he will require distributors of potato starch to describe it clearly as potato starch or by its trade name &ldquo;farina&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The Sale of Food and Drugs Acts under which proceedings are normally brought in respect of the sale of food which on analysis is reported to be non-genuine are administered by local authorities, but it rests with the court in pursuance of those Acts to decide on a case brought before it whether an article of food which is not of the nature, substance or quality of the article demanded from a purveyor has been sold to the prejudice of the purchaser.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary cannot say that the product of a potato is, in fact, corn?  Potatoes are not corn.  We are all aware that corn starch and potato starch chemically are closely analogous, but they are not identical.  Whatever potato starch may be, it certainly is not cornflour. At some stage we ought to make up our minds to come to some definite decision, otherwise we will have every district justice in the country giving different decisions, and any man who exposes a packet of farina on his shop shelves leaves himself open to prosecution, to appeal, and to a case stated, whereas a decision of this House as to what is to be described as cornflour and what is to be described as farina will give everyone certainty.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that these people with six acres of land are engaged practically from one end of the week to the other working for farmers, putting in and trying to save crops, and that they generally use the six acres allotted to them for keeping a cow and a few calves and perhaps to do a little tillage for themselves? In view of that, will the Minister take the matter further into consideration?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that the production of wheat on some of the poor and acid soils, particularly at higher altitudes, is altogether uneconomic and a great hardship on people concerned, and, if so, if he will <Col N="1994" /> consider devising means of excluding such lands from the provisions of the Compulsory Tillage Order relating to wheat growing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to alter the regulations in force in regard to the compulsory growing of wheat.  As I indicated in my reply to Deputy Beirne's question yesterday, wheat is, in present circumstances, the most essential of all crops and it is necessary that it should be grown in due proportion by every occupier of arable land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am of opinion that the wheat acreage required to be grown on poor soils at high altitudes is relatively small and cannot be regarded as constituting a hardship to the land owners concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister going to insist on people growing wheat where wheat cannot be grown economically? The Minister's inspectors are aware of the fact that the production of wheat in some of these soils is altogether uneconomic. They have inspected crops that were wholly uneconomic because the soil condition militated against wheat production.  Is it fair to these people to compel them to grow wheat, the only alternative being liability to prosecution?  Surely it is not wise even, from the point of view of producing food, to try to produce a cereal on land that is unsuitable for that particular crop but which might produce a good crop of oats.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is mistaken because if wheat cannot be grown on the land, it is not arable, and therefore there is no quota enforced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister realises that in the case of most land over the 500 contour line there is quite a lot of it that is arable but highly acid <Col N="1995" /> because of the conformation of the land?  It consists mostly of granite soils.  That land is absolutely unsuitable for the production of wheat.  It is a gross injustice to the owners to compel them to grow wheat on such land. Has the Minister carried out any experiments on land of that altitude?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in several upland areas in my constituency wheat was grown at a considerable loss last season?  In some cases the yield was as low as three barrels.  Would the Minister consider exempting these people from wheat-growing and letting them grow some alternative crop?  They do not wish to escape their obligations, but could they be granted exemption so that they could grow a crop for profit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are various factors entering into wheat production, such as management, and even on the best lands of Meath you will have losses on wheat-growing where the management is not good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, in moving the Second Reading of the Tuberculosis Bill, said that he welcomed a full discussion here of the problem of the prevention and cure of tuberculosis.  I do not propose <Col N="2003" /> to say anything with regard to the cure of tuberculosis.  I will leave that to the medical profession and to research workers generally.  But I should like to say a few words as regards prevention. The Parliamentary Secretary told us that there was an increase in tuberculosis, and that that increase was mainly amongst the working-class people.  I agree that there has been an increase in cases of tuberculosis amongst working-class people, people on low wages, but I am not satisfied that there has been an increase in the disease in the country generally.  Years ago, tuberculosis was looked upon more or less as a stigma on the family. People were not too anxious to look for treatment for the disease; they generally did the best they could for themselves.  Since then, the position in that regard has improved.  If there is a suspicion that a member of the family is suffering from tuberculosis, the parents or those responsible look for medical treatment for the patient. The existence of the disease is in that way brought to the notice of the medical officer.  There is another factor which has also had an effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without trying to give any bouquets to the Fianna Fáil Government, it must be admitted that during the years from 1933-34 onwards a big drive was made towards the provision of houses for the working-class people in the rural areas and in the City of Dublin, and in allocating those houses the Department of Local Government made it a first regulation&mdash;and wisely so&mdash;that preference must be given to families where tuberculosis exists. That is one regulation dealing with the allocation of those houses for which the Minister and the Department deserve great credit, and I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to extend that preference to more than housing. The result of this regulation was, that where a family suspected that some of its members were suffering from tuberculosis, it was brought to the notice of the county medical officer of health, and to the people responsible for the allocation of houses.  In that way it was brought to the notice of the Department of Local Government and <Col N="2004" /> of the medical authorities that tuberculosis existed in those families.  That, to my mind, has contributed a great deal to the amount of talk we have heard about the increase of tuberculosis in the country.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary the extension to the rural areas of the provision of the midday meal for children attending schools, where a certificate has been issued to satisfy him that those children, the children of working-class people, are suffering from tuberculosis, or that there is a certain amount of suspicion that they are so suffering.  I think it would be a good thing if that hot midday meal, which is given in the cities and urban areas, were extended to the children in the rural areas.  I do not want the Parliamentary Secretary to tell me about the huge cost which would be involved in extending it to all areas, but, with a view to helping the children attending schools in rural areas to combat tuberculosis, I think something should be done in the way of providing them with a hot meal during the day.  I am satisfied that the disease could be arrested if proper provision were made for food, clothes and boots for those children.  I have here the death certificate of a woman who died from tuberculosis at the age of 74.  That woman lived to that age because she had sufficient means to provide herself with nourishment, suitable clothes, and other means of combating the disease.  According to the certificate, she died from phthisis, and I am told that that is the name given to pulmonary tuberculosis.  The statistics given by the Parliamentary Secretary show that the highest death rate is amongst those suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis.  He referred to calcium deficiency.  At the present time, where can the ordinary person, even the person with £4 or £5 a week, provide food that will have sufficient calcium&mdash;eggs, milk, butter and cheese?  How can the working class person provide his children with a sufficiency of that food, even when he has only a small family, not to mention the average family of six children?</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said here in connection with the delay in the <Col N="2005" /> Department of Local Government and Public Health.  While this scheme for the spending of £1,500,000 on the provision of sanatoria throughout the country has got full support on all sides of the House, we must all realise that during present emergency conditions&mdash;and no one will deny that those conditions would be unlikely to improve for 12 or 18 months after the end of the war&mdash;it is extremely difficult to achieve the objects of the Bill. Something should be done in the intervening period to prevent the spread of the disease and to help sufferers to combat it until such time as the Bill can be put into full operation.  I cannot see why the local authorities should not be given power right away to provide tuberculosis huts to be attached to the homes of people who have not the money to deal with the disease themselves.  That would not involve a very big expenditure.  I have seen those huts in County Dublin, and I know the number of applications that there are from time to time to the county medical officer of health to obtain those huts in order that the member of the family who is suffering from the disease might be isolated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, perhaps there was good reason for it too.  The provision of tuberculosis huts for people suffering from tuberculosis would be one way whereby the spread of this disease could be arrested until such time as the Bill is in full operation.  I recently had experience of the case of a young girl from Balbriggan who <Col N="2006" /> spent a certain time&mdash;I think it was six or 12 months&mdash;in Peamount.  That child realised the improvement in her health that followed as a result of treatment there.  She realised that she was coming back to full strength and vitality and her parents realised it. They appealed to me and I made all sorts of appeals to the local authority and to the Peamount authority to allow her to remain for a further period, but it was of no avail.  She had to go back home.  Back to what?  Back to her father who was unemployed, back to the same old rut.  What chance has that person?  What happened?  The father after an investigation by the assistance officer or somebody else was given an allowance of 2/6 or 5/- a week, but what use is a small sum like that to provide the nourishment that a child suffering from tuberculosis requires? These are matters that I think require attention immediately, particularly the question of providing some assistance for those people, to enable them to procure the necessary nourishment.  It is working-class people and people who are in receipt of moderate wages who suffer mostly from tuberculosis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other preventive measure which I should like to see adopted. Apart from the provision of proper schools, I think the Department of Local Government should make it a rule to be enforced in every place possible that every house that is built, whether it be a cottage in one of the rural areas or an artisan's dwelling or a house in the urban areas, should have proper sanitary facilities both as regards water and sewerage and should have, if possible, a bathroom attached to the house.  The provision of such facilities might add £60, £70 or £80 to the cost of the house but the Parliamentary Secretary has stated here that it is going to cost an average of £800 per bed to deal with patients suffering from tuberculosis.  I would appeal to him to see that all houses built by public authorities in future are provided with proper sanitation as regards water supplies and sewerage and with bathrooms if possible.  I have nothing further to say except to join with other Deputies in welcoming the Bill and to express the hope that its conditions will <Col N="2007" /> be improved to such an extent that the Bill will be in full operation sooner than most of us think.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, do you remember the time when we were trying to catch the deer in the Phoenix Park and large numbers of men were sent out <i>en battue</i> to try to drive them into a stockade and when they had eventually to abandon the effort?  I must say I could not help thinking of the deer when I heard Deputies in this House presenting bouquets to the Parliamentary Secretary for introducing this Bill.  All the chasing that the poor deer got at their worst day in the Phoenix Park pales into insignificance when compared with the chasing the Parliamentary Secretary endured before he could be brought up to scratch to introduce this Bill.  Everybody in this country has been after him for the past six or seven years to introduce a Bill of this kind, and only after he had been harried and savaged by every element in the State, was he induced to introduce this Bill.  Why we should be presenting him with nosegays for doing to-day what he should have done six or ten years ago I cannot understand.  Nevertheless, though I am not inclined to present him with nosegays, I certainly do not desire on this occasion to employ brickbats because, as far as it goes, the Bill is a good Bill.  Its great defect, and it is a defect that I have high hopes may yet be cured, is that it does not go far enough.  I am going to suggest to the House that its failure to go far enough is going to cost the State considerably more than if we had the courage to go the whole way at this stage rather than at some future date.  If the Parliamentary Secretary has any difficulty in persuading his colleagues in the Government to provide the necessary finances to do the whole job, the purpose of my speech here to-day will be to assure him that if he renews his effort to get the requisite finances to do the whole job in an exhaustive way now, he will have the support of the whole House behind him in such representations as he may have to make to the financial authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2008" /> In passing, I know that the Parliamentary Secretary departed from custom in his observations in introducing the Bill when he mentioned a high civil servant by name, to wit, Dr. Deeney, the medical director or the new chief medical officer in the Department. All I want to say about that reference is that I am glad to observe that the Parliamentary Secretary has learned what many others in this country have known for a long time, that if you want a first-class man for a responsible post you must turn to the alumni of Mount St. Benedict's, Gorey, in the firm assurance that you will always find one.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The full significance of that fact probably inspired the Parliamentary Secretary's choice.  I could not resist paying that tribute to Fr. Sweetman, long the distinguished headmaster of that school.  When we come down to the Bill itself, the first question I would like to have clarified is this.  When the Minister speaks of creating three new sanatoria, what kind are these sanatoria going to be? He says there are two schools of thought, one which would be content with 4,000 beds and another which would declare that 7,000 beds are requisite to deal with the tuberculosis problem as it confronts us here.  Those questions are founded on statistical calculations.  I believe general experience leads to the conclusion that for every death from tuberculosis in a given community in a given area, approximately two beds are required so that where you have an average death rate of 3,500 over a period, a reasonable estimate is that you will require 7,000 beds to deal with the tuberculosis problem arising from that annual average death rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, firstly as to the type of sanatorium, can we rest assured when the Minister comes to construct the units mentioned in the Bill that we shall have at the disposal of each of these units a full modern hospital adequately equipped and adequately staffed?  I think all sides of the House will agree that the pavilion accommodation <Col N="2009" /> requisite for the patients, in which they are to take their rest and in which they may be expected to remain throughout the greater period of their curative sojourn, need not be of an enduring character.  Substantial, yes; calculated to give the fullest protection and comfort to the inmates, certainly; but not designed to last a century because, if we provide sufficient accommodation now, I do not think I am unduly optimistic if I say that within 15 or 20 years we will find that nearly half of the accommodation will be no longer required, tuberculosis will have so far declined in our community.  Therefore, bearing in mind that the pavilion accommodation can be of a comparatively temporary nature, I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that it is vital that the therapeutic centre will be of the most modern construction, should have the finest equipment that we can secure and, above all, should have in it a staff fully competent to use whatever equipment is provided, however elaborate and however modern it may be.  I suggest that one of our great dangers is that we shall erect something beautiful to look at, that we shall equip it from roof to cellar with every kind of therapeutic and surgical gadget, and that we will then fail to pay adequately the staff of that institution and so fail to secure the type of men and women who are competent to use that equipment to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary can reassure us that in each of these units such a general hospital as I envisage will be available, not only for the actual therapeutic treatment of the various types of pulmonary tuberculosis that may be lodged there, but also for the adequate treatment of the intervening sicknesses by which patients in the sanatorium may be afflicted from time to time, so that we can provide all kinds of surgical treatment that these patients may need in the period of their sojourn at that centre, our minds will be more easy.</P>
    <P>I want to submit to the House that if we provide 4,000 beds now, what we are really doing is this, we are not starting on a programme which will eliminate tuberculosis at all; what we are doing is we are embarking on a <Col N="2010" /> programme that will keep the disease in control and no more.  Quite apart from the social service point of view, looking at it purely from the £ s. d. point of view, if we do no more than take effective measures to keep the disease in control we can look forward for ever to an annually recurring charge for the maintenance of the services envisaged in this Bill.  But if we spend a little more now and, instead of providing 4,000 beds we provide 7,000 beds, we are then spending more in this year, but we are embarking on an enterprise which will mean a diminishing charge on the Exchequer from the day we start work, and which we can look forward to dwindling steadily until, in two or three generations, tuberculosis may become in this country as rare a disease as typhus fever.  I think it is not an unduly optimistic hope that, provided we construct accommodation for 7,000 patients now, in ten or 15 years we would not require accommodation for more than 3,500 and in two generations we might be able to deal with all the tuberculosis in this country in one institution.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should expand his programme a little.  I think geographical considerations as well as the prospect of early success in this great work will justify the development I recommend to him.  I understand he has in mind approximately 700 bed units in the three sanatoria he is considering.  I ask him to increase these units to approximately 1,000 bed units and, instead of sending patients from Leitrim, Donegal and Sligo to Galway, he should make other provision, which I will suggest. I think Deputies will realise there is very little geographical contact with Galway, although these two counties are in Connacht, and Donegal is in the extreme north-west.  People living in Sligo and North Roscommon and Donegal look upon Galway as being almost as remote as Dublin. All the rail transport, all the bus transport and, indeed, all the orientation of normal life is towards Sligo.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if the Parliamentary Secretary will provide for those areas a fourth sanatorium in or about Sligo <Col N="2011" />&mdash;somewhere between Sligo and Bundoran, or wherever will be a suitable site&mdash;and, if necessary, a fifth in Athlone, which will take off the Tipperary district and the Midland counties from the proposed Cork sanatorium, and, lastly, a sixth institution somewhere in the Rosslare area for non-pulmonary forms of tuberculosis, for which I understand sea air and sunshine are peculiarly necessary, it would be much more satisfactory.  I think I am right in saying the Rosslare area has the lowest rainfall and the highest degree of sunshine of any part of this country.  I suggest that area is one that will be peculiarly suitable for an institution, the occupants of which are in special need of sunshine and sea air.  If he would do that, then I believe he will have provided the accommodation necessary to combat the problem which confronts us.</P>
    <P>I would like to give credit where credit is due.  I have often accused the Fianna Fáil Government of jobbery and pushing their friends into jobs, and I believe they have been frequently guilty of it, but, in connection with tuberculosis administration&mdash;and I am not talking now of the Parliamentary Secretary's reference to Dr. T. W. T. Dillon doing research work; he has nothing to do with the executive end of the tuberculosis administration&mdash;in regard to the executive end of the tuberculosis administration, I am bound to say, and to rejoice in the occasion of saying it publicly, that the Parliamentary Secretary, Dr. Ward, has shown himself disinterested and informed in his reorganisation of many of the key positions which had to be reorganised if effective work was to be done in the control of tuberculosis. And it is because he has shown that capacity and will, in regard to this matter, to do the right thing, that I would not hesitate to commit to his care the creation of these additional institutions that I have envisaged, because I would be confident, if he would follow the same line in staffing them as he has been following in regard to the other key positions, we might reasonably hope to have not only an adequate number of beds, but an <Col N="2012" /> adequate staff to use them to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>Assuming we had the beds&mdash;and, please God, before this debate is over we may get them&mdash;and assuming we had a staff competent to deal with the problem, there is one outstanding difficulty which I cannot see any escape from.  We will not end this evil if we cannot persuade the patients to come into the institutions.  I would never support, and I hope this House will never support, the utterly detestable doctrine enunciated by Deputy Allen, that people, before they are allowed to get a public position or to enter this or that service, are to be constrained to enter rabbit hutches and undergo elaborate tests and examinations, whether they want to be examined or not.  If a man in this community elects to die and wants to die, it is his own business, and God forbid that we would ever legislate to insist that he would go in and have done to him what we think will do him good unless and until he is convinced that it is going to do him good.  I agree that in regard to tuberculosis that doctrine I enunciate has to be considered in the light of the fact that a man with active pulmonary tuberculosis has not only himself to consider&mdash;he is imperilling the lives of everybody around him&mdash;but, bearing all that in mind, I will never be a party to treating people upon whom that tragic disaster has fallen as pariahs or lepers and locking them up <i>nolens volens.</i>  It is not necessary; it is unchristian; and it is utterly detestable, more especially when, if we do our part, we have no reason to believe that the sufferers will not collaborate with us in getting control of this tragic disease.</P>
    <P>It may, however, be possible for a Deputy&mdash;and I include myself&mdash;who has £480 a year to contemplate going into a sanatorium for two years, but consider the feelings of a working man in Dublin&mdash;I am not now speaking of a destitute person, but of a working man earning £4 or £5 a week, who has a comfortable little home, a couple of boys at the Christian Brothers' school, a daughter going to the nuns and a <Col N="2013" /> wife who is accustomed to hold her head high, to present a respectable appearance and to keep a nice house &mdash;who feels a little run down, goes to the dispensary doctor and is told that he has a patch on his lung, but that if he will take effective measures now, there will be no difficulty in making him as good as ever he was, and that he need not worry.  That man says to the doctor: &ldquo;Very well; I will do whatever you say.  What am I to do?&rdquo;, to which the reply is: &ldquo;You must go into one of the new sanatoria which have been built for this purpose, where you will be treated and made all right&rdquo;. The man says: &ldquo;I shall be glad to do that.  How long will I be expected to stay?&rdquo;  The doctor replies: &ldquo;You must be prepared to face two years.&rdquo; Can a conscientious doctor say anything else?  He may hope to get the man back on his feet in a much shorter time, but is he not bound to warn him that he must be prepared to face two years?</P>
    <P>Conceive what that means.  That man will get 15/- a week and certain other little contributions from national health insurance.  His wife and family, to subsist, must dissipate whatever little savings they have accumulated for the higher education of their children or for the provision of a modest marriage portion for the daughter, and when all that is done, they must consider giving up the home, moving into a tenement room and applying to the relieving officer to supplement the allowance they are getting from the National Health Insurance Society and such other social services as are automatically available to them.  What is the use of talking of the control of tuberculosis if it involves in every case the pauperisation and degradation of the family of every citizen who has not independent means and who undertakes to cooperate with us by going into one of the sanatoria we provide?</P>
    <P>Would Deputies have any respect for the man with a wife and family, who felt well and able to do his work, albeit he was sometimes tired and troubled with a cough and a little undue perspiration at night, if he did not struggle on to keep the home together, if, at <Col N="2014" /> the first sign of tuberculosis, he flopped into bed and said to his wife: &ldquo;Carry on whatever way you like.  I brought the five children into the world with you and I am now done with them.  Get along as best you can.  I am going to bed for the next two years&rdquo;?  Would not every respectable neighbour say: &ldquo;He is taking it very coolly.  What is that poor woman to do?  She has worked hard all her life and she is not fit to go out and earn money at charing or such work.  She is to be left to sink down from the respectable home into which she married from her own respectable home into a tenement room.  She is to be left to watch her children enter blind-alley occupations because there is no money to educate them up to that standard which would enable them to get decent employment with prospects, and his lordship is gone to bed.  I was in to see him last week and he has put on about a stone in weight resting as coolly as you please in the bed?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Dr. Ward, Dr. Deeney, Dr. Ryan, Dr. Murphy and Dr. Jones, if they went in to see that man, might know perfectly well that his very existence depended on his staying in bed and resting and that if, fat and all as he is, he got up and precipitated a haemorrhage, the work of months might be destroyed in an hour; but that man has to live amongst his neighbours, and what self-respecting man will lie in his bed getting fat while his wife gets thin and his children are ill clad?  He will come out, and I need not call to the mind of the Parliamentary Secretary the case of a man he and I know well in Monaghan Sanatorium, a man for whom, for old association's sake, he had a warm regard and for whom, for more recent associations, I had a very warm regard, who kept coming out until he killed himself, because he could not bear to think his neighbours would see him lying in bed resting while his children and his wife had become burdens on his parents, who already had more to do than they were able to do in maintaining themselves.</P>
    <P>I saw that man and I sought to persuade him to stay in bed.  I sought to reassure him that all who knew him <Col N="2015" /> and understood his circumstances appreciated the reasons for which he stayed in bed, to recover his health and to maintain his family over the protracted period&mdash;because the children were all young&mdash;during which they required maintenance.  He could not see that.  He felt that every time a neighbour came to visit him he was a disgrace to be lying in bed, without providing for the wife and children for whom he felt himself responsible, and, as certainly as I am standing here, that man killed himself because he wanted to do for his children what he was not physically fit to do.  He would be alive now, and a long way towards his cure and towards restoration as the proper prop of that family which now has no father and no wage-earner, if we had been in a position to say to him: &ldquo;From the first day you go into a sanatorium, you will get your wages every week as if you were out at work. We all know that it is not for want of a will, but for want of a way that has you where you are, and the community will be glad, inasmuch as you are not only saving your own health but protecting the health of your wife and children and your neighbours by staying in a sanatorium, to give you your wages, such as they were, to give you what you were earning when you lay down until such time as you are able to stand up again.  If, at a future date, you want to give some contribution to charity as thanks for what you are getting now, well and good, but if you cannot see your way to do that, the community gladly makes this available to you&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Unless we are prepared to make this arbitrary decision, not that we will give to every man who is declared to be a proper inmate of a tuberculosis sanatorium a flat rate, but that we will say to him: &ldquo;A certain type of certificate will be required showing your average earnings over the 12 months prior to your certification as a tuberculosis patient and so long as the sanatorium authorities require you to remain on the flat of your back undergoing the cure, you will receive these wages from public funds,&rdquo; we are simply building castles in the sand in <Col N="2016" /> trying to control the incidence of tuberculosis.  We are asking men&mdash; particularly men&mdash;to do that for which their neighbours would be the first to point the finger of scorn at them. No man who is worthy of the name of man will like to go into an institution and grow fat there while his wife and children are abandoned and left on the roadside to starve, and I think that until we do something to remedy that position we must abandon all hope of fighting this disease in the way in which it should be fought.</P>
    <P>We are going to invest a large capital sum in the development of this project, but it must be remembered that, although we are investing that large sum, it will be a diminishing charge, if the right steps are taken.  If we can succeed during the next ten or 15 years in reducing the death rate from this disease from 1,500 to 750, as a result of paying a proper wage to those people who, otherwise, would be hopeless and helpless invalids for the rest of their lives, it will be money well invested, because those people who, otherwise, would be helpless invalids for the rest of their lives will be put into a position in which they will be able to earn a living.  In that connection, it should be remembered that the death rate is far smaller than the rate of incidence of this disease, is far less than the number of people disabled by the disease and who, as a consequence, are unable to earn a livelihood. I think that if we could reduce the number by even one-half, it would mean that thousands of people who, otherwise, would be chronic and permanent invalids would be able to earn a livelihood.  I think it would be a very good thing if we could say to everybody who goes into those sanatoria that he will get, not luxury, but at least the same wage which he had been earning, that it would be the best method of combating the disease.  The only thing that the patient must then sacrifice would be the prospects of financial advancement that he might have looked forward to in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>Let us remember that tuberculosis chiefly strikes the young.  It is between the ages of 17 and 28 that it wreaks its <Col N="2017" /> greatest havoc, and these are the years when a young man is getting on in the world&mdash;the years in which he might expect to get a better position than he has had heretofore and to improve himself. The fact that he is struck down by tuberculosis during those years compels him to forget that laudable hope or ambition.  His capacity for work is not destroyed, but it must be remembered that when he gets up from his bed of illness, and when the reconditioning influences, which will be a feature of these sanatoria, take place, it may be recommended that he should seek some other type of work than that in which he had been engaged prior to his illness.  For instance, if he had previously worked in a factory he may be advised to seek some other occupation and offered an opportunity of getting some other occupation.  The thing to be remembered is that his trials are not ended when his capacity for work is restored, because he may have to adopt an entirely different form of life.  Now, I say that that is a sufficient sacrifice to ask him to undergo without expecting him to go to bed in a sanatorium and grow fat while his wife and children are starving outside.  Let us not, in effect, write up above the beds of all these men in the various sanatoria that they are getting this treatment while the people dependent upon them are to be allowed to starve.</P>
    <P>There are two other matters that I wish to refer to.  I could not help smiling, albeit <i>in absentia</i>, when the Parliamentary Secretary proceeded to wax eloquent upon the question of calcium deficiency.  I am sure that this House will remember that, 18 months ago, I addressed an inquiry to the Parliamentary Secretary as to whether he would not think it wise to add calcium to the bread inasmuch as the phytic acid in the loaf at that time prevented absorption of the proper amount of calcium for those who have to depend, to a large extent, on bread for their main diet, and, of course, in the case of the poor, bread bulks very largely in their diet. Of course, at that time, laughter rang loudly from the Parliamentary Secretary's seat.  It was, of course, only a <Col N="2018" /> question of ignorant amateurs talking about what they did not understand and misinterpreting the whole matter. The Parliamentary Secretary knew all about it, and for any ignorant amateur, such as I, to talk about calcium deficiency in the bread was &ldquo;all my eye and Betty Martin.&rdquo;  I remember the words of the <i>Irish Press</i> on that occasion, where I was taken to task for daring to criticise&mdash;inexpert criticism on a highly technical matter, we were told&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary, Dr. Ward, T.D., M.B., B.Ch., etc.  Well, it has taken ten years to teach the Fianna Fáil Party the elements of economics, but it has only taken me two years to teach the Parliamentary Secretary the elements of dietetics.</P>
    <P>Now, in opening his speech, the Parliamentary Secretary said that he had come here to outline a scheme for a great improvement in this matter, and he asked for agreement from all Parties.  He said that he was asking everyone to help in the job, and that people should not be unduly critical of any weaknesses in the Bill: that he wanted help from all sources, whether it came from voluntary, semi-voluntary or paying sources.  That appeal, I am sure, touched a responsive chord in everybody's heart.  It certainly touched a responsive chord in me until I discovered something that, I am sure, will come as a bombshell to this House. I think that it will be a bombshell to this House, because the Censor's department has been, and is being used, to keep these things from the knowledge of the Irish people.  Do Deputies of this House realise that one organisation in this country, which has been in the forefront of voluntary co-operation in the tuberculosis campaign and in every other campaign against disease in this country&mdash;namely, the St. John Ambulance Brigade&mdash;has been sent for by the Taoiseach and told that they must wind themselves up or merge in the Red Cross, and that, if they do not merge in the Red Cross, they must disappear?  Is not that a great encouragement towards co-operation with the Government?  Is there a Deputy on any side of this House who will dare to assert that the St. John Ambulance Brigade has not been in the forefront <Col N="2019" /> of every activity in the fight against disease in co-operation with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, whenever he has asked for it? Yet, their reward now is that they are told that they must dissolve, or that they must subside into the Red Cross or get out.  Now, if the St. John Ambulance Society were a Protestant association, it would be a detestable outrage to issue any such ukase.  It would call to mind the days in Rome when the Catholic Boy Scouts were told to dissolve or merge in the Ballila, or the days in Germany when the Catholic Association were told to sink themselves in the Nazi Youth Movement, or get out&mdash;incidents which bring to my mind the Holy Father's Encyclical message <i>Mit Brenender Sorge.</i>  Are we reaching a stage in this country when only those organisations which are prepared to bow to the Government's views are to be allowed to exist?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, I am entitled to suggest that if people are to be treated in this way, the Parliamentary Secretary cannot expect us to give him the co-operation for which he seeks?  Let me add this, lest I should be hopelessly <Col N="2020" /> misunderstood in this connection: The St. John Ambulance Society is not a Protestant organisation at all.  The commissioner is a Catholic, and the deputy-commissioner is a Catholic.  It is simply a body devoted to voluntary public service in this country, and its personnel comprises people of all denominations in this country, and that it should be extinguished by Government ukase is an outrage which will discourage every voluntary worker in this country who wants to help.</P>

      <P>If voluntary workers are to collaborate with the Parliamentary Secretary, I think before he can hope to get that abundant goodwill which is available for the asking, that every self-respecting man and woman will first demand that they should be guaranteed against treatment analogous to that applied to the St. John Ambulance Brigade.  I urge the Parliamentary Secretary most strongly to take into consideration one or two other matters that have been dealt with here.  I ask him to increase the bed accommodation to 7,000, and with regard to the allowances in lieu of wages, I earnestly urge him to impress on the Minister for Finance the necessity of enabling him to deal with patients in sanatoria.  I do not think I exaggerate when I say that if he tells the House that he has done his best, that he is doing his part, but that unless he can get the co-operation of the Department of Finance the bulk of his work will be in vain, every element in this country will agree with him.  To <Col N="2021" /> embark on this campaign without providing it with the money, which is an essential element in its success, would be madness.  If he wants help from any part of the House when calling in that way on the Department of Finance he will get it.  I beg him to go as far as he can in these two matters, because they are essential to the success of his plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to join with previous speakers in congratulating the Parliamentary Secretary on introducing this Bill.  Malnutrition I consider to be the kernel of the whole question.  When people are affected by the disease they must be treated in a sanatorium.  The laws of logic are cause and effect.  Malnutrition should be dealt with first.  In Tipperary the water supply comes from the Galtees, the Knockmealdown and Slievenamon and lacks calcium.  A medical specialist from Derbyshire was brought over to report on the water supply in view of the prevalence of goitre.  That complaint has led to a certain amount of consumption owing to the lack of calcium in water.  I should like to hear what the Parliamentary Secretary has to say about the result of that experiment.  I was interested in a report issued by the medical officer of health in County Clare in which he attributed tuberculosis to attendance at dance halls. Another angle, he suggested, was that young people came home late at night from dances and anxious to get in quietly went to bed with clothes in which they had perspired.  He traced a number of cases of tuberculosis to that practice.  That report struck me as being a true one, because I suppose many people have got in through windows after late dances.  In such cases when a cough starts the family say that so-and-so has got a cold, but it turns to consumption.  When the neighbours hear talk of that kind some of them recall that another generation had a touch of the complaint.  It is good to know that consumption is not hereditary.  As a matter of fact I know from experience that the children of consumptive mothers live even when the mothers die.  The children are not affected.  Very often the surroundings <Col N="2022" /> in which children live, especially where somebody has died from the disease, are not properly disinfected.</P>
      <P>Lack of good food and good water are great sources of infection.  The cities and towns have good water supplies, but I should like to know how many rural areas would stand a test in that regard.  I know one stream in the Galtee Mountains that supplies 25 families, and when a sample of water was sent to the late Sir Charles Cameron, who was the city analyst, he would not pass it as a supply to a national school.  I suggest that bad water in rural areas is responsible for the spread of consumption, and that very few streams in these areas will stand a test in that respect.  In districts in which there is lime in the water supply people are bigger and healthier.  I should like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary some results where iodine was added to the water supply, because next to pure air, good water has much to do with the health of the people.  In County Tipperary we have the river Suir, which comes along to Thurles, and eventually the beet factory sewers as well as those from the town of Clonmel empty into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have 5,000 people in Carrick and I can assure the Minister that on either side of those towns, at dead of night, water is taken from those rivers for domestic use.  We have hydraulic pumps which are relics of hydraulic inefficiency.  About eight months ago, a man asked me to look at one of those pumps.  It was within 200 yards of the River Suir but it was on an eminence, so that the Suir water had nothing to do with it.  The first 70 or 80 gallons of the water drawn from that well were yellow.  After 20 or 30 gallons more had been drawn, the water was somewhat clean.  The man filled a barrel and took the water away to use for domestic purposes.  That is typical of what is happening in my native county. Water enters largely into the causes of tuberculosis.  The rivers of Ireland were never intended to be sewers for the towns.  Sheffield and Birmingham have a population of 2,000,000 each and I do not think there is a rivulet running through either of them.  They developed <Col N="2023" /> from mere hamlets into towns noted for cutlery and ironware, and they draw their water from the Welsh mountains 250 miles away and treat their sewage in septic tanks.  The rivers should be primarily used to supply water to the farmers and labourers in the country.  If you remove one of the causes of tuberculosis, you will lessen the need for the institutions which you propose to erect and the erection of which I approve.</P>
    <P>Another cause of tuberculosis is malnutrition. I knew one family which was noted for its delicacy.  The parents in that case were medium-sized farmers and were somewhat parsimonious. They measured out the food.  I never knew tuberculosis to occur in a labourer's cottage where the occupants received five or six bags of spuds and a daily quart of milk from the farmer for whom the head of the house was working.  Most of the farmers give their decent workers that allowance, and three or four generations have been built up in that way free from tuberculosis.  Milk and butter, eggs and vegetables are the groundwork of health.  About 12 months ago it was noted in this House that there was a great decrease in milk.  We made a proposal that the price of milk be increased and you walked into the Lobby against us&mdash;to your shame.  Have you increased the supply of milk since?  You have not. That is another cause of tuberculosis and of the need for sanatoria.  There was not much of the milk of human kindness in those who voted against that motion, whether the votes were Party votes or not.  I am a member of a Party, but I would not be five minutes a member of any Party if I had to do that.  However, it is a matter for your consciences, and not for mine.  There is no milk and no butter.  The allowance of butter is 6 ozs. and you would have to use a camel hair brush to apply it.  That is why you need sanatoria.  Then there is the question of beet.  I am a beet grower, and I milk 22 cows.  Are you going to get milk at 10½d. a gallon? No.  You will have to increase your price; and, if you do, you will do <Col N="2024" /> away with one of the causes of tuberculosis.  A shilling a gallon was the price we asked.  I suggest that you will not get it now at 1/2 or 1/3, and I hope I am a false prophet You cannot get people to milk on Sundays. Our sons and daughters cannot be slaves, and your Agricultural Wages Act fixed the hours for employees at eight to six, with an hour for dinner. Thereby, you killed the dairy industry. A cow must be milked at&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I merely wanted to refer to the causes of tuberculosis. A picture was hung in the English Academy, depicting a horse, after a big gallop, frothing from the mouth.  It was hung there about 12 months.  A farmer's son from York-shire, who would be called a yokel by the townsman looked at this picture and said: &ldquo;You horse is frothing from the mouth.  Where is he getting the froth from?  A horse cannot froth without champing the bit&rdquo;.  It seems the artist forgot about the bit.  The picture was taken away as not being true to nature.  I suggest that you should be true to nature and to art. The youngsters have nothing to champ. Supplies of milk and butter are the problem.  Neither is there a sufficiency of sugar to make jam.  Pay the men to supply the food and you will have no tuberculosis.  I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on his Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>With other Deputies, I welcome this Bill, as a step in the right direction&mdash;and only a step.  It has come ten years too late.  From 1934 up to the present, I have been raising questions in this House about the lack of accommodation for tubercular patients.  Week after week, I raised the question and I was almost giving up hope.  I thought that mine was a voice crying in the wilderness. Eventually, the Minister has seen light and is now introducing a Bill which will, to some extent, meet the troubles with which the people are confronted regarding the treatment of tuberculosis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2025" /> Time and again I have raised questions about the inadequate allowance paid by the public authorities and by the National Health Society.  I have appealed for an increase in benefits.  I have appealed, where it is necessary for increased home assistance, for people who had no benefits and who were less fortunate than many others. Half-crowns were doled out and half-crowns were stopped.  Deputies will remember the case of a young girl that I brought forward a couple of years ago.  Her recovery in a sanatorium was called a miracle.  She was for seven years upon the broad of her back and eventually came out cured. The authorities ordered her an allowance of 7/6 a week to provide herself with nourishment.  She was then 17 or 18 years of age and is now 21 or 22. Her brother got a job as a butcher's porter at 15/- a week in a tenement quarter.  Following that the sister's allowance of 7/6 a week was taken from her by the public authorities.  I have made appeals for people on whom money had been spent to help bring about their complete recovery. There is not sufficient after-care for people suffering from disease when they leave institutions.  I think that for a year or two after patients leave a sanatorium the tuberculosis authorities should look after them and see that they are properly fed, properly clothed and provided with boots. Quite recently I had the following letter from a man who was downhearted:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Alderman Byrne,</P>
    <P>I have been in and out of Crooksling for the past 12 years.  At Christmas I made up my mind to come out.  Do you know any kind friend in Dublin that would give me an overcoat?  The clothes that I was wearing inside were not my property and I could not take them out.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I sent that letter to the Minister asking if it was not possible to give people clothing when coming out of institutions. The answer I got in this case was that the man had refused treatment. He left the institution because he was fed up with it.  They could not do anything for him.  He had been going in and out for 12 years, and who will blame him for coming out of that <Col N="2026" /> dull depressed hole, especially at Christmas time?</P>
    <P>This Bill will do great things for future cases, but its benefits will not be seen for from three to five years.  It will take time to acquire property and erect buildings.  What I want to know is, what is going to be done for the suffers of to-day, for tuberculosis cases in corporation houses who are being charged rents that they cannot afford to pay?  What is going to happen to men of the kind mentioned by Deputy Dillon?  You have several men earning £3 or £4 a week with families of five or six children and paying rents of 12/- a week for a cottage.  When one of them gets a little cough he is told that he had better look after himself. He goes to the dispensary and sees the doctor.  He tells him that he is a case for a sanatorium, that he will look for a bed for him and may have one in three or six months' time.  Eventually, that man is forced, not of his own will, but because of the fear of poverty in the home and of the hardships that the children may have to bear if he goes away, not to go into a sanatorium, and all because of the injustices done to his family.</P>
    <P>The landlord wants the rent, even corporations want their rents.  Sometimes they are twice as heartless as anybody else.  They will serve notice to quit on an unfortunate family while the father is in a sanatorium.  What organisation, or what body of men, will get together to do something for that class of person, something that will help to ease their minds and relieve them of the fear that the bailiff will not be sent to evict their family from the home at the end of six months?  That is what happens.  On this question of tuberculosis, what I believe is needed in most cases is good food, good clothing and good shelter. If these were provided they would help to ease the situation.  I do not want to make it appear that people who have all these things do not get tuberculosis. For some reason or other they do.  At the same time, I believe that the provision of good food, good clothing and good shelter would help to ease the situation.</P>
    <P>I wish to join with other Deputies, <Col N="2027" /> not in throwing bouquets at the Parliamentary Secretary, but in welcoming the Bill.  Its introduction has been from five to ten years too late.  To me it was a source of satisfaction to see the Bill introduced.  I accept it as a sort of apology from the Parliamentary Secretary to myself and others for the way he treated us, for the discourtesy of some of his answers to questions when this matter was raised.  It is a satisfaction to us now to see it as a result of our work and of our pressure. This Bill is the result of pressure from the Opposition.  It is the result of publicity outside.  As the result of the work of organisations outside, which forced them, the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department have moved at last.  At Question Time to-day I was astonished to hear Deputy Flanagan say, when he got a reply from a Minister, &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;.  I give praise when I think it necessary, and also when I think it necessary I draw attention to the hardships and the poverty which the people in this city are suffering.  I shall continue to do so.</P>
    <P>I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for bringing in this measure and hope that it will have the results he desires. I hope that he is not going to put up buildings and then not staff them as some of our hospitals&mdash;lovely buildings which cost fabulous sums of money are inadequately staffed.  There are no specialists in any of the hospitals down the country so that when major operations have to be performed the patients, as formerly, have to be brought to Dublin.  The appointment of specialists to these county hospitals would ease matters in the City of Dublin. Proper nursing staffs should also be appointed.  If these new hospitals are inadequately staffed with doctors and nurses, then they are going to do more harm than good.  In conclusion, I join with other members of the House in welcoming the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with other Deputies in thanking the Parliamentary Secretary for introducing this measure to meet what is at the moment a pressing need.  I hope and believe that it is only a temporary necessity.  Deputy Byrne said that the <Col N="2028" /> Bill had been introduced because of pressure brought to bear from the Opposition Benches.  I wish to remind the Deputy that it was not pressure from the Opposition Benches that inspired the Parliamentary Secretary to bring in a measure for the restoration of the old age pensions which were taken away by the Party that he in no small way supports.  Apart from that this measure aims at finding accommodation for the number of known cases, and that being so, it is most necessary. Of course, none of us will cavil at the cost.  The Bill has been hailed by all Parties with acclamation.  Some Deputies have gone so far, even Deputy Dillon, as to say that half enough of accommodation is not being provided.  I believe that the Parliamentary Secretary has examined the position very thoroughly and carefully, and that he is satisfied that the amount of accommodation that is being provided under the Bill is quite adequate.  Let us hope so.</P>
      <P>It is easy enough to provide money for the building of sanatoria, but there is another side to the question of which serious cognisance should be taken, that is, the cost of maintenance.  I have been listening to much of the debate for the last two days and did not hear anybody putting the question as to what the estimated cost to the rates would be for the maintenance of the proposed accommodation.  After all, that is a pretty big question and when the figures are made known to the people&mdash;as I believe they should be made known, or at least an idea of them&mdash;we may not be altogether so loud in our laudations.  I do not want to be interpreted as being in any way against the Bill, but I would like that the people should know what extra burden will be placed upon them for the maintenance of the institutions which it is proposed to erect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figure mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary was 4,300 beds.  I believe that, in up-to-date sanatoria, each bed will cost £200 per annum. That would mean £860,000 per year for the country as a whole, to be apportioned, of course, according to the bed accommodation provided in the different sanatoria.  In the one which <Col N="2029" /> is to be erected in County Galway, and which embraces a number of other counties, the cost, on my calculation, would be £90,000 per annum.  It may be argued that a capitation grant of 50 per cent. will be paid from central funds but, even so, that does not very materially alter the position, and the people will still have to find this money.  It is only fair to state here that the rates at the present time are pretty high and that in some counties they are at the peak point. In fact, they are at the peak point in my own county.  I would say, too, that as far as County Galway is concerned, we have the highest standard of social service in any part of the country.  The people will be capable of meeting the additional cost at the present time&mdash;here I mean the farming community&mdash;since, as a result of the emergency, they have what may be termed a fixed income, but we have to take into consideration the post-war period, when it will not be so easy for the farmers to meet that very high rate.</P>
    <P>Consequently, I think the Parliamentary Secretary is on proper lines in not giving way to persons who are suggesting doubling the amount of bed accommodation.  How would such an increased cost be met?  A Deputy on the opposite benches said last night that there were some conservatives, as far as finance is concerned, here in the Fianna Fáil Party.  I happen to be one of them, because I understand the position; and I understand the difficulty which the local authorities have at the present time in collecting the rates for the existing services.  If we are to tackle this problem and pay for it, as we must do now, we should clearly realise that we can only do so by contributing, no matter how difficult that is, and in order to make that contribution possible the farming community will have to get into higher production and work harder.</P>
    <P>I have heard a good deal here from people who claim to have expert knowledge about the causes of tuberculosis and how best to eradicate it.  I believe the Parliamentary Secretary is on the right lines when he envisages a campaign for its prevention&mdash;for prevention always is better than cure&mdash;<Col N="2030" /> and a proper system of educating the people how to preserve their health. I do not like the term &ldquo;anti-tuberculosis campaign&rdquo;.  I remember a time in this country when a certain lady went around with a spotted horse and a caravan and was nearly run out of the country for labelling us all as being a consumptive people.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to hear Deputy Coogan state yesterday evening that the problem was not at all as serious as people represented it to be&mdash;and it certainly is not.  I remember well that, when I was a youngster, whole families were wiped out with it in my part of the country&mdash;strong, healthy and physically fit people were completely wiped out.  We have no cases of that kind now, thank God.  We hear a good deal about &ldquo;malnutrition&rdquo;.  I do not agree with that theory at all, as I know people who have tuberculosis in the family and who were never one five minutes short of a good meal at the proper time; and I have also known people who have come out of dingy, smoky cabins and who have never known tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about better housing. We also find people suffering from tuberculosis in the very best of houses and we find that in the itinerant class, which roams the country half clad, very few are ever found with tuberculosis. A lot of the theories that are advanced would not hold water very long, in my opinion.  It would be very interesting if a survey were made as to how many of the classes I have mentioned suffer from tuberculosis.  I am not putting that up as an argument against this scheme, but am advancing it rather as an argument against other theories which have been propounded and which, from practical knowledge and experience, I say here and now I do not believe in.</P>
    <P>Yesterday evening, Deputy Allen made a suggestion that the local dispensary doctors could do a good deal to eradicate the disease.  I believe they could.  He suggested that they should be increased in number and that their salaries should be increased, but I do not agree with his point of view on that matter at all.  I believe the dispensary doctors have sufficient <Col N="2031" /> to do already, without adding more. Between their dispensary duties and their private practice, some of them are not able to cope with all the work as it is.  What I think would be better, and what I imagine the Parliamentary Secretary has in view, according to his statement, is that the county medical officers would get one or two more assistants, who would be specialised in this disease, who would have the proper apparatus and who would attend at various centres of large population, in towns and cities, and hold dispensaries or clinics.  Of course, they are doing that at present, but they are not capable of doing it properly, as there is not enough of them. A county medical officer of health with one assistant in a big county like Galway, no matter how hard he works, I believe is not capable of doing that. The education of the people, such as is being carried out by the Red Cross and other societies by methods of persuasion, is the proper line to go on.  I would even say that every minister of religion should impress on his congregation the necessity, even if they only get a little cough, to present themselves for examination.  That would be very helpful.  The specialist, when he examines them, has an X-ray examination made and looks up the history of the family, will be in a position to report as to their condition and also the condition of the families.  I believe that that will cost less to the rates than the 7,000 beds Deputy Dillon has been insisting upon so emphatically.</P>
    <P>There is a local matter which I wish to bring to the Parliamentary Secretary's notice and that is the question of the site of the sanatorium in County Galway.  The Parliamentary Secretary and his Department have always been very generous in helping us out in regard to any matter concerning the health of the people.  We were given assistance to erect three pavilions. They are necessary, but we always regarded them as being nothing more than an improvisation, if you like, or makeshift accommodation.  We do not look upon them as being permanent structures.  Now I understand&mdash;I have <Col N="2032" /> not got it officially&mdash;that the site of the new regional sanatorium is supposed to be just opposite these pavilions. A religious community is objecting to that because they have built a house of studies at a very high cost, which will be only about 100 or 200 yards away from the new sanatorium, if it is erected there.  Their contention is that the sanatorium will have a bad effect on the young students.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that before sanctioning that site&mdash;if such a site is contemplated&mdash;he should try to find an alternative site in County Galway.  I believe that somewhere in the vicinity of Athenry an elevated position can be found for a sanatorium.  We hear a good deal about building sanatoria on elevated ground.  A site such as I suggest would have this advantage, that Athenry is a railway junction connected with all the counties concerned.</P>
    <P>I should also like to direct the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to the fact that when the Woodlands site was taken over for a sanatorium, it was taken over for a temporary purpose. There is also the fact that there is a prejudice in the minds of people, which has arisen from the instruction of medical people in the past, that the most unsuitable place that anybody affected by tuberculosis could go for a holiday is where there is sea air.  I do not know whether that is true or not, but I know it is a very old theory.  If that is the case, I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will take it into consideration.  Apart altogether from that, the prejudice that I speak of will be very hard to break down.  I put that to the Parliamentary Secretary so that he may give it consideration.  I thank him again for all his efforts on behalf of the people of the country generally, particularly the poorer sections of the community, and for the many Bills which he has piloted through this House for the welfare of the people.</P>

      <P>I think it is a good thing that there was not much space in the newspapers for all the speeches made in connection with this tuberculosis <Col N="2033" /> campaign.  It is my belief that there is no need to alarm the public with all this pessimistic talk here.  After all, we know that the position in regard to this disease is not at all as bad as people are trying to make out.  We know that before the war tuberculosis was rapidly on the decline; that with new houses, proper sanitary conditions and good food it was being rapidly wiped out.  With the conditions prevailing since the war, tuberculosis has been on the increase again.  That is more or less natural to expect, because a large number of our people were not getting proper food, were not properly clothed, and, owing to one thing or another, their vitality was pretty low, and, therefore, they contracted the disease.  I believe that the Parliamentary Secretary is doing a very good thing in building these sanatoria and trying to take away affected persons from their homes and put them in a sanatorium where they will have a chance of getting better and not be in contact with other people.  That is all to the good, but it is more or less starting at the wrong end.  We should start with the people themselves and with their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government has spent more money on social services and other things than any other Government. They lavished money on all kinds of things.  It is my belief that that has not done very much good.  We would be far better off if we had not half of these services, if we let people fend for themselves.  We built fine houses for the poorer sections of the people and gave them good surroundings at a big cost to the community.  I believe that we did not go far enough in following that up by having a proper inspection of these houses, say, twice a year.  I know of many towns and country districts where we built lovely houses costing £500 or £600.  The families put into these houses were thankful when they had got them because they had come out of hovels.  I am not ashamed to say, however, that some of these new houses are in a disgracefully filthy and dirty condition, because not the slightest attention is paid to the sanitary side of things.  That is not due to <Col N="2034" /> the fact that most of these people are not getting good wages.  I know of many cases where from £6 to £10 a week is coming into these households, from England, from Dublin, and from the earnings of people locally.  Some of these people go in for rabbit catching and pigeon catching; in fact they have money to burn.  But their houses are a public disgrace.  That is a matter that should be attended to.  In some country districts where new houses were erected you will find filthy slum conditions. If a proper inspection of the different areas was made I believe people would be alarmed at the conditions. There is no use building houses with proper sanitary accommodation in small towns and villages if we do not follow that up by a proper inspection of these houses, even if it has to be compulsory inspection.  I know houses where the sanitary accommodation, sinks, etc., are not used for the purpose for which they were intended.  If the people in these houses spent about 2/-in whitewashing them once or twice a year, had a good spring cleaning, and cleaned out the holes and corners in the houses, they would be in a healthier state.</P>
    <P>We are told that tuberculosis attacks every class of the community.  But do not 80 or 90 per cent. of the people in sanatoria come from the poorer sections of the community?  One sees ambulances day by day bringing patients to the sanatoria.  It is the poorer section of the community who are the sufferers.  In my opinion, it is not a question of money but rather the mentality of the people.  Some people, no matter how much is done for them, make no effort to improve their condition, but always hold out the hand for somebody to help them.  I know this is not a popular speech, but I should like Deputies to view the problem from that angle.  I have studied the problem.  I have talked to many people and I find that the problem is due to the attitude of the people themselves.  Governments can do a great deal in providing necessary facilities and publicity, but it is of no avail if the people do not co-operate.</P>
    <P>We are going to spend millions at <Col N="2035" /> the top.  We may find that two or three of the sanatoria which we propose to construct may become white elephants.  Indeed I hope that that will be the case.  I hope that they may never be needed and that tuberculosis will be reduced to pre-war proportions. The ratepayers' money is involved and when these buildings are put up there will be complaint that the ratepayers will have to bear this huge burden in the future.  As Deputy Beegan said, it is not going to be all sunshine.  There is no use in praising the Parliamentary Secretary for spending all this money on tuberculosis.  It may be silly nonsense if we do not face the facts and if we do not insist that the people themselves should make some effort to reduce the disease.</P>
    <P>At the present moment, money is not being put to a proper use.  It is being squandered.  Money that should be spent on milk, butter and vegetables is being wasted on drink, dancing, cigarettes, pictures and fashions.  I defy contradiction on that.  If that money were devoted to a proper use, if it were spent on food and clothing and if the people were to get plenty of sleep&mdash;which they are not getting&mdash;we would have very little tuberculosis in the country.  In my county in many cases where tuberculosis has stricken girls and boys between 18 and 27 years of age, I often find that there is £5 and £6 going into the house but in many cases the mother, and in most cases, the father goes to the public-house on Saturday night and spends one-third of his wages on beer and tobacco.  That man expects the State to give relief of all kinds to his children.  There are too many selfish brutes in this country who indulge themselves and do not make the slightest effort to face their responsibilities to their children.  They must have their good time at all costs and then they will complain that the State is doing nothing for his child who has to be sent to a sanatorium, suffering from tuberculosis, caused by malnutrition.  I should like Deputies to discuss that aspect of the problem. There is no use in talking about all the grand things we are doing, and all the money we are going to spend.  We can do no good if we do not get down to <Col N="2036" /> rockbottom and make the people realise that they constitute the greatest danger, that the Government is doing more than its share.  I believe the Government is doing more than its share.  There is a great deal of in-breeding in this country, resulting in delicate children.  That has been going on for years, and it is one of the biggest factors causing the disease.</P>
    <P>The middle-class farmers, as a class, are, more or less, immune to this disease.  In general, they are the healthiest section of the community. They are hard working&mdash;an essential for good health&mdash;they eat good food and they have less money to squander. They are content.  They have to do with less tobacco and less drink, because their parents do not give them the money.  Contentment, in my opinion, is conducive to good health.</P>
    <P>The dance halls are packed with young boys and girls.  It costs a boy £1 to take himself and a girl to a dance and he may spend 15/- on drink.  That boy may be earning £2 a week.  It is that type of person who tells you how hard it is to live.  Money is being squandered in this country.  If there were less money and a greater sense of responsibility, especially on the part of heads of families, there would be very little complaint about tuberculosis or anything else.</P>
    <P>In this country we want more hard work, more commonsense and a greater sense of public decency.  We are one of the most thriftless people under the sun.  We live for to-day and do not care for to-morrow.  Yet the people know that there is a bare and bleak period ahead of us.  What we are sowing to-day we will reap to-morrow.</P>
    <P>There are too many unhappy homes in this country.  That is the cause of most of the unrest and most of the sickness.  The father is out squandering the money while the mother is faced with the problem of making ends meet.  Our social services are second to none.  We spend far more money on social services in this country than we should spend.  All these State aids are not good for the country&mdash;children's allowances, widows' and orphans' pensions. <Col N="2037" /> Most of them are necessary but, in some cases, families receiving children's allowances derive no real benefit from them.  It means more cigarettes, more tobacco and more drink.  In most cases&mdash;not all&mdash;those who collect the children's allowances use it simply for pocket money and spend it on themselves, not on their families.</P>
    <P>I should prefer to see the problem tackled in a more direct way, that is, by getting work for the people and, if they will not work and are fit to work, let them go hungry and fend for themselves.  The State has become general benefactor to too great an extent.</P>
    <P>What we want at the present moment is a thorough cleaning up of the sanitary conditions in our country. I am not talking about the cities.  I know that, as regards the cities or big towns, it is a social condition.  A man in the city cannot get carrots or cabbage or onions or leeks as easily as the man in the country can get them. The small farmer or labourer in the country can have plenty of porridge, potatoes, soup, and vegetables, even though he is earning very little money. But do the people in the country avail of those facilities?  They do not. What you will find in the ordinary home in the country is the old teapot stewing at the fire.  Although they are getting very little tea at the moment through the ordinary channels, I can guarantee that 90 per cent. of them are never without it.  They go into every black market shop in the place and pay from 25/- to 30/- a lb. for it.  You will never find in their pot a head of cabbage, an onion, a leek, or any of those things which are essential to the maintenance of health. All they want is the drop of tea, and the old white loaf on a Saturday night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not need bacon; they could even eat the cabbage raw, and it would be good for them. They need not make &ldquo;molly coddles&rdquo; out of themselves.  They need not be <Col N="2038" /> without bacon either; they could buy a young pig for 50/- or £3, and it would be a paying proposition, but they will not do it because there is plenty of hard work in it.  The sanitary conditions in many parts of the country are appalling.  The complaint I have against the authorities is that, when they are building cottages for the people, they do not provide any sanitary facilities.  But, apart from that, there is not a man in this country who could not go out and get three or four tar barrels, cut them up, and make some sort of convenience. Instead, we find that the surroundings of their little homes are in a filthy mess.  It should not be necessary for the State to provide sanitary arrangements for them. There is plenty of compulsion needed in this country.  We are told that compulsion is bad.  I say it is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only thing with which I find fault in this country is that we have too much freedom.  The people have absolute freedom to do what they like, and they are doing what they like.  I should like to see many of the arrangements tightened up, to make the people realise their responsibility to keep the houses with which the State has provided them clean and tidy, that they ought to paint or whitewash them regularly, and have an occasional spring cleaning.  In my opinion it is the duty of the public authorities to inspect those houses at least twice a year, and they should also be visited by a sanitary inspector.  If they did not clean their houses and keep them in proper condition they should be removed.  If two or three of them were removed because they did not make an effort to keep their houses in proper condition, we would soon find an improvement. Those are hard things to say, but they are facts.  I am not one bit alarmed at the tuberculosis position in the country. It is not so terribly dangerous at all. Another suggestion I should like to make is that we ought to have more physical training and culture.  There are too many fellows in the country who, when they come to 15 or 16 years of age, are old men.  The very moment they leave school, they get into long trousers, and the next thing is they <Col N="2039" /> must have their pint.  They must also have their packet of &ldquo;fags,&rdquo; even if it has to be provided out of their mothers' old age pension.  Then they must go to dances almost every night. Those are the things which cause tuberculosis. Their vitality is lowered through their own nonsense and neglect.</P>
    <P>I do not think I have very much more to say.  I have said quite a lot, and I wish many other Deputies would speak out their minds.  There is no use in saying that we want sanatoria and doctors and nurses.  You can put up sanatoria all over the country, and staff them with nurses and doctors, but that will not solve the problem if the people do not realise their own duties and carry them out.  If they do not carry out their duties, the State should enforce its authority.  In that way, in my opinion, you would be doing more good than by spending millions of pounds on sanatoria.  I do hope that the sanatoria which are to be erected will be white elephants&mdash; that they will not be needed.  If the people could be brought to realise their responsibilities, we would have very little need for sanatoria.  There will always be a certain amount of tuberculosis in all countries.  A person whose vitality is lowered will pick up a cold; he recovers, gets into a perspiration, and contracts another, but it need not develop into tuberculosis if he takes reasonable precautions.  The young people of this country are not taking reasonable precautions.  You will find them absolutely dancing themselves mad, jitterbugs and all the rest of it, and then going home in a lather of perspiration.  I know many young boys who are in sanatoria to-day because of that kind of foolish conduct. The ordinary middle class farmer who has plenty of work, common sense, and very little money to spend on nonsense, is fairly healthy, and so are his children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Deputies seem to feel somewhat upset because an effort is being made to show that we are a race of people among whom tuberculosis is rampant. <Col N="2040" /> Deputy Giles has given us a new slant on the problem.  He wants us to portray ourselves to the world as a race of lazy, shiftless, superstitious, good-for-nothing morons, who have no souls to save and no bodies worth saving.  Not only has he given us a new social and national outlook on our people, but he has given us a new group of medical theories on tuberculosis. The Parliamentary Secretary is a professional man, and I am sure he has learned a good lot of valuable tips during the last few minutes.  A mind like that of Deputy Giles is one that I think we might more closely regard next week, when we come to deal with another Bill.  I should like to go back to the beginning of this debate, because it will be recalled that, in addition to the debate on the Second Reading of the present Bill, we also undertook to consider a motion from these benches setting out a number of proposals for the consideration of this House.  I want to make it quite clear at the beginning that that motion in itself is not the motion of the Labour Party, but was put down, as one of our speakers said, some 12 months ago, and I think could be regarded as a consensus of informed opinion on what was felt to be the essential basis of a campaign of a nation-wide scope to deal with this problem.  Therefore, there is no particular credit due to us in formulating the motion, but only in the fact that it has contributed to some extent to the development of the discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason why I mention the four or five points in the motion&mdash;namely, the co-ordination and the intensification of methods of fighting tuberculosis; the intensification of a campaign for case finding; preventive treatment; the provision of institutional treatment; the question of after care and maintenance of people recovering from the disease, and finally the problem of studying the effects of infection by contact&mdash;is not to try to get back to the basis of the motion for this discussion but to show that this motion, with its five points, was the skeleton around which the Parliamentary Secretary built up his address to the House yesterday. I do not think there is any <Col N="2041" /> other alternative basis.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary and his medical advisers are in earnest so far as they are personally concerned with this problem, and, because they are medical men and charged with wider knowledge than those of us who take the ordinary layman's interest in the problem, they must of necessity follow certain accepted lines, although they may differ on questions of detail.  It is from that point of view, from the point of view of the five points set down in the motion, that I think we should measure and judge the address of the Parliamentary Secretary and the possibilities latent in the Bill now before the House.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies here have referred to the question of tuberculosis as a national problem.  It is not only a national problem; it is a national menace, and for several years past that menace has been growing greater. It is not only a menace to our people as a whole, but is, above all, a menace to the most valuable section of our community, our boys and girls between the ages of 16 and 25.  When we realise that out of every 100 young people, who die between these ages, 64 die of tuberculosis, we see how true it is to speak of it as a menace.  In addition to those who die there are countless numbers affected by the disease in the country.  Even to-day we do not know exactly how many people are affected in some degree with tuberculosis.  That is still a problem, but I understand that some experts have placed the figure as high as 50,000.  The important fact that we have to bear in mind is that each advanced patient in our midst represents an immediate and actual danger to other people.  It is not a mere question of segregating 3,000 or 4,000 people at the moment.  It is a question of seeing that this canker in our midst does not grow and develop to such an extent that it becomes ineradicably rooted in our people in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne has mentioned that, to a certain extent, some Deputies can claim credit for having exercised pressure on the Parliamentary Secretary for a number of years on this matter. <Col N="2042" /> I think we can all agree that within the last year or two this pressure&mdash; whether it was necessary to exercise it on the Parliamentary Secretary is not important&mdash;has become intensified and that amongst every section of our people there has grown up a realisation that we have got a problem here that demands immediate attention. We have the campaign carried on by the Red Cross and we have almost daily in the Press urgent and strong representations by medical men and social workers that immediate attention should be given to the problem.  I do not think it unfair to the Parliamentary Secretary to say that if he has now come before the House with this Bill it is not unconnected with the campaign to which I refer, because I think he will agree that while he himself and his medical advisers know what they have got to do, they are faced with the problem of securing the means to do it, and I think they would welcome any pressure that can be applied to secure the financial and physical means to carry out the measures which they know are necessary to fight this scourge.</P>
    <P>We have the fact that, since 1938, there has been an increase in the death rate and a corresponding increase in the incidence of the disease in the country and we are faced with the problem that not only have we got to deal with what might be regarded in the case of other diseases as a temporary factor, but also with features in tuberculosis that are unusual.  It is the third highest killing disease.  It is a disease that is intimately connected with the social conditions of our people and it is not static.  It is progressive in its effects.  Therefore, if we neglect the problem or allow it to pass without attention, it is not a problem that will confine itself to its present proportions. From that point of view, I think we are entitled to say that, while the Parliamentary Secretary as an individual member of the Government merits appreciation for the Bill he has now brought before the House, I for one do not feel inclined to join in the many eulogies that have been lavished upon him.  In fact, I would be inclined to say that, for certain reasons, we <Col N="2043" /> ought to defer the Second Reading of the Bill.  It is true that under the Bill we are dealing with one of the most urgent and pressing questions, that is the question of institutional treatment. Nobody will differ from the Parliamentary Secretary when he regards that as the immediate problem, but it is quite clear that if the existence of advanced cases of tuberculosis in the midst of families, in the midst of industrial and everyday life, is a present source of danger to other people, apart from the question of curing patients themselves, they have got to be removed from their present surroundings.  There is only one way of dealing with them and that is by placing them in a sanatorium of some sort.  From that point of view no one can quarrel with the Parliamentary Secretary's proposals.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that while he has spoken of the other factors that the campaign envisages &mdash; the question of improving treatment, of improving the anti-tuberculosis campaign carried on in various districts, and improving the qualifications of local tuberculosis officers&mdash;I think he realises that all that has been said in regard to one other factor is also true.  That is, that while we may argue about the fine points of malnutrition, and about the question of providing maintenance before and after sanatorium treatment, we do all recognise one simple fact and that is that if the people of the country had a sufficiency of good, wholesome food, our tuberculosis problem would not be so great as it is to-day.  There can be no argument about that.  I do not think, although the Parliamentary Secretary did make some reference to malnutrition in his address, that he was trying to do what other people have tried to do&mdash;to suggest that malnutrition is not one of the primary and most important factors in the incidence of tuberculosis.  I think he was speaking as a professional man, and referring to the ordinary difficulty that professional men have in arriving at a firm and definite judgement on particular problems until they have actual factual material available to them, but if he will try to approach the question, not as a professional man, but as one who <Col N="2044" /> moves amongst the people, who has a knowledge of their lives, he will know quite well that to provide beds in sanatoria and a number of new sanatoria, and not to deal with the problem of how patients are to be maintained while undergoing treatment in the institution, awaiting admission or when they come out &mdash; how they are to be given a sufficiency of food to protect them against a further onset of the disease, to build up their bodies and give them an opportunity of becoming normal, healthy people&mdash;means that we are dealing with only one side of the problem.</P>
    <P>I can realise his difficulties because it is all very well for a number of Deputies of all Parties to come along and suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that we should guarantee wages to any man who has tuberculosis and who is prepared to go into a sanatorium.  I agree with him that the problem is not merely one of guaranteeing wages to such people. This is not an isolated problem. Tuberculosis is only one of the manifestations of the bigger problem, that a great proportion of our people are not enjoying a proper standard of living, that we have got people, not of the type referred to by Deputy Giles but ordinary men and women, who have gone through the knowledge and experience that they have not been able to feed their children, to clothe them or to pay the rent, not because they are wasting their money or neglecting their duties as parents, but because of the ordinary simple fact that from their day's work&mdash;and some of them have no work&mdash;they are getting too little wages.  That is a very great percentage of our people.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Parliamentary Secretary should take heart from the expression of views on all sides of the House and, while going ahead with his Bill, he should go back again to his colleagues in the Government and point out to them what is the almost unanimous expression of the House, that without an ancillary measure to this Bill we will not be dealing satisfactorily with the problem facing us. We should be prepared, as he says himself, to step aside from politics for <Col N="2045" /> the moment and accept an increased financial burden in order to meet this problem, deal with it on a common basis, and try to provide what is essential and what is accepted by experts whose writings on the subject I have read, namely, that persons suffering from tuberculosis should have the means to supply themselves and to maintain their families while they are undergoing treatment.  Possibly the Parliamentary Secretary has got views on that and is dealing with the matter step by step, but I think he is doing himself a considerable degree of harm from the point of view of being able to say that he has effectively and in an efficient manner taken the first steps to deal with this problem, and his Bill will be a lop-sided attempt and will not be a correct interpretation of his own professional viewpoint as a medical man and has viewpoint as an administrator.  He should take heart from the many expressions he has heard in the House, take his courage in his hands, and say that, in addition to this Bill, we want something more that will meet the point of view expressed throughout the House&mdash;that we must have ways and means of giving some form of maintenance to those people whom we are trying to save.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other points I want to touch upon.  It seems to me that what I have already spoken about is the kernel of the whole position and until we deal with that we will not be making sufficient progress and we will not have got down to the practical means of tackling the problem.  Reference was made by Deputy Fogarty to something that we have allowed to pass over.  The Parliamentary Secretary hopes that in one and a half years a number of these sanatoria will be in use.  I hope his optimism will be justified.  I have read statements by other persons, both in the Government and on local authorities, dealing with the possibility of having buildings of different types erected and very few of them have been so optimistic as to believe the buildings will be ready within the next 18 months.  Most of them refuse to give any estimate of the time by which the buildings will be <Col N="2046" /> ready.  Even granting that we will have the first building available within 18 months, it will be a much longer period until all the regional sanatoria will be available.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fogarty raised the problem that has to be faced, namely, what are we to do in the meantime until such a stage is reached when we will be in a position to have the beds available to treat our people?  That is putting it in its narrowest form, because it is a much bigger problem than that.  There are some suggestions which might be regarded as helpful.  In the course of the debate on local government last year, I mentioned a scheme which I know from personal knowledge has been tried elsewhere.  One of the problems we have to deal with in controlling the spread of tuberculosis is that mentioned by many Deputies, the fact of a member of a family, very often the head of the family, being infected and being compelled to remain in the house while awaiting institutional treatment.  Do we not all agree that if it is possible to take that man out of the house, at least at night time, we would considerably reduce the danger of infection to the family?  By doing that we will not seriously interfere with the ordinary family arrangements. It means that the man will go home in the daytime to get his meals because during the day, even in the most confined dwelling, there is a possibility of keeping the infected person apart from the healthy members of the family.  But at night time there is the problem of separation to be faced.</P>
    <P>Not only is it a question of the separation of the infected from the healthy persons, but there is the other factor, namely, that the person suffering from tuberculosis requires, in addition to his food, healthy rest.  Those of us who have knowledge of tenement rooms, and even the rooms in good corporation houses, are aware of the conditions under which families have to sleep, and we realise it is impossible for a man or a boy or girl to get the sleep that is required by those who suffer from this disease.  You have to consider the disturbances in the house, the pressure of a large family, the nervous <Col N="2047" /> irritation of the person who is sick.  All these things contribute to that lack of rest which is not only one of the causes of the disease, but is one of the most difficult things to overcome in the curing of the disease.</P>
    <P>I suggest we should consider seriously the establishment of a number of small centres where persons suffering from tuberculosis and awaiting institutional treatment could go at night after their day's work, go at an early hour, either get a meal there or have the meal at home and rest there at night and in that way be taken away from the family.  It does not require a special medical staff or special medical treatment.  All it means is separation from their families and sleep.  The centres which would serve as night sanatoria need not be elaborate buildings.  They need not be examined in detail, in the same manner as the Minister for Local Government mentioned recently as regards large country mansions in order to see if they would be suitable as sanatoria. Houses in towns or cities with normal accommodation, say, from half-a-dozen rooms up, would be suitable.  It would be worth while considering that as a temporary measure.</P>
    <P>The other question raised by Deputy Fogarty was whether we can find ways and means&mdash;again as a temporary measure&mdash;in order to give additional nourishment, over and above what we are giving in the way of special food allowances, to infected people so as to stay the ravages of the disease while our campaign is getting into full motion.  Again it is a question of money, and one of the experts dealing with this problem says, in the course of a pamphlet distributed by the Red Cross, that if we are going to tackle the problem we must be prepared to spend money.  He makes a rough estimate. He says it is difficult to speak with exactitude but, in addition to what we are spending at present, we should be prepared to face the expenditure of another £1,000,000 a year.  If we had that, in 20 years we would have brought about such a decrease in the incidence of the disease that it would be no longer a major factor in our <Col N="2048" /> health programme and that, in two generations, we could regard tuberculosis as one of the minor natural ills with which humanity has to put up.</P>
    <P>If we do not face it in that way, if we do not accept that obligation and are not prepared to undertake that expense, we will be faced continually with this problem and with everlasting expense on a greater scale than at present in order to try to keep the disease within some reasonable bounds.  That is why I was struck by one figure the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned in the course of his address. He said that at present the grants from the Central Fund to the various tuberculosis schemes amounted to £174,000 and that he expected that expenditure in the course of five years would grow to £300,000.  I think we must be prepared to face a bigger amount than that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of £300,000 I mentioned was intended to refer to the additional expenditure arising out of this Bill for the maintenance largely of these institutions which we propose to provide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Even taking it that £300,000 is applicable only to the expenses arising under the Bill and adding what we are already spending on existing schemes, we still are very far short of the figure mentioned by this man, who, I think, is in a position to give at least a general idea of what we may have to spend.  Therefore, from that point of view, when we see almost a 40 per cent. increase in the past six years in the tuberculosis death rate and we propose to spend a sum of £300,000&mdash;roughly 100 per cent. more than we are spending&mdash;we have not yet approached the problem on a realistic basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary towards the close of his speech appealed to everybody to approach the problem in a realistic manner.  I think he will agree that those who have praised him for the Bill, who have accepted the Bill as being good, even though limited, and have, at the same time, impressed upon him the urgency and the need of dealing with the question <Col N="2049" /> of maintenance and the relationship of malnutrition in a general way with this problem dealt with it in a manner equally real.  Possibly those of us who speak on these benches have greater liberty of expression than he enjoys. We can appreciate that, but I should like to close on the note to which I referred earlier, that he should take heart from the reception given to, if you like, his first major effort in this direction.  It is not good that an effort of this kind should be met by carping criticism.  We could all be very critical of many things that have happened, but we should welcome this Bill, while, at the same time, urging the Parliamentary Secretary to go further, to take advantage of the support, and even the pressure, in the House and to bring to the House very shortly what should be the complementary part of this Bill, namely, some system whereby, first, in addition to curing the bodies of affected persons in these sanatoria, it can be provided that their families will not become sources of infection through lack of support while the bread-winner is away and, secondly, that the man or woman receiving treatment will be provided with the food he or she requires either before going into the institution, because there may be a waiting period, or on coming out so that he or she will not be again broken down by stress of economic circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHCrowley" hpid="Mr. F. Crowley Mr. F. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the able and efficient manner in which he is tackling this problem.  I have looked up certain figures and I was just wondering whether it is wise to try to create a serious situation or to create propaganda in relation to it.  I am not suggesting that many Deputies in the House are doing so, but one or two are.  I find that, in 1904, there were 8,798 deaths from tuberculosis; while, in 1943, the number had dropped to 4,306, or less than half.  About 30 years ago, a campaign was carried on in this country, a campaign which did much good and much harm, and I hope that a second campaign is not to be started here in the form of exaggerated comment which may do serious harm to this country again.  If we are to <Col N="2050" /> tackle this problem, we have to tackle it on figures, and I have given the figures.</P>
      <P>As a result of the campaign carried on 30 years ago in Europe, in England and in the States, this country was supposed to be reeking with tuberculosis. We do not want that atmosphere created again.  A certain percentage of our population emigrate and if that atmosphere is again created, it is going to tell seriously against them.  I remember one time when it was almost impossible, as a result of that campaign, for an Irish girl to be taken in as a domestic servant in England, and we have to look at this matter from that point of view.  It must be looked at also from the point of view of tourism, which is going to be a very important feature after the war, and if we are to have a campaign of exaggeration which has the effect of suggesting that the disease is very serious here, people will not be very anxious to come to the country.  I mention these points because I regard them as important, because I am interested in tourism and because I know the serious harm which the campaign of 30 years ago did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the contributory causes of tuberculosis, I would not place malnutrition first.  I would put clothing first, and not so much lack of clothing as the type of clothing worn.  I remember, and I think many Deputies will remember, the time when the dispensary doctors swore by woollen garments as protection against rheumatism, chest troubles and lung troubles. If we look back over the last 12 years and note the change in our garments, we find that artificial silk and cotton have largely replaced wool.  That change is not so harmful in its effects until we come to the dance hall.  We find over-crowded dance halls, and young girls and boys&mdash;particularly girls &mdash;leaving them at 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning, clothed in light garments, with very probably a cotton raincoat thrown over their shoulders.  I say that the contrast between the two temperatures&mdash;the temperature of the dance hall and the temperature outside&mdash;is more responsible than anything I know for tuberculosis amongst <Col N="2051" /> girls.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to look at it from the point of view of educating the public as to whether it is wiser to get back to the old woollen garment or to continue wearing the flimsy, light garments we wear at the moment.</P>
    <P>One other point&mdash;it was raised by Deputy Beegan already&mdash;that I should like to stress, is in connection with the erection of hospitals.  Of course, the erection of these hospitals is a very important matter, but it is also very important to know how they are to be maintained in the future, and I should like to make an earnest plea that these hospitals should be maintained out of the Central Fund.  I hold that tuberculosis is a problem that should not be tackled locally, and that the expense of its elimination should be borne out of moneys provided from the Central Fund.  In this connection, I remember reading the report of a commission that was appointed, I think, in or about 1926 or 1927, dealing with the whole question of the care of the poor, hospitalisation in this country, and so forth.  It was one of the most elaborate and painstaking reports that I have ever read and, as far as I remember, I think there was a very strong recommendation that on the question of hospitalisation and the provision of grants for their maintenance care should be taken to see that the total maintenance should be provided out of the Central Fund, instead of leaving it on the local rates.  Accordingly, in connection with this matter of maintenance, I would refer the Parliamentary Secretary to that report, because I think that he will find it very useful. I shall not continue any longer, but I certainly congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary again for his noble attempt to solve this very serious problem, and also for warning the House that we can exaggerate the position too much and, by exaggerating it, do very serious harm to this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>While welcoming the Bill, I am afraid that I am compelled to say that this measure is only nibbling at the problem.  The measure <Col N="2052" /> proposes to establish three new sanatoria on a pretty large scale but, in my opinion, a not large enough scale. One proposal is to establish a sanatorium in Galway with an accommodation of, approximately, 400 beds. I think I am safe in assuming that that will have to cater for the whole Province of Connacht, possible including Donegal and Clare.  If that is the case, I suggest that the provision of 400 beds for such a huge area is not the proper way in which to deal with this problem, at least in the way in which we should like to see it dealt with.  Even if it only included the counties of Connacht, I think it would still be insufficient.  Now, the Parliamentary Secretary has got assurances of support from every Deputy in this House who has spoken on the matter. He has been assured of their full support, but I am sure that he realises that the present Bill will not deal adequately with this problem.  If we were unfortunate enough to be involved in a war, every nerve would be strained, and no expense would be considered too great, to deal with the invaders of our country.  Now, however, we have in our midst a vile disease waging war upon us, and yet it would seem that we grudge the amount of money to be spent in combating that enemy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit that £1,500,000 is a huge sum of money, but I think, nevertheless, that we should not grudge even twice that amount, if it would enable us to grapple with this terribly serious problem and wipe out this disease, because I am firmly of the opinion that, if proper measures are taken, tuberculosis could be definitely wiped out in this country in the course of two or three generations.  I am not a medical man, and I do not claim to have any special knowledge in this matter, but I think it is quite clear to anybody with common sense that tuberculosis could be wiped out in this country in two or three generations if the problem was tackled on a big scale.  Take the case of County Mayo, for instance.  In that county, with a population of 161,000, 183 deaths from tuberculosis were reported last year.  Now, I do not think I would be exaggerating in assuming that there are two people <Col N="2053" /> suffering from tuberculosis for every single death that has occurred there, and that would bring the number up to 366 for one county alone.  I admit that it is a large county, but there are a few other large counties in the Province of Connacht, and I believe that the provision of a new sanatorium in Galway would not be sufficient to deal with that one county alone, not to speak of the other counties in Connacht.  For that reason, I believe that the object this measure is aimed at will not be achieved unless there is greater provision for these cases.  At present, for instance, we have only 40 beds in Ballinrobe hospital, plus 12 beds in Castlebar hospital, and, in Peamount, we have between 20 and 30 beds&mdash;and that in order to deal with a problem of about 400 cases in a population of 161,000.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should take measures to double, at least, the number of sanatoria, and that he should provide six sanatoria instead of the three mentioned in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested here by several Deputies that it would not be too much to expect the provision of at least six sanatoria, and seeing that the present measure is getting so much support here in the House, that it will get support from rich and poor alike throughout the country, and that everybody is behind the Parliamentary Secretary in his efforts to put this disease to flight, I think he should be willing to agree to doubling the number of sanatoria.  The setting up of one sanatorium in Galway to deal with five or six counties is entirely inadequate, and I think it would be a pity, when the problem is being tackled at all, that it should not be tackled in a proper way, so that an end could be put to this disease once and for all.</P>
    <P>I admit that, in order to tackle this matter in a proper way, a great deal of expense will be involved, but it will be a diminishing expense, and, if the problem is tackled in a proper way in the beginning, the expense will end all the sooner.  Take the case of the 4,000 or 5,000 people who die annually from this disease.  Let us assume that the earning capacity of each of these people is £100 at the least.  That represents a dead loss of about £500,000 to <Col N="2054" /> the State every year.  I think that this problem should be tackled in a big way.  Let us take the quota for my county alone.  We will have just room for 58 patients in Galway, plus the allowance we already have.  Now, that is entirely inadequate, because there is already a waiting list of hundreds there, and the fact that there is inadequate accommodation is giving rise to grave abuses, as I brought to the notice of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in the debate last spring.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of propaganda so far as this disease is concerned, the Parliamentary Secretary, when introducing the Bill, gave us a much clearer explanation than other Ministers do.  He said that there would be an intensive propaganda campaign carried out to help people to fight the disease and educate them in connection with it.  I think that that will be one of the most important things that will contribute to defeating tuberculosis. Several cases have been brought to my notice where it would appear that, unfortunately, this disease has been contracted by people as a result of ignorance and not taking the proper steps to deal with it in time.  I am sure that other Deputies have heard cases of people attending dance halls in the country, perspiring in these dance halls, then coming out into the cold air and going to bed without taking any precautions.  Now, if people were properly educated as to the danger of contracting the disease in such circumstances, it would be a very good thing.  I suggest that it would be advisable to have a notice hung prominently in every dance hall, or places where games are being played, emphasising the danger, pointing out the ways in which the disease can be contracted, and the remedies to be taken.  I think that if that were to be done it would pay a dividend in a very short time, so far as the fight against this disease is concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to speak very long on this matter, but I should like to say a few words on the question of a rehabilitation scheme of some kind for the people who have to go into a sanatorium and then return to the old conditions. People may spend six months, <Col N="2055" /> a year, or two years, in a sanatorium, and then, when they are pronounced cured or convalescent they return to the old conditions.  I suppose I would be safe in saying that in most cases where people contract tuberculosis, who have not had it before, there may be a predisposition to that disease in that family afterwards.  It is a waste of time and money to send people for a course of treatment, if they have to return to the work and living conditions that they had when they contracted the disease.  There should be some scheme under which they would be able to take up different occupations. A scheme of that kind is working in England and has given very good results.  Now that this Bill is before the House, there should be embodied in it a provision for the establishment of at least three additional hospitals and for an intensive propaganda campaign against the disease. Without a rehabilitation scheme of some kind it is absolutely useless to be sending people away for treatment if they have to return to the same surroundings.  In the rural district those working on the land or on the bogs should be able to change their employment if there is any predisposition to this complaint.  In the towns and cities where the working conditions are unhealthy, and conducive to the spread of tuberculosis, consideration should also be given to the question of providing other types of employment.  If the Parliamentary Secretary never did better work during his period of office, than tackling this problem, he will leave after him a scheme of which he may be proud, so that in the course of time tuberculosis will be coped with and the memory of it a nightmare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to associate myself with those Deputies who have welcomed the introduction of this Bill. Beyond doing that I do not intend to offer any word of praise to the Department, because for many years people in high stations, as well as ordinary citizens, have been agitating to have something done to cope with this disease and prevent any increase of it. <Col N="2056" /> It is a complaint that no one would like to admit had been contracted by any relative.  Some may criticise that point of view, and talk about ignorance, but it has to be admitted that people are very reluctant publicly to announce that a brother or a sister had contracted tuberculosis.  Whether people are rich or poor, it must be admitted that it would take much propaganda to convince the ordinary citizen that it is for the well-being of the country as a whole that they should be prepared to have themselves examined in case there was any doubt about the incidence of the disease. Many people say that they are suffering from an ordinary cold but the symptoms are otherwise.  Accordingly, it should be their duty in their own interests to be medically examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may say that in nine or ten years, after this Bill has been working, there will be a reduction of tuberculosis cases by some 50 per cent.  But for such reduction we have to wait for years.  Is it not too bad that Parliamentary Secretaries in this or in former Governments did not take steps to have such a scheme enforced? We have been late in doing so and in the meantime thousands of people have gone to their graves, while thousands of others have become infected, by allowing them to mingle amongst people with large families and in public cafés and hotels.  That showed a lack of appreciation of the danger by Governments in that respect. It shows that they had no idea of the danger until agitation arose within the last few years.  It was the complaints, letters in the newspapers from medical men and others who felt strongly on the question, as well as the agitation that resulted, that convinced the present Government that it was necessary to take steps to deal with the position.  From 1914 to 1938, 2,850 people were affected by tuberculosis, and from 1940 to 1944, 350 people. Although we have had national government and a certain amount of national independence for a quarter of a century, very little progress was made in that time.  In his report, the county medical officer of health in Mayo stated that the incidence of tuberculosis <Col N="2057" /> was due to under-nourishment, not so much to lack of food or clothing as to lack of footwear, lack of well-heated houses, sanitary arrangements and pure drinking water for children. In a country with a small population, which has had freedom for 25 years, that situation is no credit either to the former or to the present Government. Medical officers of health do not make statements of that kind unless there is good ground for them.  When walking past the post office on Wednesday night I saw two children, aged about nine and 12 years, who were badly clad and without boots, singing before a queue.  One had a cough that it was painful to have to listen to.  I suggest that there are many more children like them in Dublin and elsewhere, who are not properly nourished or cared.  It is a terrible state of affairs in the present state of civilisation to have children in that condition during this wintry weather.</P>
    <P>I should like to know why the Parliamentary Secretary has chosen Galway as the site of one of the sanatoria that it is contemplated erecting.  There may be a reason for that.  If so, I am anxious to know why it is proposed to bring people from Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo and Mayo to Galway for treatment. I think that you should get a more suitable place.  I suppose the Parliamentary Secretary has a definite explanation as to why he proposes to have the sanatorium erected in County Galway.  I visited some sanatoria on the other side of the water and I should like to know if it is the intention to have attached to the sanatoria here large farms.  In a place called Grimsby, there is a sanatorium a few miles outside the town and, attached to it, is a large farm.  The purpose of the farm is to give employment to young men who leave the sanatorium after a stay of 12 months or, perhaps, two years.  After that, they engage in light work, such as gardening and cultivation of the soil.  In that way, the sanatorium authorities have them under observation for another period of six or 12 months.  If necessary, they find them suitable employment.  In many instances, the work they were formerly engaged in would be too heavy for them.  Even after patients spend a <Col N="2058" /> period in a sanatorium and come home cured, as they are supposed to be, they are not as strong as they were before they contracted the disease. They are unfit for heavy, laborious work.  I know a few cases of patients who belonged to families who were fairly well off and, therefore, got every possible treatment.  They are out now close on two years and they are not yet fit to take up a certain type of work. There may be cases of young men whose parents are not in a position to give them assistance and who will not be able to find employment when they leave the sanatoria.  If those farms were attached to the sanatoria, these men would be able to get employment there for six or 12 months.  That would help to defray the expense of the upkeep of the institution.</P>
    <P>I cannot impress too strongly upon the Parliamentary Secretary that this is a dangerous disease, and that it has a very strong root in the country.  No matter what Deputies may say and no matter how it may affect the tourist trade in the post-war period, we must admit that the disease has got a grip and a dangerous grip.  It has not got a grip equal to that which it has in Belgium or other continental countries, due to war conditions.  But it is only by admitting the danger we shall be able to convince the people and secure their co-operation in combating the disease.  One thing which does not add to the health of the people is the dance hall.  As I said on a previous occasion, these dance halls are run as business concerns and not for the purpose of recreation and entertainment.  In picture houses and other places of entertainment, the individual is allotted a certain space, but the controllers of the dance halls may allow anything from 200 to 1,000 persons to take part in their form of entertainment.  Their interest is what they can get at the door.  In that way, you have overcrowding of these dance halls and people, perhaps, infected with this disease by the dust and by others spitting. Out of that arises a grave danger to the health of the youth of our country.  Some regulation should be made to prevent overcrowding of dance halls.  It should be provided <Col N="2059" /> that a certain space would be available for each person admitted.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Giles that our people are lazy and dirty.  I happen to be the son of very humble and poor parents.  I doubt if there is in Dáil Eireann a son of more humble or poorer parents.  My father and I had to earn our living abroad. My father brought us up by going every year for six months abroad. We were a large family and I do not think that we had bad example as regards dirt or laziness.  Speaking for the people of my county, their little cabins and homes are comparable with the cabins and the homes of the people of any other country.  They are whitewashed, inside and outside, two or three times a year.  Manure pits are kept a certain distance from the dwelling except in very few cases.  I should like to contradict the statement by Deputy Giles and some other Deputies, that our people are lazy and not clean. The reverse is the case.  The windows of the houses may not be very large. They may be fixed windows, which do not open.  There may be overcrowding in the few rooms but that is a different story from the allegation of dirt and laziness.  It is too bad that it should have been said that the people, particularly the small farmers and the peasant farmers, are of that character.</P>
    <P>I wholly agree with Deputy Dillon when he stresses that the Parliamentary Secretary should not hesitate to go as far as possible in providing the accommodation necessary, apart from the question as to where the necessary funds are to be obtained.  He pointed out very reasonably that, if we are prepared to spend lavishly now, that lavish expenditure will not be required in the near future.  If we are prepared to take the necessary steps not only to prevent but to eradicate this disease, in five or ten years no sum will be required.  If we are prepared to spend only a certain sum now, so as to keep the disease at a certain level, an annual Vote will be required, perhaps, for the next hundred years, and we shall only succeed in preventing the disease from increasing.  I know very well that on <Col N="2060" /> platforms at the coming local elections I and other Deputies will criticise the Government for the increase in the rates.  I think we should try to take a wider view of our politics.  The people, after all, are just as intelligent as we are.  If we were to take an unfair advantage of the Government by criticising them for an increase in the rates due to this Bill&mdash;for the erection of a sanatorium in a particular county&mdash;then I think we would get the answer we deserve, and might not be elected.  I do not think that the people can be fooled that way, by trying to make it appear that the Government are spending money foolishly or lavishly on something that is not necessary.  Criticism of lavish expenditure is justified when one can point to savings that might be made under some sub-head of a Vote or on a particular Estimate.  To criticise the expenditure of money under this Bill would be to take an unfair advantage of the Government and of the Department of Local Government in particular. So far as the expenditure of money under this Bill is concerned, I think the Parliamentary Secretary has nothing to fear.  He will get the support of every fair-minded man and woman in the country.  I would be delighted if he were to take back the Bill and alter it, and were to propose to double the amount of money which he intends to spend in order that increased bed accommodation might be provided for the 7,000 cases mentioned. He indicated that there were two lines of thought on that subject, one of which was that 7,000 beds were necessary in order to meet the needs of people who are suffering from this disease.  I can assure him that if the bell were to be rung, and if every Deputy were to be summoned to the Chamber, he would get unanimous support if he were to propose to make financial provision for the 4,000 beds which are required at once.  Is that number not correct?</P>

      <P>I would say that the policy is right because I have reason to know and to regret the suffering that this disease causes.  I know what tuberculosis patients suffer, what they go through, and I would be prepared to stand over any sum that might be asked for to help to eradicate the disease, and to face a local election or a general election on that issue. There is only one way of preventing the spread of the disease, and that is by reducing the number of those who are likely to contract it.  Why wait for another ten years to do that, and then come before the House and say: &ldquo;Well, ten years ago I came before the House and asked for a certain Bill to be passed; I felt that such-and-such a sum would be sufficient, but now I find that we are not able to meet the situation with that sum.&rdquo;  Now is the time to make a start.  The goal that we should set for ourselves is the complete wiping out of tuberculosis.  I do not think that it would take two or three generations to do that.  We should be able to wipe it out in one generation. One way to do that is to make every effort to provide adequate bed accommodation. Another would be to take steps to convince the people that they should not be ashamed to admit that they have got the disease and should be ready to go to the local doctor or whomsoever is responsible for the medical examination.  Although I do not believe in compulsion, I think that in the case of our heavy industries particularly, in which large numbers of men are employed, a medical man appointed by the Department should visit them once a year and address the workers, pointing out to them the dangers of the disease, and impressing on them the necessity for having themselves examined.  I do not believe it would be necessary to have anything in the nature of compulsion.  Such a man could do a lot by talking to those men in a simple way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I worked in a part of England where there are heavy industries&mdash;iron foundries.  Two friends of mine, fine healthy fellows, in whose families there was no trace whatever of tuberculosis, <Col N="2062" /> contracted the disease there.  They could trace back their families for three generations and not one of them ever had the disease.  Their grandparents lived until they were almost 100 years of age.  These two boys got pneumonia first, then pleurisy and eventually tuberculosis.  They were sent to a sanatorium and died.  If they and other workers had been addressed once a year by a medical man as to the dangers of this disease, and of the consequences that sometimes follow from a cough or a cold, I think they would have taken advantage of the advice.  I suggest that something on the lines I have mentioned should be undertaken by the Parliamentary Secretary. Workers and others should be warned of what a terrible menace this disease is.  Something on the same lines should be done in the schools.  If young people are found to be affected with it and are treated in time, then of course their chance of recovery is all the greater.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, but I feel that its introduction is about ten years late.  I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will consider the many points that have been put before him by Deputies. He has nothing to fear so far as the provision of money is concerned.  If, as I said on a former occasion, we could afford to spend during the last four years sums ranging from £7,000,000 to £10,000,000 a year on the Army, the purpose of the Army being to protect the youth and womanhood of the country, surely we ought to be able to spend £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 on protecting our people from this dread menace of tuberculosis.  After all, it was not simply for the protection of Ireland, a piece of land surrounded by water, that we spent so many millions on the Army, but rather for the protection of the people.  Well, surely the people deserve protection from this disease which is a greater menace to them than invasion by any foreign power, whether it be Germany, England, or any other country.  The people, through taxation, contributed those millions of pounds in the form of taxes on tobacco, beer, sugar, tea and other commodities for their own protection. They have been doing that for the last five years.  I am sure they <Col N="2063" /> would be equally willing to do the same thing for the next 10 years, if necessary, in order to remove this terrible menace which eventually, please God, will be wiped out altogether.</P>

      <P>With the other Deputies who have spoken I should like to join in offering my congratulations to the Parliamentary Secretary for having had the courage to introduce this Bill.  We all understand how necessary a measure of this kind is. Some people may think that its introduction was delayed too long, but is it not better late than never?  In my opinion, it was a courageous thing to introduce it, and I wish the measure every success.  It may be some time before very much can be done in the way of building sanatoria.  I think that we should make a start by having a series of lectures delivered through the various counties on the dangers of this disease and on the methods that should be employed for combating it.  The centres should be so arranged that the people would not have to travel long distances to attend the lectures.  It might be a good thing if the lectures were given in each parish.  If that could be arranged, I believe the people would attend.  We should have these lectures open to the general public. The idea seems to be to instruct the people, firstly, how to avoid the disease; secondly, what they should do if they think they have the symptoms of it; and thirdly, that there is nothing to be ashamed of in having it, that it is just the same as being stricken with any other disease and the sooner they get shame out of their minds the better for the neighbourhood and for the people themselves.  It would be a good thing to have competent lecturers visiting various places throughout the country, apart altogether from having literature spread about, as has been suggested, in dance halls and other places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear that three sanatoria are to be built.  That is a splendid start, but I agree with other Deputies that, as we are taking this venture, it might be better to spend something more and try to build five or six institutions. <Col N="2064" /> Otherwise, it may mean doing the business only in half-measures.  Now that the blow has been struck, it would be much better to do the job rightly and overcome this dread disease once and for all.</P>
    <P>From the numbers we have heard quoted this afternoon, I think one sanatorium would not be capable of dealing with the patients for a particular county, and that may mean we would still be struggling, with people clamouring to get into places and no earthly hope of their doing so.  I have had experience of trying to get patients into sanatoria, but there was not room, and that was not in any way the fault of the heads of the institutions.  I have had to tell various people, who asked me to help them, that there would be no room for at least a year or 18 months. While these people are waiting for beds to be available, they are suffering in their own homes and infecting their families, and also they are, perhaps, not in the very best circumstances to get the nourishment needed.  The more sanatoria it is possible to build the better.  I realise that there may be much ado later on about the cost of these buildings.  However, it is money well spent and, once it is spent, the outlay may decrease gradually and as the patients are cured they will no longer be an encumbrance on the community.</P>
    <P>There is another point of view also. When the Estimates are introduced for the coming year, it may be possible to make some deductions from other Departments which would help.  For instance, the Army Vote may be reduced, or that for some branches of education, like the teaching of Irish to an extent that is really not good for the children or the teachers.  Various other schemes could be thought out to help in saving the money, so that it might be put to this useful purpose, for which the people would really stand and would not begrudge it, no matter what sacrifice it may mean to them.  After all, it is their money and, in their interest, we should study the best way to spend it.</P>
    <P>We naturally understand that the Parliamentary Secretary has wide knowledge of this matter and is <Col N="2065" /> capable of seeing the whole scheme put through in a thoroughly businesslike manner.  I am quite sure that we can leave it to him with confidence and that he will have a staff sufficient to see that all his plans are carried out and that everything is dealt with in an efficient and expeditious way.  Now that the work has been started, I know he will not let it be shelved but will get down to the job right away.</P>
    <P>For some time past there has been a good deal of talk about the anti-tuberculosis campaign here in Ireland by means of the Red Cross Society.  I would like to congratulate the Red Cross on the splendid way in which they took up this enormous task.  They were unfitted to do it and had not the means, and it was really far and away beyond them.  Nevertheless, they gave a good lead and had the backing of the various counties wherever the addresses on anti-tuberculosis were delivered and subscriptions came in very freely.  I congratulate them and thank them.</P>
    <P>At the same time, it is of great relief to people throughout the country interested in stamping tuberculosis out for ever to know that the Government has taken the matter up now.  Those people were at a loss to know why that had not been done before.  They wondered if the Government was just handing over to the Red Cross something which they should have done themselves and for which the Red Cross was wholly unfitted.  Those people are much relieved to know that the Government has taken this up in a wholehearted manner, so that the disease may be stamped out and people may not feel ashamed to say that they have had tuberculosis.  The Government is now grappling with the matter and not handing it over to anyone else. It will be dealt with now by the people who are responsible&mdash;the Government and members of An Dáil.  We appreciate very much the efforts of the Red Cross Society, while we understand that they could never deal with the disease to the same extent as we can here.  It was a courageous step that the Parliamentary Secretary took at this particular time, and I congratulate him again and wish him the best of luck.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is scarcely anything new to be said on this question, and I merely wish to draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to a more or less local matter.  He is aware that objection has been raised to the site selected for the regional sanatorium in Galway.  Some time ago, when I heard of this proposal, I understood it to be an extension of the existing local sanatorium in Galway and, therefore, I took it to be purely a local matter.</P>
      <P>There is objection from two points of view in connection with the matter. As the Parliamentary Secretary is aware, a religious Order recently built a very fine House of Studies, and now state that the sanatorium site has been selected in such close proximity as to be objectionable.  Personally, I think that the Provincial of the Order has fairly good grounds at least for an examination of the matter, and I would ask that his representations be sympathetically considered.  Apart from that, I have been hearing objections voiced for many years about the site of the present sanatorium in Galway. The proposed new site is, of course, very close to the present one, and even medical opinion has often condemned it.  In fact the same medical people have changed their views about it from time to time, at one period condemning it and at others tolerating it. There is good reason for having the sanatorium near Galway City, on account of the Medical School at University College, Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is desirable to have, not alone a good regional hospital but also any other medical institutions in the county, as near the City of Galway as possible, so that they may be of some use in the study of medicine.  However, even within that limit of selection, it should be possible to get near the city a suitable site which would be somewhat more elevated than the one on which the present sanatorium stands.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take into account the strong public opinion in Galway on this question.  It may be, of course, based on ignorance, as a great many other viewpoints in connection with <Col N="2067" /> tuberculosis seem to be.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will consider carefully the representations which he has received about it.</P>
    <P>On the general question, I think the Parliamentary Secretary is to be congratulated that, in his opening statement, he did not lay down the law positively as to the cause or causes of the increase in this disease.  Unlike a great many other speakers who picked out one cause or another and laid the blame on that, he has wisely kept an open mind.  Several causes, when you examine them, are found not to bear out all the statements that have been based upon them.  There is, for instance, malnutrition.  The Parliamentary Secretary used the term malnutrition in a medical sense and it has been taken up and used inside this House and outside as meaning insufficiency of food.  I understand that the families of people in quite comfortable circumstances, who have no lack of means, are often using food that does not give them proper nourishment and it is in that sense, I understand, that medical men use the term malnutrition. There are a great many people of my acquaintance who are afflicted with this dread disease, some of whom will be offended, and others highly amused when told that the cause of their trouble is malnutrition.  It would be very interesting to take a census of the population of the various sanatoria throughout the country and to find out the walks of life from which the patients come.  In any event, whether it is malnutrition or not, I think the cause could not be laid at the door of inadequate means.  They seem to get proper nourishment.</P>
    <P>I have often heard the view expressed that the increase in tuberculosis is more apparent than real; that it was there for a very long time; that the campaign which has been recommended by a great many speakers is actually taking effect on the minds of the people with regard to this matter; that a great many of the prejudices have disappeared; that the demand for increased sanatorium accommodation is due to the fact that people did not disclose the presence of the disease and did not seek sanatorium treatment <Col N="2068" /> some years ago; but that a great change has taken place in the attitude of the people towards the disease and that the increased demand for treatment created the impression that the disease itself has increased enormously. I hope that is true.  I am sure that, to a certain extent, it is true.  If it is, it will mean that the task of abolishing those prejudices will not be so great as it seemed.  I think that there is a great deal of scope for education in the matter, and I am quite satisfied that the public are prepared to receive it and to profit by it.</P>
    <P>I would say also that the Parliamentary Secretary has been misrepresented in the statements made concerning the extent to which he proposes to provide accommodation for patients.  In reply to Deputy Cafferky, the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out that he has not fixed any limit to the bed accommodation, and that the Government propose to deal with this matter as the problem presents itself to them and as the means at their disposal will permit of their doing.  I think that information ought to satisfy those who are inclined to think that sufficient is not being done.  I think the general attitude should be that this is a very good beginning.  The Bill has been generally welcomed, and that welcome ought not to be in any way lessened by disparaging remarks as to unwillingness to spend the necessary money to deal with the problem in a proper manner.  I wish to endorse the congratulatory remarks made by other speakers, and I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will be completely successful in the big task he has undertaken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to other speakers during this debate, I just intervene to express my opinion. I regret that this Bill is necessary, but.  I welcome it.  The majority of the speakers painted a picture which is likely to create a certain amount of panic in the country. I do not share their views.  I live almost next door to the sanatorium in Kilkenny, and I have daily contact with a great many of the patients there.  From what I have learned from many of these patients, many of them <Col N="2069" /> are in that sanatorium because there is no room for them anywhere else.  The sanatorium in Kilkenny is probably regarded by many people as a place where you are sent to die.  Many of these men and women have told me that they would have reported their condition much earlier but for the fact that they had no guarantee that their dependents would be looked after. They would be all right themselves as patients, but their dependents would not.  I know cases of young men with wives and six, seven, eight, nine or ten children, which are simply appalling, although it may be argued that they are not so badly off now with children's allowances and so on.  I know men who contracted this disease through overwork in trying to rear a large family.  Owing to working extra hours they got run down, and now find themselves patients in this institution in Kilkenny.  Some years ago it was intended to provide a modern sanatorium there, but I expect that under this Bill that is all blotted out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with those speakers who said that this measure will prepare the way for doing a lot for those suffering from this disease.  It is, however, only a small effort and requires enlargement so as to provide that, when a wage-earner has to enter a sanatorium for treatment, his dependents will not suffer thereby.  I was glad to hear Deputy Blowick and Deputy Cafferky speak in the opposite strain to their Deputy-Leader, Deputy Donnellan. Yesterday evening, Deputy Donnellan told us that we would have to cut our cloth according to our measure.  I was sorry to hear that coming from the Deputy-Leader of the Farmers' Party. I know, and Deputy Donnellan knows, that a great many of the people afflicted with this disease come from the rural community.  When it was a question of dealing with the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease some years ago, Deputy Donnellan was very vocal in his demands that there should be no limit to the expenditure necessary for dealing with the disease and providing adequate compensation for those whose cattle were slaughtered.  Surely the Deputy must realise that our young men and women are the greatest asset we have.  In that regard, I hope that <Col N="2070" /> particular regard will be paid to the children from now onwards.  It is deplorable to see queues of children outside poky cinemas on fine summer evenings and at the same time to have appeals in the Press for a sunshine fund for the children of the slums of Dublin. In provincial towns cinemas are permitted to open on Sunday and week evenings, in the broiling summer days, and the management is allowed to pack these halls with children who should be playing in the fields.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this problem is the practice of smoking amongst the youth.  I have no knowledge of this other than that of the ordinary man in the street.  I remember a time when a boy under 16 years of age would not be served with cigarettes.  It was forbidden by regulation or law at the time to serve persons under 16 years of age with tobacco.  At the present time we find the principal pleasure of many boys, even in the primary school, is to find themselves at the end of a Woodbine.  I believe that must be injurious to their lungs.  I draw attention to it in the hope that, whatever the Government's policy may be, there will be greater supervision.  It has been said by a great many people that parents are very lax nowadays.  Somebody must look after the youth of the country and if the parents are lax somebody else has to see to it.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise what I have said with regard to the position in Kilkenny because many of the patients there should be in a proper place for treatment. Many of them could be cured if they could be taken into specialised institutions.  Very often patients expect me or some other T.D. to use influence to have them removed to a proper institution.  They do not want to stay in these places down the country.  I hope the Government will take absolute control and eliminate influence, if it does exist.  There should be equality of treatment for rich and poor in dealing with this and every other disease.</P>
    <P>In my constituency there is the coal-mining industry.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows better than I do the grave dangers associated with that kind of employment.  It is said that a <Col N="2071" /> coal miner of 50 years of age is as old as a man of 70 in any other occupation. Certainly a coal miner of 55 is reckoned as being as old as the ordinary man is at 70.  A great many of them, in fact, never reach that age.  Coal miners, particularly those engaged underground, die at a rather early age and a great many of them, as the records of the sanatorium at Kilkenny show, have died in that institution.  I hope that everything possible will be done to give early attention to a county like County Kilkenny, and that the agricultural community, coal miners and all those who are exposed to severe climatic conditions will be amongst the earliest to be relieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has had many compliments paid to him, but while he was being complimented a cold shiver went down my spine.  The fate of Sodom and Gomorrah was present to my mind. Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed because one just man could not be found.  I hope this country will not share their fate because one healthy man cannot be found here.  The fact of the matter is, tuberculosis we have had; tuberculosis we have and tuberculosis we will have, possibly to the end of the world.  The disease will not be cured over-night.  We may have been lax in our treatment of it during the past 20 or 30 years.  We may have been lulled into a false sense of security, possibly, by many of our county medical officers of health.  I remember crossing swords with one county medical officer of health when I stated that I thought the disease was on the increase.  A pile of statistics was put before me to show that there was a decrease in the incidence of the disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use in exaggerating or minimising the extent of the disease. Thirty years ago a campaign was started in this country by the late Lady Aberdeen.  Many of our people resented the activities of that lady at that period.  They were annoyed at being regarded as a nation of consumptives&mdash;that is the word used at that time.  Now we are going all out in a <Col N="2072" /> campaign against tuberculosis.  That is a very worthy object, of course, but do not let us exaggerate.  Good and effective work can be done quietly, without telling the world at large that we are a people reeking with consumption. That will not cure the disease and it will do infinite harm to the country.  It is Gilbertian, in my opinion, to have the Tourist Development Board spending thousands of pounds on propaganda, inviting people of other nations to come to this country for the good of their health and at the same time to have people getting up on public platforms to state that the country is reeking with tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>For good or ill the Parliamentary Secretary has taken his courage in his hands and, in Section 4 of this Bill, has indicated that he is not going to talk any more, that he is going to work, that he is going to produce results. I think he is doing the right thing in taking control of the whole business, building hospitals himself. He is in a better position to do that, as he has the assistance of technical experts, which would not be available in the ordinary course to members of the various county councils.  He is doing the right thing.  He is accepting that responsibility and the best thing we can do now is to wish him luck, and not to be impatient.  In the Parliamentary Secretary's words, he will be doing great work if he reduces the incidence of this disease by 50 per cent. in the course of ten years.  Other nations have been afflicted with this disease and it has taken them years to make any advance towards its eradication.</P>
    <P>Possibly, after the speeches which have been made here this evening, the Parliamentary Secretary may decide to erect more sanatoria.  I do not know where they should be erected.  That is a matter for him.  There are many important factors to be taken into consideration in selecting sites.  I mention that because during this discussion it seemed to me that some Deputies would like to have one in every county.  There are many factors to be considered in regard to the setting up of sanatoria.  You have to <Col N="2073" /> consider climatic conditions, and so on. The steps which are being taken under this particular Bill will do away with the idea of parochialism.  During the period which must necessarily elapse before those sanatoria are in a position to take in patients, I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary what are the intentions of his Department in regard to the schemes that have been undertaken or are about to be undertaken by the local authorities to provide accommodation for those patients who at the moment cannot get into any sanatoria, either locally or otherwise.  He must be aware that there are public bodies all over the State who are at the moment preparing plans to provide this accommodation, and possibly a certain amount of doubt and anxiety will arise as to what will be the fate of those schemes which are under contemplation at the present time, pending the putting into operation of this Bill.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary, if not in his reply, at least by letter, to intimate to those councils the views of his Department in regard to those schemes which are at the moment about to be started by the various county councils.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to detain the House very much longer, except to say that there is no general cause, so to speak, for this increase in the incidence of tuberculosis.  Reference has been made to malnutrition, to bad housing conditions, and so on, but I would remind Deputies that quite recently the Minister for Local Government issued a circular to the various county medical officers of health asking them for their views as to the reasons for the increase in the incidence of tuberculosis, and, extraordinary to relate, there were very few of them who agreed as to what was the real cause.  Some of them put it down to one thing, some to another. There was no general cause stated, and I think they were about right.  Time and time again we have heard about bad housing.  Possibly, to a certain extent, it is responsible.</P>
    <P>But there have been cases where people were shifted from old houses into new ones and it was only after they went into the new houses that they got into bad health.  That has <Col N="2074" /> been borne out by medical opinion. It was my own opinion ten years ago. When the Government embarked on the re-housing of the people&mdash;a very worthy object&mdash;I pointed out that the people who were living in those old houses were of very limited means, some of them being dependent on 5/-a week from the St. Vincent de Paul Society, out of which they were paying 2/- rent, but when they got into the new houses they had to pay the whole lot for rent and had nothing left over for food.  A good house is no use on an empty stomach.  There is no use in having a tall hat and spats and no shirt; you will not feel warm.  You cannot attribute the increase of this disease to bad housing alone, any more than you can attribute it to bad food or anything else.  Possibly there are factors even beyond the control of medical science which have something to do with it.  We can only do the best we can in the circumstances in which we find ourselves at the moment, and in my opinion the Parliamentary Secretary is taking the right steps.</P>
    <P>I am not at all enamoured of the suggestion that has been put to him about starting an intensive propaganda against tuberculosis.  We are not a people remarkable for our gifts of perseverance.  Our swan song may be heard at any moment; we may drop the whole thing, and the whole responsibility will rest on the Parliamentary Secretary.  I do not think that this intensive propaganda will do any good.  The Parliamentary Secretary has taken on this job.  We are willing to give him the wherewithal.  There is no use in talking about increased rates, or in looking to the Hospitals Trust Fund for all the money.  It is nothing to boast about that we have to go to a fund which has been subscribed by the people of all nations.  It is time we &ldquo;caught ourselves on&rdquo; and subscribed a little ourselves in order to combat this dreadful disease.  Talk is not going to do much good.  Of course, we are here to give the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government all the encouragement we can give them.  The problem can only be solved by taking the right steps, and I think the Parliamentary Secretary is taking them. Above all, do not let us become impatient <Col N="2075" /> of results.  This work is going to take time and money.  Make no mistake about that.  It will take time and money to make any progress in the eradication of this disease which is feared not alone by the people of this country but by the people of all countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many aspects of Deputy Coburn's discourse with which I entirely agree.  I think it is obvious that, notwithstanding many features of our inheritance, our people have proved themselves at home and abroad to be as active and as vigorous and as healthy as any people on earth.  They have proved it in competition in the athletic arena, on the battle-field, and in all types of work and industry.  At the same time, there is no disguising the fact that this disease has made serious inroads on the health of our population.  This Bill endeavours to cope with that problem, and, so far as the idea goes, to my mind it is an admirable one.  The whole treatment of this disease is bound up with various welfare schemes, particularly with regard to housing and the provision of healthy food for the population.  The recent development of plots for the urban population, where they can cultivate household vegetables and thereby provide healthier food for their families, is one which I think will serve to improve the health of our population.  Another step in that direction is the medical examination in the schools.  That will help towards an early diagnosis of the disease amongst children.  As has been pointed out here to-day, the principal incidence of the disease is from 15 or 17 years to about 28 or 30 years. Therefore, the national school medical examination deals only with the fringe of the problem.  The provision of healthy food, pure milk and better living conditions generally should be, to my mind, the principal aim and object of any efforts to deal with this disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there comes the question of early diagnosis and appropriate measures to deal with the early stages of the disease and the provision for the family, particularly where the breadwinner <Col N="2076" /> happens to be affected.  We all know, it is sad to say, that when this disease is diagnosed in a family for the first time, very often it is as if a cloud of gloom had descended, not only on the unfortunate victim, but on the whole family with the result that there is nothing bright, cheerful or inspiring to help the sufferer to continue to take an active interest in life and in the possibility of recovering from the disease.  Proper provision for diagnosis and cure of the disease should inspire somewhat more confidence.  A psychological approach is necessary as well as medical treatment, to my mind.</P>
    <P>I have known cases where eminent medical practitioners, rather than send patients to sanatoria have asked them had they friends living at places in the country where there were no small children and, if so, would they agree to go there take a dog and keep out in the open air on the sunny sheltered side of a fence, hunting rabbits, rats or hares or whatever might be found there.  This kept the affected persons from thinking about the disease and gave them a lively interest in their surroundings, for the time being at any rate.  I have known cases of that kind where people have been restored to health without ever entering a sanatorium.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that gardens and farms be attached to the proposed sanatoria.  That, in itself, is a very good idea.  Such amenities would provide interesting walks, and I am sure shelter belts, trees and shrubs, will be cultivated to make the surroundings of these places as happy and as healthy as possible.  As well as that, other steps will be necessary to try to get our people to appreciate to the full the necessity of taking this disease in time. Propaganda by the Red Cross Society in the various districts and the attention which will be given to the matter by the medical officers will, I am sure, arouse the people to a sense of what should be done in that regard.  I join with other Deputies in congratulating the Minister on the steps he is taking. By consistent co-operation and helpful suggestion I hope this Bill will lead to a speedy improvement of the conditions responsible for this dread disease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to a number of Deputies speaking in this debate and I can only conclude from what some of them have said in regard to tuberculosis that they are not in touch with the people at all.  I think very few Deputies go into existing institutions and see for themselves what is happening there.  They congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the proposed building of three new big <Col N="2078" /> hospitals, but I would prefer if the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government would come to the aid of the unfortunate patients at present in the sanatoria&mdash;young men and women who are lying there, some of them even without any benefit from national health insurance, without even a miserable 5/- to get themselves some little comforts.  Some of them have no living relatives.  I have visited these institutions and I put the plight of some of these people before the county manager in my county.  The county medical officer says that there is more tuberculosis in Wexford&mdash;and the statement appeared in the papers&mdash; than in all the other counties together. If you go down to the sanatorium at Brownswood, Enniscorthy, what do you find there?  The doctor who lives 14 miles away and the county medical officer come to that institution whenever they like.  In that institution to-day there are young men and women without even a smoke and without a single living relative to bring them any comfort of that kind.  Their people have gone.  Some of these patients are from South Carlow and South Wexford and their relatives cannot afford the expense of travelling to Enniscorthy to visit them.  I asked the county manager to provide funds out of which something might be done for people in that situation.  He said that there were no funds available but that he would get a report from the medical officer on the matter.  I have heard Deputies here make reference to the fact that dances are responsible for the spread of tuberculosis, but the county medical officer in Wexford is endeavouring to organise a fund by means of dances to get cigarettes for people such as those I referred to.  He has to do that to provide a smoke for the male patients or to give a bit of chocolate to girls who have no one to look after them.  Still we are talking about building other institutions of that kind.  The majority of these people I know went home last summer. Some of them have returned; those who have not returned have gone to the grave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I knew years ago of a man who had plenty of money and who could go to Vancouver or Switzerland to get a <Col N="2079" /> remedy for tuberculosis.  Not many of our people can afford to do that.  I cannot understand why people talk so much about sanatoria, mental hospitals and county homes.  Have we no other remedy for the people other than talking about big institutions for those who are afflicted with this disease?  At the present time the death rate from tuberculosis is greater than ever it was.  The medical officer in County Wexford says that tuberculosis is raging and the numbers suffering from the disease in County Wexford are greater than in other counties in our State.  Why is that so?  It is because the poor are in a bad way; they are not getting what they should get. References have been made to people who are dirty and lazy.</P>
    <P>Why are so many men being discharged from the Army to-day?  The majority of the cases in our sanatoria are men from the National Army.  Why is that so?  Wettings, I suppose, on manoeuvres, swimming the rivers and playing at warfare.  The result is that many of the soldiers are now lying in sanatoria and we are fighting every day to get them pensions.  I know one man in a sanatorium.  He has a family and he is getting 12/6 or 15/- a week from the relieving officer.  How can a family exist on that amount? Deputies talked to-day about paying men £4 a week.  How does an agricultural labourer with £2 a week provide the necessaries of life for his wife and youngsters?  Those youngsters have to trudge the roads every day, sometimes walking three or four miles over bad roads to schools.  At three o'clock on a cold winter's day they leave a school where there is no proper fire and no hot meal and face the journey home.</P>
    <P>If you want to face the issue, face it in a proper fashion.  Come to the relief of the people now and do not rest content with post-war planning.  We are going to do everything after the war, apparently, but I suggest that now is the time to come to the assistance of the people.  We hear a lot of talk about drainage schemes, sanatorium schemes and lots of other things which will be taken up after the <Col N="2080" /> war.  It is the duty of the Government and of the Parliamentary Secretary to take action now and to assist the people who are suffering from tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>There are many people lying in these institutions without a smoke, and there are no funds to provide them with a smoke.  The county manager in Wexford says that the medical officer is endeavouring to organise funds in order to provide smokes for those unfortunate people.  Where is all the money collected by the Red Cross or by the Hospitals Trust?  Some of those people infected with tuberculosis prefer to die at home.  They leave the institutions and go home to die.  Many of them are young men and women. Then the doctor says their beds and bedding must be destroyed.  I know of cases where mothers are lying on the floor because they have no bed to lie upon.  When questions are asked, people are told it is a matter for the local authorities, and, when it is raised there, the local authorities say: &ldquo;We have no money, and until we strike a rate we cannot remedy matters.&rdquo;  I can prove that there are people lying on boards to-day, their beds having been burned by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I go to Brownswood every second Sunday.  I am not afraid to go there because of the disease.  I must say the place is clean and all right, but there is a want in that institution.  The heating apparatus is not so effective as it was.  In order to save expenditure, the amount of heating was reduced; where there were three shifts there is now only one, and they are endeavouring in that way to keep the institution warm.  I expect the same thing goes on all over the country.  Even if a man kicks up a row to get out to do a little walking around the institution, to go down as far as the road, he will not be permitted.  The regulations will not allow him to walk around the institution. There you have people dying every day.  Some of them prefer to go home and they die there.</P>
    <P>There is little use in talking about what we intend to do.  We are to build three big hospitals.  It is a bad thing to be looking forward to that.  It means that we are going to put all our <Col N="2081" /> people into sanatoria.  What is really wanted is proper food and clothing. We should spend the money on this generation rather than make provision for hospitals to put coming generations into.  The amount given by way of national health insurance benefit is not sufficient.  It is difficult even to get 5/-for a person who is in hospital.  I know of a man in a sanatorium and he had to submit satisfactory medical evidence of incapacity.  That man is in the sanatorium, yet they want that certificate before they will consent to give him 5/- to get extra comforts.</P>
    <P>Can you do nothing for the people lying there, their parents dead and gone?  Is there no way of helping them, no way of giving them extra comforts? Are there no funds available, even in the Red Cross Society, for the purpose of aiding boys and girls, fathers and mothers, who have nobody to look after them?  These people may not be in benefit under the national health insurance scheme and they cannot get a smoke.  I know of one person in an institution whose people give him cigarettes or tobacco and he has to divide the supply with his comrades who have no one to look after them. At the same time we seem to have plenty of money to give away.  Plenty of money is being sent away&mdash;it is going in thousands&mdash;while our young people are in want.  It is all right to be building three big sanatoria, but for how many years will that last?  Will this Dáil be in existence then?  We may have another Parliamentary Secretary and maybe another Government.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should have funds to give people suffering from tuberculosis some little comforts in their last days.  As Deputy Pattison says, these sanatoria are looked on as homes of the dying.  No one likes to be pronounced tubercular.  The sanatorium is the last place one wishes to go to.  In one case a 1916 man was asked to go to one and he would not go.  I asked the doctor why, if the man was as bad as he made him out to be, he was not given help at home. I suggested this man should be given the necessaries of life, proper food and clothing, and that his youngsters should also be attended to.  They cannot <Col N="2082" /> get anything.  No agricultural labourer can feed himself and his family on £2 a week.</P>
    <P>I worked in flour mills for 22 years and, thank God, I did not get tuberculosis or any industrial disease.  I worked in the dust and dirt of the mills and very few of our fellows died from tuberculosis.  I suggest the Parliamentary Secretary should investigate the conditions in existing hospitals and see that the doctors in these places do their duty by the patients. Let us help them in the best way we can while we have the power to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LaurenceJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. L.J. Walsh Mr. L.J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my voice to the chorus of welcome to this Bill, and incidentally to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on performing the miracle of uniting the House to such a degree that if the bouquets showered upon him were material, we would have some difficulty in rescuing him from them.  That is a very healthy state of affairs to have in the House on the introduction of a very important measure of this kind.  I welcome the Bill particularly for the reason that the Parliamentary Secretary has stated that he hopes to achieve the policy of isolation through the establishment of the sanatorium.  I sincerely hope he will succeed in that policy, because it is a policy which I, during my association with public bodies, have always stood for and tried to bring into effect.  I must confess that in my own county I have failed miserably in my efforts in this direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only a few weeks ago, the public body of which I am a representative considered an application from the county medical officer of health for increased accommodation for tuberculous patients within the county.  We have had an extraordinary increase in tuberculosis which has alarmed the medical officer to such a degree that he brought in a special report asking for the provision of temporary accommodation. One fact which we must look straight in the face is that the efforts to combat tuberculosis will cost money, and big money at that.  This Bill provides £1,500,000 to establish these institutions, but the Bill contains no provision, <Col N="2083" /> so far as I can see, for after-care of patients during convalescence.</P>
    <P>I think I am not asking too much of the House when I ask Deputies to bear with me while I read a letter which I found in one of the papers, in view of the fact that Deputy McGilligan spent 20 minutes yesterday quoting extracts from the daily papers.  It is from an evening paper of December 14th of last year and reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have read many letters in your paper concerning tuberculosis and its increase.  Here are some facts which will help to check the disease. I received sanatorium treatment and on discharge, I got a certificate to resume work&mdash;&lsquo;light work.&rsquo;  I have tried hard to find this but with no avail.  I have got much advice from doctors on how to live, to obtain nourishing food, warm clothing, to sleep by myself, to avoid worry, etc., etc.  Their advice is right, but never has anyone told me where to get those essentials.  I have tried but met with no success.  I am a married man with a family, and the total income which I receive is 27/6 per week to provide a little nourishment for my family and myself.  Is this not the real root of tuberculosis?  Before I contracted the disease I was in constant employment, earning £3 15s. per week.  Now this wage is missed. Surely there is to be found someone who will tackle the aftercare of the tuberculosis patient properly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will accomplish what he has set out to achieve.  If he does, it will be a great achievement.  The Red Cross Society has done very valuable work, but I want to read another extract concerning the Red Cross on this question of assistance to tuberculosis patients. This is culled from the paper in my own town:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was revealed at a meeting of the Drogheda Anti-Tuberculosis Committee of the Red Cross on Monday night that two children of a poor widow in Drogheda could be saved from tuberculosis if there could be provided a bed and bed clothing.  The Hon. Secretary, <Col N="2084" /> Mr. Anderson, reported that this was a genuine case and that the children have no place to sleep except in the same bed as their mother.  The committee could do nothing in the matter, as its limited funds are under the strict control of the Red Cross Society for other anti-tuberculosis activities.  As yet a permit to local branches has not been given to enable them to assist such cases.  All that is needed is a few pairs of blankets and a pair of sheets and pillows to save two young children from becoming contaminated with this dread disease.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Red Cross Society has been established for something like two years.  It set out to collect a sum of money with £500,000 as the target. Deputies have been appealed to to provide funds readily, and, so far as I can judge, having listened to practically the whole of this debate, every section of the House, to their credit be it said, are prepared to meet whatever demands may be made on the Department in order to provide the Parliamentary Secretary with these facilities. The Red Cross Society has failed to reach its target, notwithstanding all its activities throughout the State for the past two years.</P>
    <P>I now propose to make a suggestion to the Parliamentary Secretary.  I suggest that he make provision in the Bill for a local tuberculosis rate on every local authority in the State.  If my memory serves me, the total valuation of the State, according to the 1936 or 1939 figure, was £12,128,082, and I suggest that he take steps to impose a special rate on every rating authority of 1/- in the £ per year.</P>
    <P>Now, if we take 1/- in the £ of the approximate valuation, so far as this State is concerned, we shall have something like £600,000 per year to devote to the care of tuberculosis patients, and, as we have assurances of support from all parts of the House. I think that is a practical suggestion, and that by throwing some responsibility on the local authorities of this State they will be forced to live up to their responsibilities.  I am not one of those who believe in centralisation, because I believe that in the long run <Col N="2085" /> this clamour for centralisation will lead to Bolshevisation, and that is one thing that I, as a citizen of this State, could not and would not agree to, in any shape of form.</P>
    <P>I have said that I welcome this Bill, largely, because its aim was isolation in connection with this particular disease.  A few weeks ago, when the matter to which I have just referred was under discussion at a meeting of our local body, I moved an amendment to the motion concerned.  I may say that we have four local institutions in that area and that in those four institutions we have, all told, something like 334 beds, and of those 334 beds, 52 are devoted to tuberculosis patients, but the most extraordinary thing about that position is that although we have over 330 beds within the county institions, only 52 beds are devoted to tuberculosis patients, and in what way are they allocated to the tuberculosis patients?</P>
    <P>We have those patients in the Drogheda District Hospital, in the Ardee District Hospital, in the Dundalk District Hospital, and in the Louth County Infirmary, and when I suggested that in order to relieve the tuberculosis situation, at least one of these institutions should be devoted to the care of these patients, that it should be thoroughly cleansed, repainted, and made in every possible way suitable for the sole use of tuberculous patients in the county until such time as we might have a joint sanatorium established for the counties of Louth and Meath, I found that I had not even a seconder to my amendment. The motion dealt with the provision of these chalets.  Now, I put this to the Parliamentary Secretary: Does he suggest that there can be any success in combating tuberculosis, when such patients are allowed to associate with maternity, surgical or other medical cases in the one institution?  That is the case in our county at all events.  I cannot speak, of course, for other districts in the country, but from what I have heard, I understand that similar conditions prevail in other institutions in this country.  Surely, we should have advanced far enough and should have read enough about the causes of <Col N="2086" /> tuberculosis&mdash;surely, we should be wide awake enough to put a stop to that kind of thing.  In my opinion, that is the most serious aspect of the matter I am referring to, but when I made those suggestions, I was politely informed by the county medical officer of health that the Department of Local Government and Public Health would not tolerate any such interference with their institutions.  Now, I hope that when the Parliamentary Secretary is replying, he will deal with that matter, and either substantiate or deny the statement made by the county medical officer of health in my area, that he or his Department stands over the mixing up of maternity, surgical and tuberculosis patients in the one institution. At the meeting in question I made the statement that the same utensils were being used by these various patients, and I was flatly contradicted, although I know that it is happening in at least one of these institutions.  I know that in at least one of these institutions the same utensils are being used, that the washing for all the patients is done in the same machine, and so on, and, so far as I can learn, there is no segregation of the bed clothes or linen of the patients in those institutions.  I think that that is a most reprehensible thing for the Department of Local Government and Public Health to permit, not alone to stand over, and I shall be glad to know from the Parliamentary Secretary whether his Department does stand over it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should have reported it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The medical officer of health said, in effect, that the Minister would not accept any interference along the lines suggested in my amendment. That is the statement, and I shall not go beyond.  Now, at that particular meeting that had a report from the county member, we had a report from the medical officer of health, and a report from a county engineer, to the effect that it was going to cost no less than £4,000 to provide accommodation <Col N="2087" /> for 20 chalets.  By way of explanation, I might mention that a chalet is an open-air bed, and we are told that that is going to cost £4,000. I hope that when these proposals come before the Department of Local Government and Public Health, the responsible officials will see to it that there will not be surplus or unnecessary expenditure of the ratepayers' money in that direction.  If we are to spend £1,500,000 on three sanatoria to be erected within the State, and if we are to have Crooksling and Dún Laoghaire made available to our counties, I see no reason why these institutions cannot be provided inside 18 months, although some of the pessimists in this House seem to think that the Parliamentary Secretary is anticipating that it will take 18 months.  I do not agree with that.  We have an abundance of native material here, and an abundance of labour to do the work. Up to 1939, something like 90 per cent. or more of all the building materials for our institutions was imported into this country, but since then at least 95 per cent. of the building materials required for our homes and institutions can be produced in this country.  The one snag about the whole situation is the question of timber.  Now, I am one of those people who take some interest in building.  I know this country fairly well, and there is not one of its 32 counties through which I have not travelled fairly extensively, and I can say that in my own district, around the Counties of Louth and Meath, within two miles of Drogheda, there is more than sufficient timber to provide all the accommodation necessary for these three sanatoria which it is suggested should now be provided within 18 months.  If they only had the will, the way is there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to take up the time of the House, but I think it is only right to quote here from the 1932 report of the Committee of Reference on the Grand National Sweepstake of that year.  That  before the Hospitals Commission was set up.  In connection with the County of Louth, where we have 330 beds in our four institutions, we have a report submitted to that committee by another <Col N="2088" /> body, known as the Louth County Medical Association.  Here is the report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Since our previous report we have received a memorial signed by the doctors resident and practising in Dundalk and district, offering their unanimous co-operation and support to ensure the proper functioning of the proposed new hospital. We later received a report from a sub-committee of doctors, appointed by the Louth County Medical Association, setting out suggestions as to the accommodation required.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>That has nothing to do with this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The report continues:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This, it was proposed, should not be less than 98 beds.  Having made a study of the population and other statistics, we informed the committee that our opinion was that the maximum number of beds required was 60, as set out in our previous award.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of that, but my point is that we are going to the expense of providing accommodation for 100 beds at a cost of £4,000 when we have 20 idle.  There are 300 beds in existence, and only 52 of them are for tuberculosis patients, and my objection is to erecting 52 chalets at a cost of £4,000 when there are already beds idle.  That is my objection to the erection of chalets.  I want to point out that we have sufficient accommodation on the lines suggested by the county council, and I suggest to the Department that they should investigate the matter rather than permit the local authority to expend £4,000 on accommodation that will not be required after 18 months.  I have said sufficient to satisfy myself that I have done my duty to the people I represent <Col N="2089" /> in this House, particularly sufferers from tuberculosis in Drogheda, and in County Louth in general.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary when he comes to consider the question of an extension of chalets at Ardee Hospital will think seriously, and see to it that there will be no unnecessary expenditure for accommodation since it is there already, if it is utilised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on what he proposes to do through the medium of this Bill.  It is a very timely measure, and it has been pleasant to see the unanimity with which it has been received.  A great deal has been said about malnutrition, and about the misapplication of that word.  I am prepared to admit that the word has been misapplied on many occasions, but I suggest that the fact that many people in this country have not the wages to enable them to get nutritious food, is, to a great extent, responsible for the prevalence of or the spread of tuberculosis. Apart from the fact that they cannot get the necessary food, many are badly clad.  We are told by medical men that people with wet feet are inclined to be delicate and to contract tuberculosis.  The Parliamentary Secretary reminded us that this disease would be found amongst families who could afford to procure nutritious food. He stated that, in his opinion, some people were not using proper food and, in that connection, it would be a wise course if the Department circularised local bodies, so that they could ventilate its views in regard to the provision of nutritious food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is commendable that the Department is about to erect a certain number of sanatoria, but, as I stated in this House previously, I believe that a good deal requires to be done before people become sanatoria-minded.  I can visualise the position of a man with five, six, seven or eight children, who has to disclose that he is ill or has to go to a sanatorium, unless some provision is going to be made for his wife and family while he is away.  If such a man has to go to a sanatorium he becomes despondent, owing to the fact <Col N="2090" /> that while he is away his wife and family may be on the verge of starvation. In a great many cases of that kind no benefit is payable to the family, because of the intermittent nature of the man's work as a result of delicacy.  If that man is away for six months in a sanatorium, national health insurance benefit rates will be reduced to 7/6 weekly.  A situation of that kind is enough to make anybody despondent.  Medical men state that despondency has a great effect in tuberculosis cases, and that if a man is despondent while he is undergoing sanatorium treatment he stands very little chance of being cured.  Deputy Bartley stated that he would like to see a census taken of patients who were in sanatoria.  He used that argument to strengthen the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary, that malnutrition did not always occur amongst the poor.  I think if we had such a census it would show that those in sanatoria were not the real poor people.  I am not suggesting that any difference is made by local bodies in reference to sending patients to these institutions. People who go there can afford to do so, because they have sufficient means to ensure that their wives and families are properly looked after while they are away.  That position would be reflected in any census that may be taken.  I deprecate the attitude of Deputies who place on record what they consider to be the facts of the situation.  I do not think it is very creditable for any Deputy to suggest that sanatoria are places to which people go to die.  I do not think a statement of that kind is good for the country as a whole, or that it would help the Parliamentary Secretary to deal with the disease.  If people disclose their illness in the early stages, I believe sanatorium treatment can cure them, or, at least, enable them to live for a number of years and carry on in their occupations.  I know people who went to sanatoria in the early stages of this disease and who lived for many years to care for their families.  It is very unwise for any Deputy to suggest that people who go to these places go there to die.  The statement made by Deputy O'Leary gave the impression to the House that Wexford County was <Col N="2091" /> reeking with tuberculosis.  I could not sit here and allow any public representative to make that statement.  The Deputy stated that Dr. Daly said it.</P>

The chairman of the county council is a member of this House, and I think he will agree with what I say.  I would not like such an impression to go abroad.  It would certainly not be for the good of Wexford.  Deputy O'Leary also referred to beds and bedding being burned when tuberculosis patients were removed from houses, and stated that the local authority refused to replace them.  I have been chairman of a local authority for the past 25 years.  Deputy Allen, chairman of the county council, is also in the House.  I do not know of any case, when the proper formula was gone through, where beds were burned, that provision was not made to replace them.</P>

      <P>I had a great deal of patience while the Deputy was speaking. Will he try and have some patience with me?  I am not &ldquo;well in&rdquo; with anybody.  I am well-informed regarding my duties and I know how to meet the requirements of the people.  I should be sorry to <Col N="2092" /> hear that the position was as stated here because public bodies have funds for the provision of such things.  As regards sanatorium patients, I agree that an effort should be made to give these poor people certain little luxuries that the ordinary patient in a hospital does not receive.  I refer to such things as cigarettes and chocolates.  That would not cost very much and, if the Parliamentary Secretary secures the necessary authority for the local bodies, I think those bodies will not hesitate to provide those little comforts. No public representative should decry sanatorium treatment.  I am perfectly satisfied that sanatorium treatment is beneficial.  I am also satisfied that, unless provision be made to enable the wife and children of a bread-winner to be looked after properly while he is under treatment, sanatorium treatment will not be availed of until it is too late to do anything effective.  This Bill will be nugatory so far as the intentions of the Parliamentary Secretary are concerned unless he does as I suggest.  The Minister for Finance, or whoever is responsible for providing funds for such purposes, should be approached to set aside sufficient money to secure that, while a breadwinner is in a sanatorium, his wife and family will receive, at least, the same amount of money which they had been in the habit of receiving prior to his admission to the institution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, at the outset, to express my appreciation of the manner in which the Bill and the general outline of my policy on this question of tuberculosis <Col N="2093" /> have been received.  It is a source of great gratification to me to find that, for all practical purposes, I have the unanimous and whole-hearted support of this House in the very heavy task I have taken upon myself.  I do not want anybody to run away with the idea&mdash; I do not suppose anybody will&mdash;that I do not realise the enormity of the problem. I shall qualify that word &ldquo;enormity&rdquo; at a later stage.  I have been urged by virtually every speaker, with a few notable exceptions, to spend, spend, spend&mdash;to stop at nothing; the sky is the limit.  That, as I have said, is very encouraging.  If we are to solve this problem, we shall have to spend.  The House realises that and nobody realises it more thoroughly than I myself do.  In my opening statement, I anticipated that measure of encouragement from the House.  But I want a little more than verbal encouragement.  I want that encouragement translated into some practical action, so that I may get behind me on this policy of spending in the solution of this problem the necessary public opinion which will enable me to carry out the programme I have outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will need to do something more than tell me to spend.  With one or two exceptions, I can truthfully say that members of the House have risen far above political considerations on this question.  But when you take up a paper which is extensively read, I think, by members of the Opposition, and you see a leading article on January 9, 1945, headed &ldquo;Seventy-five per cent. increase in rates&rdquo;; in the same journal on Wednesday, January 31, you see another leading article headed &ldquo;£50,000,000 a year&rdquo; you realise that something more than verbal encouragement in this House is necessary.  These leading articles must have an effect on public opinion.  I have no complaint against any political Party or any journal opposed to the Government for criticising the Government or Government administration or, if the Government is extravagant, for drawing attention to the fact.  What I ask is that members of this House will use their influence on these organs which <Col N="2094" /> help to form public opinion and ask them, in their criticism of Government expenditure, to exclude expenditure on measures taken for the treatment and cure of tuberculosis, or any of the ancillary services, or, indeed, any of our social services.  If members of the House will do that for me, if they will get those organs behind our efforts to improve the conditions of health of our people, then we can make headway.  It is not a bit of use to tell me to spend and spend lavishly if you have your tongue in your cheek and allow this propaganda to go on.  There has been a great deal of talk about an educational campaign.  There was a fair share of evidence during the course of this two-day debate that an educational campaign is necessary even in such an assembly as this.  While I say that, I must also say, in all justice, that a very intelligent appreciation of the problem has been shown by most of the Deputies who have taken part in the debate.  But, at the same time, we saw appearing from time to time throughout this debate evidence of the same kind of prejudice that is making things so difficult for us, the prejudice that exists in the minds of so many people particularly in the provinces and amongst the rural community.</P>
    <P>A debate like this, if it does nothing else, should be of immense educational value, and from that point of view I hope that some of the Deputies who did not know perhaps as much about certain aspects of this problem as they have since learned will translate their new knowledge into effective action when they go back to their constituencies. Deputy O'Higgins, who from the Fine Gael Benches led off the debate, suggested that we should provide two beds per death.  Other Deputies took the same line, and Deputy Dillon suggested that we should aim immediately at 7,000 beds; other Deputies suggested that 3,000 beds would not solve our problem. Let us get clear on this bed question right from the beginning.  The 2,100 or 2,200 beds that may be provided at the earliest possible date under the terms of this Bill may not be enough, but who will say, who will suggest, that any sane man could in existing circumstances, and in the existing <Col N="2095" /> conditions in relation to supplies, undertake to provide the number that has been suggested?  There is more at stake than the actual building material that may be available in the country which Deputy Walsh of Louth has referred to. We may be able to put up the actual structure, but the structure is not of much use to us if we cannot provide furniture and equipment and the full service that is necessary if we are to deal effectively with the problem.  We, therefore, aim at something that we hope to achieve, and if we achieve, within the next few years, the target that we aim at in this Bill of 2,100 or 2,200 beds, and if we then find that we have not got enough, well, surely, we can continue&mdash;we will continue if it is necessary to continue&mdash; until we provide whatever institutional accommodation may be necessary for the dealing with this disease.</P>
    <P>Now, when we talk about two beds per death I just want to mention that we are aiming at a very high target. Two beds per death is the target that the responsible authorities in the United States of America set themselves. There is no harm in mentioning that they never reached it, and have never got near it, so that we are, in fact, being asked, just at the very outset, to provide something that much more highly organised health institutions in very advanced countries have not been able to achieve.  There is one other point on the bed question that I would like to mention, and that is, that tuberculosis is not distributed uniformly over the geographical area constituting the State.  The point to which I wish to direct the attention of the House in that regard is this: that in the Dublin area, say, we might require two beds per death, whereas in the West of Ireland we might only require one.  We have to be guided by the distribution of the disease as indicated by the distribution of the death-rate, and if it is found necessary to provide a higher proportion of beds per death in one particular part of the country it will be our business to adjust our plans accordingly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2096" /> Another issue that was raised by almost all the speakers, beginning with Deputy O'Higgins&mdash;I think all the Labour members who spoke, Deputy Kennedy and practically every Deputy laboured the point: that maintenance would have to be provided for the bread-winner and his dependents while he was undergoing treatment.  Now, perhaps, I said too much in my opening speech.  Perhaps I said so much that many Deputies did not follow it, but I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that I dealt with this matter briefly in my opening statement.  When dealing with the question of a scheme that might be expected to deal successfully with the threat of tuberculosis to our community, I set out a number of headings as constituting the essential elements in any scheme that might be deemed to be successful, I said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The development of an adequate and comprehensive welfare service which will enable those people who are so unfortunate as to be stricken by this disease to sustain themselves and their families in reasonable comfort.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It will be seen that I embodied that principle as one of the fundamental considerations in any scheme that might be expected to succeed in its purpose.  As to how effect can be given to that principle is another matter.  This Bill deals merely with the provision of beds.  It does not deal with such matters as maintenance either for the patient affected or for the patient's dependents.  I do not wish to evade the issue in any way. I have no doubt in the world that is an issue that we have got to face&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that we cannot expect the bread-winner to undergo treatment at the stage that we want him to unless and until some reasonable provision is made for the people who are depending on him.  As to who should shoulder that responsibility is another matter. Whether the obligation should be put on the central authority, whether it <Col N="2097" /> should be put upon the local authorities or to what extent voluntary organisations can co-operate with us in working out a policy&mdash;all that yet remains for a firm determination.  At the moment I will only say on that issue that in my opinion&mdash;there may be few in the House to agree with me perhaps&mdash;the proper authorities to discharge that duty are the local authorities with such co-operation as they can get through voluntary organisations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, we may leave that for another day, but on that issue there will be another day.  The immediate purpose is to provide beds because we cannot tackle this problem at all in any rational way until we first get our beds.</P>
      <P>Deputy Martin O'Sullivan raised the question of Ballyowen and Ballyfermot and asked what our policy was in relation to the institution that it was proposed to provide at Ballyowen, for which a planning competition is to take place.  We propose the Ballyfermot site for the purpose of the new 1,000-bed sanatorium here for Dublin City and County.  So far as the Ballyowen proposal is concerned, we are going to allow the plan to continue, as it is quite likely that future developments will establish the need for a chest hospital where specialised services will be available for particularly advanced types of work in connection with tuberculosis and, perhaps, in connection with other chest conditions. However, that is a matter upon which a firm decision cannot be reached at this stage.  At any rate, we will allow the planning to go on and we can decide at a later stage whether such an institution is immediately necessary or at what stage of development it would be necessary to provide it.  In the meantime, the Rialto hospital is being developed as an institution providing specialised services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan also raised the question of the milk supplies, with particular reference to the danger of bovine tuberculosis being conveyed to the human being through milk.  Now, <Col N="2098" /> on that I do not wish to enter into complicated technical or scientific arguments with the House&mdash;it is not the proper place for that&mdash;but I would say, in simple language, that it is very rarely that pulmonary tuberculosis is found to be of bovine origin.  A certain proportion of the surgical tuberculosis cases we meet with&mdash;a fair proportion &mdash;is of bovine origin.  Beyond that we have not firm figures, as it is not by any means a simple scientific process to establish whether the infection is of the bovine type or of the human type.  I think that I have already taken, with the assistance of the House, the preliminary steps that should lead towards the provision of a wholesome milk supply, particularly in the City of Dublin and neighbouring areas.</P>
    <P>People from other parts of the country, who are equally concerned about the purity of the milk supply, may say: &ldquo;Well, why not us; we are as badly off as Dublin?&rdquo;  My reply to that would be that Dublin is our biggest centre of population, that the problem is more acute there and that the findings of the tribunal in relation to the City of Dublin will be of useful educational value to us as to what it may be possible to do in other parts of the country.  Right in the forefront of the terms of reference to that tribunal is to inquire into the purity and wholesomeness of the milk supply and to make any recommendations that may be calculated to improve our milk supply from that point of view.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the milk question, let me say that, here again, the people can do a whole lot for themselves. Deputies could do a lot for me and for the people if they would advise and persuade the people that, until such time as they can be assured of a pure and wholesome milk supply, they should pasteurise the milk or, if they do not know how to do that, they should take the precaution of boiling it.  It is a simple remedy in their own hands and there is no shadow of doubt that, if people adopted that simple remedy ready to their own hands, we need not wait for any slaughter of animals to get rid of this question of infection by the bovine type of bacillus.  We would get rid of lots of <Col N="2099" /> other complaints, too; we would reduce the death-rate from that disease which is taking such a toll of the young children and babies of the City of Dublin&mdash;gastro-enteritis&mdash;though it is not entirely due to the milk supply.  I cannot compel the people to boil the milk for their own protection; I can only advise them to do so and enlist the assistance of enlightened persons to try to get our people to do the simple things that they themselves can do and that mean so much to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan also mentioned the question of food in tuberculosis institutions.  That, of course, is a somewhat detailed matter, concerning which he has some special complaint, and I will have to look into it when I have more time at my disposal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy raised a point that would be of considerable importance if conditions were as he and other Deputies think they were&mdash;that is in relation to the disinfection of houses from which patients are removed.  We were told by Deputy Kennedy, and I am almost certain by some other speaker, that the houses are not disinfected when a patient is removed to a sanatorium.  Now, the layman may again be misled in a matter such as this.  There would be no need to disinfect the house if the case were not what we call a &ldquo;sputum-positive&rdquo; case; in other words, if the patient were not expectorating the bacilli in his sputum, there would be no great need to disinfect the house.  It is quite possible that numbers of people may have gone to institutions for the treatment of tuberculosis, and the county medical officer of health, knowing that they were not sputum-positive, did not think it necessary to disinfect the houses, and, in that way, laymen might think he was not properly discharging his duties.  However, I believe that common sense, even without much scientific knowledge, dictates that, where there is any suspicion that there are living bacilli about the house, disinfection must take place.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy also asked about the treatment of tubercular cases in mental hospitals.  Again, I think <Col N="2100" /> Deputies will realise that, owing to the particular circumstances of these people, who are suffering from an ailment of another kind, whatever treatment is to be afforded to them must be in the institution in which they are housed for the time being.  The tuberculosis services would be available for diagnostic purposes and for any advice that might be necessary, but the treatment, in the main, would have to be carried out by the staffs of those institutions. The point was also made that there is a high proportion of attendants and nurses in mental hospitals who contract tuberculosis.  I have not any figures on that matter to guide me.  It is one of those general statements that may have some substance in it and may not have much. But, at any rate, I have already arranged with the medical officers in the Department, including the inspector of mental hospitals, the chief medical officer and the medical inspector who is particularly earmarked for tuberculosis work, to look into this matter and see if we are affording the maximum protection to our attendants and nurses who, in the discharge of their nursing duties, are exposed to particularly heavy doses of Tubercle Bacilli and to advise what we can do by way of affording them additional protection.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan would be prepared to go very far in the matter of isolation of infectious cases.  Other Deputies&mdash; not many, but some Deputies&mdash;were inclined to agree with him.  That is a matter which requires very careful consideration, but it is a principle that I would not lightly dismiss.  We would, I am sure, hear a good deal of talk as to the rights of the subject and the liberty of the subject if we were to say: &ldquo;You are in an infectious condition; you are a danger to your family and a danger to your neighbours.  We must bring you to an institution where we will offer you treatment and where, at any rate, you will cease to be a danger to anybody but yourself&rdquo;.  It would be a very drastic power to take, but, in the circumstances, it is a principle that I am not prepared to dismiss, at any rate, without further consideration. The idea did not originate in this <Col N="2101" /> debate.  These are matters that have already got very serious consideration; but they are matters of general policy that arise on the motion rather than on the Bill.</P>
    <P>I think it is Deputy Cogan, too, who raised a question about control and management.  I think it is clear from reading the Bill that control and management will be vested in the local authorities.  We will build the institutions, equip them, and hand them over and ask the local authorities to run them.  Deputy Cogan also raised a question about a Ministry of Health that we now hear discussed a good deal.</P>
    <P>We have, in effect, a Ministry of Health for the past year or so.  At any rate, since the Government, at the request of the Minister, delegated to me the full powers and duties of the Minister in relation to public health and related matters, we have, in effect, a Ministry of Health.  It has, perhaps, some drawbacks.  We have only one chief executive officer but it is open to him to delegate his work to assistants. It has the further drawback that a Parliamentary Secretary is discharging the duties and functions of a Minister on a Parliamentary Secretary's salary. I do not think the House will worry a great deal, and I can assure you the Parliamentary Secretary will not either, about that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Hughes raised the question of the Hospitals Trust Fund in relation to the proposals before the House; the amount of money in it and so on.  The actual amount of money in the Hospitals Trust Fund is about £8,500,000. Deputies must not take that as a firm figure.  It is over £8,000,000, but it is not more than £8,500,000.  Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Hughes want to know what is my policy in relation to the Hospitals Trust Fund and eating into the capital in the Hospitals Trust Fund for the purpose of providing institutions. There is no secret about that.  I dealt with this matter fairly fully in the Seanad upwards of a year ago.  A couple of months ago I received a representative <Col N="2102" /> deputation from the Associated Sweepstakes Committee of the voluntary hospitals and I explained the policy very fully to them. I propose to build and equip the institutions that are necessary so long as there is money in that fund.</P>
    <P>That money has not been earmarked by statute for the particular and exclusive use of voluntary hospitals. There is no doubt that the voluntary hospitals were the first in the field with the sweepstakes idea which has proved such a boon to us for a number of years.  At the same time, it has to be borne in mind that the Oireachtas, by a deliberate statutory act provided that this fund would be available for the provision of hospitals and institutions under the control of local authorities in just the same way as institutions under the control of voluntary bodies.  The Minister for Local Government has a full discretion in the allocation of these moneys.</P>
    <P>I am asked&mdash;and it is quite proper that I should be asked&mdash;if the capital sum to the credit of the Hospitals Trust Fund is to be eaten into and absorbed in capital expenditure, how the deficits of the voluntary hospitals are to be met, I can see only one way of meeting them.  I told the representatives of the hospitals how I would approach the solution of that problem.  The voluntary hospitals are, for the most part, situated in the Dublin area.  It has always seemed to me to be illogical that the people of Dublin and the ratepaying community and the local authorities in Dublin should be almost completely relieved of financial responsibility for providing hospitals for the institutional care and treatment of their poor.</P>
    <P>When we go outside the City of Dublin, with very few exceptions, the local authority has to make the necessary provision for the building, equipment and maintenance of hospitals for the institutional care of the poor.  The ratepayers of Dublin are relieved of that obligation by the fact that they have the services of highly trained technical staffs and the hospitals actually provided out of the Hospitals Trust Fund, and it seems to me that it is not unreasonable to ask the <Col N="2103" /> Dublin local authorities to pay the voluntary hospitals for the maintenance of their patients.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say this.  Upwards of £6,000,000 would have to be locked up in investments to pay the deficits of the voluntary hospitals if the deficits were not reduced.  The voluntary hospitals put a proposition to me to the effect that the maintenance rate for the local authority patients throughout the provinces should be increased; that the local authorities that send their patients up to Dublin for specialised treatment are not paying the full cost of maintenance; that they should pay at a higher rate; and though they are paying £2 12s. 6d. per week per case at the present time in the general hospitals, that that should be increased.</P>
      <P>My answer to that is, that before we increase the capitation maintenance rate on the local authorities throughout the country, the local authority that is immediately concerned and gets the service here, at its door, ought to make some contribution.  That is a matter of policy.  If we had plenty of money in the Hospitals Trust Fund and if we could build all the institutions we require and at the same time pay the deficits on voluntary hospitals and give some benefit to the rest of the community outside the City and County of Dublin, then I would be all in favour of paying the deficit, but I cannot accept the thesis that only the people of Dublin are entitled to benefit from the Hospitals Trust Fund.  That is the position.</P>

      <P>A Deputy raised a point as to the type of institution that we contemplate in our regional hospitals. <Col N="2105" /> I think that was raised by Deputy Hughes and Deputy Dillon.  We contemplate a number of ward blocks on the pavilion system.  They will be of simple construction.  We are not going in for marble walls and terrazzo floors. We hope to establish an institution that will provide all our requirements, that will be up to date in construction and equipment with an efficient staff for proper servicing, but we are not going to spend any money on frillings. If we were to build the elaborate type of construction that people have become more or less accustomed to in the hospitals that have been provided out of the Hospitals Trust Fund, the sum of £1,500,000 that has been mentioned would not be at all adequate, but the active service hospital unit that will service these various blocks will have to be of a better type of construction and equipment because it will in fact be a hospital within a sanatorium.</P>

      <P>In fact, I am fairly hard to live with in the Custom House at the present time, before I get the powers at all, so that I think Deputies need not have any anxiety in that respect.</P>

      <P>In fact, I think lots of people will be feeling very happy if we do not reach the point of divorce. It will take considerable driving force to bring this undertaking to a head, if it can be achieved at all, but if we should fail, it will not be because of any lack of intolerance on my part of avoidable delay.  Deputy Corish can re-assure Deputy Norton when next he sees him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton also raised some more or less personal points regarding Newcastle.  I am not in a position to deal with them now but I will inquire <Col N="2106" /> into the points with which he is concerned.  He also was anxious that it should be put on record that I aim at eventually providing a mass radiography service that would be extended to all the community.  I definitely aim in that direction but I think it will be a long time before that aim can be reached, because we have very great difficulty in getting one mass radiography plant and the necessary equipment.  It has been on order for quite a considerable time.  It is not because of any reluctance on the part of our neighbours to help us out.  They are not available in Northern Ireland or in Britain.</P>
    <P>I would sound one note of warning on this question of mass radiography. It is well that even laymen should advert to this: As soon as a mass radiography service is available, I have no doubt at all that people will come forward in their thousands to be radiographed and to be certified fit, and, in so far as they are certified fit, it seems to me to constitute a possible danger, for this reason, that while you may be fit at the time you are radiographed, you may get an exaggerated feeling of security and you may not be so fit three months afterwards.  There is the danger that if and when we are able to provide this service and large sections of the community are radiographed, by virtue of the fact that they will feel safe, they may remain too long away before they come back to be again overhauled.  And once again we may get into the vicious circle of the cases coming to us too late for the most promising results of treatment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton emphasised, as did other Deputies&mdash;it was the keynote of almost every Deputy's speech&mdash;provision for the bread-winner and his dependents, while under treatment. Again, all I can say on that is that reasonable provision will have to be made if we are to be successful in our campaign.</P>
    <P>The question of propaganda and education and rehabilitation has been emphasised a good deal, too, throughout this debate.  The Department of State concerned will have its hands fairly full in dealing with other aspects of this problem.  Consequently, the <Col N="2107" /> educational campaign, propaganda, rehabilitation and all that kind of activity must, in the main, be delegated to voluntary organisations.  That does not mean that the voluntary organisations are not to get any guidance or assistance in the carrying out of this work.  Their efforts will have to be co-ordinated with the local efforts, and their plans will have to be under the general direction of the responsible medical officer of health in the area, acting under the central authority.</P>
    <P>We next come to Deputy McGilligan. I do not intend to spend a whole lot of time on Deputy McGilligan, because he did not spend a whole lot of time on this subject.  He came into the House and delivered the usual type of embittered tirade, without a constructive idea in his whole statement.  He had not even sufficient interest in the subject under discussion to come in to hear my opening statement and so acquaint himself with the general outline of what is our policy in relation to this matter.  He had his little speech to deliver; he came in and delivered it, and as soon as he delivered it he disappeared, and we have not seen him since.</P>
    <P>I do not think, then, that I need waste much of the time of the House in dealing with him.  However, he made some points which might be misleading if I did not make some reference to them.  He treated the House to a number of quotations from various publications.  Those quotations were taken entirely out of their context.  In a matter as serious as this, I think it is an irresponsible act, to put it at its mildest, to take out of their context statements made by various people or organisations, in the knowledge that they are likely to be misleading&mdash;in fact, that they cannot very well be otherwise.  He seemed particularly anxious to convey that lack of nutrition and our economic circumstances generally are the potent factors in the spread of the disease.  He has not yet thought of an answer to the question I put to him as to how it comes about, if economic conditions or housing conditions <Col N="2108" /> or wages or lack of food were the determining factors, that the death-rate from tuberculosis fell in 1943 as compared with 1942.  He did not attempt to answer that.  If he had answered it, and if he had stayed a little longer in the House, I would have had to ask him how it was that in 1944 we had a still further decline, notwithstanding the fact that he would lead the House to believe that the economic circumstances of our people, particularly of the lower income classes, are going from bad to worse.  Later on I may have to say a word about the actual degree to which some of the factors that have been mentioned here enter into the problem, if I can dispose of those other matters out of the way in time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donnellan talked about compulsory isolation.  I have already dealt with that.  He agrees with the idea of maintaining the bread-winner and maintaining his dependents, but the rates are not to be increased.  Well, I am afraid that Deputy Donnellan will have to come a little bit further if we are to provide the type of service he would encourage us to provide.  At some other time I will enjoy a debate with him as to the attractiveness of central taxation, from the small farmer's point of view or from the labourer's point of view, as against local taxation.  That is too big a question to go into to-night. Deputy Keyes said that the disease is due to lack of suitable housing accommodation and to malnutrition.  Well, I do not suggest that a person living in a mansion is just as liable to tuberculosis as the person living in the slums where there might be three or four people occupying one room.  But when we talk about the housing conditions of our people, and the adverse effect on their health of the conditions under which they have to live, we ought to be realistic about that too.  We ought to be as realistic as, in one respect, Deputy Giles was.  We ought to recollect that, since this Government came into office, no less a sum than £45,000,000 has been spent in providing housing accommodation for the working classes.  In fact, since 1932, we have provided 132,000 houses, between new <Col N="2109" /> dwelling-houses and reconstructed houses, and have re-housed practically 500,000 of our people.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to concede that overcrowding is a danger to health, but at the same time I should like the House to concede that this Government, as far as it was humanly possible in the time at our disposal up to the emergency, mobilised the resources of the State in order that that particular danger to health should be mitigated. All I ask is that, when we talk about those things, we should not talk as if nothing whatever had been done to remedy those conditions.  Within the limits of the time and the resources at our disposal, everything that was humanly possible has been done.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan and some of the Deputies who talked about the state of nutrition of the people conveyed the impression that a large section of our people are half starved.  Nobody in this country at the present time need be hungry.  Again, the Government has organised the resources of the State to sustain the weaker elements during this emergency.  Before this Government came into office we had no widows' and orphans' pensions, no children's allowances and no unemployment assistance. Neither had we any food voucher system.  Through our food voucher system, we have ensured that if there is a limitation on the availability of sufficient supplies of protective foods, the poor will get their share of what is there before anybody else is supplied. We have subsidised agricultural produce in order that our farmers might be induced to grow sufficient food to sustain our people.</P>
    <P>Putting all these items together, we are spending £10,000,000 a year out of taxation for the purpose of sustaining our people, not only against tuberculosis but against the inroads of any other ailment that might attack them.  I feel that people who are approaching this problem with a very hopeful mind and who have no idea whatever of scoring political points, should have adverted to these matters. We would feel more confident if we were all advancing in step under the one generalship to oust this particular enemy from our midst.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2110" /> There are certain relationships between poverty and disease, particularly tuberculosis, but will you get this fundamental fact into your heads, carry it out with you, and try to get it into other people's heads: that no matter what economic conditions obtain, even if the people are starving, if they are not exposing themselves to tubercle bacilli, they will not contract tuberculosis? Naturally, if a member of a poor family, badly housed and insufficiently fed, contracts tuberculosis, it will spread and it will create havoc in that family, but the point.  I want you to realise is that the germ must get in there first and that it is not poverty, starvation, or housing conditions that brings the germ in there.  It is that somebody else who is an open infected case is at large amongst the community and through coughing, sneezing, spitting, etc., discharges millions of these germs into the air we breathe.  Obviously when it gets into the poor man's house, it creates more havoc than when it gets into the rich man's house.  Some Deputies may be reluctant to accept these facts, or perhaps they cannot grasp that malnutrition does not cause tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>I shall put it to you in another way. Does not every Deputy in this House know of somebody who died of cancer of the stomach, disease of the liver or kidneys, or of the lungs; that person had completely lost his appetite for months or even years.  He may have suffered from malnutrition and wasted away from lack of food, but he did not get tuberculosis.  If the malnutrition theory were true, he should have got tuberculosis.  If starvation be a cause of tuberculosis, surely a man without food for several months should contract it.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputies do not misunderstand me.  I am talking with the greatest sincerity and conviction, but I do think that many Deputies do not understand the relation of malnutrition and housing conditions to the problem of tuberculosis.  The real problem that confronts us&mdash;and we shall make no headway until we solve it&mdash;is the problem that people who are openly infective are at large, and the only way we can solve that <Col N="2111" /> problem is by segregating such people in institutions.  So long as the germs that cause this disease and bring about tuberculosis are being openly discharged as they are at the present time, sometimes by persons who are entirely unsuspected, so long as that condition continues, so long shall we have tuberculosis.  The day we eliminate the source of infection, regardless of economic conditions, that day shall we have mastered tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>We had some discussion about tuberculosis in cattle.  I think I dealt sufficiently with that already.  Deputy Everett said that about 10 per cent. of our cattle were suffering from tuberculosis. I do not know whether or not he is correct in that statement, but all I wish to say is that only a small proportion of the cattle which will react positively to a tuberculin test, give tuberculous milk.  Again it is a question of the layman's view, but the latest statistics about the number of cattle that give a positive reaction show that the number does not bear any relation to the number of cattle that might give tuberculous milk.  I think I have covered most of the points raised but if I have not I shall be glad to deal with any points I may have omitted.</P>
    <P>One thing I should like to mention is the note struck by Deputy Coogan and some other Deputies.  Deputy Coogan first mentioned it and it is of considerable importance.  That is to draw the attention of the public, and of everybody who is interested in this question, to the fact that this country is not reeking with tuberculosis.  If we are embarking on a campaign now, it is in order to rid ourselves of a deadly disease that should not be so prevalent.  It is not because our people are any worse off than their neighbours in regard to this disease.  In fact, as many Deputies have pointed out here to-night, and as I pointed out in my opening statement, in the past 30 years, notwithstanding the fact that all the steps that might have been taken were not taken, the death rate from tuberculosis has fallen by no less than 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2112" /> Our complaint is that the death rate did not continue to fall rapidly enough. Our complaint is that it is a preventable disease and that it should not exist at all, or at any rate to any great extent, and what we are aiming at is not to deal with any terrible evil or curse that has come over our country, but to rid our people of tuberculosis so that we shall be free, if we can achieve it, from this disease, so that we may be the envy of the people of other countries.  It can be achieved but it can only be achieved if we all forget about politics and concentrate on the complex problems that confront us and if we all try to find a solution for them.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary to further prolong the discussion.  Probably most of you are tired.  I wish we had more time as there is a good deal more I should like to say to you, but we shall get other opportunities.  Once again I express appreciation of the assistance you have given me on the Bill.  We shall carefully examine all the suggestions made, and if we think we can improve our plans in any way by adopting these suggestions, then we shall certainly do so.  One thing I want you to bear in mind above all others is that the success of our plans is largely a matter of money and that if that money is to be provided you must assist in the provision of it, and you must use every possible influence you have with a hostile Press and hostile critics to get them to realise that they, too, have a duty in this matter and that they must join with us in the attack on this disease.</P>

      <P>I have just one question to put to the Parliamentary Secretary.  When he was dealing with the funds of the Hospitals Trust, an interruption prevented him finishing. Am I to take it that you are not going to adhere to the policy of using the one-third&mdash;that the encroachment is going to be on the basis of the two-thirds hitherto allocated?  The Parliamentary Secretary rightly said that this is not laid down by statute.  The procedure originally observed was continued for years&mdash;an allocation on the basis of one-third and two-thirds.  That procedure was continued until very recently. In the last report the Hospitals Commission said that on the basis <Col N="2113" /> of the allocation hitherto adopted&mdash;I think that was the phrase&mdash;there is approximately £6,000,000 for the voluntary hospitals and over £1,000,000 for the other institutions.</P>

Assuming we encroach to the extent of only £1,500,000, and the provision of voluntary hospitals, which was decided upon before the emergency, is carried out in full, I do not think that the amount of money remaining in the fund will be sufficient to finance it.</P>
