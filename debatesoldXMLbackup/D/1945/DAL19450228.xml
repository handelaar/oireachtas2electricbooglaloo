      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if his attention has been drawn to the serious coast erosion at Ballyheigue, Tralee, which is endangering the safety of many dwelling-houses in the village; and, if so, if he will make provision as soon as possible for the construction of a breakwater there.</P>

      <P>I have received representations to the effect that coast erosion is taking place at Ballyheigue, Tralee, and that certain private property is endangered. The protection of private property from coast erosion is primarily a matter for the owners of the property, and I regret that I have no funds at my disposal for the carrying out of such works.</P>

    <P>I might add that Section 5 (1) (i) of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932, enables grants not exceeding £150 per house to be made from State and local funds to a public utility society erecting houses in an urban area for letting to persons of the working classes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if his attention has been directed to complaints regarding the serious deterioration in the quality of the food served in sanatoria during the past five years; and, if so, if he will state whether he has caused any inquiries to be made to ascertain if there is any justification for such complaints; and if he will make a statement in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I am aware there are no good grounds for complaint regarding the quality or quantity of food supplied in sanatoria, and I shall willingly investigate any specific complaint that may be brought to my notice.  I may say that a dietary scale has been approved by my Department applicable to sanatoria which is considered to be adequate for the needs of patients.  The diet approved includes three pints of milk per day, 14 ounces of butter per week, and seven eggs per week.  Where local authorities have experienced any difficulty in obtaining adequate foods of this nature for patients it has been my <Col N="586" /> practice to take the matter up with the Minister for Supplies with a view to ensuring these supplies for persons undergoing treatment.</P>
      <P>I would inform the Deputy that my attention was directed to a letter in the <i>Irish Times</i> of the 12th instant under the caption &ldquo;T.B.&rdquo; and signed &ldquo;Honest Sufferer&rdquo; which contained charges attributing the main cause of the increase in the tuberculosis death rate to the diabolical deterioration of the food served in sanatoria during the past five years.  On the date of publication of that letter I wrote to the <i>Irish Times</i> asking for the name of the sanatorium to which the anonymouse letter related.  On the following day a reply was received that it is an unvariable rule of the newspapers to respect the anonymity of correspondents who desire to remain anonymous. On the same day I again requested the <i>Irish Times</i> to give the name of the sanatorium.  I pointed out that I attached the greatest importance to the maintenance of a high standard of care and attention to patients in sanatoria and for that reason I desired that the conditions in the sanatorium in respect of which charges were made should be closely investigated and that in the case of a sanatorium under the control of a local authority the charges made in the letter, if proved, would involve gross maladministration by the responsible officials of that authority.</P>
      <P>On February 14th I received a further communication from the <i>Irish Times</i> stating that the correspondent, &ldquo;Honest Sufferer&rdquo;, asked specifically that the name of the institution should not be mentioned, on the ground that he would be identified thereby.  It was further stated that the <i>Irish Times</i> would be glad to help, but the disclosure would amount to a grave breach of journalistic etiquette.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the 17th February I addressed a further letter to the <i>Irish Times.</i>  I again pointed out that the charges in the anonymous letter published on the 12th instant affected adversely the administration of the Tuberculosis Acts by local authorities and that a public investigation of the charges was in my <Col N="587" /> opinion a matter of public importance. I further expressed the view that the decision not to supply the name of the sanatorium is so opposed to the public interest that it could not now be justified by a plea of journalistic etiquette; that in this matter there was a great deal more at issue than journalistic etiquette; that the publication of charges concerning the standard of maintenance and treatment in sanatoria has more than a passing effect unless it can be shown either that the charges are false or if they are found to be correct that the position can be fully remedied; that for friends and relatives of those receiving institutional treatment the publication of such charges must be a cause of grave anxiety and that for those affected with tuberculosis who require institutional care their publication may be the cause of deterring them from entering an institution.</P>
    <P>On the 24th instant the <i>Irish Times</i> replied repeating that the Editor of a newspaper in no circumstances can disclose the identity of a correspondent who may wish to remain anonymous, and that the correspondent &ldquo;Honest Sufferer&rdquo;, whose <i>bona fides</i> does not come into question, desired the whereabout of the sanatorium to be withheld and that the Editor had no option in the matter.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that so long as the persons responsible for the publication of such allegations as are referred to in his question can refuse to facilitate investigation I am denied the opportunity of establishing the truth or falsity of the charges.</P>

      <P>Old age pension appellants suffered injustice from the additional anxiety caused to them when consideration of their appeals was unduly prolonged by reason of the fact that the personal intervention of members of the Oireachtas on behalf of certain claimants resulted in cases being dealt with out of their strict chronological order.  As a further consequence of the intervention referred to, the Department was blamed for the undue delay which attended the consideration of numerous appeals. There is no way in which the injustice referred to could be dealt with except to amend the procedure which led to it.  This object having been attained, no further action is required.</P>

Is it not desirable, in view of that relative <Col N="589" /> injustice as between those who had representations made on their behalf and those who had not, that something should be done to remedy that position and in some way to compensate those people who are not, perhaps, in close touch with a local political club or who have no Deputy to intervene on their behalf?

The number received after that date and prior to 1st December, 1944, was 3,365.  The number of applications received within the prescribed period was more than sufficient to absorb all the funds available for the areas mentioned for the season 1944-45. Besides, in a scheme of this magnitude, it would create serious administrative difficulties if the time-table were not adhered to.

      <P>On the assumption that the Deputy refers to salmon netting operations, I would point out that it is not possible to make an alteration in the fishing season in any locality without holding a public inquiry.  In January, 1938, this matter was the subject of a public inquiry held at Enniscorthy.  After full consideration of the reasons advanced for and against a change in the opening date, it was decided to allow the existing season to continue.</P>

      <P>If Deputy O'Leary will read the reply carefully he will find that I have not the decision in this matter.  All I can do is to ask that an inquiry be held and if any interest makes a <i>prima facie</i> case to the effect that the fishery in general will be benefited by a change, a public inquiry will be held.  When I was in opposition I promised the men on the River Slaney that if a <i>prima facie</i> case was made an inquiry would be held.

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 2 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 5 of the Act of 1934 shall have effect as if it enabled the appointment of a number of referees instead of a referee only and all consequential amendments may be made in the Act of 1934 as are required by the substitution of a number of referees instead of a referee only and each such referee shall have the duties, powers, rights and privileges as are by the Act of 1934 given to the Referee by or under the said Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is designed to shorten the time which, as envisaged by the Minister, it will take to decide cases. The idea underlying the amendment is that every member of the board could be a referee, or that a number of referees could be appointed by the Minister, and that a procedure somewhat similar to that adopted under the 1924 Act could be arranged: that is to say, that the Referee or referees could <Col N="598" /> be sent to different areas to hear evidence.  The applications could then be referred back by the Minister to the Referee, and reconsideration could take place.  The amendment is one which, I think, the Minister could easily accept.  If accepted it would give to each of the referees so appointed powers equal to those possessed by the existing Referee.</P>
    <P>I know the argument will be made against it that if it were accepted you would get different types of rulings. I think we ought to be able to get over that.  The adoption of this method would go a long way to get rid of a lot of the complaints that are being made.  It would also save applicants a considerable amount of financial loss.  Owing to transport difficulties at the present time, applicants who have to come to Dublin in connection with their cases are put to a great deal of expense.  The hearing may take a long time, so that one way and another an applicant from the country may have to spend a day or two in the city.  He has to meet transport charges and hotel expenses, and if he brings witnesses with him he has to bear their expenses.  All these expenses would be eliminated if a number of referees were appointed and if the applicants could be heard in their local centres.  I think applicants are entitled to that much consideration. They have been waiting now for ten years, and a gesture, such as I am proposing, from the Government would, I think, be very well received. It would be an earnest, at any rate, of the Government's goodwill towards these particular people.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is assuming that there are a number of cases to be heard when, in fact, as I mentioned both in my opening and closing statements on the Second Reading of the Bill, there are practically no cases to be heard.  I also pointed out on that occasion that a number of referees would mean a number of varying standards.  Not only would the acceptance of the amendment mean that, but it would also mean that there would be varying stages of discontent in regard to the <Col N="599" /> varying standards adopted by the different referees.  I, therefore, do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says there are no cases to be heard.  It is true that a great number of cases were dealt with in an arbitrary fashion simply because the applicants did not fill their forms correctly.  In respect of the cases of quite a large number of applicants, evidence was never heard.  I do not know the exact number, but I would have no hesitation in saying that in respect of the majority of 10,000 or 15,000 applicants no evidence was ever given except what was stated on their forms.  The Minister defended that by saying that, when the 1924 Act was in operation, a number of cases were thrown out as not coming within the Act.  That is very easily understood because, under the 1924 Act, it was a condition that an applicant must have had service in the National Army, and it was therefore very easy for the Department to decide because they had their official records as to who had been in the National Army.  Those who had not service in the National Army were automatically eliminated.</P>
      <P>Under this Act, there are sections other than those to whom the 1924 Act applied&mdash;people who served with the Executive forces in 1922 and who had pre-Truce service, people who were neutral I.R.A. and the Cumann na mBan.  A great number of these people filled in their forms in very light-hearted fashion.  The reasons for that were many and I do not propose to go into them, but as one who has a considerable knowledge of the people who filled in these forms, not only in my own brigade area but all over the country, I can say that they were filled in in the belief that they were writing not to the Department but to the Minister for Defence, whether Frank Aiken or Oscar Traynor, who knew them and to whom it was not necessary to state what they did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They filled in the forms in very haphazard manner, believing that at some stage they would have an opportunity of going before the Referee and giving <Col N="600" /> verbal evidence in substantiation of their claims.  These applications were thrown out if the forms did not show a <i>prima facie</i> case in support of their claim and that begot a good deal of dissatisfaction.  I could cite scores of cases in which the form was improperly filled.  The applicants then became indignant when they got the 21 days' notice and did not appeal but their cases have not been heard.  If the Minister would adopt this suggestion, it would enable these people at reasonable expense to the State and very little expense to themselves to get their cases adequately dealt with, and I submit they are entitled to that.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there would be varying decisions, but in that connection I urge that a standard be set by statute which would obviate the possibility of varying decisions.  If a standard is set by the House, there cannot be varying decisions.  The Minister should not make this a matter of Government policy and put on the Whips for this Bill.  It is a matter which the House, irrespective of Party affiliations, ought to be allowed to decide on its merits.  If we approach it from a Party angle, I admit it will not do very much good, but this House is supreme and can at any moment obliterate Party affiliations in the common interest, and I put it to the Minister that he should accept the amendment, as well as others which I propose to move.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEoin speaks as if he did not know there was ample protection for the people for whom he speaks.  We all know that practically every man who filled in an application form was connected with some unit or other throughout the country and that if he failed to convince the examining officers through the medium of the form, he was protected against having his case summarily disposed of.  As I mentioned in the course of the previous debate, there was the question of notification to the brigade committee within a period of not less than 28 days.  If a man had not been connected, as Deputy MacEoin might seem to think, with a brigade unit, he was entitled to receive, and did receive, 21 days' <Col N="601" /> notice, and if in the course of that period he was in a position to produce any more evidence than appeared on his form, if, for instance, he was foolish enough to think that his form would reach the person of Frank Aiken or Oscar Traynor, which I very much doubt, he was amply protected by the 21 days' notice afforded to him to make a better case.  If he failed to do so, he cannot blame the Referee, the Advisory Committee or the Government. He can only blame himself.</P>

      <P>Everybody knows that, broadly speaking, the Fianna Fáil clubs throughout the country looked on the 1934 Act as having been specially brought in for the Executive forces, and why would they not?  I am not cavilling at that.  What are the facts?  Fianna Fáil, which had been in civil war against the State, had succeeded, and the 1934 Act, to all intents and purposes, was an Act to give recognition to the men who served with them in the civil war as the 1924 Act gave it to those who served in the National Army.  As I say, I do not cavil at that.  Politicians then butted in and in a great number of cases&mdash; particularly in Longford, as I know&mdash; they advised people to form the committees themselves and not even to allow Seán MacEoin into them.  That was the deliberate advice given and that comes not from any supporter of mine but from members of my brigade committee.  There were hundreds of applicants in Longford at that stage. I saw that injustice would be created and I wrote to a large number of brigade officers&mdash;pre-Truce and post-Truce as I knew both of them&mdash;who came together on my initiative and formed a brigade committee representative of all.  The Act had been in operation a considerable time before that stage was reached.  A number of persons had, in the meantime, received the 21 days' notice.  The Minister is not correct in saying that the brigade committees got 28 days' notice that the Referee proposed to send out a 21 days' notice.  The first list we got&mdash;I speak again of the Longford brigade committee&mdash;was one of 200 or 300 names which was to be dealt with in 28 days.  At that time the Referee and his staff, which was whole-time, were dealing with about 30 applications per day on an average.  In this case a voluntary committee was expected to sit for practically 28 days to investigate the claims sent to them.  As in the case of several brigades, by the time the brigade committee was in a position to report upon a certain number <Col N="603" /> of these claims, the 28 days had elapsed.  The Referee held fast to the rule and the 21 days' notice went out to the applicant.</P>
      <P>Some of the units to which the Minister referred got specimen copies of the forms.  They filled them in and then gave them out to members of a company. Some of the men concerned, not understanding the matter fully, left part of the periods blank so that, on the face of the form, they were shown as persons to whom the Act did not apply.  They got the 21 days' notice because they left the period blank, for instance, from 1st April, 1921, to 11th July, 1921.  I know cases of that kind and so does the Referee and everybody else who has had to do with those pensions.  The Minister says that applicants were amply protected.  I submit that they were not.  If they were, I would not be a party to putting down this amendment.  If Deputy Killilea thinks that it is not in the interest of the applicants to have the referees go out to the districts and hear any cases that may be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The rules of order here permit a Deputy to get up and answer another Deputy who has spoken.  Interjections are not the way to help him.  If Deputy Killilea wants to help me to make the case to the Minister, he should not interject.  I accept Deputy Killilea's statement that he is not opposed to this proposal. Therefore, I join with him in putting it to the Minister that he should accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. During the Second Reading of the Bill, we heard a great deal from the Taoiseach and the Minister about the number of persons who had made application for pensions and the time which would be necessary, in their opinion, to have the claims adjudicated. I suggest to the Minister that the machinery suggested by Deputy MacEoin for having those claims heard in a reasonable time is most suitable. The Minister said on the Second Reading and to-day, and the Taoiseach said on the Second Reading, that if there were different referees there might be varying decisions.  I do not think that that would be so.  The law is there to be administered and, if it were administered fairly, I do not think that there would be varying decisions.  The Minister might as well say that litigation in connection with every matter should be brought to Dublin and that there should be only one judge.  I think that that is a parallel case, though the Minister does not think so. As Deputy MacEoin pointed out, these forms had to be filled up in the country by people who were not used to filling such forms.  It was not an easy matter to fill some of them.  It was not always an easy matter, either, to get people to come forward and give evidence on behalf of claimants.  There was a certain amount of confusion at the beginning.  If arrangements were made for the hearing of claims in the appropriate areas, they would be dealt with in a comparatively short time.  I ask the Minister to reconsider his decision. I am sure that there are members of his own Party who think as we do on this question.  Every member of the House is anxious that everybody who took part in the War of Independence should receive justice.  After all, these men are getting old and the liability to the State would cease in a comparatively short time.  I think that an earnest attempt should be made, through the medium of this Bill, to do justice to those people.  Members of the Government Party know that claimants with a stronger case than others who are in receipt of pensions <Col N="605" /> have been turned down.  I do not see that there would be anything unconstitutional or wrong in the acceptance of this amendment.  It is an earnest effort, in my opinion, by Deputy MacEoin to settle this question once and for all.  I am sure that every member of the House, no matter to what Party he belongs&mdash;and especially those of us who were identified with that period&mdash;is most anxious to have these cases settled once and for all. The Government have a good opportunity of doing that by taking advantage of this amendment.  From my knowledge of the situation and from conversations I have had with members of the Old I.R.A. from time to time, I am certain that, if such a method as this were adopted, the persons concerned would be prepared to accept the decisions given.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to get into controversy with Deputy Killilea on this amendment.  In my opinion, the expenditure involved by the amendment would be very small. As regards the varying awards which the Minister says would result from adoption of this amendment, I want to say this, and I do not say it for the purpose of controversy: under the <Col N="606" /> existing rules, it is well known that there are varying standards, that although the Referee set a standard of qualifying service, that differed as between brigades.  In a brigade area in which there had been a large number of engagements, more was required of an applicant than was required of an applicant in a brigade area in which there was a small number of engagements.  If the same standard were applied in an area in which engagements were few, virtually nobody would qualify.  There is already a varying standard.  If this House does not set the standard, these people, sitting together, can by a rule of procedure settle what the standard should be.  I think that no member on the Fianna Fáil Benches if he were on this side&mdash;not even the Minister himself if he were on the back benches&mdash; would be in disagreement with this amendment.  I put it to the Minister that he should not let the old lady of Finance overrule him in this matter.  If it is simply a matter of finance, I think I can say that this House is prepared to give the Minister all the finance and all the power he requires to do justice to these men.</P>

It has to do with the grant or purported grant of a pension, and its purpose is simply to say that such grant or purported grant of a pension shall not be invalidated or be questioned merely on the ground that certain conditions were not complied with, as provided under the 1934 Act.  The Minister, in introducing this Bill, said, as one leg of his argument, that it was necessary to have some such provision in the Bill, and, in putting forward this amendment, I suggest that I am trying to facilitate him in the matter of validating such claims, and leaving it open to have doubtful cases cleared up. There are some doubtful cases pending at the moment, and I suggest that this amendment would help the Minister to deal with such cases.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister ought to accept this amendment, because it is a more positive way of achieving the object that he has in mind of validating awards that have been already made.  I think it is a better way of achieving that object than the one he has adopted in the Bill, and, in my opinion, it would certainly remove any doubt about the <Col N="609" /> matter and would give both the Minister and the applicant concerned the security that they desire.  I think that the method proposed here is simpler than the method proposed in sub-sections (3), (4), (5), (7) and (8) of the section; and I also think that the adoption of this amendment would give proof to the Minister's assertion that this Bill will not lessen the rights of any applicant for a pension.  I think that this amendment will leave the matter clear and beyond all doubt. The Minister, when speaking on the Second Stage of the Bill, was very positive that the claims of applicants were not being jeopardised in any way by this Bill, and I saw a letter written by the Parliamentary Secretary to a brigade committee, in which he assured them that that was so.  Now, my contention is that this amendment would make that so, beyond all doubt, and would give effect to the Government policy and the Government view, as has been set out, on this matter, while, at the same time, it would give the applicant an assurance that where positive awards were granted, there would be no interference with such awards.</P>

      <P>As I understood it, the Minister, and other speakers on the Government side, during the debate on the Second Reading of this Bill, expressed anxiety as to the validating of the claims of people who had been awarded military service pensions. That seemed to me to be the case made by the Minister, and it occurs to me that this is an opportunity for him to go into that matter now.  The Minister, and other members of his Party who spoke, seemed to be chiefly concerned to see that there would be no interference with pensions that had already been awarded, but, by refusing to accept this amendment, it would appear now that the Minister is now departing from that.</P>

      <P>It is incorrect for the Deputy to suggest that we are scrapping the machinery of the Act of 1934.  We are not doing so.  We are, in fact, reinforcing it by the introduction of this Bill to validate the work which the Referee has been carrying out in a particular manner for a considerable time.  The actual machinery of the Act of 1934 is there, and the Referee can operate it at his will.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (3) reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Nothing in the Act of 1934 or in any regulation or rules made thereunder shall be construed as</P>
      <P>(a)  requiring the Referee, in investigating an application for a service certificate,&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  to summon the applicant, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  to hear the applicant, or</P>
      <P>(iii)  to be present at any time when the applicant is being heard, or</P>
      <P>(b)  prohibiting the Referee, in investigating an application for a service certificate, from authorising or permitting a person to hear the applicant.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I submit that that sub-section means the scrapping of the Act of 1934 under which the applicant had certain rights. The Minister stated that the Referee can do anything.  He may decide a case without hearing the applicant or without having a form of application before him.  If that is the position, I am perfectly happy.  If the Minister is going to give the Referee the right to decide cases without hearing anybody that will do, because the applicants will know that that is not done by law or by a statute passed by this House, but by an administrative act of the Minister and the Referee.  In this Bill the Minister is proposing to scrap everything that has been done and he is putting this section in its place.  We are trying to meet the Minister.  His whole case was that if this Bill was not brought in every award that had been made was null and void and could not be paid.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment. The Taoiseach, the Minister and other Deputies stated that the impression conveyed to the House was that the Bill was definitely necessary in order that claims already granted should not be declared null and void. Members of Fianna Fáil carefully stuck to that line of argument all the time.  I know that where resolutions came before various county councils on which there were Fianna Fáil Deputies the answers invariably given by them was that this Bill was not to interfere with the decisions of the court in so far as appeals made by applicants went, but in order to secure the absolute validity of claims already granted.  If that was not the purpose of the Bill perhaps the Minister would state now what was the object.  That was the impression conveyed on the Second Reading.</P>

      <P>We are not accepting this amendment because it would impose an enormous cost on the State. Up to the present time the cases with which we have dealt have cost about £5,000 in legal expenses but if we were to take into consideration the number of cases which we know lawyers are ready to bring into court, the costs <Col N="614" /> would run into an enormous sum.  I am not quite sure of the actual figure but it would be enormous.  We have to protect the taxpayers against that sort of indiscriminate assault on their rights.  We accepted the decision of the Supreme Court in regard to the cases which were before the court. We decided to go beyond the number of cases in the court up to a given date and the date we decided was the 1st February and even cases that had not come before the Supreme Court on that particular date are being admitted up to that date.  We are certainly not going to be a party in encouraging either lawyers or clients to come in here and get easy money.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister give an undertaking that where there is reasonable evidence from brigade committees that was not previously available he will refer back the cases without getting an order of the High Court?  In that way some of the errors &mdash;that is the easiest word that occurs to me&mdash;that have occurred would be eliminated.  The Minister insists on this because the blunder has cost £5,000 already and he is afraid it will cost more.  I would remind him that while it is right and proper for the Minister and for the House to guard the Treasury, these applicants, through blood and sweat and labour, have won certain rights which this section, arbitrarily, takes from them.  I suggest that the hardship endured by these applicants is worthy of much more consideration than any £5,000 the Minister may talk about.  I do not want to get hot about the matter but I do feel that this is an arbitrary date taken by the Minister and put into this Bill, and it will appear as being the wish of the House.  I am protesting against that.  I protest that in this Bill this House is represented to the members of the Old I.R.A. as being an arbitrary body that does not care one hoot about them.  It will appear to them that this Bill represents the minds of all of us.  I think that is very unfair.  It may represent the majority of the House that are governed by the Whips.  I do not want to make political capital out of it or anything like that, but I think it would be a <Col N="615" /> revelation to the Minister if he were to take off the Whips in respect of one of these amendments&mdash;not this one in particular&mdash;but those that really affect the interests of the applicants.</P>

I am one who would vote against this amendment if the Whips were off and, with all due respect to what Deputy MacEoin feels, I think that I have as much right to say that if the public were not made aware of what is happening here, through reports in the Press and otherwise, he, too, would vote against his own amendment in the interests of public good and public economy.  I maintain that the court decision did not benefit in the slightest degree the men who went before the court and got a certain decision.  It did not benefit them in enabling to qualify for military service pensions.  That is the point.</P>

      <P>If it has not benefited them&mdash;and I take it Deputy MacEoin agrees with me in that&mdash; what is the point in allowing public money to be squandered by permitting to be rushed into court 10,000 cases, at the expense of the State, to get a similar decision, that in the end will not benefit the men on whom that money is spent?  I suggest it is purely and simply waste of public money. The men who went before the court did so to effect a test case decision. When a test case decision is effected it decides all similar cases and I suggest it is rash waste of public money to bring in all the other cases that are already decided by the test case and to spend public money in having them decided individually.  In view of that fact I cannot see any wisdom in Deputy MacEoin's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin asked the Minister would he say that if certain evidence <Col N="616" /> was made available now he could refer particular cases back to the Referee.  Deputy MacEoin is better qualified than I and probably is as well qualified as the Minister to answer that question himself.  He knows that under the existing Act where evidence is made available that was not previously available the Minister may refer them back.  It is for that reason that I am taking a certain line of action on this Bill from start to finish and I still maintain that it is the way to have justice done.  It will not be done by rash spending of public money in obtaining court decisions where a test case decision has already been obtained.  For that reason, Whip or no Whip, I can see no justification for any Deputy, on any side of the House, voting for further expenditure in order to effect similar decisions.</P>

      <P>It allows their cases to go before the Referee for a hearing, which some of them have not got up to the present.  In that case, the Referee has now to decide upon the facts which they will now put <Col N="617" /> before him whether or not they come within the terms of this Bill or the Act of 1934.  Therefore, they are in a better position than the people who are now debarred from having their cases heard.  When Deputy O Cléirigh argues that it is no advantage to them, that is more ingenious than anything I can put up, because it is near the truth, but not quite the truth.  By changing this to read &ldquo;the passing of this Act&rdquo; instead of the 1st February, the rights are left to these people.  The Minister may refer the cases back.  Deputy O Cléirigh is ingenious again because he says that he is prepared to depend upon that method for getting their rights for these people rather than this other way.

      <P>I want to stress that the word is &ldquo;may&rdquo; and not &ldquo;shall&rdquo;&mdash;he may refer back.  The Deputy knows thoroughly well that the Minister has to be satisfied that the evidence is now available, that it was not available at the time of the hearing and that, if it were available then, he is not bound to refer it back. I know well that if I go with one case to the Minister, being good-natured, he will say: &ldquo;I, will have that matter examined.&rdquo;  But he will not promise that he will refer it back to the Referee.  If I have made a very good case, he may do that.  But, to expect brigade committees or chairmen of brigade committees, or even Deputies to make representations in each individual case is something that I think nobody would undertake.  I think that the House should not allow a case to <Col N="618" /> be dealt with through influence.  If the Minister says that he will agree to change the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in the relevant section to the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, that when there is additional evidence put up he shall refer it back to the Referee, I will be satisfied.  I agree that in that case these people will have got the same rights as the people who got the High Court judgment; it will be the equivalent of that.  The fact that it is referred back to the Referee does not guarantee a pension to the applicant or a certificate.  But it does give him the opportunity of making his case upon the evidence now available.</P>

If I am informed that there is additional evidence, I have no option but to refer it back to the Referee and I do so.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo;, so far as I know, means &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and it becomes mandatory under the Act; so that there is nothing in the point the Deputy is trying to make, that it should be changed to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  In its present form it is mandatory.</P>

If you make an application and fill in a form, you can have that other evidence affixed to the form.  A man is not confined solely to the evidence contained in the form.  All that is put on a file. If I get an application to have a case reviewed, the only way in which I can ascertain whether the evidence is new or not is by submitting it to the secretary to the Referee who examines it and compares it with the evidence on the file.  If, in his opinion, it is additional evidence which was not already available, I am informed of the fact that, in the opinion of the secretary, this is additional evidence and I refer it back.  I have no option but to refer it back, just as I have no option, if it is not additional evidence, but not to refer it back.</P>

      <P>Deputy O Cléirigh made clear what we are already aware of, that there is no benefit in a material sense to any of the applicants who went before the High Court; that is to say, that the decision of the High Court does not, of course, give a pension to any of these people, as was wrongly thought in various parts of the country.  But I cannot understand what the Deputy means when he talks about a test case.  The inference I drew from that is that the cases already before the High Court would determine other cases of a similar nature which have not been before the High Court and that these cases <Col N="620" /> would be reheard.  I should like to know is that true?  There is very little use in the amendment if that is true. I understood from what took place on the Second Reading that it was only those applicants who had access to the High Court who would have their cases reheard; that the Minister was not taking any action to invalidate their right to go before the Referee or the Pensions Board.  But when you talk about a test case it implies that all those who have not got pensions and who think that they should get them are entitled to go before the Referee. If that is the case, I submit that there is no necessity for the amendment.</P>

All those applicants who have additional evidence can go back and have their cases reheard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point. That is an entirely different argument. The cases that went before the High Court were cases of people who contended that the whole machinery of the Act was not brought into operation in trying their cases.  Is not that the position?  The question of additional evidence has nothing whatever to do with it.  These people whose cases have been already before the High Court are entitled to have their cases reheard without submitting what they consider or the Minister considers to be more evidence at all.  There is a big principle there.  We are discussing two different things.  When Deputy O Cléirigh talks about test cases it certainly entitled us to draw the inference, if he is right, that anybody who was in a similar position to those whose cases came under the High Court are entitled to have their cases reheard.</P>

      <P>I cannot exactly follow the Minister's statement that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is mandatory even if it is not changed to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, in view of my own experience of the actual practice.  I have had experience of cases of the Longford Brigade Committee in which there was certain additional documentary evidence put in.  I cited one of them here on the Second Reading debate and the Minister's reply to it was that that was not additional evidence.  On its face, there was no question that it was additional evidence because the applicant had made a mistake in his evidence. It was actually an error on his part and documentary evidence was got at a hospital here in the City of Dublin to establish the fact.  It was evidence additional to that which had been before the Referee.  I am not going to argue that, however, because that is not the point of this amendment. The point of the amendment is that at the moment there are people who have certain rights.  They can, whether it is additional evidence or not, by a High Court order or by the Minister's consent get their cases heard properly by the Referee.  The Minister can leave them these rights by accepting the date of the passing of the Act or he can say that he proposes to refer them back where a case is made.  I submit that it would lead to greater satisfaction to the applicants if this right were left to them.</P>

I might look through it but if I think it is something in regard to which I can do very little, I refer it to the department of the Referee. It goes, in fact, to the secretary who is a member of the Referee's staff. The secretary then secures the particular file.  He examines what is stated to be new evidence against the evidence already contained in the file. If he has doubt of any kind in his <Col N="623" /> mind he immediately consults the members of the Advisory Committee and between them they make a decision.  If there is no doubt whatever in the secretary's mind he is entitled, if he so desires, to come to a decision of himself, but he very seldom does that.  He shares his responsibility in that respect with some member or members of the Referee's Advisory Committee or his staff.  If, in their opinion, there is additional evidence it comes back to me with the statement that there is additional evidence and then it becomes my responsibility to refer it to the Referee for rehearing.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 23 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 24:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of Section 2 a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(10)  Where a report has been made or purports to have been made by the Referee prior to the 8th day of February, 1945, in consequence of which the Minister has refused to grant a service certificate to the person to whom such report relates and such person, prior to the 1st day of January, 1946, by a notice in writing requests the Minister to cause such person's application for a service certificate to be again investigated, the following provisions shall have effect:&mdash; the application shall be again investigated and a report made thereon by a referee as if sub-sections (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) and (8) of this section had not been enacted.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us to-day, and I have accepted that view, that when additional evidence comes his way he must refer the case back to the Referee and that in actual practice what he does, when he gets an appeal which purports to have additional evidence, is to refer it to the Referee's department, where it is examined by the secretary to the Referee, and if the secretary has any doubt a member of the board is consulted. That is the procedure.  I cannot understand how it comes about that some of the appeals have been turned down if there was an examination of that type.</P>
      <P>What this amendment proposes to do is to refer the case back to the Referee and, instead of having it examined by the secretary or any other such person, as to whether it is addiditional evidence or not, when this appeal is made to the Minister the Minister shall refer it back to the Referee for reinvestigation.  That is the equivalent of the quashing of the award already made by the High Court and it gives these people certain rights.  I submit that if an applicant, when he is making the application, is aware that the onus of proof rests on him and he has to travel to Dublin to give evidence before the Referee and has to bring witnesses with him, then, unless he has a good case, he will not do it.  This sub-section gives the applicant an opportunity of proving his case.  At least, it gives him the satisfaction of knowing that he is not turned down by reason of not having given service to his country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the overwhelming <Col N="627" /> majority of the applicants, there have been charges made against them of being pension hunters, but we have now reached the stage when that is not so much the consideration.  The certificate of service is now regarded as a very important matter.  There are large numbers of applicants in the country who would regard the refusal of a certificate of service as a reflection upon them, because most people in their areas knew them to be members of the Volunteers and the I.R.A., and if they are left without a certificate it would be a serious reflection on them. This amendment would go a long way to satisfy me, at any rate, as to the possible elimination of the errors that have arisen in the administration of the Act.  I regret to say that the errors are fairly numerous.  The amendment is a reasonable one and I urge the Minister to accept it, at least in principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not accepting this amendment, because actually under the Act and under this Bill, before a case can be reviewed, additional evidence of the kind we have been discussing here to-day must be submitted. It must not only be additional evidence, but it must be evidence of a type which was not already available. I cannot depart from that.  In view of that, I do not see that I can accept this amendment.  As I see the amendment, it would compel me, in every case in which the applicant desired an appeal, to grant that appeal.  It would be tantamount to rehearing all the cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest it would not be tantamount to that.  Remember that there will be an obligation on the applicant.  The applicant has to come to Dublin at his own expense and bring witnesses at his own expense and he would be running a big risk.  Therefore, unless the person has a reasonably good case and has service, he is not going to risk £5, £6 or £10 for the mere whim of being heard.  The Minister says he cannot depart from the section under which he refers the case back.  The phrase in regard to evidence &ldquo;that was not already available&rdquo; is <Col N="628" /> the whole snag, because there are various views as to what is meant exactly by what was or was not available at the time of the hearing.  Under the 1924 Act it was accepted that evidence was not available where a member of the executive forces refused to give evidence on behalf of an applicant; in other words, that it was not possible for the applicant, because the person who could give the evidence on his behalf refused to do so, to succeed. That established the procedure that has more or less been carried on and that is the sort of thing that would apply here.</P>
      <P>I hold there were mistakes made by brigade committees in submitting records.  Take once more the example of the Longford Brigade.  We put in a covering letter saying that in the time at our disposal we were going as closely as we could go to the facts, but that we were sure there were errors and omissions and we reserved the right to ourselves to make amendments as time went on.  We found that very difficult.  When a case was put forward that an error was made and we referred to the covering letter and to our right to amend, we were told that it was simply a covering note.  I admit that I do not like the wording of the amendment, but I think the Minister should not tie himself so tightly in the matter of referring cases back.  That is why I suggested that the Minister should accept the amendment in principle. He could then draft it in such a way as to cover what was clearly additional evidence and to enable a case, whether that evidence was or was not available at the time of the hearing, to be reheard.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach last week asked the House for suggestions as to a solution of the problem and indicated that he was prepared to consider the views of all concerned.  I should like to know now if the Government have made up their mind not to give way in respect of any of the amendments put down by Deputy MacEoin and other Deputies.  I suggest that where a man or woman claimant was not able to produce sufficient proof of having taken part in a major engagement to qualify for a <Col N="629" /> pension, but has evidence to show that he or she took part in the war for freedom, compensation of some kind should be granted, if the Minister cannot see his way to grant a pension, and so finish the matter once and for all with satisfaction to people who have just claims.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The ruling out of order of some of the amendments I tabled has put me at a disadvantage and I wish I had got a little more notice of the decision to rule them out.  I submit that the House should not pass this section because it leaves the Referee still with the right to hear a case or not as he decrees and to make rules as to what will or will not constitute service.  The House should, by statute, define the minimum requirement for active service, and if the House passes this section as it stands, it will be handing over the right of Parliament to somebody else, that somebody else being the Referee. The Referee has apparently no difficulty whatever in defining active service and the position is that he varies the rule by which applicants will qualify for a certificate.  In one brigade area, an applicant must have taken part in so many engagements, but in another area much less is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ground&mdash;a reasonable ground, I admit&mdash;for that is that these men gave as much of their time as those who had more engagements, and where there were a large number of engagements&mdash;again a reasonable argument&mdash; it is only reasonable that a claimant should have a certain number if he was on whole-time service; but, at the same time, the principle of varying standards is established.  Before the House passes the section, the standard should be set by statute and not by a rule, or, if it is to be set by a rule, the rule should be made by somebody with very clear knowledge of the times and of the services these people rendered.  I do not want that to be taken as a reflection on any of the <Col N="630" /> referees of the past, but, with all due respect to them, they were men who had not very much, if any, association with that particular period in the field.  Some of them may have had knowledge of administration of a different kind, but I suggest it is impossible for the Referee to investigate a case when the rule by which he is to be guided is made by himself. It would be much easier for the Referee or the judge to interpret the standard if we here set it.  The Minister, as the responsible person for submitting such an amendment, can do that.</P>
    <P>Everybody is supposed to be equal before the law.  Yet, in respect of this Bill, which applies to Volunteers, Cumann na mBan and Fianna Eireann, there are different standards. Instead of being set by the Referee, it should be set by this House, so that the judge or Referee, instead of having to interpret his own rule, would do what the judges of the courts to-day do, that is, interpret a statute of this House.  The Bill lays down certain things and it is then left to somebody, not bound by any statute but by a rule of his own, to interpret what constitutes service as a minimum requirement for a certificate.  I ask the House not to pass the section until the Minister gives an assurance that he will introduce an amendment defining active service and the matters in respect of which the Referee is to investigate and report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in the same position as Deputy MacEoin.  I had an amendment down dealing with this question of assessing the value of active service, but it was ruled out of order.  While appreciating the difficulty of arriving at a satisfactory definition of active service, I agree with Deputy MacEoin in thinking that the Minister should, in this Bill, have at least laid down the principles on which the Referee would treat active service.  Now, ordinarily speaking, active service should mean active participation in military operations in an active area or theatre of warfare.  That would be the ordinary definition as applying to the recognised <Col N="631" /> army of any State fighting either inside the State or outside the State. Something of the same general principle should apply here.  After all, &ldquo;they also serve who stand and wait&rdquo;, sometimes.  We have seen some extraordinary results from the administration of the 1934 Act by the Minister's Department.  I know several cases where men who were in similar engagements and had similar service, were treated differently in the matter of pensions.  It is difficult to understand by what process of reasoning a distinction was made in those cases. I think that the grievances of many of those men could be got rid of if we would face up to a definition of active service.  We all know that in an army it may be by accident a man who goes into the firing lines finds himself there. It may be by an accident of administration that a man, who is very keen on being in the firing line, is denied that opportunity, and is retained behind the firing line in an administrative capacity, owing to the fact that he is considered better fitted for a position there.  We also know that some individuals are particularly expert in the making of munitions or, perhaps, in matters of transport or intelligence. It is, as I say, merely accidental, so far as the individual is concerned, that he finds himself in a military organisation in a given position at any given time.  I think, having regard to these considerations, we should at least have some general principles to safeguard individuals when the Referee comes to consider claims for pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the statement from the Minister to-day that pending claims will be disposed of by the arbitrary will of the Referee, and that no restrictions whatever will be imposed on him.  I hope no influence of any kind will be exercised from any section of the House or by any section of the Minister's Department.  That may or may not be a good way to reach finality in these matters.  I know there are great difficulties and that it is essential that finality must be reached.  At the same time, the case of these individuals is to rest on the arbitrary will of the Referee.  All the machinery procedure <Col N="632" /> of the 1934 Act is cut away and there is nothing left but the arbitrary will of the Referee.  Under sub-section (1) of Section 2 he need not consult the committee.  We set up a committee, and yet we say that he need not consult it.  I do not know why the House went to the trouble of setting up a committee at all if we are going to leave the matter to the discretion of the Referee and ask no member of the committee to assist him.  The committee need not function unless it is requested to do so by the Referee. That seems an extraordinary provision. Assuming that there is a reason for it, and I suppose the Minister has a good reason for it, though it has not been disclosed to the House, we reach the position that the Referee, and he alone, will decide the matter. That is placing a serious responsibility on him.  We are cutting away all legal procedure, scrapping the rules of evidence and any rules or regulations that were made under the 1934 Act. All the administrative procedure is being scrapped and you are giving the Referee <i>carte blanche.</i></P>
    <P>Therefore, it is clear that if there are any malcontents, as a result of the administration of this new measure, the position will only have been caused by the Minister and the Referee acting under his directions.  This House cannot be blamed.  Deputy MacEoin has pointed out that in this respect we have been trying to put the Bill on right lines.  We are really trying to safeguard the individual who may have a legitimate grievance from the exercise of the arbitrary will of the Referee.  I have no doubt that, under the present dispensation, the Minister will see to it that all pending cases receive a reasonable hearing. But, nevertheless, in this matter it has to be remembered that the House is conferring these extraordinary powers on an individual civil servant who owes his position to the Minister, who acts in accordance with the will of the Minister and serves only during the pleasure of the Executive Government.  I do not intend to go into that question again.  I dealt with it on the Second Reading of the Bill. I do want to say that it is a bad precedent <Col N="633" /> for this House to establish, that it is a bad precedent to scrap what was really intended as a judicial procedure, and go to the opposite extreme of setting up in its stead the arbitrary will of a referee.  I want again to register my emphatic protest against this.  It is a type of precedent and of legislation that every free-minded citizen and every Deputy should reprobate and resist with all the strength at his command.  The other unsatisfactory feature of the section is that, while scrapping that machinery, the Minister in Sections 5 and 7 proceeds to refine what he means in sub-sections (3), (4) and (5).  He proceeds to amend the original Act, and in sub-sections (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7), and paragraphs (a) and (b) refines what is meant in certain cases.  The position is that you have a refinement within a refinement and an amendment within an amendment.  That is an extraordinary type of legislation, and to the ordinary citizen and Deputy it must appear very confusing.</P>
    <P>As regards the arbitrary date fixed in the Bill, we asked the Minister to agree to an alternative date.  The majority of our amendments suggested that the date should be the date of the passing of the Act.  I do not know what the Minister would have to fear from a provision of that kind.  A very short period will elapse until this Bill becomes law, and I doubt that in the meantime very many cases can come before the courts.  Moreover, the Minister is taking very good care in a later amendment to ensure that if any cases come before the courts the costs, so far as the applicants are concerned, will have to be met by the applicants themselves.  Therefore, the argument put forward in favour of this section falls to the ground.  We were told that we would have multitudinous applications to the courts for conditional orders and that these would involve the State in enormous cost.  In the first place, the Minister is taking good care to ensure that that will not happen.  Where the rights of a body of citizens such as the men we are concerned with here are in question, <Col N="634" /> of men who gave their services voluntarily to the country and who risked their lives in difficult and troubled days, the cost should not count.  The services that they rendered could not be measured in terms of money even if the cost were £5,000 or £10,000. If that is the only reason that the Minister can put forward for denying those men their rights, then we must say that we have reached a deplorable position in this country: that for a mere matter of £10,000 or £5,000 those men are to be denied their rights&mdash; rights which were given to them by this House and by the present Government Party.  Finally, I ask the Minister to consider the cases that may be put up to him, where applications were made to the courts and conditional orders were made but where, through no fault of the applicants, the conditional orders were not confirmed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bennett has already mentioned three cases.  I do not think there are many more cases of the kind, but in the particular cases he mentioned, conditional orders were obtained, and now the applicants concerned, through no fault of their own, find themselves without any means of redress.  Those cases go back as far as 1943; they do not come within the terms of this Order and, accordingly, I would ask the Minister that in any case of that kind which comes to his notice&mdash;and I think he has full power to deal with such cases under Section 3&mdash;he will deal with them sympathetically, because, I feel that if we were to do so, it would take a great deal of the sting out of this thing, so far as these people are concerned at the moment.</P>

      <P>Anybody who has had experience of the various Military Service Pensions Bills that have been passed during the last few years must be aware that the one snag in connection with all these Bills was the definition of &ldquo;active service&rdquo;.  I was not here at the beginning of this debate, and I am sorry that I did not hear the arguments of Deputy MacEoin and other Deputies on this matter of people who were deprived of pensions because of their failure to prove active service within the meaning of the various Acts. <Col N="635" /> I have met many cases of that kind in my own constituency, and I should like to back up the arguments of Deputy MacEoin and other Deputies in that respect. Apart from that, however, I am particularly interested in the section that, in my opinion, somewhat arbitrarily cuts out men who appealed to the courts, got conditional orders, and who now have no redress as a result of the arbitrary fixing of the 1st of February as the latest date.</P>
      <P>The Minister, on the Second Reading, said that this might mean bringing numerous cases to court, possibly, thousands of cases.  There may be something to be said for the Minister's point of view there; but surely there are certain other cases, such as I have mentioned, which are deserving of the Minister's sympathetic consideration.  I have in mind three cases, and, possibly, there would be some more who applied for conditional orders in or about that time.  Now surely these people could not prophesy that there would be any orders made in their favour or against them.  What I am given to understand is that, in connection with this case, some time later on, there was some question of an extension of time.  I am not quite clear on that issue, but I understand that what eventually happened in that particular case was that Judge Haugh decided that the best thing to do would be, not to give an extension of time, but to make a new order.  My point is that, in fact, these applicants are in the same position or, possibly, even in a better position, than some of the people who succeeded in the cases I have referred to&mdash;that they might even have a better case&mdash;and yet they will be ruled out, it appears to me, by the fixing of this date of 1st February.  I would ask the Minister to take a sympathetic view of such cases. If he wishes I can give him, privately, the names of the people concerned in my own constituency who, through no fault of their own, will be denied an opportunity of making a claim as a result of the procedure now laid down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid, Sir, that I cannot accept Deputy Coogan's valuation of the position.  From his remarks during the course of the discussion <Col N="636" /> on this Bill it appeared to me that he was trying to convey that he was very innocent in this matter. I venture to say, however, that if I were to go to Deputy Coogan and ask him for his professional opinion on this matter, it would be somewhat different.  However, that is another matter.  It seemed to me that the Deputy showed a singular lack of knowledge of the circumstances in which a large number of pensions were awarded.  He spoke of people who had rendered good service, in an administrative way, because of their particular abilities, or by doing intelligence work, and so on, and seemed to convey that such people were not awarded pensions because they had not given active service.  Now, anybody who has any knowledge of the way in which the Pensions Board functions must know that pensions have been awarded to persons of that type, even though they never fired a single shot. I am sure that that is within the knowledge of most of the Deputies in this House, and the Deputy is quite wrong in saying that people of the kind to whom he has referred have not received any award.</P>
      <P>As to the wording of this amending Bill, I am sure that Deputy Coogan, more than many other Deputies, knows that that is the legal jargon, if one might call it so, or the ordinary legal formula for ensuring that things, which, perhaps, might not have been done quite legally in the past, would now be put in proper legal form, and thus enable the Referee to carry on in proper legal fashion.  Under the law, the Referee has power to determine his own procedure, and I believe&mdash; although I am not saying this dogmatically&mdash;that the original Referee, in making his procedure, which was eventually adopted, under Statutory Rules and Orders, determined on that procedure in the belief that he was acting legally, within the terms of the Act.  These rules and regulations are there.  They are laid down by the Minister for Defence, and it is a matter for the Referee to decide what procedure, within these rules and regulations, he will adopt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing in this Bill which <Col N="637" /> differs in any way from the conduct of cases by the Referee.  For a very considerable time the Referee has, to the knowledge of practically every Deputy who has contact with him, been carrying out the procedure which has been questioned, and on which decisions were given for a long number of years.  No Deputy and no applicant raised any protest against it. It was not until this was discovered as a flaw by some of the legal fraternity that the matter was taken into court.  I have no doubt that the Old I.R.A. organisation which was involved in the securing of legal opinion was, probably, in agreement with the legal people who advised them to contest it in court.  When it was contested it was found that the procedure was not in accordance with the Act, but there was no charge, either in the court or anywhere else, that we heard of, of any case of injustice against the Referee or the advisory board during the years he was operating this procedure.  I would be amazed to hear from anybody that there was anything in the nature of gross injustice.  There may have been errors.  I am not going to suggest that in the examination of 60,000 applications mistakes may not have been made here and there.  Mistakes are things which, as human beings, we can all make, but mistakes are not cases of gross injustice.  The court was merely asked to decide the question, as to whether the Referee was or was not acting within the meaning of the section.  The appeal court taking the strictly legal method of dealing with it said something like this:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="638" />&ldquo;This is in defiance of the manner in which cases should be heard.  The words are there in black and white, that cases should be brought before the Referee, and, in our opinion, taking the strictly literal and legal interpretation of these words, the fact that men were not heard before the Referee makes the cases null and void.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was no charge whatever in court, and no judgment by the court, to suggest that there was anything wrong in the decisions of the Referee, other than that the procedure was wrong.  I am perfectly convinced, that whatever small number of cases may yet have to be heard&mdash;and I want to say that if this Bill goes through they will only be a very small number with the exception of whatever number may come in on appeal&mdash;they will be examined if they are within the proper category.  Outside the small number of cases that I have referred to, practically every case in the country has been dealt with.  To suggest, as has been suggested, that there are still large numbers of applications to be heard, is wrong.  In fact, this Bill will hardly affect anybody.  In the main it will affect only those coming in on appeal.  In future appeals will be carried out in the same strict legal manner as the Referee has been carrying on up to the present.  I submit that the section as it stands does not make any change in the actual procedure adopted up to the present.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 25:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 3, to insert the following section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a conditional order of certiorari has been granted directing the Minister to send before the High Court for the purpose of being quashed a report of the Referee on an application for a service certificate, and</P>
      <P>(b)  the conditional order has been made absolute by an order (in this section referred to as the absolute order) of the High Court made at any time during the period commencing on the 1st day of February, 1945, and ending on the date of the passing of this Act,</P>
      <P>then, whether or not any further order or orders to quash the said report or allowing costs or otherwise is or are made (whether before or after the passing of this Act) in the matter by the High Court, the following provisions shall have effect&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the Minister may, nothwithstanding any rule of court, appeal, within 28 days after the date of the passing of this Act, to the Supreme Court against the absolute order and such further order or orders (if any),</P>
      <P>(ii)  if the Minister so appeals and the appeal is allowed, no costs in the High Court or the Supreme Court shall be awarded to, or recoverable from the Minister by, the prosecutor, but the Supreme Court may make such order as it thinks fit for the payment to the Minister by the prosecutor of the costs of the Minister in the High Court or the Supreme Court or in both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2, sub-section (9) deals with reports quashed before the 1st February, 1945, and prescribes explicitly <Col N="641" /> that the case must be reinvestigated in accordance with strict legal procedure and that the State will bear plaintiff's costs.  It also prescribes that where reports are quashed after the 1st February, 1945, they will not be reinvestigated.  It leaves open the question of costs in such cases.  The new section prescribes that where reports are quashed between the 1st February, 1945, and the passing of the Act the costs both of plaintiff and the State will be recoverable by appeal to the Supreme Court within 28 days of the passing of the Act.</P>

      <P>The Minister, having refused to accept any amendment at any stage, now comes in with this, to take the last little bit from the applicant.  His whole case was that the reason for the Bill at all was the huge cost that was going to be involved.  In this amendment he has no thought whatever about what costs the applicant may be involved in.  The applicant, no matter what his rights are, no matter what the equities of his case may be, if he succeeds in court, will not get his costs.  That is an extraordinary development, an extraordinary situation. Of course, the number of cases that could come in between the 1st February and the passing of the Act is very small.  I presume that nothing that this Act can do can stop the person from applying to the High Court, on other grounds, to have an order quashed but, if he does apply and if he gets a decision in his favour, the Minister can go to the Supreme Court within so many days and have the State relieved of the costs.  The applicant will then have the grievance of financial loss in addition to whatever other grievance he may have.  I cannot accept this amendment and I ask the House not to pass it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an extraordinary piece of <i>ad hoc</i> legislation. As Deputy MacEoin has pointed out, and as we have all pointed out, the case made by the Minister all along has been that if he were to give way on the question of the date&mdash;1st February, <Col N="642" /> 1945&mdash;the courts would be inundated and the costs would reach astronomical figures.  Now we have the Minister by this amendment endeavouring to preclude the applicant from getting his costs, if he succeeds in getting his order.  It is, to my mind, a most unwarrantable interference with the right of any citizen who is involved in litigation. It is deliberate interference by the State with the right of the courts to grant costs as they have always granted them to a successful litigant. It goes so far as to say that, whether or not the court grants costs, the Minister may apply to have his costs collected from the prosecutor of the claim.</P>
      <P>This is on a par with the legislation that we have been getting in this House since I came into it.  Every Bill that we get introduces some extraordinary claim on the part of the State.  The State's interests are paramount. The citizen has no rights whatever when it comes to his testing his claim <i>vis-á-vis</i> the State.  I do not know how far this House will continue to accept passively legislation of this type.  I seriously suggest to members of the Government Party that they ought to sit up and think seriously, and put on their considering caps, because we are drifting in this matter into legislative interference not only with the courts, but with the citizens; drifting towards the type of situation there was in Italy when Fascism came into power, and in Germany under National Socialism.  The State is paramount. The citizen does not count; he only exists for the State.  The State is right all the time.  That is the mentality that is percolating through this type of legislation.  It is most reprehensible legislation.  Here the Minister comes along and goes so far as to anticipate that applications may be made to the courts, and, in case his anticipations are correct and well-founded, he wants to ensure that successful litigants will not get their costs.  Words fail me to condemn this in anything like the manner in which it should be condemned.</P>

      <P>The legislation enshrined in this particular provision is directed to circumventing any citizens who have legitimate claims, such legitimate claims as in their opinion warrant their being heard by a court of law. It is designed to make it impossible for these people to pursue their claims. The trend of this type of legislation is to vest in officialdom the juridical powers of the courts.  That is a tendency and a trend which I have repeatedly resisted and which I intend to continue to resist.  I think it is a deplorable development.  We are following on the lines of Fascism and National Socialism in all this type of legislation.  The Government come to this House with a skeleton Bill.  Rarely do they enshrine any legal principles even in that Bill.  They proceed under the Bill to hand over to the particular Minister introducing it the power to legislate by decree or by Order.  That is what happened in Italy; that is what happened in Germany.  That is why we had a debacle on the Continent of Europe.  In these countries the people were pushed aside; the rights and responsibilities of the people were filched from them and handed over to an usurping officialdom; an officialdom which trampled on the rights of the people and, in turn, produced its own reactions; an officialdom which eventually identified itself with the State; the Party in power for the time being constituting itself as the State and officialdom falling into line with that Party, with all clashing or conflicting interests pushed to one side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what we are getting in this <Col N="644" /> Bill.  That is what we got in the Drainage Bill and in the Customs Bill. It looks as if the Party on the Government benches are committed to handing over the powers of this House, and their own powers for that matter, lock, stock, and barrel to officialdom.  I say seriously to the members on the Government Benches that that is a tendency which, very soon in their careers, they will have to sit up and think about, unless they are embarking on a deliberate policy of producing the reactions produced in Italy and in Germany in this State here.</P>
    <P>I believe the majority of the Government Party are not so inclined.  I believe that they are democratically inclined.  I believe, too, that they are being whipped into line on these matters because they are allowed no voice by the Minister.  The Party Whips are put on on all occasions and they have to step into line.</P>
    <P>Sooner or later, and I seriously suggest sooner than later, the members of the Party opposite will have to consider whether, in turn, they will not have to hand over their entire powers, even within the Party, to the particular Minister who demands them for the time being.  That is in fact what they are doing now.  That is what they did in all the recent pieces of legislation that we had.  I cannot condemn it any more strongly than I have been doing. <i>Ad hoc</i> legislation of this type is roundly condemned by every democratic and free-thinking citizen in every country.</P>
    <P>Retroactive legislation is, if not unconstitutional, definitely sailing very near to the wind of unconstitutionality. It amounts to this, that the rights of a citizen who has a case to contest with the State are filched from him by officialdom stepping in, in advance, to prevent his establishing these rights before the courts of the country.  As I said on the Second Reading of the Bill, in litigation between the citizen and the State, the citizen comes last, last all the time.  The State steps in, asserts its prerogative and &ldquo;carts&rdquo; the citizen.  I really do not think that the members of the Government Party are quite happy in this matter.  If <Col N="645" /> they are, then we can only come to the conclusion that they are deliberately embarking on a campaign of dictatorship in this country, because they are simply using the cover of legislation in this House to assert dictatorial principles.  That is what it amounts to. I go so far as deliberately to say that whether or not orders are got, the Minister is going to have his rights and the prosecutor is not going, to have his costs.  That is what it amounts to in a nutshell.</P>
    <P>I think that is a most reprehensible feature of this section.  The Minister has made no case for it and I would ask him in all seriousness to withdraw it.  I think already he has ample powers and I do not see why he must feel that the courts will be inundated with cases.  He may have special information about these matters but, if so, he should put the House in possession of that information.  To my mind no abnormal number of cases will be rushed into the courts because a particular door is left open.  No door is, in fact, being left open in this Bill that would justify the Minister's fears as to an excessive number of cases.  He wants to close every possible door against these people, to slam the door in their faces and to make sure that these citizens will not be in a position to assert their rights before a court of law.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to continue on these lines but I think this is a most reprehensible type of legislation; it is a type of development we in this House on all sides should deplore.  I feel sure that if the Minister left the question to an open vote, he would not have a member of his Party supporting him in this type of legislation.  It is bound in any event to produce its own reactions.  If this type of legislation is to be persisted in, the time will come when the citizens of this country will have to get some redress through other courts, through a system of administrative law such as they have in France.  If you are going to set up a new machinery of administrative law, then deliberately come into this House and say that you are doing that and that as regards these cases, the citizen will not have the right of redress in ordinary <Col N="646" /> courts.  That he will have to get some redress, goes without saying.  I suggest that that redress can only come about through the setting up of administrative courts where, when the citizen finds himself in conflict with officialdom, he can go and have his case thrashed out.</P>
    <P>When I say that administrative courts should be set up, I mean that not only should we set up administrative courts to enable a citizen to have his case thrashed out against the particular official dealing with him in a particular case but that these courts should be established on some principles of administrative law, not on the haphazard system we get here of introducing a particular bush for a particular legal gap which the State finds it inconvenient to leave open.  The citizen will have to get redress by some means which I shall call, for the time being, administrative law.  Some new court will have to be set up to enable him to assert his rights; otherwise you are going to have legal chaos here in a short time.</P>

      <P>The Minister previously asked us to try to bring forward some solution for cases affected by this Bill and, no doubt, the Minister has found a solution.  No doubt the solution is that provided for in this section, a section which provides that people who are not financially in a position to bring forward their cases will be deprived of any opportunity of doing so because they are not going to get any expenses.  The problem is well solved now!  Those of them who cannot afford to find the money to fight their case are wholly barred by reason of that fact from bringing their claims forward.  I wonder if such a principle was ever heard of before in this country?  It is an old-established principle in law that when you win your case you generally get your expenses.</P>

If it were <Col N="647" /> not for the legal advisers of the Old I.R.A. the Minister would not be where he is to-day, defending the most undemocratic Bill that was ever put before any House.  In my opinion, the Bill is the limit in unconstitutionality. No such measure was ever heard of in this country as the Minister is trying to get through to-day.  It interferes in my opinion with the Constitutional rights, not alone of the Old I.R.A., but of the ordinary citizens of this country.  It is something that can be used against every citizen of the country, for no matter how strong a case a citizen may have against the State, if he is financially embarrassed he is prevented by legislation of this kind from bringing his case before the courts.  Undoubtedly this will solve the problem for which the Minister asked a solution.  The mentality of Deputies who are not here to listen to the debate, but who will crowd in when the bell rings to walk like a flock of sheep behind the Minister&mdash;the mentality of public representatives such as those is one that baffles understanding.  I did not intend to say anything on this Bill as I thought I would treat it with contempt, but undoubtedly the section brought in by the Minister is one that is the limit, in my opinion, to consistency, to decency and to democracy in this country.  You may talk about dictatorship but nothing that I ever heard in my life could beat this for dictation.  Remember it will go down in history as being the foulest and rottenest Act that ever came before any Parliament in Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="648" /> That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £450,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1945, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Supplies, including payment of certain Subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>The necessity for this additional sum arises out of a deficiency in the provision for food subsidies.  The total deficiency in the amount voted by the Dáil was £810,000, but the amount now required is reduced to £450,000 by reason of savings which were effected upon other sub-heads, to which I will refer later.</P>
    <P>The main cause of the deficiency in the provision for food subsidies was the necessity which developed during the year of reducing the millers' price for offals below the amount at which it was assumed at the beginning of the year that the millers would be able to sell offals.  The House will remember that when the supply of offals was made available, a price ex-mill of £17 10s. 0d. per ton was fixed.  When the Estimate was being prepared, it was assumed that the 72,000 tons of offals which would be produced during the year would be disposed of by the millers at £17 10s. 0d. per ton.  In fact, only a very small quantity of offals was disposed of at that price, and after some weeks the price was reduced to £15 per ton.  Even at that lower price, only about 6,000 tons were sold, and as the offals were accumulating in the stores of millers and wholesale and retail distributors of offals, it was decided to bring the millers' price down to £10 per ton, at which price the offals were freely disposed of.  That price is still being maintained.  The disposal of 72,000 tons of offals mainly at £7 10s. 0d. per ton less than was originally assumed resulted in a decrease of £510,000 in the amount received by the millers. As the millers were not allowed to increase the price of flour, by reason of Government policy, it became necessary to adjust the allocation price of imported wheat to millers to enable that loss to be recovered.  The House is, I think, aware of the fact that the <Col N="649" /> price of flour and other mill products is regulated through the price of imported grain.  Grain Importers, Limited, allocate the grain to millers at the price fixed by the Government, and any loss incurred by Grain Importers, Limited, in allocating wheat at that price is made good by this subsidy.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the second heading under which a deficiency occurs. The House will appreciate that the determination of the proper allocation price for imported grain is a matter of some difficulty, because there is a number of variable factors.  There are changes made from time to time in the percentage of imported wheat used in the millers' grist.  There have been changes during the year in the flour extraction, and some changes in the cost of production.  One of the most important items, however, is what is known as overweight.  Just as native wheat has to be dried before it is in a proper condition for milling, so imported wheat has to have water added to it before it is suitable for milling. In the past, that overweight allowance was found to be about 2.86 per cent., representing 2/1 in the sack of flour. During last year, however, we imported mainly No. 3 Manitoba wheat, instead of No. 1 Manitoba wheat, which was the type we had previously imported, and the moisture content of the No. 3 Manitoba wheat is higher than that of No. 1.  When the results of the milling operations during the cereal year which ended in October last were available, it was found that the actual overweight percentage was only .27, representing approximately 2½d. per sack.  There was, therefore, a deficiency of about £310,000, which has to be rectified by another alteration in the allocation price of imported wheat. Those two figures, £300,000 in respect of overweight allowance and £510,000 in respect of the reduction in the millers' price for offals, represent the total deficiency upon the Vote for food subsidies of £810,000.</P>
    <P>Against that £810,000, however, there were certain savings.  By reason of the fact that we imported substantially more No. 3 Manitoba than No. 1. there was a reduction in the price we had to <Col N="650" /> pay for wheat, Manitoba No. 3 being cheaper than Manitoba No. 1.  The wheat importation programme contemplated considerable imports of Plate wheat, which costs us more in present circumstances than wheat imported direct from the North American Continent. It was not possible to complete the programme in respect of Plate wheat, so a higher proportion of North American wheat had to be procured, and there was a saving in consequence. The main reduction, however, in the loss in allocating wheat is due to reductions in the freight and insurance charges.  It may interest the House to know that the present cost of Canadian wheat landed at one of the four main ports of this country is £20 7s. 10½d. per ton, as against £25 18s. 10d. in August, 1942, although since August, 1942, the purchase price of wheat has increased from £8 7s. 3d. per ton to £13 15s. 8d. per ton.  It will be obvious, therefore, that the reductions in freight and insurance charges have brought down the price of wheat by approximately £10 per ton.  The total saving arising out of that cause was £135,000. There was a reduction of £10,000 in the amount provided for wheat meal subsidy, due to the fact that not all wheat meal millers claimed the subsidy.  The saving there, as I said, was £10,000. There was a saving of £15,000 in respect of tea, due to the fact that when the increase in the ration was effected towards the end of last year it was decided to use for the purpose stocks of tea held by wholesalers, to some extent, in preference to providing for the purpose of the extra ration stocks held by tea Importers Limited. The reduction in the loss to Tea Importers by reason of that decision was £15,000.  The other and principal saving was £200,000 in respect of turf subsidy, which is due almost entirely to the decision not to proceed with the construction of additional turf camps during the financial year.  These various savings reduced the amount required from £810,000, which was the deficiency in the amount voted for food subsidies, to the £450,000 now asked for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. H.M. Dockrell Mr. H.M. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate contains some extraordinary figures, <Col N="651" /> and I do not know that the Minister's explanation covers the whole thing. The Minister has spoken of the £650,000 extra required for imported wheat, or rather to make up the loss on the sale of offals and the loss in the overweight.  I have a recollection that, at the time the offals price was reduced, some people who were distributing offals were very badly let down, or thought they were let down, by the Government, having just bought their quota of offals at the full price.  I know that at the time they could not obtain a refund.  I do not know whether the Minister was later on able to satisfy them, but it seems to me that it is a very bad policy for a Government, when they are trading, to load up the distributor just before there is a fall in the price of the stuff. It seems to me that somebody made a bad mistake, when arranging the Estimates for the year, when this point about offals could not be foreseen.</P>
      <P>The next thing one comes to is the saving of £200,000.  You have to read that saving in conjunction with the previous Supplementary Estimate showing £342,000 of an increase.  The £342,000 was put down then to cover an increase under the fuel subsidy and an increase under sub-head K (1)&mdash; that is, turf development, of £142,000. Immediately afterwards the Minister comes along and finds he can make a saving of £200,000, so that the increase of £142,000 becomes a saving of £58,000 nett.  That is all to the good.  The Minister has mentioned that the saving was largely brought about by the decision which was arrived at not to go in for additional turf camps.  The Minister was probably very wise in that, but that brings one on to consider what the position with regard to turf will be for the rest of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year, on an Estimate such as this, I invited the Minister to give us some idea of what a ton of turf was costing the country.  I suggested at that time that the ordinary person in Dublin pays £3 5s. for a ton of turf and that there was, roughly, a loss to Fuel Importers and to county councils of <Col N="652" /> something like £2 10s. per ton of turf divided between the two of them.  That would bring the cost of a ton of turf to £5 15s.  It used to be argued that 2¼ tons of turf were equal to a ton of coal.  Tossing up those two figures, it brings one to a price of £12 18s. 9d.&mdash; call it £13&mdash;for 2¼ tons of turf, the equivalent of a ton of coal.  The Minister will probably say to me that that is all very good, but that he cannot get a ton of coal, and I quite agree with him.  When you cannot get coal you must do the next best thing, and probably turf is the next best thing.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister made any calculation or tried to find out when coal will be available?  I would like to suggest that most people think that the price of coal will not continue at £13 per ton for very much longer, because that is what it works out to in practice. Perhaps the Minister could give us the cost to the country of a ton of turf, and also say whether any effort has been made to bring the expenditure on turf to some sort of a conclusion, and whether stocks will be at a reasonable figure and will not all have dissolved under the weather when coal does appear on this market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the fixing of the price of wheat offals, the Minister claimed that a very substantial loss was made owing to the fact that the price of wheat offals had to be reduced.  Who advised the Minister to fix a price of £17 per ton for wheat offals, having regard to the fact that events proved that they could not be disposed of at this price, which had to be reduced later to £15 and later still to £10?  The effect of these drastic reductions was very disconcerting to everybody engaged in the trade, and the position at the present time is that wheat offals cannot be obtained at any price.</P>
      <P>There is a very serious shortage of wheat offals in the country and the question we have to consider now is whether the Minister was wrong in fixing £17 a ton, or whether he was more wrong in reducing the price to £10 per ton.  Anyhow, it seems as if the situation has been badly bungled, because feeding stuffs are unobtainable at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="653" /> I should also like to know who is intended to benefit by this flour subsidy. I presume it is the consumer, but there has been a tendency to represent this subsidy as a Vote for the benefit of the farming community.  I should like to point out to the Minister that, in 1943-44, we produced 6,586,000 cwts. of wheat from 509,000 acres.  That represents something less than 13 cwts. per acre which, at £1 2s. per cwt., the fixed price, gave a gross return of £14 6s. per statute acre.  Nobody will dare to suggest that that is a very high return, nor do I think it can be seriously contended that, on the basis of present costings, wheat can be produced economically at £14 6s. per acre. The costs of production, if worked out, would be very considerably more than that.</P>
    <P>A point of great interest to all Deputies was that credit was taken for the addition of £300,000 worth of water to imported wheat.  I think that was the position the Minister made clear, and the fact that this amount of water has to be added to imported wheat, in order perhaps to make it palatable to our people, is a very interesting point for consumers and the general public. I suggest that this whole question ought to be reviewed in the light of the continuous changes which have taken place in regard to prices and profit.  Some very clear and definite investigation should be made into the profits being secured by those engaged in the milling industry.  There is no doubt whatever that, if investigations are carried out, it will be revealed that the profits of those engaged in milling wheat are very considerably higher than the remuneration afforded to those who actually grow the wheat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>But it goes to all wheat producers.  It goes to millers really and is supposed to drift down to all the wheat producers.  The point in respect of which I should like to get some clarity is what percentage of the whole subsidy goes to the firm of J.V. Rank and Co.?  It is a rather peculiar contrast that this is introduced by way of a slide-over from a piece of legislation intended to prevent members of the I.R.A., not from getting pensions but from having their cases adjudicated upon by a tribunal which the House established to certify as to whether there was active service and so on.  We shift over from that discussion to being very delicate in respect of the amount of money which is said to flow down to those who produce wheat.  What Deputy Cogan said is perfectly correct.  Whatever may be the effect on consumers, there is no doubt that a fair amount of the subsidy sticks on the way down and the Minister should be in a position to tell us what is the average rate of profit made by those engaged in milling flour here.  The Minister ought particularly to be able to tell us what amount of the subsidy eventually goes out of this country to Joseph Rank and Co.</P>
      <P>Deputies need not be reminded of what a Government commission found out with regard to that particular company&mdash;that people were able to come into this country, to buy up certain concerns for a certain amount of money and eventually to off-load the concern on to the Irish public for something in the neighbourhood of £200,000, that is, not merely to recoup their capital expenditure but to get a gift of about £200,000 and, at the same time, to have control and more than half the dividends for nothing, for no capital involvement, their original capital having been repaid and they having got something like a couple of hundred thousand pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made efforts from time to <Col N="655" /> time to find out what percentage of this subsidy sticks to the firm of Rank on the way down, because when we discover that we shall be able to find out how much goes to those people in Ranks (Ireland), Limited, who have nothing whatever to do with this country but who, by holding on to the control and the majority of the dividends of the company, are enabled to put money into their pockets over and beyond their capital expenditure and over and beyond the present of a couple of hundred thousand pounds this country made to them.  I think that is a figure the public are entitled to know.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when I asked questions, said that the money is distributed by Grain Importers (Éire), Limited, and he apparently is in the dark as to who are the beneficiaries under it.  I think that with regard to very big units, as some of the milling units are, it is quite easy to discover, if the Minister cared to do so, what amount of this subsidy is being paid on bread stuffs which goes to outside concerns, and particularly to an outside concern which has already taken back all the money put into it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

Was it only recently or has it been in operation for some time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point mentioned by Deputy Cogan, a number of retailers felt a certain amount of dismay by reason of the manner in which the price of offals was suddenly reduced practically immediately after they had purchased quantities of them.  I do not know whether it is possible to recoup these people&mdash;I presume <Col N="656" /> it is not&mdash;but in future if this difficulty arises&mdash;possibly the price fixed now will remain fixed for some time&mdash;some notice should be given to these people before the reduction takes place.  I can visualise the difficulty that, if people are warned that a reduction is likely to take place, no one will buy the stuff, but, on the other hand, if these people are to be faced with a loss of anything from £2 to £7 per ton, it could mean a substantial sum to a large business.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister with regard to the commissioned mills, that is to say mills which previous to their being made subject to complete control could take some offals from the wheat, to consider the position of farmers who send their wheat to those mills to be ground.  They are under an unfair handicap in view of the fact that offals, as Deputy Cogan has said, are now practically unprocurable.  They cannot have the offals that used formerly be taken from the wheat.  They are not available to them owing to the restrictions. I would ask the Minister, if it is possible, that the restrictions in that respect should be withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A question was asked as to the effect on the distributors of offals of the decision to reduce the price from the level at which it was originally fixed to one substantially lower.  It is true that these distributors claimed compensation for whatever loss they may have incurred on the stocks they had in hands.  I did not admit that claim.  I would regard it as a fair commercial risk, one to which these traders would ordinarily be subject in normal times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart, however, from that argument, there is the fact that when the millers' price of offals supplied to the distributors was £17 10s. per ton, we fixed the maximum retail selling price at £18 10s. per ton, which allowed a narrow margin for the wholesale and retail distributors.  When the millers' price was reduced to £10 a ton, there was no maximum retail price fixed. That permitted the price of offals <Col N="657" /> to be determined, in particular localities, by the conditions prevailing there, and, as everybody knows, the most important condition is the prevailing price of oats.  An examination of the retail prices at which offals are being sold indicates that they are generally reasonable, having regard to the prices which the distributors pay. I would not, therefore, be prepared to admit that the distributors of offals have any claim for compensation arising out of the reduction in their prices, any more than they would admit liability to tax if the circumstances during the present year should necessitate an increase in the price of offals which would permit them to secure extra profits upon whatever quantities may be in stock at the time.</P>
    <P>The price of offals was fixed at £17 10s. per ton in consultation with the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Finance.  The Department of Finance had a very lively interest in the price we fixed because, of course, that price determined the amount of the subsidy which had to be provided.  The Department of Agriculture was concerned because it was anxious to secure that the offals would be available to the farmers at a reasonable price, and particularly a price which would be related to the cost of other feeding stuffs on the market.  When the price was originally fixed oats were much dearer than they subsequently became, and the inability to dispose of offals was attributed to the decline that took place in the price of oats last year.  I think that at any time the price of wheaten offals will have to be related to the prevailing price of oats.  It is not, of course, true to say that wheaten offals cannot be procured.  The production of wheaten offals has reached 1,200 tons per week.  These offals are being distributed to the different localities in accordance with a scheme prepared by the distributors themselves, a scheme designed to ensure that every trader and every locality will get a fair share of the available supply.  The stocks in the hands of traders may have been dissipated by reason of the growth in the demand for offals.  The normal output of offals will <Col N="658" /> continue as long as the present extraction of flour continues.  If we reduce the extraction of flour from wheat we will have more offals, and if we increase it we will have less.  The present output is 1,200 tons per week.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a great deal of misunderstanding concerning the operation of this subsidy.  The whole benefit of this subsidy goes to the consumers of flour and to nobody else. Neither Messrs.  Rank &amp; Company Limited, nor any other wheat miller gets a penny of the subsidy.  Any alteration in the subsidy will have to be reflected in the price charged for bread or flour.  If there is a saving in the cost of wheat, as there was in the case of imported wheat, the benefit of that saving is secured by the Exchequer.  If there was a rise in the price of imported wheat which involved a heavier cost, then the Exchequer would have to provide more.  The Government fixes the price at which flour and bread may be sold.  It fixes the price at which imported wheat is delivered to the millers, and it relates these prices one to the other, and sees that the profits made by the millers will be reasonable.  The profits, over the costs of production, are carefully checked by the officers of the Department of Supplies.  There is, therefore, no relationship between the amount of the subsidy provided and the profit made by the millers.  The amount of the subsidy is determined solely by the price at which imported wheat has to be made available to the millers to enable flour and bread to be sold at the prices we have determined.  There is no need therefore, as Deputy Cogan has suggested, to investigate the profits made by the millers.  We know what these profits are.  The millers are allowed a return of 6 per cent. on the capital actually employed in flour milling or in financing the purchase of the native wheat crop.  That capital sum is taken at £4,000,000.  In determining the allocation price of imported wheat a sum is made available to the flour milling industry as a whole which is equivalent to 6 per cent. on an estimated capital of £4,000,000, and the amount, so made available, is distributed amongst the millers by a committee <Col N="659" /> of the millers established by themselves, and in accordance with a formula agreed upon by themselves. The Department of Industry and Commerce was concerned only to ensure, first of all, that the estimate of the amount of the capital actually employed was an accurate one, and, secondly, that the various calculations made as to the cost of milling the wheat into flour were accurate.  It is also concerned to ensure that the amount which would have to be provided by the State as a subsidy to Grain Importers Limited would not be higher than it need be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  If the Deputy will study the information published by the Department of Industry and Commerce, he will find that it does not necessarily follow that the bigger mill benefits by any averaging of costs. Deputy O'Leary asked me a question about a bonus for flour-mill workers. <Col N="660" /> I am speaking at the moment as Minister for Supplies and that question relates to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I should require notice of the question.  I am not aware of any bonus for flour-mill workers, recommended by a tribunal, which has been refused.  Deputy O Briain asked me why commissioned mills were not allowed to produce flour of less than 100 per cent. extraction.  The reason is that these mills are not equipped to produce flour of any pre-determined extraction.  The ordinary licensed mill &mdash;the concern that produces flour for sale&mdash;can adjust its machinery to produce flour of a pre-determined extraction. We can supervise the operation of that mill to ensure that flour of the type prescribed is, in fact, being produced.  But, in the case of the commissioned mill, nobody can say, when the wheat is going into the mill, what percentage, with some extraction of offals from the wheat, the resultant flour will be of the total wheat used.  It is not possible to say in respect of those commissioned mills that they may produce flour of 75 per cent, 80 per cent. or 85 per cent. extraction. They are not equipped to produce flour of any pre-determined extraction, and there would be considerable wastage of wheat if those mills were allowed to extract offals as a result of their milling operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell asked me some questions concerning turf.  I mentioned the sum of £200,000 as representing the saving upon sub-head K (1). I attributed that saving mainly to the decision not to proceed with the construction of additional turf camps.  In fact, the saving upon that head was £144,000.  The difference between that and £200,000 represents savings on other aspects of turf production&mdash; economies which were brought into effect during the year and which reduced the amounts which had to be provided for fuel-subsidy purposes. Deputy Dockrell's calculations concerning the price of turf are in many respects misleading.  When he asks me what the price to the country of a ton of turf is, I find it difficult to understand what he has in mind.  I can tell him the price to the consumer&mdash;the price which the consumer pays&mdash;and <Col N="661" /> add to that the subsidy which the Exchequer pays.  When he asks me what is the cost to the country, I find it hard to give him a figure because I presume that, in determining the cost to the country, one would deduct from the amount realised by the sale of turf the amount paid in wages to workers, because that does not represent a cost to the country.  To put Deputy Dockrell right, I think I should say that if turf were produced and delivered direct to the fuel merchant's yard and from the fuel merchant's yard to the consumer, it could be sold, in most areas, without loss, at the present fixed price for the non-turf area.  However, the Deputy must appreciate that the State is doing more for turf producers than merely producing turf for them.  It is storing that turf for use in the winter when production is impossible and when transport may be difficult.  It is rationing the distribution of that turf, which also involves a storage charge.  A large part of the amount required as subsidy is due to the cost of storage.  Not only are there actual cash charges for putting the turf into store&mdash;the dumps in the Park and dumps in other localities &mdash;and for taking it out of those stores, delivering it to the fuel merchants and subsequently delivering it to the consumers but, in the stores, there is a shrinkage in the weight of the turf. The allowance that has to be made in respect of that shrinkage in weight, due to the evaporation of moisture or the crumbling of the turf into mould, is not less than 20 per cent. of the total value of the turf as it goes into the dump.</P>
    <P>It could be said, therefore, that almost the whole amount of the subsidy for turf in the non-turf area is attributable to the need for those turf stores and the keeping of the turf in those stores so as to facilitate its rationing and secure a supply in winter months.  If we had to carry out the same operations in relation to coal, assuming we could get the coal, the price of coal would be equally enhanced by the addition of corresponding charges.  However, there is no need at this particular moment to go into the economics of turf production. I told Deputy Dockrell before that he could come to no conclusion concerning <Col N="662" /> the economics of turf production on the basis of present experience. Present experience is not a reliable guide.  Our main concern at the moments is to get the turf produced, because we need it.  Cost must be a secondary consideration.  It is being produced by organisations not entirely suitable for the purpose and in circumstances which impose charges which could be avoided in normal times. Certainly, the Deputy's calculation, which brought him a total of £13 10s. as representing the corresponding price for coal, was completely erroneous.</P>

      <P>It must be remembered that a great deal of capital expenditure is necessary on those bogs in order to make it possible to produce turf from them, and that that also applies to the provision of turf camps on the bogs.  The idea of putting these turf camps close to Dublin was almost entirely due to a transport problem, and not to a turf problem.  It was due to the fact that, no matter what quantities of turf could be produced in the western portions of the country, there still remained the question of transport.  Therefore, it was a question of bringing workers from the west to <Col N="665" /> work on the bogs in the east, in order to save the cost of the transport of turf.  So far as the financial calculations arising out of that decision are concerned, it must be borne in mind that we were trying to solve, not a turf-production problem alone, but a transport problem.</P>

In altering the allocation price of imported wheat, Grain Importers, Limited, lose money. If they were to raise the price of imported wheat they would lose less.  So far as the millers are concerned they have to use in their grist the prescribed percentage of native wheat, bought at a fixed price, plus a percentage of imported wheat, which they got at the allocation price.  They get the total grist at a price which enables them to sell flour at the fixed price, having regard to the cost of production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That, in view of the economically disastrous consequences which must ensure if there is a serious decline in the value of agricultural produce after the war, Dáil Eireann is of opinion that a five-year plan should be drafted and promulgated by the Government, which will guarantee remunerative minimum prices for the chief products of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be admitted that this is a very important motion, seeing that the basis of our economic existence depends on the agricultural industry and that that industry depends upon the remuneration which those in it receive.  If those engaged in agriculture are not adequately rewarded for their labour and enterprise it is inevitable that production will decline in volume as well as in efficiency.  This motion seeks to give some security to those engaged in our basic industry over a period of years. We are all familiar with the disastrous consequences that followed the previous European war.  That war produced for agriculture a condition of prosperity for a period of four or five years, but that position came to an end about two years after the termination of the war, when there was a collapse in prices of agricultural produce and of live stock.  The collapse resulted in a drastic reduction in farmers' incomes as well as in the incomes of labourers. Farmers who took live stock to fairs found that they were unsaleable, and <Col N="669" /> after some months had to dispose of them at prices that were little more than 50 per cent. of their value.</P>
    <P>Employers then had to say to their workers: &ldquo;I am cut 50 per cent. in my earnings; you must take a smaller cut.&rdquo;  There followed a rather bitter conflict between agricultural workers and employers.  In some counties the bitterness was more intense than in others, but in all counties it was a state of affairs to be deplored.  If farmers and their workers, instead of accepting a state of affairs that was dictated to them after the war, had united and insisted upon guaranteed remunerative prices for agricultural produce, the deplorable conditions experienced in agriculture during the past 20 years would have been avoided. There would not have been such a reduction in the number of people employed on the land, nor such a decline in agricultural production and efficiency.</P>
    <P>The advantages of having secured prices for agricultural produce should be obvious to everybody.  Such security would mean that agricultural producers could plan with something like the same measure of safety that big manufacturers have when planning their output.  For example, manufacturers of motor cars, tractors or agricultural implements can make a reasonable forecast of the price they are going to obtain, and can thereby plan to pay wages in accordance with such prices.  Farmers have no such security at present.  In Great Britain there has been a continuous agitation during the past few years for secured prices, in order to avoid the conditions which followed the end of the previous great war.  It is realised that if such conditions arise after the present war they may be on a more disastrous scale.  After the first great war a reduction in agricultural prices was followed by a reduction of wages.  At that time the workers were, perhaps, more inclined to accept reductions and to regard them as inevitable than is the case now.  The standard of wages generally is somewhat higher now, and there is certainly a stronger feeling amongst workers against accepting drastic reductions in wages.  In addition <Col N="670" /> to that, we have the marked contrast between the earnings of those engaged in agriculture and the earnings of those engaged in industry and sheltered occupations.  There is hardly any justification for a lower standard of income for the skilled worker in agriculture than there is for the skilled worker in other industry.</P>
    <P>It may be said that these proposals are all right, but the question is, can they be implemented, is it possible to guarantee to the primary producer in this country a reasonably remunerative price over a period of years?  I intend first of all to set out what I consider to be a reasonable basis for fixing prices for agriculture.  The only reasonable basis for fixing agricultural prices must be the costs of production in the industry.  Costs of production must be based, first of all, on a reasonable wage for those engaged in the industry. The question must be approached from that standpoint.  The worker must get a reasonable return for his labour. Having fixed a reasonable wage for the worker, costings must be based upon that wage.  The costs of production having been decided, a reasonable margin of profit must be provided for the farmer, and the price of the commodities must be fixed accordingly.</P>
    <P>It may be said that it is not possible to fix the price of every agricultural product.  I am prepared to agree that it would be extremely difficult to do so.  We are not pressing, in this motion, for the fixing of the price of every product of agriculture.  We suggest that prices should be fixed for the chief products of agriculture, by which we mean mainly the key products.  As far as certain commodities produced for human consumption within this country are concerned, no great difficulty is raised by this motion.  Wheat prices have been fixed for a number of years, and the administrative problem involved in guaranteeing wheat prices is not insurmountable.  It has been possible up to the present to fix prices for wheat for one year in advance.  I maintain&mdash;and I think no reasonable man can dispute&mdash;that it would be equally possible to fix a price for wheat for four or five years in advance.  I do not intend at the moment to discuss <Col N="671" /> the price that has been fixed for wheat, as to whether it is fair or unfair.  I wish broadly to outline the case that it is possible to fix a price for wheat as it is required for the home market. In these circumstances, the price can easily be controlled.  In connection with wheat, the question might naturally arise as to whether or not it should be the policy of the State to continue growing wheat after the war.  I think most reasonable people are of the opinion that we must continue to cultivate a substantial acreage of wheat after the war.</P>
    <P>As long as the people of this country rely upon bread as their principal article of diet, I think it is wise policy to ensure that at all times there will be a sufficient acreage of wheat cultivated in this country to make it possible, even if we do not grow 100 per cent. of our requirements, to expand the acreage up to 100 per cent. of our requirements should an emergency occur.  We must, therefore, face the fact that after the war we shall have a very substantial acreage under wheat.</P>
    <P>The same considerations apply in regard to sugar beet.  At present we are producing, I think, 100 per cent. of our requirements of sugar and there does not seem to be any valid reason why we should not continue to do so in future.</P>
    <P>We find, in relation to the two commodities I have mentioned&mdash;wheat and sugar beet&mdash;that it is possible and easy for the State to fix a guaranteed remunerative price, not only for one year, but for a period of years.  But a guaranteed price for wheat and sugar beet only would not go very far in giving the farmers of this country economic security.  The total area required in order to supply 100 per cent. of our requirements in both sugar beet and wheat would be less than 800,000 acres.  That is only a comparatively small fraction of our total agricultural land.  There are something in the neighbourhood of 15,000,000 acres of land. including agricultural and grazing land.  If we are going to provide security for the farmer only in <Col N="672" /> relation to the produce of 800,000 acres, we will not give the farmer economic security or safeguard him against the risk of huge loss which might follow from a collapse in the price of, say, agricultural exports.  We must go further and, I maintain, the next step is to consider dairy produce.  The production of butter, milk, etc., forms a large proportion of our agricultural industry.  They are commodities for which there is a huge and, I think, a growing home market.  As far as milk for home consumption is concerned, there ought not to be any difficulty whatever in fixing a price for a long term.  At present, we have fixed prices for milk supplied to the larger towns and cities and that does not involve any great difficulty.  With regard to butter, it is possible and probable that we shall have a surplus for export and in considering this question we must try to devise ways and means of maintaining the price at a remunerative level.  No matter how far production is expanded, our exportable surplus will be only a fraction of the total output.</P>
    <P>We have to see that the price of that exportable surplus, if it declines, does not pull down the price of butter on the home market and leave the producer without a possible chance of getting a profit.  Therefore, it will be necessary, by some means or other, to create a fund to stabilise the price of any butter which may be exported.  In this connection, of course, we shall always have to have regard to a number of important considerations.  If the State is called upon to supplement the price of butter, owing to the fact that the price of the exportable surplus is low, the first consideration will always be whether or not it is desirable to export butter.  A decision on this matter would have to be taken, bearing in mind the price obtained for the butter in the external market and also other considerations, such as the necessity for exporting butter in order to import some other commodity in return; because it is almost inevitable that in the post-war period there will be a certain amount of barter in regard to external trade.  Therefore, a decision in regard to whether or not we should export will have to rest, first, upon the price we obtain and, secondly, on the <Col N="673" /> value of the goods we get in exchange.</P>
    <P>What is true of butter is equally true of bacon pigs.  We are not at present producing a sufficient amount of bacon for export; but we have reasonable ground to hope that we will have a substantial exportable surplus in the post-war period.  Here again it will be necessary to ensure that the price of the exportable surplus does not pull down the price in the home market. Therefore, it will be necessary to create a fund to be used, when necessary, to stabilise the price of bacon. I want to make it clear that the stabilising of the price of bacon pigs and dairy produce will go a long way towards ensuring stability of income for the farmer, because the dairy industry and the pig raising industry are consumers of a very large proportion of the produce of agriculture.</P>
    <P>I am not one of those who suggest that everything produced on the land should carry a guaranteed price.  For example, I am not suggesting that tillage produce required as feeding stuff for live stock should command a guaranteed price.  We have demands from time to time for guaranteed prices for tillage products which are used mainly as feeding stuff for cattle and pigs.  I do not think those demands can be sustained or should be met by the State.  If the farmer is unable to obtain good prices or reasonable prices for certain tillage products and has the alternative of turning these particular products into butter or bacon or eggs and getting a decent price for those products, then he has nothing serious to complain about.  That is why we hold that dairy produce should certainly be guaranteed in regard to price, and that bacon pigs should also carry a guaranteed price.  I think the same considerations apply in regard to eggs.  I am not suggesting that every branch of the poultry industry should be adequately protected; but eggs, at any rate, as the chief product of the poultry industry, should carry a guaranteed price.</P>
    <P>It will be noticed that I have left out of this list two of what would be regarded as the most important products of agriculture, namely, cattle&mdash; fat cattle and store cattle&mdash;and sheep. <Col N="674" /> I have left these out for the moment. So far as cattle are concerned, I hold that a long step will be taken towards assisting the cattle-raising industry by ensuring that dairy produce is safeguarded. With regard to sheep, I hold also that it would be a difficult matter to have a guaranteed price in regard to this form of live stock.  I think, however, that there would be no difficulty about guaranteeing a price for wool.  Wool is a product required in industry, and required to a very substantial extent in industry within this country.  Just as people who manufacture wool into clothing are adequately protected and assured of a reasonable profit and their interests are in every way safeguarded, the farmer who keeps the sheep that produce the wool is entitled to the same measure of protection.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I come to deal with barley and oats.  I have pointed out that barley and oats are required to a very large extent as feeding stuff for live stock; but a percentage of both of these cereal crops is required for human consumption.  Barley is required to a considerable extent in the brewing and distilling industry.  Oats are required to a very considerable extent in the milling industry for human use.  The point which I want to make in regard to these two crops is that it would not be possible for the State to guarantee a price for an unlimited acreage of oats or barley; but it might be worth while considering the desirability of fixing a price for the limited acreage.  For instance, a certain number of farmers in a district eminently suitable for barley growing would contract to grow barley for the brewing and distilling industry. They would enter into a definite contract for a certain acreage and they would be assured of a price for their product, just the same as the beet growers are assured of a price.  The same would apply to oats for milling. It should be possible to segregate certain areas, particularly areas where the land is inferior and where it is difficult to grow wheat profitably.  In such areas the farmers might be allowed to contract to grow oats for the milling industry and have the security of a guaranteed price.</P>
    <P>If the various products of the agricultural <Col N="675" /> industry which I have named are assured of a reasonable price over a certain number of years, say five years, I think we will have a certain safeguard against a disastrous decline in agricultural income, and that is what we have to secure at any cost, no matter how great the difficulties are. We may be told that the country could not afford such a scheme.  I assert that the country cannot afford to allow the agricultural industry to sink into the condition in which it was before the present war.</P>
    <P>Another point which I should like to emphasise in regard to security of price is that it would make for a higher standard of efficiency in the industry.  For example, if there is security in regard to the price of wheat, we can hope to get improved varieties of seed, and, which is more important, greater efficiency in production.  The same observation apply even to a greater extent in regard to dairy produce, because dairying is a long-term industry, and the man who wants to engage in the production of either milk or butter has to plan many years ahead.  It will take many years to build up a dairy herd, and, unless there is reasonable security, the farmer cannot go all-out to get the best dairy cows and build up a most efficient herd.  I had experience in my own district of a creamery established in 1929 or 1930. A number of farmers put their capital into the building of the creamery, and also into the purchase of dairy herds to supply that creamery.  I found that in a few years they were selling off their dairy herds at less than half the price that in some cases they had paid for them, because the price of butter had collapsed in the meantime and the whole business was uneconomic.  You cannot have efficiency in an industry while you have violent fluctuations in price.</P>
    <P>Another consideration is that violent fluctuations in price lead to extensive profiteering.  As long as farmers are engaged in producing in an isolated way throughout the country, they are always at a disadvantage in regard to price fluctuations, because they are the <Col N="676" /> last people who get inside information as to the trend of prices.  Cattle dealers and people closely associated with the cattle trade can always know what way prices are tending.  The same applies to corn, wool, and practically every product of the land.  The producer is the last person to know what way markets are tending and he is at a disadvantage. In addition to that, there is the fact that these fluctuations enable the middleman to extract a much larger rake-off than if prices were stabilised, because he can always deceive the producer and the consumer. He can quote to the consumer the peak price which has been paid to the producer as the average price.  In that way he can rake off an excessive price which would not be possible if the price were stabilised.  I recommend the motion to the House.  I think that if accepted it will go a long way towards putting the agricultural industry on a firmer foundation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great pleasure in seconding the motion.  Within the past few days, some facts have been brought closely under my notice.  In Tipperary we have always carried on a mixed type of agriculture.  Even in normal times, in the light lands of South Tipperary we did not go in for such intensive creamery production as the farmers in the Golden Vale area, so that mixed agriculture is nothing new to us.  As I say, within the last few days my attention has been drawn by some neighbours to the impossibility of getting agricultural workers. I should like to direct the Minister's attention to that fact.  At the moment I could place 100 men in about five parishes in my immediate area.  I congratulate the Minister on the migratory scheme which he brought into operation last year.  I think it was I who first suggested it to him and it has been a great success.  I am sure this is perfectly in order at the moment. Three men have recently written to me in regard to this matter and they told me that although they inserted advertisements in the daily and local papers, they did not get a single application. The question of the demobilisation of the Army was recently discussed in this House and on the motion <Col N="677" /> for the adjournment it was suggested by Deputy Cosgrave that men demobilised from the Army should be sent back to areas from which they were recruited with a view to getting employment in these areas.  I could do with two men myself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>So far on the question of labour.  Speaking of mixed farming, I should like to direct the Minister's attention to the beet question. The production of beet is a big problem at the moment.  I may be told that the Sugar Company is a commercial enterprise and that the Minister has nothing to do with it, but I should like the Minister to try to get some idea from them as to the amount of beet they are going to get in the coming year.  I do not think that the contracts are filling in as well as last year.  The people are very anxious to grow beet in order to assure our sugar supply, but what we are getting out of it to-day does not give us a return commensurate with the expense. There is a declining return from the crop owing to the lack of artificial manures.  The tendency in my area is to reduce the area under cultivation by one-half or one-third of last year's area.  I think that when the declaration comes from the Beet Company it will show that there is a very large reduction in the area under cultivation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may tell me that this is a commercial company, but I should <Col N="678" /> like him to deal with this question from the commercial point of view and the farmers' point of view also.  In order to qualify for the maximum price, beet must have a sugar content of 17.5.  I saw a quantity of beet thrown by a ditch on the roadside. There were five loads in it and the sugar content came down a unit in the five successive loads.  I am not suggesting that there is anything but a fair test of the beet carried out in the various factories, but it is a mystery to me how these variations occur.  The 17.5 per cent. is reached perhaps in one load in every 50.  I think that the average sugar content would be about 15.  I wish the Minister would pay more attention to this question.  We have not got the returns yet but let us assume that it takes six tons of beet with a sugar content of 15.5 to make a ton of sugar.  Between carriage and the washing of the beet we have to pay about 9/-.  We may send it in with a lot of clay attached.  In Tuam they have only to pay 6/- in respect of these charges.  As I say, it takes six tons of beet to make a ton of sugar.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>It takes more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It would possibly take more.  Six tons at 15.5 sugar content would bring me approximately to 100.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, with the low content this year, the average grower gets about £3 9s.; that is £24 or £25 for the seven tons.  What is the consumer paying?  He is paying £65 8s. I would suggest right off that sugar at 1/- a lb. would not be too dear.  You can coupon it out to the poor people at 4d. or 5d. a lb.  If you had sugar at 1/- a lb. on the top of the McGillicuddy Reeks, at Galtymore or the middle of the Bog of Allen, and a whisper came through that doorway that it was there, there would be nobody here listening to me.  The lame, the halt and the blind would wend their way to <Col N="679" /> those inaccessible places.  If we had enough sugar, we would have confectionery and jam, instead of seeing all the fruit going to waste.  It is said that money will get you anywhere except into Heaven, but there are many things it will not buy at the moment.  If the price of beet were a little higher, there would be more sugar available for confectionery and jam.  As things are at the moment, you will find that two-thirds of the beet quota will not be filled in this year.  It is not a paying proposition, with the declining returns owing to lack of artificial manure.  We want to feed the poor people, and not have anybody hungry in this country.  I would suggest £4 5s. a ton for beet, and all we get at the moment is £3 9s. or £3 10s. Take sugar at the moment at 7d. a lb., and add a quarter to that, that is 1¾d. I would suggest 8¾d. a lb. for sugar and £4 5s. a ton for beet grown remote from or adjacent to the factories.  You can coupon the sugar out to the poor people if you like.  Something will have to be done, because the farmers are not growing beet at the present prices. I am not a teetotaller or a non-smoker, and I have some other vices strongly developed too.  Ten cigarettes cost 8½d. and a pint of stout costs 11d.  I think if I were the father of a young family&mdash;my family are grown up at the moment&mdash;I certainly would not smoke cigarettes or drink a pint while I could get sugar to buy.  Of course the Government is getting plenty of taxes out of the cigarette and out of the pint. The money must be got somewhere.  I would suggest putting a quarter on the sugar to bring it to 8¾d., and to increase to about £4 5s. the price of beet grown remote from or adjacent to the factories.  You would get plenty of sugar then, and plenty of sweets and jam.  It is a grand thing to see youngsters eating sweets&mdash;Peggy's leg and all the rest of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just another matter of great importance to which I want to refer.  I have a question down about it, and it will possibly come up in the next three or four days, but perhaps I might be permitted to take time by the forelock. I attended a meeting of the South Tipperary Committee of Agriculture on <Col N="680" /> Friday afternoon, and we had two letters there from tinsmiths.  There is scarcely a creamery churn to be had at the moment, nor is there a bit of tin to mend the churns.  I do not know how the milk is taken to the creameries. Any creamery churns that can be procured at the moment cost £6 or £8; they used to be bought at £2.  Those churns are used to bring the milk to the creameries.  Then they bring back the separated milk&mdash;about eight gallons out of 10.  Then they are frequently used during the day for water-carrying. A shortage of those churns is a very serious matter.</P>
    <P>I do not want to put the Minister on the spot; that is not much my style. At the same time, I disagree with this question of feeding cows.  What can you feed them with?  Cotton cake was the great thing for feeding cows; there was nothing to equal it.  We have nothing to make up for that.  We use crushed oats; we use barley; wheat is out of the question.  Without the cotton cake you cannot get the high milk yield.  About a year ago we asked for 1/- a gallon for milk.  As far as I remember, most of the people over there voted against it.  That accounts, to some extent, for the scarcity of agricultural labour; we cannot pay them. When we look for the wherewithal to pay them, nearly everybody votes against it.  Examine your consciences about that.  In my area we are engaged in mixed farming, and we do it tolerably well.  In the Golden Vale, 10 miles away, they are dairymen.  At one time I used to milk 32 cows; then I got down to 17 or 18, and back again to 22 or 23.  I do not know how I am going to get those cows milked.  My sons are now ranging from 22 to 25 years; when they were about 17 or 18 years they did not mind milking.  During the last election campaign I went through four towns, Cahir, Clonmel, Fethard and Thurles.  From the time I left home at 6 o'clock in the morning the cows were being driven into the yards.  Then we met people taking the milk to and from the creameries.  They would go to first Mass and bring home the churns afterwards.  In the towns we visited, most of the workers were finished since 12 o'clock, old time, the day before. Our fellows had to do a day's work <Col N="681" /> after that, coming in at 6 o'clock or 6.30 on Saturday evening, having worked at hay or thinning turnips, and all the other work that goes on at that time of the year.  I had another experience. The final of the county championship was being played.  A couple of our fellows were on the team.  We left at 5.15 in the morning, and when we came home they had to milk 32 cows.  That was at 7.30 in the evening. Most of the remainder of the team were town workers.</P>
    <P>We farmers are not whiners; we are always averse to showing our wounds in the market-place.  When we ask you for 1/- a gallon for milk you all walk into the Lobby against us.  On that matter I think you should examine your consciences.  As a result of your actions, the milk industry is going down.  You will not get milk at even 1/2 or 1/3 a gallon to meet the needs of the nation.  I hope I am a false prophet in that connection, but that is my belief at the moment.  My people have been on the land for generations and I know the traditions of the land. I know, too, the traditions of the City of Dublin, because I lived here for 25 years.  I say you must advance the price of beet and the price of milk or you will be sugarless and without milk, and your campaigns in relation to sanatoria and hospitals will be no good without those things.  The price of milk should be at least 1/- or 1/1 a gallon and the price of washed beet should be £4 5s., either remote from or adjacent to the factory.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan referred to sheep.  I have pedigree Suffolks and I do fairly well with them.  Speaking generally of Munster, the farmers go in for Border Leicesters; in Tipperary we have the Irish mountain variety.  This question of wool is to me something of a mystery. I have been in the drapery trade for many years and I know something about wool.  There is a tendency lately for the Saxony finish, and that is a thing for which Irish wool is not quite suitable.  We would like to have a little information as to the class of wool which would be most suitable for our farms.  Considerable quantities of our wool are used more in the making of rugs and blankets.  I dare not suggest <Col N="682" /> that we should get away from the Saxony or West of England finish.  We do need some guidance as to the proper breed of sheep for this country. There is a tendency lately for a blend with the Suffolks.  The farmers would certainly like some guidance in the matter of sheep breeding.  The heavy deep wool is practically unsaleable.</P>
    <P>There is one very important matter with which I think everyone is sympathetic. I refer to greyhounds.  I think that when this emergency is over, every city in the world will have a greyhound track, from the North Pole to the South Pole, and from China to Peru. There was quite an export trade before the war with South Africa and France. The moment the war ceases, that trade will boom again.  The Irish dog is without rival.  If the Government could help that industry in any way, it would be very desirable.  You have helped the cattle trade with premium bulls, and the horse industry with premiums for stallions and for good mares.  Something along those lines should be evolved to help the greyhound industry. It would be very desirable if we could induce the poor man to keep a really good bitch and, perhaps, get the services of the very best dog at a modest price.  People would be able to rear greyhounds in the backyards in cities and towns with almost as big a chance of success as in a country town &mdash;perhaps not quite the same; but pretty good ones have been reared in that way.  I observe Deputy Briscoe smiling.</P>

It would be a great help if premiums were offered, and I hope the Minister will think along these lines.  There are some other things I would like to refer to, but the <Col N="683" /> Acting Chairman might not be pleased. I know that in the country people are in a very bad way for nailed boots.  I paid £4 10s. for a pair of nailed boots recently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the man who walks out in a country district in a pair of bad boots will soon be motionless&mdash;will soon be in his grave.  Now, with regard to wheat, I may say that I know a great deal about it because I come from a county where there is a great wheat-growing tradition.  I say that the wheat problem is a terrible one.  Wheat is beginning to decline. The smaller farmer is getting back a second time on the ground, and the wheat is declining through lack of manure, artificial or otherwise.  The artificial manure has been described as an auxiliary.  You really want the plain old-fashioned dung&mdash;humus&mdash;to keep the ground at its best.  The Minister for Agriculture has not much to do with the importation of manure, but he knows the need of it.  It would be a great advantage if we could get a further supply of artificial manure, otherwise the wheat will become a fearful problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You are really travelling in a vicious circle.  History repeats itself.  You are now in the same vicious circle as during the Crimean War, when wheat went 3/- a stone.  I belong to the greatest wheat-growing valley in Ireland. In the Crimean War period and the American Civil War period we had experience of the depredations of wheat on the land.  In the early '70s England wanted cheap food for her teeming population.  They got wheat in from the colonies, and poor old Ireland could grow nothing but switch grass and daisies.  From the early '70s until 1883 there was a bigger emigration than at any other period.  Fine young fellows went away in their thousands. The resting of the land for 10 years and the introduction of artificial manures helped the country along. Then you came to your wheat-growing campaign.  We told you to grow <Col N="684" /> wheat.  It was not the first time we grew wheat in an emergency.  If you continue growing wheat for another ten years you will find that you will be back again to the growing of switch grass and daisies.  Talk about producing your own stuff! I fed 70, 80 and up to 100 pigs, and what did I feed them on?  I fed them principally on Indian meal mixed with barley and bone meal.  We shall be getting Indian meal again when the seas are cleared, and, if we do not, poor Ireland will not grow much more.  You will be sorry for your wheat-growing.  You have to do it in wartime, but you cannot continue to do it, and, as a matter of fact, we shall be lucky if we get over the emergency.</P>
    <P>With regard to barley, I understand that barley is making up to 50/- in England.  Why do we not get that price here?  Look at the big price of the pint, of the glass of grog, here, and look at the parsimonious price paid for barley.  We are not getting a fair price for barley, any more than we are getting it for milk or beet.  Why do you not pay a fair price for it?  That is the whole history of the flight from the land.  Migratory labourers to the number of 450 came in from the West of Ireland.  We got the Kerrymen, and grand fellows they were.  About 25 came to my immediate area, and, if ten or 12 of them remained, we would be winning an All-Ireland Football Championship in 20 years' time.  They were not as skilful with the reaper and binder as our Tipperary men, but they did great manual work.  They were great workers with the fork&mdash;I do not refer to the table fork, as they did not eat more than we did&mdash;and at stacking and such operations.</P>
    <P>I was travelling down with a Senator on 11th November, and he drew my attention, when we passed Sallins, to the number of stacks of corn and cocks of hay from Sallins down to the borders of my native county.  They were quite green, and what became of them I do not know.  I am sure we could have counted 100 or 200 from the train on either side.  I have spoken to County Kildare men about it, and apparently they were beaten, because they have not got the tradition of feeding <Col N="685" /> their men indoors.  In Tipperary, we have our men outdoors, but they generally have their meals with us, and we are able to put them up and are able to get our crops saved.  We got roughly one-quarter of the 430 or 440 who came in.</P>
    <P>I think County Meath and County Westmeath suffered in much the same way, in that they were not able to accommodate the men as we in Tipperary, Cork and Limerick were able to accommodate them.  I seriously suggest to the Minister that what we need for the next five or six weeks is a migratory labour scheme.  We are in a desperate way at the moment and I think our situation is typical of most of Munster.  We cannot get a man for love or money.  They are not there and unless you do as you did last September and bring them in from the western seaboard, the people will be in a bad way.  What I say in that connection will be borne out if inquiries are made.</P>
    <P>To sum up, I certainly say: Increase the price for washed beet to £4 5s. 0d., whether grown remote from or adjacent to the factory; give a price of 1/- or 1/1 for milk; and introduce a migratory labour scheme.  These are the three points on which I particularly appeal to the Minister.  You will not get sugar at the present price of beet and you will be surprised when you get the returns.  I hope I am a false prophet, but if you give a price of £4 5s. 0d. the country will not starve.  This is the crucial, the critical year, and everything depends on what is done in the next five or six weeks.  The beets are going in very soon now.  Very little winter wheat has been set, but a lot of spring wheat is going in and it will not be bad.  In our area, we set winter wheat up to the first week in March with fairly good results, but at the moment we have not got the labour to enable us to get on with the work.  That is the big problem&mdash;the flight from the land. Give us a price for beet, milk and barley and we will keep the men on the land; otherwise you will face a terrible problem.  I do not put these suggestions forward as a suppliant or beggar on behalf of the farmers.  I merely ask for a plain, honest deal because the <Col N="686" /> last thing we farmers would like to do is to cadge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cogan gave his views on this motion and I do not think I can go further than his speech so far as this debate is concerned.  The motion has an &ldquo;if&rdquo; in it&mdash;&ldquo;if there is a serious decline in the value of agricultural produce after the war&rdquo;....  If there is not, I take it the motion does not arise, but we had better regard the motion as being brought in with the fear that disastrous consequences might arise, and all I can do is to follow the speech made by Deputy Cogan and to make what comments I have to make on some of the points he raised.</P>
      <P>First, the point is often made by speakers that the agricultural population is going down.  I think that is true.  The population on the land has gone down over the last 15 or 20 years, but if Deputies look at the output from the land, they will find&mdash;I have not got the figures here because I did not think it would come to my turn to speak to-night&mdash;that the output has not gone down over this period, although the population has gone down, and I think that all we can take from that is that agriculture has become more efficient, because if you have 100 men doing a certain amount of work, and, after 20 years, the same amount is being done by 95 men, it would in most industries be looked on as a sign of efficiency and I do not see why we should not regard it as a sign of efficiency in agriculture, nor do I see why we should deplore the fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, if there is a certain amount of money coming to agriculture, as there is on the basis of the output in terms of cash&mdash;and we know that, for instance, in 1944, the amount of the output in cash value was very much higher than it was 20 years ago&mdash;and if there are fewer people employed, those who are employed are considerably better off than they were 20 years ago. If there had been more employed in it, it is possible that they would not be so well off, so that taking efficiency combined with increased income to those on the land, we cannot but <Col N="687" /> regard it as a good sign that there are fewer people on the land than there were 15 or 20 years ago.  It would be better still, I suppose, if output had been doubled and the number of people increased, if not doubled, but that is something to be aimed at.</P>
    <P>Another point made by Deputy Cogan, which again is very commonly made, was that the skilled worker in agriculture should not be worse paid than the skilled worker in other industries.</P>
    <P>I have always held, and I think members of the House who know anything about agriculture will agree with me, that it takes very much longer&mdash; and also a better type of man&mdash;to produce a skilled worker in agriculture than it does to produce a skilled worker in most industries.  From that point of view I have no hesitation in saying that the skilled worker in agriculture deserves equally good treatment with the skilled worker in industry. In looking at this matter from the purely cash point of view, there are certain aspects of it that we must keep in mind.  If the skilled worker in the city has, say, £4 a week, and the skilled agricultural worker £2 or £2 5s. a week, I do not know that we can come to the conclusion that the city worker is twice as well paid or twice as well off as the man in the country.  First of all, we must remember that the farmer and his family are workers in agriculture.  We have comparatively few big farmers that do not need to, in some cases, and do not want to, in other cases, work as hard as their workmen.  The number, I say, is comparatively small if we take the total number of males employed in agriculture, so that farmers' sons and small farmers are workers in just the same sense as agricultural workers are. Therefore, whatever income agriculture can afford to pay to agricultural labourers it can afford the same income to farmers' sons and small farmers, provided you have equal efficiency.</P>
    <P>Looking at the matter in that way we must remember that, in the case of the small farmer and his family and the big farmer and his family, they use many things in their households which <Col N="688" /> they have at a lower cost than the artisan or the skilled worker in the town.  Potatoes and vegetables cost them less.  They have them at the ex-farm cost.  That makes a big difference in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>The complaint has been made in this House from time to time that the farmer is getting £6 a ton for his potatoes, while consumers in the city are paying 2/3 and 2/6 per stone for them.  Now £6 a ton for potatoes is 6/- per cwt. or 9d. per stone.  Therefore, as far as potatoes are concerned, the farmer and his family have them for 9d. per stone, while the artisan in the city has to pay 2/3 or 2/6 a stone for them.  The same thing applies to vegetables to some extent and also, in a certain degree, to milk, butter and eggs.  At any rate, as regards a great number of the items that are taken into account in calculating the cost-of- living figure, the small farmer and his family and the large farmer and his family have them at a much lower cost than the city artisan or worker.  I do not know if the latter has any corresponding advantage over the agricultural worker.  Deputy O'Donnell mentioned the pint of Guinness.  The worker in the city has to pay the same price for that as the farmer or agricultural worker.  As far as I know, the worker in a tobacco factory has to pay the same price for his cigarettes as the agricultural labourer, so that when you compare the position of the worker in the town with that of the worker in the country, I do not think that the man in the town has any corresponding advantages over the other.</P>
    <P>The agricultural labourer has a plot. I know, of course, that it would be difficult for him to maintain the fertility of the plot unless he was facilitated by his employer not only in the use of his horses but also in being supplied with farmyard manure.  If he gets those facilities he can produce potatoes and vegetables in his plot. I admit that he cannot produce milk, but in many cases he gets milk as a perquisite from his employer, and in other cases he gets it at practically a nominal charge.  Agricultural labourers who live some distance from towns and cities have no difficulty in getting a sufficient supply of fuel.  In some <Col N="689" /> cases they have turf and in other cases timber.  The type of firewood available to them depends on the part of the country in which they are employed. The agricultural labourer has probably to pay the same price for butter as the townsman.  If he has been lucky enough to choose a good wife, he may be able to have cheap eggs.</P>
    <P>When we speak about the wage of the agricultural worker, we must remember that he is one of a group, a group which includes small farmers and farmers' sons.  He has certain advantages that we must remember when considering this question of a wage.  The agricultural labourer and the working farmers are responsible for the output of food, the price of which is a very important matter in the general economy of the country. Without going into them now, it can be said that there are good arguments for keeping the price of food down. If it can possibly be done, it may be preferable for a country to give certain advantages to its agricultural labourers by way of a subsidy or otherwise, and in that way help to reduce the cost of output of the agricultural produce.</P>
    <P>The agricultural labourer gets those subsidies in the way, for instance, of cheap rents.  When the first scheme of labourers' cottages was carried through the cottages were let to the tenants at 9d. a week, and even in the case of labourers' cottages built in the last ten years or so the rents are only 2/3, 2/6, or 2/9 per week, a very much lower rent than the town labourer or artisan has to pay for his house.  There is a difference between a rent of 2/9 a week and 12/9.  To that extent anyway the agricultural labourer's wages might be lower than the rent of the artisan or labourer working in the town.  Then there are the other things that the agricultural labourer has, such as vegetables, potatoes, milk and the benefits he enjoys with regard to fuel.  These things should be taken into account in order to make a real comparison between the conditions under which the agricultural worker has to live on, say, £2 5s. or £2 a week, and the conditions under which the artisan or worker in the town or city has to live on £3 10s. or £4 a week.  I am not <Col N="690" /> going to make a calculation of what would be a fair difference between the two, but at any rate there is some difference that might be allowed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan went on to talk about the products which might come under his motion.  I should like to say straight away that I agree to a great extent with Deputy Cogan as regards the commodities which he thinks it is practicable to deal with in this way.  He has stated that, in his opinion, it would not be practicable to deal with cattle and sheep or with seed oats or barley or crops grown for animal feeding.  I agree with the division he has made. A great deal can be said for what is referred to as a &ldquo;long-term policy&rdquo; in respect of prices.  I believe that, if we could effect that, we would give the farmers a sense of security and, perhaps, a sense of hopefulness.  We would enable farmers who have the necessary capital equipment and labour to go into production even to a greater extent than they have been doing recently.  There are, of course, arguments against this policy, though they do not arise so much from the agricultural point of view.  There is a possibility&mdash;only a possibility&mdash;that, having fixed prices for five years ahead, some catastrophe might happen, either in regard to the value of the £ or in some other way, which would make the farmers sorry that they had agreed to fixation of prices.  If such a catastrophe were to occur, I take it that Deputy Cogan and other Deputies would come here and say that they had not foreseen the circumstances and that the policy should be amended.  From that point of view, there are objections.</P>
    <P>If this proposal were to be given effect, some form of financial obligation would have to be placed on the State by way of guarantee or by way of payment out of some fund.  That would mean that the Minister for Finance would have to be brought in.  The Minister for Finance would, naturally, have an objection to this policy.  Any Minister for Finance will strenuously object to being tied to a certain policy for five years ahead.  He does not know what his budgetary position will be three or four years from now, or what the taxable capacity of the <Col N="691" /> country will be.  Therefore, he does not like being tied to a particular commitment for so long a period.  I do not say that the Minister for Finance might not overcome his objections, but the objections are there.  The post-war planning committee is considering all these matters.  I am expecting to have what I regard, and what they, I think, regard as their comprehensive report on the general future of agriculture before the summer.  I may be disappointed in that hope.  They may find it impossible to complete their report by that time, but they hope to be able to do it.  I understand that they will discuss the future of agriculture in relation to guaranteed markets and guaranteed or fixed prices.  As soon as I have an opportunity of studying that report, I shall be in a position to put my views before the Government, and those views, as approved or altered by the Government, will eventually be placed before the House.  Therefore, I hope that we shall be in a position to discuss this question of guaranteed markets and fixation of prices for a long period.</P>
    <P>At the moment, it appears to me that two things are necessary to bring a commodity within this system of guaranteed prices over a long period. There must be uniformity.  In the case of wheat, there is uniformity.  If there is a slight variation, we have recourse to bushel weight.  There is uniformity in the case of creamery butter.  There is no such thing as good or bad creamery butter; it is all good.  We have uniformity in beet, because the company which buys it pays on the sugar-content.  There is uniformity in the case of eggs.  If the eggs are fresh, they are bought by weight.  The system could not be applied to cattle, because every Deputy knows that, if three store cattle, each weighing 10 cwt., were offered for sale, there might be a difference of 40 per cent. in their value on account of quality and other factors.  Deputy Cogan does not include store cattle in his motion.  That exclusion would apply equally to dogs, which Deputy O'Donnell wants to include. Where is the uniformity or even identity in the case of hounds?  They must be ruled out, and I am afraid <Col N="692" /> that sheep would have to be ruled out also.  I also agree with regard to feeding barley and feeding oats.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan referred to wheat, beet, dairy produce, pigs and bacon and eggs.  I think the system would be practicable in the case of all these. If this post-war planning committee are able to put up a feasible scheme, if I agree with it and, in turn, get the Government to agree with the scheme, possibly that scheme will come along. I cannot say at the moment whether it shall ever see the light of day or not.  If it does come, I agree that these commodities could be brought within it.  I am not sure about wool. I said a moment ago that there were two essential requirements in the case of such a scheme.  The second requirement has reference to the home market. In the case of the export market, we do not know where we are and we could not operate the scheme unless we were able to obtain a contract for five years ahead for our exports.  We are not likely to get such contracts. Wool, as I said, is a doubtful item. We used very little native wool before the war.  During the war, we used quite a lot of wool.</P>
    <P>There are complaints from different sources about the difficulty of using native wool and I am not sure that we shall be able to use all our native wool when the war is over.  We shall, probably, use more than we did before the war but I am not sure that we shall use all of it.  To operate such a scheme, we should want to know what percentage of the wool would be used at home.  If there were only a small percentage for export, wool could be brought under the scheme, because the financing of a small amount of exported wool would not present great difficulty.  Deputy Cogan said that malting barley might be dealt with by way of contract growing.  I often thought so myself but I am afraid that it would lead to a great deal of trouble as between farmer and farmer.  The Deputy thought that the same system might be applied to milling oats.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
