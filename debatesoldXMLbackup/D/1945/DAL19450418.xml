      <P>A return giving the figures will be circulated with the Official Report.  As I explained before, the figures show the number of permits issued to persons travelling to take up employment, temporary or otherwise, and are, therefore, not a guide to the number of people emigrating in the ordinary sense.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the many difficulties which may face large numbers of Irish citizens on their return to this country after the emergency, in securing employment, housing accommodation, social service benefits, etc., he will consider the advisability of establishing central advice bureaux at which such persons may obtain guidance and advice on all such problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider it to be extremely improbable that any substantial number of Irish workers returning to this country from employment in Great Britain will require assistance of the nature indicated in the question. The employment exchanges and the branch employment exchanges are available to all workers who desire to register for employment, and the managers are in a position to advise <Col N="2048" /> applicants as to their claims to unemployment insurance benefit or unemployment assistance.  In respect of health insurance, workers can get advice from the local offices of Cumann an Arachais Naisiúnta ar Shláinte (The National Health Insurance Society).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will note that my question deals with more than the matter of obtaining employment.  These people, when they return, will have to settle-in here and already the small numbers who are returning are finding difficulty, especially with regard to housing accommodation. It is all very well to say that the employment exchanges and the branch employment exchanges will give advice as to claims for unemployment insurance benefit, or unemployment assistance, but many of these people are not aware of that.  It would be much better, I suggest, if facilities were afforded in the manner suggested in my question.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the likelihood of the return at an early date of large numbers of men and women from Great Britain, he will make a statement assuring these people of the willingness of the Government to facilitate their return home at the earliest possible moment; that work will be made available for them at rates of wages adequate to their needs; and that, in the interim period, other provisions will be made for their maintenance pending their absorption in the regular economic activities of the country; and, if so, if he will indicate the nature of the provisions.</P>

      <P>So far as the regulations now in force in this country are concerned, Irish workers employed in Great Britain are free to return Home at any time.  With regard to the remaining parts of the Deputy's question, the Government does not contemplate affording any preference in, or guarantee of, employment to workers returning from Great Britain.  Workers returning from Great Britain who may be in need of employment will be afforded the same facilities in obtaining work as other unemployed workers. Neither is it contemplated that any special provision, by way of unemployment assistance, will be made available to workers returning from Great Britain which will not be available to unemployed workers generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had under consideration the position in regard to supplies of cartridges during the current year, and by arrangement with the manufacturers there will be an issue of cartridges in the near future to ammunition dealers generally.  In <Col N="2051" /> accordance with the practice which has obtained since the distribution of cartridges has been controlled by emergency Order, a proportion of the available supplies of cartridges will be reserved for farmers for the protection of their crops against vermin.</P>
      <P>The supplies of cartridges which will be available this year will be considerably less than normal requirements and, consequently, holders of shotgun certificates generally will be able to procure only a limited number of cartridges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be practicable to relate, in some measure at least, the supply of cartridges to the issue of licences, because I have reason to believe that persons who have licences, £2 licences, cannot get a cartridge and certain big cartridge dealers are shooting as much as, or more than, they did pre-war?  I have heard of cases, though I am not in a position to prove them, of persons holding licences to whom it has been indicated that if they were prepared to pay 1/3 per cartridge they could get them, but not at a lower figure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of cartridges permitted is related to the number of licences extant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider a scheme whereby a person getting a £2 licence would have the right to go to a licensed dealer and get a dozen or a dozen and a half cartridges which would be endorsed on his permit and in respect of which the dealer could apply to the manufacturer for supplies?  Otherwise, I believe the supply of cartridges are, as to about 50 per cent., being used by the dealers or diverted into the black market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In great part, that is the scheme of distribution in force, but the distribution of cartridges to dealers is related to their previous sales and could not be arranged on any other basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask who is to do this work?  I understand that a close perusal of the Constitution in Irish reveals the interesting fact that the Constitution says what nobody intended it to say, and that there is considerable confusion because certain persons are claiming to interpret the Constitution literally in Irish: that they are claiming rights under it that it was never meant to give, and are even claiming to deny rights which the Constitution was intended to provide. That is largely because there is an eager battle going on between the expert Irish lexicographers as to the meaning of the words employed in the Irish text of the Constitution.  If you are now going to have a set of legal terms, and if we all can produce expert evidence in the courts that the terms <Col N="2058" /> contained in the dictionary do not mean what they are meant to be, we will be in a very serious difficulty. Will the Minister tell us what precautions are going to be taken to secure that, in this new dictionary of legal terms, ambiguities similar to those which sprinkle the pages of the Constitution will not arise?</P>
      <P>In a case, say, where two scholars think a word means something, and a third scholar thinks it means another thing, will there be an appeal to the Supreme Court as to the true meanning of the word, none of the judges of that court knowing Irish?  I would be glad if the Minister would enlighten us on that.  After all, the humblest citizen of the State is entitled to know what his rights are.  It will be an extremely awkward business if we have to go to the Supreme Court to ask for a decision from judges, who do not know the language, on the precise meaning of the words, some of which, no doubt, will be invented to meet the occasion.  Will the body to be set up under this legislation be instructed to invent a word, where no available word is there, because, perhaps, members of the House may not be aware that we are very fecund in the invention of words?  We have a Department in this House, and whenever a word turns up in a Bill that is not immediately translatable in Irish, we invent a word upstairs in a minute.  Unfortunately, our inventions do not coincide always with some other fellow's invention, and then you have a protracted battle about the two words as to which word is to prevail.</P>

Is it intended that once this foclóir of legal terms is published that it will be illegal to employ any term not appearing in this foclóir to describe the things?  In addition to the words prescribed in the publication here envisaged, will it be permissible to continue to use the words that people have been in the habit of using for these things?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole object of the Bill is to remove the difficulty referred to by the Deputy.  As I said on the Second Reading, an Irish speaker, say from Kerry, may use one phrase, an Irish speaker from Donegal may use another, and an Irish speaker from Connemara may use a third.  People will be at liberty to take any chances they like as to the phrases they use, but it is the one that will be certified by the Minister that will be the legal one.  If they adopt the words and phrases in the authorised list, then they will be taking no chance.  They can be certain that they will be using a word or phrase the meaning of which has been decided by the courts.  This Bill was brought in because I understand there was a reluctance on the part of legal people&mdash;solicitors and others&mdash;to draw up wills or deeds in the Irish language for fear the interpretation given to the forms and words they used might not be what they had intended.  When this Bill is passed, the words and phrases certified by the Minister for Justice will be the legal equivalents of the English words.

      <P>A substantial list of equivalents in English and Irish exists as a result of their actual use up to date in the framing and translation of the statutes.  When we arrive at the point at which the subtleties are to be attended to in the way the Minister intends under this Bill, surely we will have reached the point at which the whole foundation stuff that is there <Col N="2061" /> should be made available.  A very large number of terms in connection with legal matters are available in the statutes.  It would be timely and desirable that they would now be brought together in the form of a dictionary, so that we would have a dictionary of the legal words and terms that have been used up to date.</P>

Does the Minister realise that the words and phrases used in the courts of law have received, from the system of common law that has obtained in this country for several centuries certain highly specialised meanings in accordance with the cases where their form has finally crystallised?  Is it intended in this dictionary to take a phrase such as, &ldquo;all the heirs of his body&rdquo; and say that, according to the ruling in Shelley's case, this phrase shall be translated into Irish by the following words but outside the ruling in Shelley's case the following words may be used?</P>

If he is going to get the Bill that the Attorney-General has drawn up, if he is going to take the foclóir which he says he has before him and hand it to one civil servant and ask him is that all right, the job is not going to be done.  This ought to be a job in which highly-paid persons would be consulted and which may take years to do correctly. If you do not do it in that way, if you do not spend the money and hire the men who are competent to do the job, you may be plunging into a sea of sorrow which none of us, but unfortunate litigants down the country, will pay for.  We ought to consider that before we go further with this matter with a view to appropriating sufficient money to ensure a job being done which will not cause people unnecessary litigation and hardship.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon seems to be afraid that adequate attention will not be paid to the Irish language side of the proposals here and that people qualified on the linguistic side to do the work will not be made available.  The list of the committee as indicated in Section 2 would suggest that there may be something in that argument.  The committee shall consist of a judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court, a judge of the Circuit Court, a justice of the District Court, a practising barrister, a practising solicitor, and only then do we come to a member of the Oireachtas translation staff and to some other person.  While the Minister is endeavouring in this Bill to deal with a very practical problem, that is, to ensure that there will be the same firmness of meaning for a certain number of Irish phrases as has been established for a certain number of English phrases in the statutes, it is important that whatever may be introduced or built into the Irish language for the purpose of enabling Irish law to be administered, it should be made certain that it will be a thing that can be recognised as as natural a part and parcel of the Irish language as legal phraseology in English is of the English language.  Therefore, it is very important that the language side of it should be done by persons peculiarly competent with regard to the living language and its roots and the suggestion that is made here, that there will be one member of the translation staff on the committee, hardly seems adequate to provide for that.  I should like to hear from the Minister whether or not there will be any piece of organised machinery, competent to deal with the purely language problems that will arise, operating in connection with this body, perhaps, doing a certain amount of preliminary work or a certain amount of ordered work <Col N="2064" /> for them before they come to their final conclusions.</P>

      <P>Yes.  That would be the one other person&mdash;the seventh person on the committee.  Some of the judges have a fairly good knowledge of Irish, I think, and I expect they are the judges who will probably be appointed.  In regard to the points that Deputy Dillon is afraid of, I am sure they will be adverted to by the committee.  They are practically all legal people, except the one member of the translation staff.  I do not think there are any people in the country who have more experience of these phrases in Irish than the translation staff of the Oireachtas. No one else deals with them to such an extent, and the points that Deputy Dillon is afraid of, will, I am sure, be borne in mind by the other members of the committee, that is, the judges and the representatives of the Bar and the solicitors.  I think it is as good a scheme as can be devised. I do not think it is capable of improvement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My feeling is that the Minister is entirely oblivious to the difficulties which are about to confront him.  He seems to be labouring under the misapprehension that you can take a whole string of words in English and attach to them Irish equivalents which will be binding upon the courts.  It is not a question only of swopping word for word. Legal terminology is full of phrases to which meanings have been attached as a consequence of the long operation of the common law and it has frequently transpired that phrases which, at first glance, to the untutored mind, mean one thing, to a trained lawyer, knowing the common law, mean something quite different. Deputies may imagine that this will give rise exclusively to difficulties in the course of trials proceeding in a <Col N="2065" /> court and it will appear to Deputies that if such ambiguity arises in the course of a trial it can easily be disposed of by having recourse, if needs be, to English, in order to remove the ambiguity, but these terms may very well be used in deeds and wills, the interpretation of which may not arise until all the parties to them are long dead.</P>
      <P>On the interpretation of some word which has been borrowed from this list there may emerge an interpretation of a document which is irrevocable and utterly opposed to the intention of the person who executed the deed.  Surely we know that, although English has been the language of the courts and lawyers have been studying the usages of the courts for three centuries, it still occurs that deeds fail to express the true purpose of the people who make them and that wills give rise to ambiguities which involve protracted litigation.  To that already difficult situation, which is just as difficult in Great Britain as it is here, is to be superimposed the right of using arbitrary terms with this false guarantee that, if they stick rigidly to the translations provided in this foclóir, they are perfectly safe.  Nothing could be further from the truth, because you cannot take the words and translate them literally one after the other.  The forms of Irish do not fall into the same shapes as the forms of English.  Very often one word in English would require a phrase in Irish adequately to reproduce it.  Similarly, one word in Irish will be the equivalent of a phrase in English.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that employing a judge of the Supreme Court or High Court, a judge of the Circuit Court, a justice of the District Court, a practising barrister, a practising solicitor, a member of the Oireachtas translation staff, and a person nominated from time to time as occasion requires by the Government is the best way of dealing with the problem.  It is not.  There is no way of dealing with this problem except by allowing the Irish language to take its place in the courts side by side with the English language, running the same risks in getting the forms settled by the courts <Col N="2066" /> as has been run in the past in getting the forms in English settled by the courts.</P>

      <P>The Minister says the best way of geting this business done is by a committee of this kind.  I think it will be a complete failure and I am going to prove it.  I allege that the best legal and technical advice was got by the Taoiseach when he was burning midnight oil to draft the Constitution in Irish.  I bet you that he had the assistance of this Supreme Court judge who is to be nominated under sub-head (a).  I could nearly swear that the particular man who is going to be parpointed to that vacancy burned the midnight oil with the Taoiseach.  I would not be at all surprised if the judge of the Circuit Court who is to be appointed was there also.  We could name them just as well as the Minister.</P>

      <P>I do not want to amend the Bill at all.  I am pointing out the danger of the procedure in appointing a committee of this kind.  When you begin to discuss a question of this kind, all reason seems to become suspended. I urge the Minister most strongly, instead of having a committee of this kind, to recognise that the best he can do is to get some kind of a committee which will record from time to time in a digest legal decisions relating to the use of the Irish language and the meaning attributed by the Puisne and the Supreme Courts to the phraseology of the Irish language as it crops up in the course of litigation. There is no other safe way of securing a compendium of dependable Irish terminology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that if this committee was charged with that task it might do something useful.  In Great Britain, digests are being turned out year after year on account of the immense volume of litigation and the number of practising lawyers there.  It would not be an economic proposition in this country for any firm working for a profit to print a digest in Irish for the limited number of practitioners who would avail of it.  But, if you had a committee of competent Irish speakers with legal knowledge who would carefully peruse all the reports and prepare such a digest annually, it might cost a great deal of money&mdash;I do not believe it would cost any more than the proposal here&mdash;but at least it would be a useful service to the legal profession and the language.  The suggestion that the miscellany provided for in Section 2 should pontificate on the meaning of words is merely a trap for the unwary.  They may pontificate till the cows come home, but the courts <Col N="2069" /> will refuse to be bound as to the meaning they extract from sentences composed of the words defined by this committee.  I confess at once that, if Deputy John Costello were here, he would probably be able to make the point I am trying to bring home to the House more clearly than I am able to do so.</P>

      <P>Well, Section 3 gives a direction as to how the committee should proceed.  I do not care what directions are given to the committee &mdash;they cannot do the work, because the task assigned to them is an impossible one.  I believe that any lawyer would tell the Minister that, if a different kind of committee were chosen and a different task assigned to it, we would get some return for the money.  This proposal is going to provide us with nothing but a trap for the unwary.  The disgusting part of it is that the reason we are proceeding on these lines is in order to create the fraudulent impression that we are Gaelicising the nation at express speed.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (3) says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Whenever the Minister makes a Legal Terms Order declaring that the equivalent in the Irish language of a specified term shall be the word or words specified in the Order, then, the said word or words whenever occurring in ... an Act of the Oireachtas, ... the official translation of an Act, ... any statutory <Col N="2070" /> instrument or ... the official translation of any statutory instrument or ... document used for the purposes of legal proceedings ... shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed as having the same meaning as, and have the same force and effect as, the said specified term.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does the House realise what those words mean?  Does the House realise that a person going to this list and picking out of it an expression provided for in the list, is liable to go into court and meet the argument that, although the words used appear in the list, from the document a contrary intention appears?  Instead of finding himself on a rock of certainty, which it is represented to this House will be provided by this committee, that man is back into exactly the same field of ambiguity that he would have been in had this statute never been passed.</P>
    <P>I am submitting to the House that this whole business bears upon its face the stamp of fraud.  In so far as the Attorney-General has seen this Bill, he must have told those responsible for it that the purpose they had in mind of providing certainty in Irish was not being done and that the only way that could be got was by establishing a committee to publish regularly a digest for lawyers and that even then there would be no more certainty than they at present enjoy in the employment of the English language.  Do Deputies realise that these words &ldquo;shall, unless the contrary intention appears&rdquo; mean that the person drawing up the document or drafting the deed, when he comes before the court, is in exactly the same position as if this Bill had never been passed?  Will the Minister consider, at some stage, instead of the machinery he has provided in these two sections, the desirability of setting up a body to prepare an annual digest?</P>

      <P>Deputy Costello might have said what Deputy Dillon has said. He spoke on the Second Reading, and did not say that at all, so I took it then that he did not see that danger. Deputy Costello said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The real essential is that where a technical term is about to be translated into Irish somebody with a complete technical knowledge of the precise significance of that term, a competent Irish scholar if possible, one with legal knowledge and training should give advice as to what is required.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is all provided for.  What Deputy Dillon says may arise in the future and there may be some decision such as at present occurs even in regard to well-known English words.  That cannot be avoided and we cannot make anything any more certain.</P>

      <P>I wish to say that I did not rush the Commitee Stage.  I was prepared to wait, if Deputies had any better suggestion but, as no amendment was tabled, I took it that the Bill was accepted.  As Deputy Mulcahy has said, we will have to wait to find out how it will work.  All any human Assembly can do is what is best at the particular time; and if defects become evident we will have to come back and amend it.  This is a genuine attempt to deal with the matter.  I think Deputy Dillon went too far in saying it was a fraud and that that was stamped all over it.  We know that there is a certain element anxious to do their legal work through the medium of Irish and this is an effort to facilitate them.  It is not fair to say the Bill is stamped with fraud.  That is strong language to use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell the Minister why.  There is nothing to prevent anyone in this country having his business done through the medium of Irish at the present time.  I will get a dozen men to-morrow who will draft any deed the Minister ever heard or thought of in good literary Irish without any serious difficulty, and it is ridiculous for the Minister to pretend that Irish is so hopeless a language that you cannot express in it anything you can express in English, because it simply is not true.  Any concept of ordinary life can be just as effectively expressed in the Irish language as it can be in English.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But what we are doing is, we are trying to barge in on the legal system which we are operating and we are trying to say to people: &ldquo;You can use the new instrument of expression, an instrument new to this system, with perfect safety because we are providing you with a precise terminology.&rdquo; That is something we are not doing and it is something we cannot do.  We are admitting our inability to do it in sub-section (3) (f) of this Bill, whereunder we throw back to the discretion of the judges the interpretation of any and every document, word and phrase <Col N="2074" /> that comes before them.  Although a particular phrase in a particular instrument is declared by the foclóir, or the dictionary prepared by this committee, to mean something, it is open to the judge to say: &ldquo;While that may be strictly so, taking the meaning of the whole instrument and of the words and sentences employed in it, I determine that the true meaning is other than appears upon the surface.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputies may say that that is being unduly apprehensive and that such things are not likely to arise; that competent scholars will handle this thing, and that competent lawyers will also be concerned, and they may say that no danger of ambiguity arises. But the fact is&mdash;and everybody closes his eyes to it&mdash;that in connection with the Constitution the best Irish lawyers were retained as well as the best Irish scholars, and the Taoiseach himself presided over their deliberations, taking a personal interest in every line, in every comma, in every word.  Months were devoted to the preparation of the Irish text of the Constitution, and, nevertheless, after the period of amendment by legislation has passed, it is now discovered that the text of the Constitution contains several ambiguities, and the meaning attributed by the Taoiseach to many parts of the Constitution is seriously challenged by competent scholars who are not inclined to disagree with him and who would like to accept his interpretation, but who say that interpretation could not legally be attached to the phrases and sentences used.</P>
    <P>Now, the Constitutional dovecots are fluttering, and everyone is wondering what he will do.  Some are praying to God that the ambiguities in the Irish phrases of the Constitution will not be invoked by some why individual who will go into the court on foot of the Irish text and reject the English.  And probably out of the fertile brain of the Taoiseach some expedient will emerge to get out of this linguistic difficulty without going to the country on a referendum.  He thought that every possibility of obscurity had disappeared, that he had provided for everything; but he discovered to his cost that he could not and did not. <Col N="2075" /> That is all very well for the Taoiseach, but what will happen suppose some unfortunate person in County Kerry permits his solicitor to draft his will in Irish, or makes an assignment of his property to one of his children in Irish, believing he has provided adequate protection for an elderly wife or daughter?  After he has died, the man who executed the deed or made the will, somebody starts litigation on the true meaning of the text of the instrument, and some ambiguity such as is at present perplexing the Taoiseach emerges as to the true meaning of the words employed.</P>
    <P>As a result of what we are doing here some unfortunate individual in the country may be very seriously embarrassed. It might occur to us that we might provide some kind of insurance fund against that by saying that where a man suffers financial loss arising from an ambiguity created by this dictionary, funds should be made available out of which to compensate him. But it is not practical politics to do that.  You will find yourself in the position of having to decide whether the ambiguity was in the language or in the mind of the person who executed the deed.  It is all very well to do these things in regard to the Constitution &mdash;they do not matter very much one way or the other&mdash;but it is a serious thing to involve poor people in the country in unnecessary expense.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that before he goes further in this matter he ought to take further counsel with competent lawyers and put it to them that the object is to make the use of the Irish language as easy for an Irish speaker in this country as the English language is for English speakers and to make it as safe to draft any deed or instrument in Irish as it is in English.  I think he will get from these lawyers the same advice as I am giving him.  The way to achieve that is by not attempting to prepare some kind of dictionary that will not work.</P>
    <P>The best service the Legislature can do to the promotion of that end will be to publish an annual digest giving cases in which certain language was employed and the interpretation attached <Col N="2076" /> to that language by High Court judges in the course of ordinary legal procedure.  That is the most effective thing we can do here to facilitate the use of the Irish language in legal proceedings and documents.  If we delude ourselves into thinking that we can do anything more, we are simply fooling ourselves and, what is worse, we are probably involving simple people in an expenditure which they should never be called upon to bear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was speaking on the last day that we had the Estimate for the Office of the Minister for Justice before us, I was stressing the need for some change in the existing system, to see, if at all possible, by introducing a new system of policing our country, whether we may not be able to find means by which we can police it at less cost.  I suggested that some system could be evolved, by combining mobility, radio communication, telephonic communication and a <Col N="2077" /> system of central reserves, local and at headquarters.  I feel there is an opportune time approaching for the Minister to take his courage in his hands and get a committee together to investigate this problem.  The cost of policing the country is not only excessive, but it has reached saturation point.</P>
      <P>On this question of a change of system, I think that we should couple with any contemplated change some scheme of housing for the Gárda.  As most Deputies are aware, housing accommodation as such does not exist for the Gárda in many rural areas and particularly in most of our cities and towns.  Such of the older barracks as provide accommodation provide it more or less on the garrison principle, a system from which I am averse, and if a housing scheme is to be embarked upon at some future date, it should be one which not only will make the lives of the Gárda more happy and comfortable but will also provide a better system of acquiring local knowledge for the police.  In the first place, the Gárda barracks should become an office in the modern sense rather than a bridewell, a barracks or garrison, or place which people fear to enter.  In the minds of our people in the past, the local police station was associated with dark and evil things.  We should, if you like, glamorise our police stations to the extent that people will have no hesitation in going into them with their troubles.  At the same time, I do not want to provide a paradise for the wrongdoer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be better if houses for the Gárda were staggered in a locality throughout a sub-district rather than built together in one block.  I would not suggest that we should have, as it were, a police quarter in any town or village.  It would be better from the private point of view of the Gárda and the members of their families and from the public point of view that, if a housing scheme for the Gárda can be linked up with housing schemes generally, the houses should be scattered throughout the locality; in other words, that the Guards should have <Col N="2078" /> the right to settle down as members of the community amongst the community and be regarded as citizens of that community there, not to spy on their fellow-men, but rather to assist them in their troubles.</P>
    <P>The scheme would, of course, be a costly one, but we hear of £100,000,000 about to be spent over the next ten years or so for housing, and opportunity should be taken to link up whatever schemes the Minister may have in contemplation for the Gárda with the housing schemes proper.  The rent allowance which the Gárda of any rank is paid is inadequate to provide him with a suitable house.  In certain areas, no houses at all are available. In many cities and towns, no houses are available, and even the increased rent allowance which the Minister was good enough to procure for them is inadequate to provide them with any decent sort of living accommodation. There are towns and cities in which a Guard at present would not get more than one or two rooms for the rent allowance approved by the State.  It is because of the inadequacy of the rent allowance that I press for serious considerátion of the housing problem of the Gárda and for coupling it with any change of system which the Minister may see fit to introduce.</P>
    <P>A good deal of praise can be given to the Gárda for the work they are doing, but there is a good deal of criticism of the force abroad at present.  Deputy Dillon mentioned some points, and I do not wish to stress them, but there are definitely rumours of things being wrong in certain areas.  Whether these rumours are well-informed or not, I am not going to say, but there is a general looseness in certain areas.  There is a certain evidence of indiscipline and a certain amount of evidence that unsavoury practices are creeping in. In voicing these matters, I feel that I am giving effect to the wishes, desires and outlook of every decent member of the force who wants to see these things ended once and for all.</P>
    <P>There are, as Deputy Dillon pointed out, black sheep in every flock and a certain number of black sheep <Col N="2079" /> at the moment require looking after. I feel, however, that if these black sheep exist, it is because of the war situation, because, owing to the war situation, the inspection system has, to a large extent, broken down.  To my knowledge, there have been few inspections by headquarters officers and the inspections by local officers have been reduced to a minimum.  The effect of there being no inspections is that the Gárdaí in rural areas are inclined to take things easily, and, even though it may cost more to provide petrol and cars to enable officers to get about, the old system of quarterly and monthly inspections by divisional and district officers should be restored.</P>
    <P>Headquarters inspection should also take place at least once a year.  I go further and suggest that, while formal inspections have their effect in getting the personnel to study police duties, to clean up their stations and to make themselves, presentable for inspection, an odd surprise inspection by headquarters has a very good effect. Several Deputies since I came to the House have mentioned matters to me which put me thinking on these lines. I have no desire to criticise the Gárda personnel, but I feel that there is not enough supervision from the top, not enough supervision by the local officers and that the time is ripe for a drastic change in the matter of inspection.</P>
    <P>I mentioned on the previous day that the Gárdaí are top-weighted with extraneous duties and I want to reiterate that statement.  They are being loaded with all sorts of miscellaneous administrative duties by every Government Department.  In relation to practically every Act that passes through the Oireachtas which means inquiry outdoors, the Departments concerned invariably suggest that the Gárda Síochána should undertake the particular duties.  I cannot emphasise too strongly on the Minister that he should resist any further encroachment on the time of the Gárda for purely administrative work and should not only resist such further encroachment but should endeavour to rid the Gárda of <Col N="2080" /> such duties as can properly be shed and performed by other outdoor civil servants.</P>
    <P>The Gárda, by virtue of the present trend of legislation and the present policy, is being converted from a police force proper to a mere outdoor Civil Service machine.  It is not so much that they have inquiries and outdoor calls to make in relation to these duties, but every one of these inquiries necessitates a report to some Department. The report goes through the usual channels: the sergeant, the superintendent, perhaps the divisional officer, up to headquarters and then on to the Government Department concerned&mdash;a system of circumlocution which succeeds in creating nothing very often but a deadweight of paper. The Guards are loaded down with reports and with a deadweight of paper, a good deal of which could be cut out if there were some attempt made to rectify the present system. The Minister, I am sure, is aware of all these problems and I want to emphasise that, in my experience, they have a detrimental effect on the performance of police duties.  The police force exists primarily for the prevention and detection of crime and not for assisting the administration of routine matters.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon had a good deal to say on the question of promotion, particularly in relation to the prison service. I do not want to go into the matter in great detail, but Deputy Dillon seemed to favour a cadet system, and, at the same time, felt that advocacy of a cadet system might be regarded as introducing a caste of officers into the Gárda Síochána, or any other service, for that matter. There is this to be said for a cadet system as for any other system, that it is not a question of the system, but largely a question of the fitness of the particular individual for promotion; in other words, his fitness for command. The test of fitness to command should not be whether he was a socialite, whether he came from a certain respectable family of a higher social status than, say, the ordinary individual, or that he was a university man and was better educated than a <Col N="2081" /> man who had served in the ranks. You may get an individual who has not had the opportunity of a university or secondary education who is quite the ideal man for the job.  On the other hand, you may get a university man, a man who is probably highly educated, who would not suit at all, and who has no fitness to command.  I suggest, therefore, that if any change is contemplated it should be a mixture&mdash;not the social status of the individual for promotion &mdash;of educational qualifications, combined with a capacity to command.  I believe that could be brought about by combining, more so than is being done to-day, a system of competitive examinations with service qualifications.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin Metropolitan Division, particularly, you have a system whereby a man is promoted largely by reason of his seniority&mdash;<i>seniores priores.</i>  That very often means that the individual next on the seniority list may have been divorced from the proper performance of police duties for very long periods.  He comes out of his set, as it were, and he gets promotion despite the fact that he has not been performing police duties for many years.  I think that type of thing should cease.  If there is a case for promoting a man of that type, then he should be brought from the particular post that he is in&mdash;clerical or otherwise&mdash;and be placed on outdoor duty for 12 months or two years before he goes on to promotion.  Seniority may count in certain cases, but there is the fact, in the area mentioned, that men may reach the higher ranks of inspector or superintendent when they are really too old.  They are then marking time towards pension and are not concerned so much with the important matters around them.  You can get away from that system by enabling young men to get promotion early in life, certainly at not less than 35 or 40 years of age, to the higher ranks. Otherwise, you will have a dead weight of time servers, so to say, at the top who will squelch all initiative and energy in the ranks beneath them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to a recent case in Monaghan about which I would like to give my view.  This was a case <Col N="2082" /> in which two district justices disagreed. Deputy Dillon seemed to convery the impression that in a case of that kind there should be a fresh inquiry, a disciplinary inquiry, held by the commissioner.  I do not agree with that principle.  If a Guard is charged before the courts and is acquitted by the courts, it would be contrary to all legal principles to put him in jeopardy a second time by having a disciplinary investigation.  If there is any question of a disciplinary investigation, a decision should be taken in the first instance to have it, and end the matter there.  If you decide to take a particular individual to the court and charge him with a specific offence and the court acquits him, that also should end the matter.  I think it would be contrary to the Constitution to put a man in jeopardy twice.  If you bring a man in a disciplined force like the Gárda Síochána before a disciplinary inquiry, the penalty there may be far heavier than that which would be inflicted before an ordinary court. I would like to have myself recorded as being in entire disagreement with the principle put forward by Deputy Dillon.</P>
    <P>There was a good deal said the last day about complaints.  I do not want to go over that ground again, but I do seriously suggest to Deputies, and to the Minister, that when people come forward with complaints and allegations the best and wisest counsel to give them would be to remind them that they have legal rights and should go to a solicitor and assert their legal rights.  If members of the public complain that they have been wronged by the action of the Gárdí, and that the Gárdaí have abused their powers, I do not see why Deputies should be twisted into a machine for the ventilation of these allegations.  The proper course for such people to take is to seek legal redress, and if they have a case they will get their legal redress.  The alternative might be to advise them to report their case to the Minister or the commissioner.  If they do so, I have no doubt that such allegations as are made will receive impartial and fair investigation.</P>
    <P>Suggestions were thrown out on the <Col N="2083" /> last day that Deputies should have the right, more or less, to investigate these complaints and pass them along to the Minister.  I think if you were to allow a system of that kind to grow up you would upset the entire administration of the Gárda Síochána.  I am satisfied that it has now reached the stage where you have impersonal and impartial administration and where personal considerations&mdash;private opinions and that kind of thing&mdash; have no influence whatever.  I think it is only right, when the machine is working on that purely impersonal basis, that it should be allowed to continue and should not be interfered with, particularly by Deputies.  My advice to people who have grievances is that they should ventilate them in the proper manner, and that is in the courts of the land, or by way of complaint to the Minister.  Everyone, I suppose, has the right to make representation to the Minister to ensure that there is the pure administration of justice and the impartial enforcement of the law.  It is the right of every citizen to bring anything affecting him to the Minister's notice.  It is the privilege of Deputies to bring these matters to his notice, but what I have in mind are cases of personal spite and spleen when the law happens to hit a particular individual on the knuckles.  That sort of thing should not be done, and the machine should be allowed to work as the Civil Service machine works.</P>
    <P>In June last I raised with the Minister the question of the Land Registry fees.  I again direct his attention to the matter.  I agree entirely with the remarks of Deputy O'Connor on this subject.  The fees at present being charged are considerably more than the 100 per cent. increase represented by the Minister.  In some cases the increase runs up to 300 per cent., 400 per cent., 500 per cent. and even 600 per cent.  I want again to impress on the Minister that it was never the intention that the Land Registry should be a means for collecting revenue, or that it should be a self-sufficient unit of administration.  It was never intended that the registry fees would pay for the <Col N="2084" /> machinery of registration.  The whole principle underlying the setting up of the Land Registry was to provide a ready, accessible and cheap means of registering title.  In fact, the fees were made so low as to induce people to come forward to have title registered. Now we are getting to the opposite position.  The Minister says that the fees have been increased largely for the purpose of balancing up the cost of running the service and that sort of thing.  This is a considerable hardship, as the Minister must be aware, on solicitors.  In nine cases out of ten, it is the solicitor who has to put up the money to pay these fees and very often he has to wait 12 months, two years, or even longer before he gets his money back.  To compare the fees under the old scale with the new scale, in respect of a purchase price of £1,000, the old scale fee was £3; the new scale fee is £5 6s. 0d.  In respect of a purchase price of £3,500, the old scale fee was £6 5s. 0d.; the new scale fee is £13 1s.  For a voluntary transfer, say, from father to son, the old scale fee was £1 10s. 0d.; the new scale fee is £5 6s. 0d.  For a marriage settlement, the old scale fee was £3; the new scale fee is £5 6s.  For ordinary transmission to devisee under a will or next-of-kin on intestacy, the old scale fee was £1 10s.; the new scale fee is £5 6s.</P>
    <P>I regard these as very excessive charges, which are a burden upon the solicitors, who have to put up the money in the first instance, and a crippling burden upon the farming community.  I would stress again that the registry was never intended to be anything but a cheap and ready means of registering title and was never intended to pay for itself.  The present increases are contrary to the whole principle upon which the registry was originally set up.  If there is no other way out, I would seriously suggest to the Minister to consider Deputy O'Connor's suggestion, that is, to amalgamate the Registry of Deeds and the Land Registry and see whether or not a cheaper service can be evolved. Deputy O'Connor has quoted the figures and there is no comparison between the fees under the Registry of <Col N="2085" /> Deeds and those under the Land Registry.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said about the courts and the administration of justice.  I do not want to go over the ground covered by Deputy Costello and Deputy Cosgrave, but there are a few points to which I should like to direct the Minister's attention.  One is the question of vesting the High Court on circuit with full criminal and civil jurisdiction, subject to the right of any party to seek a change of venue.  At the present time people from the most remote parts of Ireland have to come to the High Court in Dublin and in serious criminal cases this involves considerable expenditure of public money.  A good deal of that expenditure could be avoided if the High Court on circuit had jurisdiction and if, in addition, there were a winter assize, such as there was in the old days.  I believe the jury system in certain areas might require a certain amount of revision if we were to attempt anything like that, but in the long run it would be a fairer and cheaper means of justice for the people than to drag them from Dingle or Donegal to Dublin.  At present the High Court on circuit is badly arranged.  As a rule, it sits in March and July.  These months are too near each other, and, if at all possible, I would seriously suggest some alteration in the arrangement to provide a longer interval between the two sittings.</P>
    <P>Litigants in some cases in Circuit Courts are at a considerable disadvantage in not being able to have a jury for certain civil actions.  That is a matter that might be considered, particularly in respect of borough areas and the larger towns; such as Galway, Kilkenny, Clonmel, Wexford, Sligo.  I should prefer to see the old jury system in operation in these larger towns.  I am afraid that the principle underlying the present system of having a jury of seven is to ensure convictions, and it would be fairer to the accused if the old system of having 12 jurors were in operation, particularly in the boroughs and the larger towns.</P>

      <Col N="2086" /> The matter of the ground rent agitation in Carndonagh has been already discussed in the House and I do not want to refer to it in any great detail, but I should like to know from the Minister under what authority the Gárda officers and members acted in the case of the recent seizures in Carndonagh. We had the extraordinary spectacle there of Pressmen's cameras being seized by Gárda officers.  Not only were their cameras seized, but the negatives were taken and, as I am informed, destroyed.  The Press was not allowed to publish pictures of the seizures.  I know that the Gárda have powers, under Emergency Powers Order, to seize certain photographs of ports, military barracks, military areas, and that kind of thing.  I doubt if they have power to seize cameras, as was done in the case of the evictions at Carndonagh, and I should like to know whether the members concerned acted on their own authority or on instructions from headquarters. This matter has caused considerable feeling in the area concerned and has caused considerable apprehension throughout the country, particularly where branches of the United Irish Leaseholders' Organisation are functioning. I wish to stress the importance of Carndonagh in this matter.  It took a Carrickshock in my constituency to end the tithe war and we are beginning to find some rumblings of serious trouble brewing which may come to a head if the matter of the relationship of landlord and tenant is not tackled in a practical fashion.</P>

It is probably being investigated and there may be civil proceedings arising out of it, but I do understand that the Guards prevented members of families from assisting aged people in making an inventory of the furniture and stock or whatever was being seized by the sheriff.  I understand that in certain cases that was done.  I also understand that the solicitor for the tenants was denied access to the tenants during the evictions when the tenants sought his advice and, in fact, was assaulted.  I mention these matters because I feel the time has come when the Minister must take up this question of ground rents.  If I cannot advocate new legislation, perhaps I might express disappointment that the Minister has not seen fit to introduce the long-promised Landlord and Tenant Bill.</P>

I cannot say if I am in order in this either, but it is a standing grievance with the members of the Gárda that they are denied the right to vote.  They will have no right to vote at the forthcoming Presidential election.  They have no right to vote at a Dáil election.  They may only participate in the local elections; they may record their vote at a local election.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of points affecting the Gárda Síochána of which I should like to remind the Minister. One is the question of the cleaning of barracks.  I know that the Minister is sympathetic in regard to that matter and has done his best with the Minister for Finance, but I would again ask him to use his good offices and to make a further effort to get the necessary allowance for the Gárda. Deputies may not be aware that the members of the Gárda have to pay for the cleaning of their own superior's office and the public rooms in barracks, which all of the members of the force do not use, and, in certain cases in the rural areas, for the entire cleaning of the barracks.  Up to recently that came completely out of the Gárda's pockets.  The Minister was instrumental in getting an allowance from the Minister for Finance of 2/- per man per month.  My information is that that allowance is inadequate in the case of the large stations; that it requires something like 5/- per man per month to be an adequate allowance for the purpose.  It is very unfair that members of the Gárda have to contribute to the cleansing of public offices. They are the only public servants who have to incur expenditure of that kind from their own pockets.  I think there is a good case to be made in this matter and I would again appeal to the Minister to try to remove this grievance.  In the case of rural stations the Gárda are entirely responsible for the cleansing of the stations and such allowance as they have been able to get is not at all adequate.  I ask the Minister, if at all possible, to raise this matter again in the hope that the Minister for Finance may see fit to increase the allowance.  It is a hardship in present times when money is scarce and when men with large families have not any money to throw away, particularly when they feel that this should be State expenditure.  I do not know of any case where public offices have to be cleansed at the expense of public servants except in the case of the Gárda.  It is an anomaly which exists in the service and I ask the Minister to make a further effort to remove it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in giving us the figures for the past year as to the various forms of breaches of the legal code indicated that in certain respects there has been a reduction as compared with 1943.  Everyone appreciates that there are possibly a number of causes for that.  First of all, the first wave of what one might call the onrush of emergency conditions has died down; people have become more steady.  Secondly, the general machinery for enforcing the law in respect of offences against various emergency Orders and having them accepted by the people has become more practicable.  What I am particularly concerned with is to what extent will we have a residue of these increased figures which have developed during the period of the emergency left with us when the emergency has gone.  I do not wish to traverse the whole ground, but only to deal with one point which nobody else has referred to and which seems to be ignored largely both by the Gárda authorities and by those responsible for the supervision of the Gárda authorities and those under them.  I want to refer particularly to a situation that is developing, so far as I am personally aware, in the City of Dublin.  We have got a condition developing there which is not merely a breeding ground of ordinary breaches of the law, the ordinary wild spirits which are usually said to go with youthfulness, but of a type of viciousness and lack of respect for other human beings which was symptomatic at certain times of large cities on the other side of the Irish Sea and which we have been in the habit of reading about in regard to cities on the North American Continent.  All of us are familiar through reading the papers with the lurid stories of so-called gangs and gang warfare in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder does the Minister realise that a position has developed in Dublin around certain dance halls, not run in any objectionable manner, but run on the basis of the utmost possible control by respectable groups of people and organisations; in which it is almost impossible to maintain any kind of order and, in certain cases, any <Col N="2091" /> kind of safety for ordinary decent people frequenting these halls?  I speak with particular knowledge of one hall which is within 50 yards of the main Gárda station in this city. Within recent weeks four weekly dances had to be closed down because of this development within our city. In different parts of the city we have groups or gangs some of which may have a criminal basis, but many of which are only that kind of loose association common to groups living in the same street and congregating round the same corners.  In those groups or gangs there has developed an atmosphere of viciousness and of complete disregard for any ordinary rights of people who may transgress or cut across the interests of the particular group.</P>
    <P>This has developed in the particular neighbourhood in which they reside and has spread right through the city. When one reads of a decent, well-ordered dance hall being cleared by a gentleman with a butcher's knife, one realises that the atmosphere here may not pass away with the emergency. When we consider the swollen figures for various forms of crime, we take some satisfaction in feeling that the emergency conditions have given rise to many of these offences and that the figures will drop when the atmosphere improves.  If we have an atmosphere in our main city, in which nearly a sixth of our population resides, in which we see the development of crime not merely from the economic and social causes with which we are familiar, but as a development of viciousness which has in many cases no relation at all to the economic conditions of the individual participating, then we realise that we are up against a very difficult problem.  We know of the situations that have developed in Glasgow, Sheffield and other towns, when we recall the development of the razor gangs.  There were many of those gangs completely dissociated from ordinary criminal activity and this same kind of development is taking place in Dublin.  It is not that these people are associated to pursue criminal activities, but rather, by <Col N="2092" /> their association, by their lack of social consciousness and responsibility and understanding of their duties as citizens, all that is bad and wrong in the ordinary human character is cultivated and brought to the surface and is looked upon as something to be emulated, not only by members of these groups but by younger boys and girls watching their activities.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Gárda authorities appreciate the magnitude of the problem or not.  I think they do, but there appears to be very little in the way of effective steps to deal with it.  Much of it is a type of problem that it is almost impossible for the ordinary police force to deal with.  My own experience is that by the time the Gárda authorities are brought on the scene the people who created the difficulties have disappeared. Some attention must be given to it, if not by the law enforcement officer, then by the Minister and the Government, charged not only with the enforcement of the law and the suppression of crime, but also with the proper upbringing of young people in a decent ordinary way of life.</P>
    <P>Attached to that particular problem is one to which there have been several references recently&mdash;the question of child delinquency.  Some time ago I put a question to the Minister in the House as to whether he considered having an inquiry held into the general problem.  He did not seem to be particularly sympathetic to that. It is a problem which requires more consideration than that which has been given to it by debates in this House or in the day-to-day administration of various State Departments and sections of the Local Government authorities concerned.  Each one has his own idea as to the cause of juvenile delinquency.  There is substantial agreement in regard to the social and economic causes, though there may be some difficulty in agreement regarding the lack of parental control, the effect of the cinema, and so on.  One thing on which there has been no agreement is as to the type of solution which can be applied to the problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2093" /> We have at present sitting a Government commission on youth unemployment. Surely, directly connected with that problem is the problem of juvenile delinquency?  The official figures show that the largest number of cases requiring attention either by the Gárdaí or by the Children's Court lie within the age group 14-17.  If the Government felt that the problem of unemployment amongst juveniles required the attention of a very representative and authoritative commission, surely the other question of the child as a possible delinquent does require some attention?  It would not be out of place for the Minister to consider appointing a number of persons, not only interested but with expert knowledge, who might be able to find some partial solution.  I do not see that any complete solution can be found as long as we have the present basic economic and social conditions, creating homes in which the child cannot grow up with the possibility of becoming a normal citizen, creating conditions of life for the parents that make it impossible for them to exercise proper control over their children and give them proper care and attention, proper schooling and a proper opportunity to start in life.</P>
    <P>In many of the cases to which Deputy Dillon referred last week on another debate, medical and psychological treatment is necessary, but there are other forms of treatment that may be applied to many of these cases which, while not reducing the problem to infinitesimal proportions, at least would save it from developing on a larger scale.  It would save many of these children from becoming part of a larger problem of criminals operating in city and country.</P>
    <P>Another point which was raised before was the possibility of inquiring into the general provisions for providing free legal aid to people in poor circumstances who require it in order that they may avail themselves of their rights under the law or be able to defend themselves in regard to charges or actions in which they may be involved. This matter has been receiving fairly wide consideration in England.  As far as I am aware, there are two inquiries going on at present <Col N="2094" /> or just concluded&mdash;one officially by the Lord Chancellor's Department and the other by the Incorporated Law Society.  Their purpose was to improve the system and provide a much broader one than existed heretofore in that country, where the provisions even at present are much better than we have here.  We are in an invidious position when we pass laws for the protection of citizens or to regulate their conduct, and then, because a poor man or woman has not got the wherewithal to obtain expert legal advice, they are unable to obtain their rights, especially in civil cases, or they are debarred or deprived of their rights because they are not able to defend themselves.</P>
    <P>Those of us who take a certain interest and active part in ordinary social activities connected with the Labour movement or with charitable organisations of one kind or another know that, every day, we have the problem of men and women threatened with eviction from their homes over some clear legal point or some obscure legal point.  They can get legal advice, if they are able to go to solicitors, but whether that is a good thing or not I do not know.  The Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures and other members of his Party poured scorn on the legal profession some time ago, in another debate, and regarded its members as mere fee-chasers.  I do not hold that opinion.  There are very few exceptions in the profession as a whole and what may be the drawbacks of the profession are not the responsibility of the profession, but the result of the peculiar legal code which we have allowed to develop.  It has reached a point where, in even the simplest legal action, expert legal advice is necessary if the plaintiff or defendant is to receive what he is normally entitled to under the law. That is something for which we should try to find a solution.</P>
    <P>It should not be possible&mdash;and it has happened every day in the week&mdash; for an ordinary working-class family to lose possession of a home through ignorance or poverty.  They are made the victims of the law, quite legally and properly, by the landlord or, possibly, <Col N="2095" /> in the case of disturbance or annoyance, by some other tenant living in the same house.  We should have some method of providing free legal advice and of offering representation in court.  There could at least be some bureau or central advice depot where, in a simple way, they could be informed of the legal position, so that, if they could not be legally represented in court, at least they would know exactly what they were facing and what steps they could take to protect themselves.</P>
    <P>I wish to close by referring to another matter which is of a somewhat difficult nature.  It has been referred to already in the debate and I believe it has been common in the last few years.  It is in regard to certain prisoners now serving sentence in Portlaoighise Prison.  Since 1943, when a debate was initiated in this House on the general question of the treatment of political prisoners, there has been some improvement; and we should, in a general way, compliment both the Minister and the Government on the change in their attitude.  That change has been largely successful.  During that period there has been a considerable reduction in the number of men detained.  They were let out under varying conditions, some on parole and some unconditionally.  So far as I am aware, I do not think the Minister has any complaint to make because of his more conciliatory attitude; I do not think he can say that it has not been justified.</P>
    <P>As regards crimes arising out of the existence of unlawful associations, he told us, in his opening statement he was glad that the past year was peaceful. That, I think, is a justification of the policy he has been following since 1943 in relation to these men who were detained, the majority of them without trial.  I think the Minister could relate that same policy to the position existing in Portlaoighise.  He should not regard the situation from any narrow viewpoint.  We are told that these men have refused to obey certain rules and regulations, but I suggest that we should look at the matter from a wider <Col N="2096" /> point of view.  A good deal of progress has been made in the direction of encouraging citizens to engage in ordinary peaceful methods of political activity rather than adopt other forms of activity, and I do not think that the Minister or the Government should hesitate to take other steps if they will bring them nearer the goal of having that idea generally accepted.  So long as we have a situation such as exists in Portlaoighise, I think it will be difficult.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to argue that because of the association of these men in Portlaoighise with a particular organisation they are entitled to special treatment.  I do not argue that, because I realise that the Minister has a completely contrary point of view. I will, however, put this point to him. If three men are tried before the same court for the same type of offence and they are sentenced, why is it that one is sent to Portlaoighise to become the subject of a particular set of circumstances there and is therefore in a certain way a sufferer, while the other two are sent to an internment camp where the conditions are not so objectionable? I am not suggesting, as has been suggested outside, that this was due to discrimination.  I do not think that is the position.</P>
    <P>The Minister gives us a total of 55 prisoners serving sentences imposed by the Special Military Court and 104 persons detained under the Emergency Powers Orders, making a total of 159. As far as I understand, some 130 are in the internment camp at the Curragh and we have about 29 between Mountjoy and Portlaoighise.  Of those in Portlaoighise some are serving sentences for exactly the same type of offence&mdash;possibly they were tried by the same court&mdash;as men serving sentences elsewhere.  That gives rise to a certain suspicion that should be removed. There is, as the Minister is aware, because of the documents he quoted in the House, a large number of complaints in regard to the treatment. I suggest, as he has found it possible to take a broad and human view in relation to the detention of certain prisoners, that he should be <Col N="2097" /> equally big enough to find a solution of the Portlaoighise problem.</P>
    <P>It is very easy for members of the House to use words the Minister or members of his Party uttered in years gone by against them now; it may be a very good form of debate for some people, but I do not think it gets us anywhere.  I suggest that in the cases of certain men serving sentences in Portlaoighise, whatever may have been their point of view and however unjustified their actions may have been, there can be no doubt that their motives were political.  There may be some doubt in regard to men involved in the round-up, but in other cases, whether you are of the opinion that the men should be hanged or imprisoned, you cannot deny that they were prompted by political motives. When Deputies are in opposition it is possible that they have a different viewpoint from what they would have if they were associated with the Government.  I think the Minister might try to look at this matter from the angle from which he used to view it when he was in opposition.  I agree that the circumstances have altered as compared with 1924, but even so, I think we should try to appreciate what is in the minds of men who are serving sentences and, above all, that section of the Irish people who have not yet fully accepted the changed conditions in this country.</P>
    <P>I do not deny that facilities are provided for visiting persons detained in Portlaoighise, even by members of my own Party, but I suggest in all sincerity that some effort should be made to get over the impasse there. Let us not have the position where a man, whose child dies through a certain foolish action on the part of his wife, is not able to see his dead child or wife and has no knowledge of what has occurred until some time afterwards. None of us would like to see that situation continuing.  I appeal to the Minister, apart altogether from ordinary human considerations, to remedy the condition of affairs at Portlaoighise.</P>
    <P>I have refrained from referring to certain other matters that I raised in the House some months ago, because <Col N="2098" /> I do not want to cause any irritation or get back to old grounds.  I think it would be better to get rid of that atmosphere.  Reference has been made to certain complaints in relation to the Gárda as a body and to individual members.  I have no complaints of that nature.  If I had any such complaints I would quickly bring them forward.  I know that there is a general feeling of uneasiness, and because of the existence of that feeling of uneasiness, I think there should be closer supervision with reference to the discipline exercised in the police force.  Above all, there should be a better sense of responsibility, because there are tremendous powers placed in the hands of the Gárdaí.</P>
    <P>One incident was quoted by Deputy Coogan with reference to seizing cameras.  That is somewhat similar to what I referred to months ago, when posters and other articles were seized in the city.  That is a bad development in any police force, because it indicates that either the Executive or the police, on certain occasions when they feel it suits their particular end, can abuse the powers given for the protection of the citizens.  What I regretted in that particular instance of the seizure of posters was not the general attitude of the Minister, but that, without even knowing what incidents occurred, he was prepared to say that he stood over everything the Guards had done in the city at that time.  It is not a good thing.  There should be, on the one hand, an acceptance that on every occasion on which a complaint is made against the Gárda a public inquiry will not automatically be held, but, on the other, very painstaking care on the part of the Minister and the Gárda authorities to see that all members of the Gárda, and especially the higher officers, are fully aware that there must be certain standards, that no departure from them will be allowed, that the main responsibility on them is not merely the suppression of crime in its more lurid forms, such as we read in the newspapers, but, above all, the protection of the citizens as a whole and the care and fostering of the interests of the citizens because <Col N="2099" /> they are not merely the people who pay the piper but the people who are entitled to call the tune and the people for whose protection the Guards and the whole system of law enforcement are primarily set up.  No departure from that should be allowed, and where instances occur, such as one or two of those which occurred lately, which might give rise to a lack of faith on the part of the public, to a doubt as to the complete disinterestedness of the Guards either as a body or as individuals, even if it does mean, as Deputy Coogan said, a possible penalisation of the individual, some steps should be taken to assure the public that they are being fully inquired into and to satisfy them that nothing has occurred which cannot stand the fullest investigation.</P>

      <P>With the bulk of Deputy Larkin's speech, I thoroughly agree, but with certain portions I find myself incomplete disagreement and to the extent to which there is complete disagreement, I think it can be explained by a different point of view. I look at things in this way: this State is nearly 23 years old and in the past there was very heated, very acute, political tension and a particular type of offences against the law in those days.  There was a reasonable case for urging that there was a strict dividing line between ordinary crime and political crime in those days, but at this stage of our history I am inclined to get a little impatient when the case is put forward that, when two men rob a bank&mdash;one because his family is starving and the other because he feels encouraged by the fact that he belongs to a semiarmed organisation&mdash;more leniency should be shown in the latter case, where the individual has not the justification of a starving family, than in the earlier case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we have reached a point when crimes against the person and crimes against property should be regarded as equal, no matter who commits them.  I have, as a matter of principle, always faced up to the fact that whoever sits on the Government <Col N="2100" /> Bench, responsible for the administration of justice, for the safety of life and the safety of property, should be interfered with to the very minimum by Deputies or by debates in this House.  There is a very grave and worrying responsibility on any person who finds himself responsible for depriving another person of his liberty, for keeping another in jail, particularly if the friends and family of the person in jail are decent, upright and exemplary citizens; but there is a much greater responsibility on the individual charged with the administration of justice, with ensuring respect for the law and the safety of personal property, if, in a weak moment, he too hastily opens the jail gates and takes responsibility for letting loose on the country again those who are a menace to the country.</P>
    <P>I remember well sitting on these benches when an appeal was made to the Government&mdash;an appeal supported, I think, by all Parties&mdash;to release certain people because they appeared to be in danger of death through hunger-strike or defiance of prison regulations. The Taoiseach came in here and told us that if, because of the objection of everyone of us had to seeing any Irishman die, that argument was to be used, if regulations were to be defied and the people concerned released, it would mean the end of all law in the country, that one batch of prisoners would follow the example of another and that it was impossible to release such people. Unfortunately, the heart conquered the head subsequently, and the particular men were released.  The outcome was that within a very short time we had a tragic shooting in Dublin in which three or four men lost their lives, the centrepiece being the man released before his time.</P>
    <P>If we have a Department responsible for the administration of justice, if we have a Department responsible for the policing of the country, we have reached a point in the development of this State at which we should have enough confidence in them to close our ears to propaganda of all sorts and to allow the administration <Col N="2101" /> of justice to sail along on an even keel, without interference, no matter how well-intentioned or to what extent prompted by sentiment or emotion.</P>
    <P>I listened to my colleague, Deputy Flanagan, a Deputy with whom I am happy to say I rarely find myself in disagreement, and I was sorry to find him in his emotional spirit being influenced by propaganda, and, because of the propaganda operating on him, making a thoroughly unjust attack on the whole administration in Portlaoighise Prison.  The game of prisoner and jailer will always go on.  Most Deputies at one time or another were on the wrong side of bars or the wrong side of wires, and we know the propaganda that flooded this country, and in fact a greater part of Western Europe, with regard to conditions in these jails and camps.  It was such that, when we came out and read that propaganda, we began to think that we were thundering great men to have lived through that kind of thing without knowing it ever happened.</P>
    <P>That is the ordinary legitimate game which goes on between those on the inside of the bars and those whose duty it is to keep them there.  It is a perfectly understandable game.  It is the function of the inmates to make as much difficulty as possible for those whose painful duty it is to keep them in, and reasonable people know that. Reasonable people, therefore, should evaluate propaganda at its proper worth and not on its face value.  The suggestion contained in the Deputy's statement was to the effect that prisoners in Portlaoighise were kicked around like animals, that medically they were neglected by the medical officer of health, and that conditions were such that they were prevented from going to the Sacraments.</P>
    <P>We have to remember that the governor, the warders, the doctor and the chaplains are decent, human, charitable Christians like ourselves.  I knew most of the warders as boys.  The balance I know as men.  The idea that those decent, Christian warders, whose origins we know, are of that brutal beastly type that they would kick an unfortunate prisoner around the jail <Col N="2102" /> like animals, and it is only a brute that would kick an animal and it is only a real demon that would kick a human being about, and that we should have it declared in this Irish Parliament that those blood-brothers of ours are monsters and beasts of that kind, should not be allowed to go without challenge.  It is like suggesting that a medical man would neglect his patients, and such a suggestion would only be made by a person who did not understand the implications of such a charge.  It is the foullest charge that one could make against a member of the medical profession&mdash;that he had neglected his patients.  No doctor would resent half as strongly the charge that he had murdered a hobo as that he had neglected the patients entrusted to his care.  The rule in the profession is that if a charge of neglecting a patient were made against a member of it, and if it was found to be true, he would be deprived of his professional diplomas.  Deputies hold a position of responsibility and should take their position seriously.  Therefore, charges of that kind should not be bandied around here.  In this House we have representatives from every county.  We have the Press of the world taking down what is said, and that will be quoted as being true, merely because the charges were made by a Deputy in Parliament.</P>
    <P>Prison regulations are, of course, severe.  Within the prison there must be some system of dealing with those who defy the prison regulations.  In other words, within the jail itself there must be further systems of punishment.  They may be too harsh. That is a matter for the Minister and his Department to look into.  By reason of the money voted by this House, the officers and officials of the prison are bound to carry out the regulations.  There should not be confused thinking as between the regulations and the unfortunate human instruments that have to carry them out.  I am perfectly certain from what I know of the governor and the staff in that particular prison, from what I know of the visiting chaplains and of the visiting medical men, that if even one man in that <Col N="2103" /> prison was subjected to any form of punishment, outside what the regulations define, they would throw up their positions rather than continue to serve.  I will say this, that you have not to live six miles away from that prison to know what goes on inside. Every one of us has contacts, and we know whether there is a regime of humanity there under the rules or otherwise.  There was the suggestion of demanding an inquiry.  Of course, that is part of the game.  If a prisoner is to get an inquiry every time he distributes pamphlets, let us examine what the effect of holding it will be. The inquiry is held and it exonerates the staff but, nevertheless, the mental impression that is left is that, if those in charge carry out the regulations, there will be an inquiry.  That means that the honesty and effectiveness of the staff are undermined by the threat and the clamour for an inquiry.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to the present Government, and, as regards many of the things they do, I thoroughly resent them.  I am perfectly satisfied, however, that the services operating under them&mdash;in our police force, in our Army and our prison service&mdash;are carrying out their duties in a perfectly honourable and humane manner.  In the course of this debate we heard a lot about the Civic Guards, about the administration and conduct of the Civic Guards.  Reference was made to their pay.  The general opinion was that it was too small since the cost of living is rising and salaries are not. I would be inclined to agree with that. At the same time, I would like to say that if the pay inside such a service is to be increased it should be done by effecting economies within the service, economies that would not interfere with its efficiency.  I do not think I have ever seen any force run in such an uneconomical and unbusiness like manner as our police force.  I can see in it ample room for carrying out sensible economies that, I think, would increase its efficiency.  Suppose you go into any of the big barracks here in Dublin, what is the first thing that will hit you in the eye?  You will see a fine strapping young Irishman, probably <Col N="2104" /> 6ft. 4in. in height, broad in proportion and about 30 years of age, putting in his life tapping a typewriter.  Beside him you will see a bigger kind of man that should be out dealing with the turbulent elements in our community that Deputy Larkin referred to, and he is engaged writing records&mdash;census work or some other sort of clerical work.  I ask Deputies to consider the lunacy of that.  Suppose you had that sort of thing in an engineer's office: that you had to have an engineer typewriting and keeping diaries, surely the cost of engineering would be such that all of us would have to live in mud cabins.  Suppose you had that kind of thing in a hospital, that every post from ledger clerk up had to be filled by a doctor, on doctor's pay, the cost of illness would be absolutely prohibitive, while the number of people that could get into a hospital would be nil. But in our police force, every single duty that could be carried out by a boy clerk is carried out by a fully paid policeman.  While that is so, we have not enough men outside the doors of the police barracks to do police duty efficiently.</P>
    <P>If one says that that system ought to be changed, it probably will sound revolutionary, simply because we have grown accustomed to it.  The Army is as virile a body as the police force, and is a body that is expected to be far more mobile.  There is no geographical fixation about the Army. The lighter and easier clerical work is done by clerks and typists, and not necessarily by soldiers, although those people are in most cases more costly than soldiers.  But go to the depot or to any police headquarters in Dublin at lunch time, and you will see the manhood that pours out from behind typewriters&mdash;a body that would beat half the world physically. I consider that not only an insane, but an unbusinesslike type of administration. I consider it a type of administration that has no regard to the matter of giving taxpayers value for their money.  If that is one side of the picture, and if the other side of the picture is that we have not enough men, available adequately and efficiently to police this country, then <Col N="2105" /> surely there is something wrong.  I venture to say to the Minister that, at any given moment, we have not one-tenth of our police force engaged on police duties proper.  Police duties proper, to my mind, are the protection of person and property, the prevention of crime and the detection of crime.  Walk into any country barracks. Have a look at the diary. Find out how the four or five men are engaged on any given day.  What will you learn?  One Guard is out taking tillage returns.  He is out ascertaining how many acres are under tillage, what stock the farmers are carrying and how many hens and ducks they have.  Another Guard is four or five miles away, taking samples of food and drugs.  Another Guard is at the far end of the parish hunting down particulars about some child who is absent from school.  If I put down a question next week in Dáil Éireann to inquire from the Minister for Agriculture how many greyhounds there are in Ireland, the following week members of the Civic Guard will be traversing the country, like greyhounds, to get the material to answer that question.</P>
    <P>I am not criticising.  I am putting it to the Minister that he should look into the machine.  Perhaps the Minister will be pleased to have my remarks and to pass them on to other Departments.  The Irish police force is made the runner boy of every Department in this State.  If there is any information required, the task of getting it is thrown to the Guards.  So much so that, out of any five Guards in any town or village in this country at any time, not more than one of them is engaged on police duty.  There must always be a man in the barracks. The man who is on night duty is entitled to rest in the day.  That means one man sleeping and one man on night duty.  One, if not more than one, of the three that are left is always engaged on duty other than police work.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the increase in crime&mdash;a thing we all deplore. There have been discussions and debate after debate with regard to the increase in juvenile crime.  I do not <Col N="2106" /> believe that the R.I.C. was a larger body than the Gárda Síochána but to the very greatest extent they were confined to police duties.  There was very little extra work thrown on them. We had not at that time all the departments that we have now.  We had not every department frenzied to get its statistics right, the easiest medium for getting statistics being the Civic Guards.  In any one of our villages, at any time, there were two or three R.I.C. men apparently lolling about. There was one on the bridge in the middle of the town.  There was another at some tough end of the town, and a third just exercising his cane, walking around the place.  But those men knew the bad boys and the bad boys were good boys as long as they felt they were under observation.  The mere perambulation of two or three R.I.C. men, singly, at different times, around different parts of our towns, the mere sight of them, prevented quite an amount of crime.  They were not off checking up the number of greyhounds; they were not off finding out the amount of tillage; the school authorities, public opinion and the clergymen insisted on school children being at school and week after week it was impressed on the parents that that was their responsibility.  It was not necessary to have a six foot Guard to tote the children into school.  Police work was being done and, leaving out the times when it got mixed up with political movements in the country and lost the confidence of the people, that force was a particularly efficient force. It was recruited from the same type of people as we have in the Gárda. What is wrong with our Civic Guards is that they are not allowed, they have not sufficient time, to carry out police duties proper and when the wilder, more lawless spirits in any community, whether they are adults or juveniles, feel that there is not ample or adequate police supervision over the activities of individuals, all over their area, then it is a case of the old story, when the cat is away, the mice will play.  The criminals play when the police are engaged in other duties.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan urged the advisability of ensuring that no more outside <Col N="2107" /> duties will be thrown on the police.  I would urge the Minister to have some kind of investigation as to how the police in rural barracks are employed from day to day.  I venture to say that he will find on any given day he likes to take a spot check, that all those members are busy, they are all putting down a hard day's work, but not more than one in three is engaged on police work proper.  The answer from the Government may be that it is necessary to get all the material to answer Deputies' questions, that it is necessary to know the amount of tillage that is being carried out, that it is necessary to know the amount of stock that is being carried by the farmers in different parishes, that it is necessary to have sampling of food and drugs, etc.  I agree, but would it not be sounder economy to have a parish clerk paid 50/- a week for getting together all these statistics that are required than to have a big hefty, £4-a-week policeman doing it? Would it not be far better, more expertly, done by the person whose vocation in life is that of a clerk than by a man whose very physique gets him the particular post he has?  You would be saving public funds and you would be carrying out more efficiently the purpose for which a police force is maintained.</P>
    <P>As for sampling and that kind of thing, you have a development of posts of county sanitary inspectors; highly qualified men carrying diplomas, whose day-to-day duties take them all over a county; people specially trained in all forms of sampling.  Surely somebody should investigate what duties now thrown on the police force should be taken off their shoulders and thrown on some existing officer of the State. You have three officers, one of them a policeman, covering the same road day after day.  The policeman is not doing police duties, but doing some form of public health duty or some form of statistical duty.  You can have the public health officer I referred to, the tillage inspector, and a member of the Gárda all belting along the same road on any given day, and the policeman going that road to do the duty <Col N="2108" /> either of the public health man or the tillage man and thereby forced by circumstances to neglect his duty as a policeman and to leave the public without the protection they are paying for and without the type of force they are entitled to expect, in view of the amount of money it entails.  I am not criticising the Minister or his Department or the force in question.  On the whole, I think we are entitled to be proud of the kind of force that has been brought about so early in the existence of this State.  I believe it irritates these men not to be allowed to do the particular work of the particular profession they take up.  Many of them find that for threequarters of their time they are engaged actively in some form of work that has nothing to do with police work.</P>
    <P>Just one word with regard to the courts.  I agree absolutely with Deputy Larkin in his advocacy of some assistance to poor people hauled before our courts.  Any of us who has had experience of police courts time and again have seen people dragged up there.  The whole atmosphere of the police courts paralyses their tongues.  The charge is read out against them and they do not appreciate really what it is all about.  There is a queue of hundreds of others to be dealt with.  Sentence is imposed and, before they know it, they have been convicted.  Sometimes it is a fine and sometimes loss of liberty.  Then you will get a similar type of case coming up fifth on the list.  The person concerned may be slightly better off and be legally represented and may be charged with a similar offence.  The defence is put up by the legal man and the person concerned is not convicted.  This may be a very expensive suggestion to make, but I think it is a thing that should be looked into; that unfortunates should not lose their liberty without being competently defended. The justices are working against the clock and now and then we become aware of very serious mistakes.  The police get evidence that young John Brown did something.  They collar young John Brown and he is brought before the court.  His parents have <Col N="2109" /> never been in court before and the youngster is overawed by the court and is convicted.  It may turn out that it is the wrong John Brown and that the wrong John Brown was elsewhere at the time the offence was committed.  I am not putting a concrete case but the kind of thing which is liable to happen.  A case is made and there is no answer to the case.  There are alibis which are never brought forward.  People have not sufficient self-confidence or courage to do it.  That is one aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>Another thing about the courts, and perhaps it is not so revolutionary, is this.  Departments have been engaged for the best part of five years manufacturing crimes, making crimes to-day what were not crimes before.  Emergency Orders are being poured out like sausages out of a machine and these Orders have the effect of law.  So much so, that we have reached the point that it is a major offence against the laws of the country to neglect , to use a fashionable word, to be slovenly in the keeping of books, or registers, or records.  Day after day, traders and industrialists are hauled up before our courts for newly manufactured offences.  A conviction by the court may mean loss of liberty or a fine; in most cases it means loss of livelihood, being deprived of the supplies through which they live. Obviously they must go to the last halfpenny so that they may be adequately defended.  Frequently the charge is not proved against them and they are found not guilty and acquitted.  But they are bankrupt as a result of the cost of the defence they have to put up.</P>
    <P>Now, I would suggest, with full conviction, that where the State brings people before the court and these people are committed to very heavy expenditure in order to clear their name, to clear their character, to protect their livelihood, and a court of this land finds them not guilty then, just the same as in civil actions, the State should pay.  It is no consolation to a man or his family to go out of court cleared of the charge but bankrupt and crippled in business.  That <Col N="2110" /> matter should be looked into.  It was not as urgent in normal times as it is now.  But when we have traders and others brought up day after day for offences that were not offences a few years ago, then I think it is essential that the State should be made to be careful that, in fact, there has been a gross violation of the law before they put people in the dock.  The only way to make them careful is to ensure that the State will pay the piper when the court finds that the person charged is not guilty.</P>
    <P>As I am on that point, might I say, without any bitterness in my mind, that many years ago special courts were established because jurymen were been dropped in their tracks in the City of Dublin and because any of them who escaped with their lives were being intimidated and could not do their job as jurymen?  In the face of the noisiest, but I would say well-intentioned, protest ever raised in Parliament, special military courts were established to deal with certain classes of organised crime, backed up by guns.  It was an undesirable departure from every well-established legal principle, but the circumstances and the times made such an undesirable course necessary.  There was never any idea that such courts would function for any class of crime except crime that was organised and supported by armed violence.  Now we have reached the point where that type of court is being used to deal with traders who do not keep their books properly, who sell an extra ½ oz. of tea to a customer, or who secure an extra lb. of tea which is not shown in the ledger.</P>
    <P>Of all the lunacy that ever was grafted on a country with a wild record in the past, that is the most exaggerated form of lunacy&mdash;that the ordinary courts cannot be relied on adequately and competently to try a woman or a man, a simple trader down the country, for selling or buying tea in excess of the allowance.  Is there any defence under heaven for bringing these cases before a special military court, designed to deal with armed crime and armed conspiracy? If there is any excuse or defence for <Col N="2111" /> such a procedure, it can only be that it is easier to find the person guilty in a court that does not understand law.  If that is the answer&mdash;and I can see no other&mdash;then the whole administration is rotten.  If you cannot give the people law as decided by lawyers, if you cannot give the people justice as meted out by the courts of justice and the judges, then it is not either law or justice that they are getting in the other type of court.</P>
    <P>There were references here to juvenile crime.  One of the things that requires more serious attention than the actual increase in crime is juvenile crime.  Every reference to it in the course of this debate naturally impinged on the Department of Education.  I would point out to the Minister that where citizens are made, where citizenship is bred in every country, is in the schools.  The school curriculum is so overloaded with instruction that every minute of the school day is booked up, from the time the school opens in the morning until it closes in the afternoon, and there is no half hour left for instruction in civics and in citizenship, for instruction of the type calculated to produce better men and women and better citizens.  If we send them out of our schools, deliberately ignorant of their responsibilities as citizens, their responsibilities to neighbour or to State, then there is no good in our bemoaning the fact that juvenile crime is on the increase.</P>
    <P>I well remember the old schoolmaster and the old school system, where there was not an overloaded curriculum. Whether the people were as well educated or not is a debatable point.  The old schoolmaster and schoolmistress of the past always ensured that, when their pupils left the school, they were pupils which they were proud to own and to claim in the future as having been their pupils. They felt that it was a slur on them if their pupils misconducted themselves after school hours.  They made themselves responsible, not only for the amount of instruction and for the conduct of the child at school, but also for the conduct of the child after <Col N="2112" /> school and for the conduct of the man and girl years after they left school. They were able to do that because they had ample time, now and then in the course of the week, to talk civics, to talk citizenship, to instruct as to how a neighbour should behave, how an employer should behave towards his employee and an employee towards his employer.  That kind of instruction equips one better for life than a deeper and more intense knowledge of the capitals and the rivers of far away Asia.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Connor, who is a comparatively young and yet a very eloquent member of this House, paid a glowing tribute to the Minister during this debate in these words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I cannot recall any period in the history of our State when there was in the minds of all decent men a more widespread confidence in the administration of the law than there has been under the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I accept that as a very sincere tribute from an eloquent member of the Fianna Fáil Party to his political friend, the Minister.  However, when you go on further in the debate and read what has been said by a man with a wiser head and with much longer experience of the administration of law, you find that Deputy Costello, with practically a quarter of a century of experience at the Senior Bar,. says, as reported at column 1974 of Volume 96 of the Official Debates:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I feel that the rights and liberties we are supposed to have under the Constitution, the right of free speech and the right of trial by jury, are being corroded and eroded&mdash;perhaps in a manner that is not too manifest at the moment or that is clearly observed by the general public&mdash;and that in a very short time, unless the people wake up to the facts of the situation, they may find themselves deprived of many of the rights and liberties which are supposed to be stated in the Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently, he was referring to the question of trial by jury and the <Col N="2113" /> attempt to get rid of that system, as, in another phrase, he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There has also been a sort of, shall I call it, unexpressed or at any rate partially expressed view, that juries ought to be got rid of, and some step was taken in that direction when the number of jurors in Circuit Courts throughout the country was reduced from 12 to seven.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I regard these as very important statements, coming from a man with wide experience at the Bar, from a member of this House who, in my opinion, expresses his views in a judicial way rather than in a politically-minded way.  I am sure the Minister would regard statements of that kind, coming even from a lawyer who is one of his political opponents, as based on some sound ground.  That is why I wish to ask the Minister, like Deputy O'Higgins, who is responsible for the policy of referring to the special criminal courts cases which were always intended to be dealt with by civil courts. I strongly support the concluding remarks of Deputy O'Higgins in regard to this particular matter.  I regard it as a very dangerous development at a time when the country is in a comparatively peaceful condition.</P>
    <P>I should like to know is it the Government as a body, is it the Minister advised by the Attorney-General, or is it the Attorney-General himself who is responsible for referring a very important case that has been at hearing for 13 or 14 days in the Special Criminal Court.  I am not certain who is responsible and that is why I am asking this question.  I hope the Minister will answer it.  That kind of case, so far as one reads from the summarised version given in the daily papers, is one that should be dealt with by judges of long experience, assisted by a jury.  I think it is very unfair that a big case of that kind, in which important legal points have been raised, should be handed over to a group of Army officers.  I am quite certain they could deal out evenhanded justice without the knowledge of the law which they should have in <Col N="2114" /> dealing with intricate cases of that kind, but at the same time I do not think they are the persons most suited to hear such cases.  Surely, experienced judges, whether in the Circuit Criminal Court or whatever senior court would be concerned, assisted by a jury, would be the proper machinery for dealing with those cases.  I take it Deputy Costello's fears, as expressed in the words I have read out, are based on that kind of activity and that he fears&mdash;I have not had any conversation with him on this subject and I do not know&mdash;a further development of that kind and a complete departure from the democratic custom of having cases like this one tried by a judge and jury.</P>
    <P>There is another very serious development which, I think, is noted by the average citizen, and particularly by jurymen in Dublin City who have been engaged for long periods in the trials of certain cases which have had to be retried by another judge and jury.  Will the Minister give us the number of trials in the Criminal Court which had to be retried?  Will he give us the cost of retrials?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>The Minister for Finance, on a recent occasion in this House, in my hearing, stated he regarded that kind of development as a very serious matter for the Government&mdash;I <Col N="2115" /> presume for the Government, or those responsible for advising the Government in legal matters.</P>
      <P>I have read, as everybody else has read, a very long list of charges preferred against a citizen in the District Court some time ago.  The charges were listed in the District Court and the case was referred to a higher court for trial by a judge and jury. The jury disagreed in regard to one section of these charges and there was a retrial.  On the retrial, when a section of the charges had been dealt with, the person acting for the Attorney-General indicated that all the other charges against this defendant were being withdrawn.  Were they withdrawn because the charges, in the first instance, were unfounded, or was it that they could not be proved in law?  If so, such a statement should have been made in court at the time when the other serious charges, previously made in the lower court and listed and published in the daily papers, were withdrawn.</P>
      <P>If a person is wrongly charged with a serious offence and that charge is withdrawn on the instructions of the Attorney-General, I think an explanation for the withdrawal should be given in court, or should be given in this House by the Minister.  I will tell you why that should be done. People suggest that the charges originally made in the lower court have been withdrawn as a result of pressure of some kind or other on the Minister, on the Attorney-General, or on somebody else.  That is why an explanation should be given if a case of that kind ever crops up again in the courts, when serious charges are made and then withdrawn.  It is only fair to the citizen concerned that some statement should be made as to why the charges have to be withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard and read statements made here by Deputies with regard to the administration of the Gárda Síochána.  I have been a member of the House since it was established. One of the things I made up my mind upon in the early stages of my political career was that I would not drag individual cases concerning the <Col N="2116" /> administration of the law by the Guards into the House, and whenever I had a complaint against a Guard I would send it to the Commissioner for investigation.  I think I have lived up to that.  I do not think I ever troubled a Minister with a complaint of that sort.  I cannot recollect doing so.  I may have sent a few complaints to the Commissioner for investigation. Generally speaking, I found that the Guards have done their duty, under very difficult circumstances at certain periods of their existence, in a satisfactory way.  At the same time, I know that, as regards a certain type of sergeant, who believes in the red-tape administration of the licensing laws, whenever he carries out his duty in a country town or village in that red-tape way, complaints come to Deputies and others from the licensed traders concerned, but I have never interfered in cases of that kind.  I cannot recollect having done so.</P>
    <P>I know of at least one person&mdash;I cannot describe him as anything else except a political tout&mdash;who has been going round my constituency, particularly during the last two elections, boasting that he has succeeded in getting certain things done&mdash;Guards shifted and prosecutions quashed&mdash;and he has used the name of the Minister in connection with these matters.</P>

      <P>The Minister, as well as being Minister for Justice, is one of the true bosses of the Government Party and, as such, naturally he must make himself readily available and accessible to political agents in every part of the country.  If the Minister gets representations from political supporters in the country in regard to the conduct or misconduct of Guards, and if a case is made for their removal, I suggest, and I make the suggestion with the greatest possible respect, that to avoid things of this kind in the future, the Minister should return the complaint to the individual concerned and tell him he should communicate directly with the Commissioner, the person who is responsible.  I accept the Minister's statement that this gentleman has no right to go around boasting, as he has done on political platforms and in public-houses, about the political &ldquo;pull&rdquo; he has not alone with the Minister for Justice but with other Ministers in matters of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to raise also a matter which has come to my notice not for the first time.  During last week I received a complaint from four workers who were casually employed by a public authority and who were summoned as witnesses at the District Court that was held at Tullamore on 26th January.  They were called away from their work and were brought there as witnesses in a prosecution by the State against a person charged with fraud in connection with the carrying on of his own work.  Since that date these casual employees have not received the day's wages which <Col N="2118" /> they lost through having to attend the court.  This is not the first case which has come to my notice of long delay in the payment of expenses and wages lost by men who have to attend court as witnesses for the State.</P>
    <P>The four men concerned in this case furnished their bill on 9th February for their day's wages, plus bus fares to and from the court.  Strange to say, in the recent past, they received 3/- covering their bus bares, but they have not yet received their wages, and I suggest to the Minister that whatever section of the Department&mdash; it may be some local representative of the Department&mdash;is responsible for dealing with and disposing of claims of this kind, it should be tightened up and workers who have to attend courts, on summonses served on them by the State, should receive the small sums due to them, if not immediately the case is disposed of, within a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>On 13th March of this year, the Minister was asked a question here as to his attitude and policy in connection with certain cases affecting ground landlords.  The question was addressed by Deputy Neal Blaney of Donegal and had reference to certain incidents which had taken place in that constituency.  The Minister, in his reply, is reported at column 1189 of the Official Reports as having said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This is a most complicated matter and requires the most careful consideration before we enter into legislation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He also said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I cannot give any indication of what the Government's decision is likely to be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to address certain questions to the Minister in that connection.  Is it correct that, as long ago as two years, he received a deputation from the Leaseholders' Association which supplied him with a long list of cases in which ground rents have been increased&mdash;in some cases doubled and trebled?</P>

      <P>I should like to know if the Minister is satisfied with the machinery at the disposal of his Department for dealing with alien penetration.  I notice from recent cases&mdash;I know other cases which are not published in the papers&mdash;that some of the flyboys, who came over here from Great Britain to escape conscription, shortly after they arrived&mdash;wherever they got the financial assistance&mdash;set themselves up in business under very good Irish names. I know that some of these aliens have even used the name of Boland, as well as the names O'Sullivan and Murphy. These are very good Irish names and I want to know if the Minister has any machinery at his disposal to compel these people to trade under their own foreign names, so that people who want to have business dealings with them will know the names of the individuals with whom they are dealing. Has the Minister any machinery at his disposal for dealing with matters of this kind?  If he has, I would like him to look into it, especially in view of the large number of cases coming under notice every other day concerning the activities of gentlemen of this type.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other point that I want to raise with the Minister.  I have read in the newspapers recently of serious statements made by district justices arising out of the trial of certain cases, or rather, on the evidence in cases which have come <Col N="2122" /> before them.  They said that they were satisfied that glaring perjury was being committed in some of those cases.  I am told that perjury is quite a common occurrence in the district courts of the country.  Am I to assume that, when district justices make statements of the kind that I refer to, their reports go to the Minister for Justice?  If so, will the Minister say why no prosecutions are brought&mdash;because none are being brought so far as I can discover&mdash; against the gentlemen who, in the opinion of district justices, commit perjury?  Speaking for myself, I only go to a mission once a year, the one that is held in my own parish.  This question of the amount of perjury that is being committed in our courts is, I know, referred to by missioners at the missions and retreats which they conduct through the country. Where glaring cases of perjury occur, should not some steps be taken against the people who are believed to have been guilty of it?  I know, of course, it is difficult to produce evidence to convict a person of this crime, but its prevalence through the country is causing a great deal of demoralisation. If the Minister has reliable evidence that, in some case, a person has been guilty of committing perjury then I think he should institute proceedings against that person.</P>

      <P>There is one other matter that I want to deal with.  I am not sure whether it is the function of the Minister for Justice to give a final decision as regards granting licences to bookmakers in cities and towns. Recently a case in my constituency came before the court for the second time.  It was an application for a bookmaker's licence.  In passing, I may say that I have no personal <Col N="2123" /> interest in this kind of activity.  The application, however, was turned down although the local Gárda Superintendent admitted in court that the applicant was a person of good character and had all the necessary qualifications to entitle him to a licence.  The application was turned down on the grounds that there was an excessive number of bookmakers in this town.  As a matter of fact, the number of bookmakers' premises in the town is two, and they are owned by the same bookmaker.  That meant giving a monopoly to one bookmaker. Since that happened, additional licences have been granted to bookmakers in adjoining towns, although the population of the two adjoining towns is only half that of the town I have in mind, which is Birr.  If bookmakers' licences are supposed to be granted on a population basis, then the same law should apply in Leix and Offaly as in Tipperary or any other county.  I do not know whether there is a right of appeal in these cases or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Superintendents in different areas may hold different views with regard to these cases, but if an application is refused the applicant can bring an appeal to the court. I do not enter into it at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I know, the superintendent in this case that I refer to certified that the applicant was a fit and proper person, and had all the necessary qualifications to entitle him to a licence.  The district justice, however, decided that there were enough bookmakers' premises in the town while, as I have said, in the adjoining towns additional licences were granted. The matter is not a very important one, but if there was the right of appeal to the Minister I would advise the lawyer acting for the applicant to make such an appeal.  I do not know what can be done if the Minister says he has no power in the matter.</P>

      <P>I want to join with Deputy Davin in the tribute that he paid to the fair and impartial way in which the Guards carry out their duties.  From my experience, in my own constituency, I can say that they generally show fine commonsense and a wise discretion, notwithstanding the fact that sometimes they have to deal with rather difficult cases.  The Estimate for the Gárda Síochána has been increasing year by year, although one would imagine that, with a progressive increase in efficiency, there would be a reduction in expenditure.  This Estimate of approximately £2,500,000 represents a substantial portion of our national outlay.  That is a rather large expenditure when we take into account that this State is now 23 years in existence.  It has, in a self-governing sense, passed its majority, and one would naturally conclude that we had a sufficiently keen appreciation of the necessity for maintaining law and order, and that, therefore, there would not be the need for this large expenditure.  It was inevitable, when the State was founded, that a large force of Guards should be scattered all over the country in order to enforce respect not only for the institutions of the new State but for the observance of the law.  During the intervening years the tendency has been for the numbers in the Gárda Síochána to increase rather than diminish.  That, to my mind, is an extraordinary development.  It is strange that, since those early years of the State, no effort has been made to reorganise the grouping of the Guards, although there would seem to have been great scope for the carrying out of a scheme of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit that in the cities and towns traffic duties impose a severe strain on the personnel of the Guards, and that, consequently, you must <Col N="2125" /> have a large force in such centres. That, however, does not apply to the country areas.  I think that, instead of having barracks dotted all over the country in which you have three, four or five men, a good deal of the work they are doing could be carried out by patrols from fairly large central stations, the patrols to be provided with motor cars and motor cycles when conditions allow that at the end of the war.  As Deputy Coogan has suggested, they might also be provided with radio sets to enable them to carry out their duties more efficiently and keep in continuous touch with their headquarters.  At the moment the Gárda force is scattered in small areas all over the country in groups of three, four or five.  That to my mind is not only uneconomic but an unwise distribution of a police force. It seems to me that the time has arrived for reconsideration and reexamination of the whole problem.  It is essential in the interests of economy and efficiency that there should be re-organisation of the Gárda force.  If certain centres were selected, one or two in each of the smaller counties, and probably more in the larger counties, it would be possible from these centres to control large county areas by a mobile force equipped with motor cars or motor cycles and radio sets. I admit that at the present time it may be difficult to procure petrol for motor cars or motor cycles, but the war may be over very soon and petrol may be available again in the course of 12 months, or even less.  Even if it is not available for two years, I suggest to the Minister that he should bear in mind the suggestion I have made, and reorganise the Gárda force somewhat along the lines I have indicated. I think the country would be much better served by a smaller and more compact, mechanised force, well paid, living under agreeable conditions, rather than by the present force, scattered as it is in isolated sections throughout the country.  I imagine that such a rearrangement or re-organisation would inevitably lead to a very substantial decrease in expenditure, at the same time giving exactly the same degree, or probably <Col N="2126" /> a much higher degree, of efficiency than we have at the present time.</P>
    <P>Reference was made in the course of the debate to the fact that many of the Guards are engaged on purely clerical work.  It would appear to me from what I have seen in various Gárda stations throughout the country that the Gárda force is gradually being turned into a branch of the Civil Service. The qualities required by a civil servant are quite different from those required by a policeman.  The first essential characteristic of a policeman is common sense.  The second is a knowledge of the country and of the people amongst whom his lot is cast.  If the Guards have to concentrate on purely clerical work, it is inevitable that they will not be able to acquire that knowledge which would help them to perform their work satisfactorily. It was mentioned to-day that Guards have to collect tillage returns.  In this age of compulsory education, the farmers should be able, and it should be obligatory upon them, to supply these returns, and I am sure that if they realised it was their duty to supply such returns they would do so and thus relieve the Guards of one form of clerical work.  There are various other types of clerical work imposed on the Guards which could very well be performed by the Civil Service.  As I have said, the Guards are gradually being turned into civil servants and, because of that, there has been an increase in the standard of examination for recruitment to the Gárda Síochána.  In my opinion, at all events, it does not follow that because a recruit is highly educated, he will make an efficient policeman.  In fixing the standard of examination for the Gárda Síochána, consideration should be given to the type of candidate likely to apply from the rural areas and to the type of education they receive in the schools they attend.  In any event, the standard of education required by recruits to the Gárda Síochána is increasing year by year, and in order to become a Guard at the present time one would want to go through a more or less specialised course of education. The standard is approximating more and more closely to the standard required <Col N="2127" /> for the Civil Service.  In other words, the Gárda Síochána is approximating more and more closely to the Civil Service, which, in my opinion, is a bad thing for the police force.  If we want to maintain an efficient police force in this country, the Guards should be relieved of a considerable amount of the clerical work they are at present obliged to perform.</P>
    <P>In introducing the Estimate, the Minister gave certain figures relating to increases that have taken place in certain classes of crime from 1939 to 1944 and from 1943 to 1944.  The most abnormal increase is that which has taken place in respect of offences against property without violence, larcenies, etc.  There is no question about it that there appears to be a lessening of respect for the rights of property. I do not know what the cause of that may be.  It may be that our moral standards are not as high as they were 20 or 25 years ago.  It may be that, because of the peculiar circumstances of the times in which we are living, or of the peculiar psychology engendered by the war, the minds of many young people&mdash;because these are the people who are engaged mostly in these crimes&mdash;have become somewhat abnormal. The fact, however, is, that there is a lessening of respect for the rights of property.  Deputy O'Higgins has suggested that it may be due to the fact that our educational programme is so overcrowded that the teachers have no time to instil moral precepts into the minds of their pupils.  It may be due to a variety of causes, but, whatever the cause of it may be, I suggest to the Minister that, in the interests of the State and of the Government, he should cause an inquiry to be instituted as to the reason there has been such an abnormal increase in such types of crime, especially since 1939. I do not believe that it is due to the peculiar psychology engendered by the war.  I believe that there has been a definite lessening of moral standards, the cause of which I am not in a position to say.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to the increase in the number of prosecutions for summary offences.  There has been <Col N="2128" /> an increase in the course of one year of 40,000.  Because of my associations, I know, as a matter of fact, that from 1943 to 1944 there has been an increase of 40,000.  Some of these prosecutions are ridiculous and reflect no credit on the Government Department concerned. People are dragged into court for the most trivial offence and in the majority of cases they are let off.  The case is dismissed, or they are let off under the First Offenders Act.</P>
    <P>But it is a scandal, in my opinion, that the State Department should be responsible for dragging innocent people, in many cases, into court on a trivial charge.  Presumably, the charge has been formulated on the report of some inspector, who may not have taken the time or the trouble to go into the circumstances, but proceeds to make a report to his headquarters. Automatically, the higher officials at the headquarters institute prosecutions against unfortunate people.  I know numbers of such people who have been dragged through the courts and subjected to a lot of unnecessary expense and odium.  I know that the Minister is not entirely responsible for that type of case, but I think it is up to the Minister to represent to the different Government Departments that some more severe form of investigation should take place before people are dragged into court in this fashion and subjected to the odium associated with an appearance in court.</P>
    <P>I meant to refer at some length to the abnormal increase in Land Registry fees, but that subject has been very extensively, dealt with by Deputy Coogan, who has given the figures that have operated until recently and the new figures.  I do not propose to travel over the same ground again.</P>
    <P>With reference to the District Courts, complaints are frequently made of lack of suitable courthouses and accommodation for district justices.  I admit that the accommodation should properly be provided by the county councils, but I suggest to the Minister that he should see that the county councils discharge their duties in that respect. In very many parts of the country the accommodation is exceedingly primitive and numerous complaints have <Col N="2129" /> been made to the Minister on this subject and numerous letters have been written to the Press about the very bad accommodation provided for district justices in many areas throughout the country.  I think he has had representations from my own county and from the neighbouring county of Leitrim in respect of three, four or five different areas, and I hope he has represented to the county councils that they have been negligent in discharging their duties in that respect and that he will keep on the pressure until something is done to improve the accommodation.</P>

      <P>Some time ago the Minister made a pronouncement that he was prepared on behalf of the Government to make provision for a scheme of recognition of acts of gallantry, particularly when associated with life saving.  So far as I am aware, no effort has been made to implement that promise.  I gather from the Minister's indication now that he is going to introduce that scheme, but he might intimate the form that the recognition will take and, particularly, that there will be compensation given where personal loss is incurred.  I gather that this is not the appropriate time to refer to the interesting question of ground rents, and I do not propose to infringe the rules of the House beyond suggesting to the Minister that he might take serious note of the growing volume of opinion which demands readjustment, to say the least of it.</P>

      <P>On a previous occasion I made a suggestion in connection with juvenile delinquency that there should be an increase of probation officers in Dublin and that that scheme might be extended to large centres throughout the country.  I gathered from the Minister that he would prefer to see an expansion of the scheme along the lines of voluntary organisation rather than an increase of probation officers.  I should like to know from his experience of the last 12 months what assistance he has received from voluntary organisations <Col N="2130" /> along these lines and if he is still of opinion that the suggestion which was made from more than one side of the House should not be taken into consideration, namely, the increase of probation officers.  My own experience is that that is an ideal scheme for dealing with juvenile delinquents and is calculated to give the most satisfactory results.</P>
      <P>On a previous occasion I drew the attention of the Minister to the very immediate possibility of a very large retirement so far as the personnel of the Gárda is concerned; that a number of these would be retiring at a comparatively early age and many of them would find themselves in a position in which it would be difficult for them to reinstate themselves in civilian life because of the small amount of their pension and, generally speaking, of their domestic circumstances. I suggested to the Minister that he might consider adopting the principle which applies to the Army and the Civil Service and that a capital sum, say a year's salary, might be given to the retiring officers and men to meet that particular position. My recollection is that the Minister did not indicate the attitude of the Department on that matter, but, as it is a matter affecting a very considerable number of the Gárda officers and men, I would be glad if he would give attention to the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point I should like to make so far as the administration of the Gárda generally is concerned. We congratulated the Minister last year, and we do so again very cordially and sincerely, on the fact that he has such a very efficient organisation under his control.  Taking the force as a whole, it is one that the country can be proud of.  Early in the debate I understand that Deputy Dillon pointed out, so far as the administration of the Gárda was concerned, that the sole control should be under the personal jurisdication of the Minister, and, of course, the Commissioner, so far as discipline and domestic policy are concerned.  I think that is a point of view that will meet with general approval, that promotion <Col N="2131" /> and advancement in the force should not be due to any outside influences, or to any influence on the part of members of this House.  Acknowledgment of that principle&mdash;and I personally subscribe to it&mdash;puts a very serious responsibility on the Minister to ensure that adequate machinery will be at the disposal of all ranks to bring their grievances before the appropriate officers for the purpose of adjustment.  I make that statement without any specific knowledge that the present machinery of the Gárda Representative Body is not receiving the recognition to which it is entitled.  But, in accepting the principle that the control of domestic policy is vested in the Minister, it is all the more important that a body like the Gárda Representative Body should have the machinery to which I have referred.  Secondly, an acknowledgment of the principle that the Minister and the Commissioner should have sole control of the Gárda does not entitle individuals&mdash;a very small percentage, fortunately, of the force&mdash;particularly in small towns and villages and in rural areas, because they are clothed with the garb of authority, to set themselves up as a sort of field marshals.  They constitute in themselves a nuisance to the general public and to their own personal colleagues.  That type of individual is not unknown throughout the country.  The suggestion that excessive zeal or the pursuance of trivial and vexatious breaches of the law should bring a man to the notice of the Department for promotion should not be tolerated, much less encouraged. There is that type of individual abroad, and it would be a pity if the good name of the force as a whole were damaged in that way.</P>
    <P>Finally, may I remind the Minister that I have brought to the notice of the Department some minor matters in connection with the staff in Mountjoy Prison, in regard to expenses in attending court cases and, in particular, in regard to the duty that attendance at those cases entails.  I think I know sufficient of the Minister and of his Department to feel that these particular matters will receive consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>For a number of years past, I have been referring to the question of the housing of the Gárda, and other Deputies have mentioned it here during the present debate.  The position is absolutely disgraceful, and the Minister knows it.  It was pointed out to his predecessors on various occasions when the Estimates for the Gárda Síochána were under consideration. When a Gárda is transferred from a district and a new man comes in, there is no house for him and, in many cases, these men have to take up occupation of rooms, for which they have to pay a fabulous rent.  It is not at all fair that some provision should not have been made for them before now.  I have suggested on various occasions that the Department of Justice, or whoever is responsible, should build houses in various areas for the Gárda.  I suggested that money should be available from the Local Loans Fund for that purpose, in the same manner as it is available for the building of houses for the working classes.  I am satisfied that the rent allowance given to the Gárda would almost pay the interest and sinking fund required to finance a scheme of that kind.</P>
      <P>I went to the trouble at one time of submitting a scheme to the previous Commissioner, which showed conclusively that that could be carried out and that it would not be a greater expense, either on the Department of Justice or the Gárda, than the amount of money given as rent allowance. Certainly, the position to-day is different, as the cost of building has increased enormously since the beginning of the war, but I think the Gárda would be prepared to meet the economic rent of a house built under such a scheme as I suggest.  It is disgraceful that a Guard and his family should be living in a back room in a town or city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public generally can have very little respect for a man in that position, who must occupy premises of that kind.  One would expect that the Minister would have considered dealing with this problem long ago.  If we want to create respect for the Gárda, we must house them properly.  I would ask <Col N="2133" /> the Minister to go into this matter within the next 12 months and find out if money can be made available from the Local Loans Fund to build houses for Gárda, so that, when a Guard is transferred from one district to another, there will be a house available for him.</P>
    <P>Last year, I referred to what I considered to be an infliction on the Gárda&mdash;the question of the cleansing of barracks.  I pointed out that they were expected to subscribe every year, or every month, a certain amount of money to pay for the cleansing of certain rooms in the barracks.  I understand that, during the past 12 months, the Minister has come to their aid to some extent so far as that matter is concerned.  However, I still say that it is absolutely wrong in principle that a Gárda should have to pay out of his salary or wages each year for the cleansing of a barrack, which is a public institution used in the public interest, and I consider that the Government should arrange to pay that cost.  One could imagine the outcry there would be if a civil servant were asked to contribute to the cost of cleansing one of the Government offices here in Dublin or if a teacher were asked to contribute to the cost of cleansing a school in the country.</P>
    <P>This is an absolute infliction on the Gárda and, even though the Minister has made some contribution towards the cost, I am not yet satisfied.  The thing is absolutely wrong in principle. This grievance of the Gárda should be removed definitely and I hope the Minister will approach the Department of Finance again with a view to doing away with such a very objectionable practice.</P>
    <P>These are the only two points I wish to raise.  I hope the Minister will consider, in the very near future, the question of the proper housing of the Gárda in various parts of the country and that he also will remove this infliction on the Gárda of their being asked to pay for the cleansing of the barracks, which is really a Government job.</P>

      <P>Several Deputies raised the point about the housing of the <Col N="2134" /> Gárda.  I assured the House last year that this matter was one of the things we would take up post-war.  It is not a question of money.  We quite agree that it is very necessary and desirable but, as every Deputy knows, housing is practically impossible now.</P>

      <P>Practically since I became Minister, and I have been Minister during the whole of the emergency, that has been so.  That is one of the proposals which have been sent to the new building committee of the Department of Industry and Commerce. If I am Minister when they are free to act, I will press all I can to have the grievance removed, as I realise it is a big handicap in more ways than one. There is something in the point raised by several Deputies, that it may then be possible for the Guards to be moved around more often than they are.  One of the things which militate against that is the lack of housing.  I can assure Deputies that that is being attended to and I believe it will almost pay for itself.</P>

      <P>The other matter the Deputy mentioned was raised by the Representative Body every time they came to see me.  We have got somewhere already and, in the future, we may get the rest of it done.  It is there a long time and I do not know why it was there at all.  Apparently, it was an old custom and these customs die very hard, especially when it means getting money to meet them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the points raised by Deputy Morrissey was in regard to the increase in crime.  He wants to know the official view as regards the causes. Opinions may differ on that, and while I, myself, may be a bit complacent, I am satisfied it is due very largely to the conditions in which we are living.  There is no question about that.  I am not prepared to admit that there has been any loosening of our moral standards at all&mdash; at least, I hope not.  I think the <Col N="2135" /> emergency conditions have brought about a state of affairs where people who, in ordinary circumstances, would not break the law, have done so.  I suppose there is in everyone a selfish strain, and if they are expected to do without things which they have been in the habit of getting, they are tempted to do something which they should not do.  That is in every one of us.  When war conditions end and things become more plentiful, I believe that will disappear&mdash;I sincerely hope so&mdash;and I am not prepared to say it is a policeman's job.</P>
    <P>Education has a lot to do with it. I do not know if Deputy O'Higgins is right, that the teacher has not time. It is not a question for the teacher alone, though he has to do with it. Most people think the parents are not taking their responsibilities as seriously as they should, and I really think that there is a lot in that.  There is not the same parental control as there used to be.  Some people say it is due to the cinema, but others say it is not.  If we had an inquiry I think we would have a different opinion from nearly every member, and would not get an agreed opinion.</P>
    <P>I think it is a very good thing to see this question being raised by practically every Deputy and discussed so much by the people generally.  When people become conscious that such a state of affairs exists and that such a problem is growing, then I feel sure some way will be found to deal with it.  I can get no more information from officials than I can get here or outside. Officials have their own views.  My views are somewhat the same as the official views I get.  I feel that the existing circumstances are due largely to a shortage of supplies.  There are certain offences that were not usual here in other years; they are offences that have been created by the war.</P>
    <P>As regards the keeping of records, that may seem a trivial thing, but really it is not.  There was a big demand from all sides of the House for a rationing system.  The Minister resisted that demand as long as he could, because he foresaw difficulties.  The <Col N="2136" /> essential part of a rationing system is the keeping of records; otherwise you cannot have a rationing system at all. If the Minister for Supplies did not deal severely with people who were not observing the regulations, then the black market for tea and sugar would be widespread and people with small means would probably have to go without. Although these things seem harsh, they are absolutely necessary if the system of rationing is to be carried on successfully.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey asked about prison conditions.  He wanted to know whether they are any better now than they were, say, 20 years ago.  There is not very much difference, except that prisoners are not locked up as early as they formerly were.  The hours used to be 4 o'clock p.m. until 7 o'clock in the morning.  Now the hours are from 7.30 p.m. and there is definitely an improvement there.  Then, there is wireless in the jails.  We try to make conditions tolerable without making the place a palace or an hotel.  Of course, it is essentially a place of punishment; people are sent there to be punished for crimes and we cannot make the jail an hotel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that the Deputy did.  There is not very much of a change otherwise.  As one who has been locked up for 23 hours of the day, or more&mdash;my first experience in 1916 was being locked up for 23½ hours&mdash;I was able to fill up my time all right, but the same experience drove others almost mad.  One of the worst things is to have people not very well educated locked up for such a long time.  When I became Minister, one of the first things I asked was to have the people in prison allowed out of their cells for a longer period.  It involved an increase of staff, but the Minister for Finance did not object. Prisoners at the present time also get an extra light meal, and to that extent there has been an improvement. Those who know the inside of a jail will recognise that as a considerable improvement.  That is my own opinion, anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2137" /> As regards reforming people, you cannot do that in six months; it would be impossible to do it in such a short time.  The Borstal Institution is Deputy Dillon's pet subject.  I admit we have not provided facilities for a proper system yet.  We did the best we could in Cork jail.  We know the grounds were not sufficient to enable the boys to get exercise, but the university authorities kindly made their playgrounds available for football and other games, and the boys are brought out for bicycle runs and that sort of thing.  I agree the jail is not a suitable premises, but I cannot get a suitable institution out of my hat, any more than I get a Gárda station. When the proper time comes we shall have all those things.</P>
    <P>So far as recruitment to the Gárda is concerned, there are advertisements published in the Press, and application forms may be had at every Gárda station.  Of course, it is confined to members of the Defence Forces or the Auxiliary Defence Forces.  As regards the standard of education, I do not agree that it is anything like what Deputies have suggested.  It was found to be a bit high, and it has been reduced.  A boy who has gone to the ordinary national school and is a few years out of it will have to brush up his knowledge.  But a boy who has gone through the whole course in a national school and who has carried on his studies should be able to pass the examination.</P>
    <P>The syllabus can be got in the Gárda Review, and any Deputy who looks at it will see that it is not nearly as difficult as some seem to think.  I agree with the remarks made by one Deputy last year, that it would not be desirable to insist on too high a standard. If every applicant has a university education he will be inclined to think that he should be the Commissioner, whereas if a man has a fairly good education he realises that there are avenues of promotion, and he will know where he fits in.</P>
    <P>The question was raised whether every applicant should not be brought up for examination.  I do not know whether that would be desirable.  Last <Col N="2138" /> year there were 160 recruited.  This year we expect 200 from those who were examined in February.  That will mean that 800 or 900 will be disappointed. The Commissioner gets the list of applications examined and he tries to select a quota for each area. He likes to give every area a quota.</P>

      <P>We are considering increasing the age limit for those who have been in the regular Army. As I have stated, that is the system followed by the Commissioner&mdash;the men are picked out for each area.  I think it is a fair system.  It might look as if there could be some discrimination in the selection, when you have 1,000 men going for 200 vacancies every year, but there is nothing of that sort.  We shall see what can be done about having everybody called.  It may result in most of the selected persons coming from the one area, and there may be discontent.  Every district like to have some of its men in the Guards. We all know where the cleverest people come from.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No others are eligible, as a matter of fact.  Deputy Flanagan was dealt with very well by his colleague, Deputy O'Higgins.  I do not know where he got the story of the man's head being cut off.  I think it happened once in England about 40 <Col N="2139" /> years ago, but it did not happen here. Somebody must have been pulling his leg.  I have never gone after Deputy Flanagan or any other Deputy.  On one occasion before he was elected, I received complaints that he had sent threatening letters to a bank director, and when the complaint was made to me twice, I thought it best to have the Deputy and others who had signed them advised to be more careful about what they did.  Apart from that, I have never interfered with the police or asked them to look after anyone. That is their job.  Deputy O'Higgins knows all about Portlaoighise and will understand that the Deputy was using his imagination.  No one was driven mad there.  One man in Mountjoy was committed to Grangegorman and I think he escaped twice.  I do not know whether he is mad or not, but he was certified, so I suppose he must not be &ldquo;all there&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of all the work the police have to do, which was raised by Deputy Hughes and many other Deputies, it is a very big question.  I think the system is a good system.  It will be admitted that, taking the country outside the cities and big towns, there is practically no crime.  Any crime that does take place is very easily detected.  The Guards are used for a variety of purposes and, as I say, I regard it as a good system.  I do not know what the Commissioner may say, but I think it a good system.  It is useful to have Guards living amongst the people. They know everybody, and, as time goes on, the people will come to rely more on them, and will, as Deputy Coogan suggested, treat them as they ought to be treated, as protectors and friends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They can do this work for Government Departments better and more cheaply than it would be done by a system of officials.  It will be admitted that we must have these figures.  We have to know what tillage is being carried out, and other statistics in relation to unemployment assistance and matters of the kind.  The Gárda barracks are very convenient for the purpose, and, taking it all in all, I think <Col N="2140" /> there is a very good case for not discontinuing the system.  In the cities and towns the system is not necessary and is not in operation there, but in country districts it is very necessary. The statistics must be made available, and I do not think anyone can do the work better or more cheaply than the police.</P>
    <P>One sees Guards knocking around a village, and some Deputies spoke of their collars being open, but it must be remembered that these men may be off duty.  They are supposed to be available when wanted, but normally a Guard is not expected to be on duty for the 24 hours.  He must have his off-time, too, and, on the basis of an eight-hour day, there is only one effective man for ordinary work, if they are to get their time off.  They are not too numerous, and in the cities quite the contrary is the case.</P>
    <P>Practically every member of the Dublin Corporation who is a Deputy waited on me last year and asked me to have the number of Guards in the city increased.  There is a slight increase this year, but I very much doubt if it will meet the requirements of Dublin, which has grown so big. The Bill introduced to-day provides for extra station-sergeants and other officers for Dublin District, and in the cities, instead of a reduction, we shall probably have to have more police.  In country places, it must be remembered, that the Guards are not doing purely police duties all the time, and to have these statistics collected by other sets of officials would probably cost more than it costs by having the work done by the Guards.  I have considered whether we could do away with some of these other inspectors and give the Guards more pay to do more inspectorial work.  It might be more satisfactory.  That is just a personal opinion, but I think there is something to be said for it.</P>
    <P>I was intrigued by Deputy Roddy's speech, because I remember saying the very same thing myself on the Gárda Vote in 1928.  I thought mechanisation and sending patrols out an ideal system.  I asked the Commissioner about it, and he said that it had been gone into exhaustively, and they were <Col N="2141" /> satisfied that it would not suit, and since I became Minister I have been satisfied that it would not work, and would not be desirable.  If the country areas are to be visited by patrols, the Guards will not know the people, and the people will not know them, and they could be &ldquo;humbugged up to the two eyes.&rdquo;  Apart from that, the Guards are very useful, and they will be more useful as time goes on, because the people will appreciate them more and become more friendly with them.  It will cost more, naturally, but if other services can be got to cost less, it will balance out.</P>
    <P>With regard to pay, a great number of Guards are now on full pay, and those who are married have marriage allowances.  Perhaps the increase was not as much as they should have got, but the last increase meant another £250,000.  We cannot increase pay without increasing costs, or at least we know of no way of doing it. I was asked what the purpose of the provision of £14,000 for the L.S.F. was.  It is designed to provide for any contingency which might arise, and is more of a token Vote than anything else.</P>

With regard to the Registry of Deeds, a committee composed of two civil servants and two representatives of the Incorporated Law Society, with the Senior Taxing Master as chairman, was set up to examine fees.  I believe the majority report was that the fees were not exorbitant.  The two solicitors dissented from that view, but I understand that the original idea was that the registry should be self-supporting. I do not know whether there can be any reduction.  I have not had time to study the report and there may be some reduction in the charges, but some increase certainly is warranted. It is a fact that the service was intended to be self-supporting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Costello referred to the delay in bringing men to trial.  I dealt with <Col N="2142" /> that matter in my opening statement when I said that in the Circuit Court there were 49 cases as against 138&mdash; which was very bad, no doubt&mdash;last year, and that only ten are to be proceeded with.  The situation is fairly satisfactory now.  We come now to the big question of the Special Criminal Court and why certain cases are brought before it and not before the ordinary courts.  It is a fact that this court was set up to deal with a particular type of offence&mdash;offences against the State&mdash;but, as the emergency continued, it became quite clear to the Government that if we were to preserve the people's food supplies and petrol supplies, we would have to take very drastic action.  Consequently, the Government gave a direction that any case of a serious or widespread black-marketing nature should be dealt with by this court.  I say there was no alternative.  We had to let people see that we were determined, so far as we could, to keep this black market down and to prevent people taking advantage of the emergency to enrich themselves, as a good many have been doing.  The Government takes responsibility for it. It is the Attorney-General who decides the question on the general lines laid down by the Government.  I do not think there is the slightest danger of its being extended when the emergency is over, but I am quite satisfied that it was absolutely necessary if the Minister for Supplies was to carry on at all.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to blame district justices in the matter of the imposition of only nominal fines.  That is the way he saw the thing.  Probably he had an eye only on the local shopkeeper and saw that he did not keep records.  He can be pardoned if he did not see that, if every shopkeeper in the country did not keep records, the position would be very unsatisfactory for the Minister for Supplies as regards the enforcement of the rationing system.  An example has to be made of people.  I stand over this, and I do not think there is any danger or uneasiness so far as the general body of the people are concerned.  I think they are satisfied that those who try to get away with black marketing operations, and to beat down the rationing system, should be dealt with.  Sometimes there <Col N="2143" /> may be borderline cases, but these are matters for the Attorney-General to deal with.  I think that, on the whole, he was justified in bringing the cases that he did to that court.</P>
    <P>There was a good deal said about juries.  Deputy Costello and Deputy Davin practically said that we were trying to do away with the jury system by the reduction of the number of jurors to seven.  That, I may say, is a purely emergency measure.  We had all sorts of protests made here on previous occasions about jurors not being able to get home, and we were asked to restrict the area from which jurors would be drawn.  It was said that jurors had to spend the night in some of the county towns, and in that way were put to a good deal of expense.  I do not think there is any real objection at all to the reduction of the number of jurors to seven.  That reduction does not apply in capital cases.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello talked about patronage in the appointment of State solicitors, county registrars and others. I frankly admit that there is patronage in the making of these appointments. The State solicitor is appointed by the Government, and, generally, if he is a good solicitor and a supporter of the Government, he gets the job.  I do not deny that.  That was always the case, and I do not know if there is any better system.  As I have said, that has always been the practice.  I frankly admit it, and I think it is quite all right if you get a good man.</P>

      <P>It was always the practice.  If you can get some better system, we will listen to it.  I think, in regard to this, that we can stand comparison with the last Government, that we have been pretty fair, and that we have tried to give every side a chance.  In the main, they are supporters <Col N="2144" /> of the Government, and I am not making any apology.</P>
      <P>There was something said about prison treatment and the need for an independent visiting committee.  We have that already.  Deputy Dillon said some very strong things in condemning Deputy Fogarty in connection with a recent case.  Deputy Fogarty and Deputy Coogan also referred to that case.  I am glad that the case was raised.  I think that Deputy Dillon handled the case better than either of the other two Deputies.  He made it clear that he wanted to have the thing cleared up.  As well as I recollect, the district justice on that occasion said that this sergeant was removed so as to put as great a distance as possible between himself and Deputy Fogarty. I want to say that Deputy Fogarty had nothing whatever to do with the transfer of that sergeant.  What happened was that complaints were made by four residents in the district.  I say that it is the duty, and the right, of every Deputy or of citizens in any constitaency, to make complaints if they think that a Gárda is doing something that he ought not to do.  We all admit they have the right to do that.  What happened in this case was that four residents in that area made complaints to Deputy Fogarty and he simply forwarded them to me, as any other Deputy might do, without any comment, for investigation.  I passed them on to the Commissioner.  Any representations that I got in the case were on behalf of the sergeant and not against him.  Deputy Cosgrave said that he did not come near me, but he came to my Department on behalf of the sergeant.  Other people also came to me.  I met two deputations on the sergeant's behalf, and I assure the House that Deputy Fogarty had nothing whatever to do with the transfer of this sergeant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards what the district justice said, he had no grounds whatever for saying it.  I wish that some of these district justices would confine themselves to the cases before them and not be making speeches, especially in regard to things they know nothing about.  I would like some of the district justices to take notice of that, and if they do <Col N="2145" /> they will be giving more satisfaction. It causes me great concern and worry to find district justices saying something that is not correct.  Naturally, when a district justice says something people assume that he has evidence for what he says&mdash;what he says will carry conviction&mdash;and will say: &ldquo;There is Boland, simply a politician, trying to whitewash himself.&rdquo;  The fact is that there was no connection whatever between Deputy Fogarty and the removal of the sergeant except that he was the medium for conveying the complaints of the four residents in the area.  It was for irregularities that the sergeant was removed from that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it on the representations of those four residents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and there was a disciplinary inquiry carried out.  The allegations made against him were not substantiated, but it was found, in the course of the inquiry, that there had been certain irregularities which did not justify the retention of the sergeant in that area.  Several Deputies have raised matters of this kind with me&mdash;the conduct of the Guards.  I invariably send them in the same way as I did in this case, to the Commissioner, and he treats them in the same way as he did this case.  If he finds that there is no substance in the complaints he will say so, and if he finds that there is he will deal with them. Neither Deputy Fogarty nor any other Deputy has ever influenced this Commissioner since he became Commissioner, and he was there before my time.  Any Guard removed since this Commissioner was appointed was removed either in his own interest or in the interests of the force.  I take it that is accepted.  It has been said that justice should be done, and not only that but that it should appear that justice should be done.  I do not know how I am going to make it appear that justice is done if Deputies will misrepresent the position.  I hope they will not do it.  I admit that on several occasions Deputy Fogarty has been a bit of a nuisance, but I want to say that in this particular case he had nothing whatever to do with the removal of that sergeant.  As I have said, in any case in which a Guard has <Col N="2146" /> been removed, his removal was purely and solely in the interests of the force after an inquiry, or for the Guard's own good.  I hope the House will accept that because I could satisfy any Deputy that it is so.  Neither I nor the Commissioner has ever been influenced by anybody.  No Guard who has done his duty has ever suffered because of interference by any T.D. either through me or through the Commissioner. I would like the House to accept that as absolutely true.  I admit that people have tried to do it, but it has never happened.  On that, I agree with the remark that was made by Deputy Dillon that Guards will do themselves more harm by trying to use influence.  He was quite right in saying that that would be the net result, so far as the Guard was concerned, even though he might happen to get something temporarily.  To attempt to do such a thing would not do him any good ultimately.  The Guards have their own police machinery for getting their grievances attended to.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon spoke about the verminous state of Mountjoy.  I know it is very hard, where you have people going in and out of jail all the time, to keep a place clean.  I do know at the same time that every effort is made to keep it clean.  No complaints on this matter have been made to me.  I move to report progress.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2147" /> That Dáil Éireann agrees with the recommendation of the Commission on Vocational Organisation that there should be established a council of education as a permanent institution to act as the accredited advisory body to the Minister for Education, and directs that a select committee, of which the Minister for Education shall be chairman, and consisting of 11 other Deputies, be appointed with a view to the early formulation of the necessary legislative proposals.&mdash;Deputies Mulcahy and O'Higgins.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion I was explaining to the House that, under the system of collective authority and responsibility through which the Government works, there are opportunities for reviewing and criticising the work of Ministers.  The Minister for Education is responsible to the Dáil, and in the course of the annual Estimates for his Department, or in dealing with motions affecting his work, there are opportunities for public criticism and public discussion, and in that way the national representatives and the people are informed as to changes which take place from time to time, and the reasons for them.  They are made acquainted with the lines of reform which are in contemplation or are suggested. I think there have been hardly any changes, even in regard to details of the programme, in the different branches of education for which I am responsible, that have not been brought before the Dáil annually and discussed.  It has to be borne in mind when it is suggested that it might be better to return to the old system of a board, that these boards, under the British régime, really had no responsibility to the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever their merits may be in regard to membership and in regard to their exercising administrative and executive authority, for example, in intermediate and primary education, the big fact is that they were not responsible to the Irish people or their representatives.  In fact, the authority which they exercised was very largely negatived by the fact that the British Treasury kept a close <Col N="2148" /> watch on their operations and vetoed frequently proposals for expenditure. I do not see, therefore, how that system can be made appropriate to the present circumstances.  It seems to me that there would be a clash of authority between the principle that the Minister responsible should be responsible to the Dáil and the idea that the board should have administrative or executive or financial authority.  Some of the protagonists of the idea of an education council do not conceal that their aim would be to have a body based on their conception of these boards, that is to say, that, in fact, the entire control and direction of education would be administered through the council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, a proposal was made some years ago, I think about 1934, for the setting up of a council.  That proposal fell through. It was in no way officially sponsored. I had no connection with it, but I know that the proposal was made, that a meeting was held and that the thing fell through.  So it would seem that some, at any rate, of the interests or authorities who, it is claimed, now seek the co-ordination of their work through a council, did not feel at the time that that course was necessary. We have to ask ourselves what are the aim and purpose of the council.  If the purpose is to bring about co-ordination, for example, my reply would be that in the Department of Education, <Col N="2149" /> where we have the headquarters of primary, secondary and vocational education, co-ordination, to a great extent, can be brought about.</P>
      <P>If it is suggested that the purpose should be inquiry, we can always set up commissions or committees of inquiry to deal with particular aspects or problems of education.  On the other hand, as I have indicated, if there is a suggestion that this body should have certain responsibilities placed upon it, which might mean that interference in one way or another would take place in the administration for which the Minister for the time being is responsible or that there might be a misunderstanding as to whether the Minister is responsible&mdash; as is now the case and as the Constitution lays down, subject always to the principle of collective responsibility&mdash; or the council were to be responsible for these administrative matters, I think no good result could come from the setting up of the council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy, in this matter, referred to the question of finances.  For example, he referred to the question of school buildings and the provision of buildings.  That is a matter, for example, which I am dealing with at present, dealing directly with the interests concerned.  I do not know whether it is proposed or suggested <Col N="2150" /> that the question of school buildings for the future should be determined, should be considered and have recommendations made upon it by this council and that then these recommendations should be made public.  I have adverted to the difficulty that is likely to arise, particularly in regard to financial matters, where this House is the supreme authority and where the Government alone has the right to put forward proposals for expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have referred to the difficulties that naturally will arise if another body is to have the right to recommend proposals for expenditure, and to publish these.  It is not as if somebody quite apart from the administration were making such recommendations, because clearly it is envisaged that this council should work in close co-operation with the administration. In fact, it is difficult to say that it would not be part of the administration if the recommendations regarding the setting up of the body made by the Vocational Organisation Commission were carried out in detail.  Or take the question of salary scales for teachers.  That is a matter of the greatest importance.  It is a matter that may have to be examined at some time in the near future, perhaps, let us say, after the emergency.  Supposing that this council is set up, and that it examines, and considers itself free to examine, this question of salary scales for teachers and that it makes certain recommendations.  As I have indicated, even if the Minister were in sympathy with these recommendations, that is no proof that the Government as a whole may accept them.  Nevertheless, in regard to finance or proposals involving finance, it seems to me that the principle is clear that the responsibility must rest with the Minister and with the Dáil, in its turn.  If an education council be set up by the Government and entrusted with certain responsibilities, entrusted with power to make recommendations, to consult with the Minister, and to examine educational questions and, if having these powers, such a council should make recommendations upon that particular <Col N="2151" /> question, for example, of salary scales for teachers, is it not likely, unless it were made absolutely clear that the functions of the council were to be purely advisory, purely subordinate to the Minister, and that they should have no approach other than through the Minister, that there might arise serious difficulty?</P>
    <P>It is stated in the report of the commission that State control is growing in education: &ldquo;There is the danger that the State may be urged to go beyond its legitimate sphere and to usurp the sacred rights of parents&rdquo; and so on.  If it is suggested that the setting up of this council would prevent such a development, I think the course of events in other countries has made it clear that a national education council in itself will not prevent such a development.  But, if it is suggested that there is any danger of developments here contrary to the wishes and intentions of the Irish people, and the ideals and wishes of the Governments that we have had up to the present, I would point out that there are certain safeguards there at present and I think it is not clear from the particular paragraph from which I have read an extract, that these safeguards have been put in their proper perspective if we are to regard this question from the point of view of safeguarding parents and citizens from the danger of usurpation of their rights by the State.</P>
    <P>In the first place, we are working under a denominational system of education.  The Church has a predominant interest in education.  She controls to a very large extent the primary and secondary system.  For example, in the case of primary education the schools are owned and controlled by the managers, and the teachers are appointed by them.  In the case of secondary education, the schools are almost altogether controlled and managed by the Church, which is, in fact, entirely responsible for them.  The only function the State has in connection with either system may be described briefly as supplying the necessary finances, seeing that the work is inspected, that value is being <Col N="2152" /> given for the money, and that the curricula for the time being are being followed.  If there were any further doubt on that question as to whether we have sufficient safeguard in the control which the Church itself directly exercises at present in the two most important branches of education, you have the fact, as I have said, that you have a forum here in which educational problems from time to time can be discussed, and we have seen that, even if the Oireachtas should pass legislation which is considered to be antagonistic to the Constitution, you have a further safeguard in the way of appeal to the courts.  You have sufficient and ample safeguard there, even if the Oireachtas itself should err in not ensuring that the rights of parents and the people generally are safeguarded. I think, therefore, that the principle underlying the establishment of the council will have to be very carefully examined so as to ensure that, if it be set up, there would be no conflict between the Minister and the council; that it would be quite clear that the responsibility for policy rests with the Minister; that he cannot share that responsibility with any other body.</P>
    <P>Consultation, as I mentioned on the last occasion, is going on all the time with the different educational interests. It has always been the practice to have these consultations with the most important interests.  I have been informed by representatives of some of these interests that they prefer the system of free access to the Minister, direct and candid consultation with him, and free and untrammelled discussion, to this alternative system. From my point of view I feel that it can be argued that the system of consultation leads to more effective and better work and would probably lead to better results than the loose organisation which it is proposed should be set up in the shape of a council of education.  It means that the Minister and his staff, who are responsible for the administration of the educational services from the State point of view, can come into direct and immediate-touch with those charged with the running of our schools; with those who <Col N="2153" /> are entrusted with direct responsibility for teaching and looking after out pupils.  These representatives are persons of practical knowledge.  They have the training and experience, they have the special qualifications, which enable them to give advice regarding projects or proposals and, above all, being, by virtue of their positions, in direct touch in a way that outsiders cannot be with the work of the schools, they are in a position to give a very direct, immediate and complete answer to any question that may be put to them regarding developments or reforms.  They can immediately answer and give the Minister the benefit of their advice as to the reactions of the proposed reforms or developments on the work of the schools.</P>
    <P>Now, if it is suggested that a body is necessary to co-ordinate all the different opinions and to get advice, to make inquiries and to review the position from time to time, we need not confine ourselves to consultation, though that, I believe, is by far the most valuable agency by which proposals can be examined and considered and, if thought worthy, be put into effect.  We can set up at any time commissions or inquiries for the special examination of certain questions.  The Hadow Commission in England was really in the form of a permanent consultative body, to which the Minister from time to time referred certain important educational problems.  That commission, having dealt with one particular branch or with one set of problems affecting education, having spent a considerable period of time examining these, was able to pass on to other fields of inquiry.</P>
    <P>As I have said, however, it appears to be clear enough, from the way in which the recommendation is set out here, that the proposed council would not confine itself to mere inquiry.  It would have the right to send for officers of the Department, for example, and could question them regarding proposals.  It could question them on the methods by which these proposals would be carried out and on any other issues arising there from. Moreover, each year it would review <Col N="2154" /> the chief educational activities of the Department and question higher officials on those activities.  It would publish a yearly report, dealing with defects or with possible developments in various branches of education. Especially, it would deal with the co-ordination of the whole educational system, from primary school to university, and the relation of primary education to the more important fundamental education as a whole.  All these questions would seem to me to lie within the sphere of educational policy entrusted to the Minister for the time being.  No doubt, the Minister could from time to time refer questions of the nature mentioned to such a council, but it seems to me that, if the council is to be entrusted here and now with all these responsibilities, it would be difficult to see where the Minister's responsibility for educational administration and policy ends and where the responsibility of the council begins.</P>
    <P>Under the vocational education system, which is administered through local statutory committees representing the trades, occupations and professions of the area, the bodies concerned should be familiar with the needs of their respective districts and they should know the wishes of the parents.  I think members on all sides of the House will agree that there is popular and democratic control there in the fullest sense.  There is an annual congress of the representatives of vocational education and there is a council set up.  First, there is the Irish Technical Education Association and, secondly, there is a committee or council of that body.  When the Department of Education was asked why we had not set up a consultative council, as contemplated under the Vocational Act of 1930, we replied that, in fact, we regarded the Irish Technical Education Association as a consultative council.  The commission, in paragraph 353 of its report, does not consider that this council is adequately representative, or if it is, that it can look after vocational education as a suitable consultative council.  The paragraph goes on to state:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But this body, representing local vocational education committees, <Col N="2155" /> with a standing council including officers employed under such committees, cannot be said to be independent of the Department, for both committees and officers rely on the Department for their grants and the approval of their schemes.  Moreover, the association's annual congress; attended by large numbers and with constantly changing personnel, has neither the time nor the means for a thorough review and annual report; the smaller standing council meets very infrequently and cannot be considered an adequate consultative body, which should include persons of national standing representing the universities, secondary education, organised employers and organised labour.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should have thought that most of those interested, particularly organised employers and organised labour, would be represented in one way or another in the Irish Technical Education Association.  However, for the reasons stated by them, the commission did not consider this body to be adequate.</P>
    <P>I shall not trouble the House at this stage by going into the comments of the commission on vocational education and technical education generally, but I should like to call the attention of the Dáil to the foreword written by the Most Reverend Chairman of the commission, in which he states that&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;vocational organisations should develop from existing institutions and should follow the laws of organic growth.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Except for the body to which I have just referred and which, I think, can claim to speak for vocational education, there is no body, so far as I know, which can claim to be considered as the basis for the establishment of a council representing primary and secondary education.</P>

I should like to refer now to one very serious difficulty, to which I have not already alluded&mdash;the problem of allocating representation between all these different bodies, apart from the fact that, if the council is set up, presumably the system of consultation to which others as well as myself attach the greatest importance will go by the board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably, if these different vocational interests or organisations wish to approach me, they could scarcely do so, or may not consider it proper, it seems to me, to do so, except through the agency of the education council on which they would have their representatives.  If all the bodies directly concerned in the various branches of education, religious and secular, viz., the churches, universities, headmasters and teachers, are to be accorded representation&mdash;I take it equally, for it seems clear that the recommendation of the commission aims at securing representation on the commission for all those bodies&mdash;it seems to me that the council will be a very large body indeed.  In the sphere of secondary education, I think we have at least seven associations.  Representative bodies of agriculture, industry and commerce also will demand fairly good representation and will not be content to be in a very small minority, in a body consisting predominantly of teachers and representatives of the teaching profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If these are added and, as well as these, representatives of parents, whose interests in education are preponderant, the council will certainly be very large and, in my opinion, an unwiedly body.  When this question was mooted in the Dáil, in the course of a discussion on the Education Estimates, in the time of my predecessor, he rather scoffed&mdash;I think that would not be an incorrect or improper way to describe his remarks &mdash;at the idea of parents' representatives <Col N="2157" /> being on such a body.  We all know that different parents have different views; they have the most divergent views; but, quite apart from the fact that parents as a body can scarcely be said to have uniform views and that each individual parent may have different views to the next one, there is the difficulty that there is no machinery at present by which such representatives could be selected.  Failing any better assembly or any better representation, it has been suggested that the Dáil, in the annual discussion on education, takes the place of the parents' representatives on such a council, and I think that is true enough.</P>
    <P>In any case, it is suggested by the commission that, in the event of a council being set up, parents' representatives should be appointed from a panel proposed to the Minister by the National Vocational Assembly.  In the absence of this body, it is not clear how they should be selected.  Neither is it made clear what should be the basis of representation between the different educational bodies which would be represented on the council.  Will all the bodies receive the same representation, the same number of delegates&mdash; one, two or three&mdash;or will some receive a larger representation than others because they have a greater number of members or are obviously of greater importance?  These are rather difficult questions and, while the commission's report has given some indication of how representation should be built up in respect of other vocational bodies, I am afraid that we have no light from them on the question of the details of representation to the education council.</P>
    <P>There is also the important point that the problems that arise in connection with the different branches of education vary very much and the knowledge and experience of education possessed by many members of a council of education constituted on the lines proposed in the report would frequently be confined to one branch of the subject.  Difficulties would inevitably arise if such persons were placed in a position to offer advice regarding other branches about which they had little or no knowledge or experience. <Col N="2158" /> Instead of the system of consultation under which discussion of a fruitful nature takes place between representatives of the Department and of that branch of education who are most closely in touch with its problems and who are best qualified to speak for it and who have the best knowledge, training and experience, we would have a very large and unwieldy body.  It might very easily happen that all the representatives of secondary education if, for example, the seven associations were all to be represented and should vote together, could be outvoted upon an issue of secondary education by these other representatives, many of whom might have really very little, if any, acquaintance with secondary education, if the decision was to be determined by the majority.  One can easily see that in a very large body of perhaps, half a hundred members, discussion would become difficult and fruitful results, I think, would become scanty if this council had under discussion all the problems dealing with all the different branches of the service. The question would inevitably arise whether it would not be necessary to have three or, perhaps, four councils or advisory bodies to deal with, let us say, the four main branches of education&mdash;primary, secondary, vocational and university &mdash;not including the institutions of science and art.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything further that I can usefully say at this stage.  To enter in detail into the arguments as regards the present state of education or the alleged defects in the system of education or in the results of that system, to which the report of the commission refers, would take me too far afield and, possibly, I may have other opportunities for dealing with the matter.  I must say, as the House will, no doubt, have gathered from the trend of my remarks, that while the issue is still open and the Government are entirely free to decide to set up this council should they think fit, I, as Minister for Education, having regard to the manner in which the proposals are set out and the implications which I see <Col N="2159" /> in them and to which I have referred, do not think I could, in my present state of knowledge, at any rate, recommend to the Government that such a council as is contemplated in the report, with the powers that are spoken of be established.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>We certainly had a few gems from the Minister in the course of a rather involved and, may I say, rather irrelevant speech.  I think his concluding remarks were priceless. Having spoken for nearly 40 minutes in the strain in which he did speak, he would up by telling us the Government have an open mind on the report of the Commission on Vocational Organisation as regards this council of education.  I said the Minister's speech was largely irrelevant.  May I remind Deputies that what we are supposed to be discussing here is:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann agrees with the recommendation of the Commission on Vocational Organisation that there should be established a council of education as a permanent institution to act as the accredited advisory body to the Minister for Education&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Perhaps I had better finish reading the motion in view of the Minister's talk about vagueness&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and directs that a Select Committee of which the Minister for Education shall be chairman, and consisting of 11 other Deputies be appointed with a view to the early formulation of the necessary legislative proposals.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the motion before the House. No one would gather from the Minister's speech that that was the motion which we are supposed to be discussing. Listening to the Minister, one would imagine that we were proposing that the Minister and the Department of Education should be removed and supplanted by the proposed council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister quoted from a number of paragraphs in the report of the Commission on Vocational Organisation. It was rather strange that he did not quote from the paragraph which has the nearest bearing on this motion, which is the basis of the <Col N="2160" /> motion.  I will ask Deputies to listen while I give a short quotation from paragraph 540, page 335:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We recommend, therefore, the establishment of a council of education as a permanent institution to act as the accredited advisory body to the Minister for Education.  It should be a vocational non-political body without any executive or administrative powers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...without any executive or administrative powers&rdquo;&mdash;that is the recommendation of the commission.  What has the Minister been talking about for the last 40 minutes?  It seems to me that the Minister did not read the motion.  He certainly did not address himself to it and certainly did not address himself to the paragraph of the report from which I have just quoted, or, if he did, why does he suggest to the House that this council asked for in the motion would be in a position to direct the whole policy of the Department of Education?</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about the alleged defects in the present educational system Does the Minister suggest, and does the Taoiseach agree, that the present system of education is satisfactory?  Does he suggest that he could not get from a body such as that contemplated in the report and in this motion information which would be of value not only to him and his Department but to the country?  What is the use of the Minister talking about reforms and advances in education when we find to-day the position in which 80 to 90 per cent. of our pupils finish their school lives at 14 years of age?  What is the use of talking about reforms, improvements or advances when, on that fundamental, we are still in the same position as we were in 30 years ago?  What is the use of talking about this country's progress, about greater production from the soil and from the factory, of a higher sense of citizenship, of fitting ourselves to meet the battles we shall have to meet in the economic and other fields when the war is over, or of talking to farmers and farmers' sons and agricultural labourers and their sons about improved methods of agriculture, about leaflets from the Department, <Col N="2161" /> about fertilisation, about compound manures and percentages and so on, and about going in for cow-testing, if the education they are to get to fit them for these improvements is to cease at 14 years of age when they leave school?</P>
    <P>I want to say here publicly and plainly that so far as the vast bulk of our people in rural Ireland&mdash;perhaps even to a greater extent in urban Ireland, but certainly in rural Ireland &mdash;is concerned, they are not fitted by the education they receive to understand one-fifth of what the Departments set up by the State are trying to teach them.</P>
    <P>There is no Deputy but knows that as well as, if not better than, I do. We have this Department of Education plodding along in the same old way year in, year out, and, as an ordinary plain citizen without any qualification, if I may put it that way, to speak on education as such, because my own education was rather limited&mdash;perhaps for that reason I want to see other people get a better chance&mdash;I venture to say that if the educational standard of those leaving school at 14 years of age now is no lower than it was 15, 20 or 30 years ago, so far as I can ascertain through the country, it is certainly no higher, and we are not doing justice to the children of the country so long as we tolerate that position and a Department of Education which is prepared to sit down and allow that to go on is not doing its duty.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not want an advisory council because he has people whom he can consult, people who know more about it than anybody else, the officials of his own Department.</P>

He can be very charming and will be still more charming when those who come to see him are leaving, but they will not have changed the Taoiseach's opinion, and I doubt if they will have changed the Minister's.

The second, if my recollection <Col N="2163" /> is correct, was an inquiry into the results of the policy of Irish in the schools over the past 20 years.  The Minister smiles.

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>And that is why I bring it in here.  I frankly admit that I am not competent to go into this question of teaching in primary, secondary and vocational schools and in universities, but I am going into it to the best of my ability and I say it is fundamental and plain, even to a person like myself, that we cannot have an educated race of people if we cannot afford to keep children at school beyond the age of 14 years.  I am sure the Taoiseach, as one who has been interested in education all his life, will admit that there is very little use in trying to get our people to take advantage of the latest improvements in industry, agriculture, or any form of our life, if the best we can do for them is to leave them in a national school until they reach the age of 14 years.  We know that 80 per cent. of them never see any other school.  That is the position as I see it, and I would like to have a clear pronouncement on this from the Taoiseach or the Minister on that question.  I think that until such time as we have settled that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One of the reasons why we want a council of education to advise the Minister is because nothing is being done.  We are hoping that, if we get someone to advise him, something may be done.  There is no use in the Taoiseach trying to sidetrack this by saying that he would love to meet the Dáil on it.  The Taoiseach, when he wants to do anything, does not wait for the Dáil to tell him.  He tells the Dáil what he thinks should be done, and very properly as the head of the Government.  What is the mind of the Government on this question of the school-leaving age?</P>

He was satisfied that he could not get better advice from a council than the advice he was already in a position to get.  That is what we had from a man who has been Minister for Education for 13 years.  We are now told that the Government has no policy on the school leaving age, and that it has never made up its mind on it.  That is all I have to say on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the time limit I intend to be brief.  I cannot congratulate the Minister on the case he attempted to make on this motion which seeks to set up a select committee of the House to advise us as to how a council of education could be constituted.  The Minister pointed to many ways in which great difficulties <Col N="2166" /> might arise in the formation of this proposed council.  We have before us the definite suggestion that a committee of this House should meet to find a solution of the problem of consituting a representative council of education.  The grave difficulty which the Minister sees in connection with a council of education is that there might be a conflict between the views of the majority of it and himself and his Department.  I ask the House, is that a valid reason why this council should not be set up?  Is it not better that we should have a definite conflict of ideas in regard to education than that we should allow the situation to drift along as it has been drifting for 20 years?  Would it not be better that this council of independent advisers should shall we say, occasionally rile the Minister as other Ministers have been riled by the report of the Vocational Commission?</P>
      <P>Would it not be reasonable to assume that, if the Minister's anger were aroused by the decisions of this council, he might be spurred into doing something definite something really effective in order to provide the country with a better educational system than we have at present.  But the Minister says that it would be disastrous if there was a conflict of opinion between this council and himself, as Minister, or his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The council envisaged in this motion will have no administrative or executive functions.  It will be a purely advisory body, and as such will be far superior to the various deputations or delegations which may meet the Minister from time to time.  We all know that when deputations meet Ministers they have the feeling that they are dealing with a superior individual: that they are going to ask some favour or concession.  Here we could have an independent body which would not feel itself in that inferior position of having to approach the Minister for some favour or concession.  It would be a body which could make its decisions in the same way as, for example, a local authority.  If the Minister's arguments against this council of education are sound, then the same arguments could be applied for the <Col N="2167" /> abolition of all locally elected bodies. On frequent occasions the latter clash with the Minister or the Government, but I think that a clash of ideas is always desirable.  If we want to bring about reforms we do not want to have everything stream-lined and the official point of view the only one that can be heard&mdash;the only one that can be effectively put forward.  I believe that democracy can only function at present through vocational bodies such as are advocated in this motion and by the Commission on Vocational Organisation. I know that propaganda is being used at the present time against vocationalism in every shape and form. It is possible that the Minister for Education is lining up to-day behind Flann Campbell and other Communists who advocate that vocationalism is the enemy of democracy, and that vocational organisation is a form of Fascism and of Nasism.  I think that under the present complex system of our national life democracy can only function through vocational bodies such as are being proposed in the motion.</P>
    <P>If we are not prepared to set up vocational councils such as this, then we shall eventually have a servile State in which the official view point is the only one that will be heard and the only one that will be effective.  I ask the House to consider, in the interests of a better system of education, in the interests of democracy functioning effectively, to accept the motion.  I think it will be found that, while it may cause occasional headaches for the Minister for Education, it will have the ultimate effect of raising the educational service to a higher standard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There was objection made that the Minister for Education did not speak to the motion.  He was dealing with the general spirit behind it.  I will try to keep very closely to it. The first thing is that it is a vote of censure, simply and solely, on the Government. There is an organisation set up here by the Constitution&mdash;Parliament&mdash;with an executive responsible to Parliament&mdash;the Government.  That is the body that is primarily responsible for considering and bringing <Col N="2168" /> before the House proposals for legislation. Although the Government has indicated that a certain report has to be considered in its broadest aspects, namely, the whole Vocational Commission Report, and that this whole question of vocationalism has to be considered in its broadest aspect, the proposal here is that the Government should be set aside, that its desire to examine that matter in its broadest aspects should be ignored, that, although the principal executive committee of the Dáil, that is, the Government, has not had an opportunity of examining this thing in all its bearings, the Government should be set aside, that the Dáil should here and now come to a decision that it was desirable to set up this particular council, and that it should immediately displace the Government also by setting up a select committee of eleven who were to replace the Government and to bring in this legislation.  I say that a proposal of that sort, unless it had the agreement of the Government, who wanted to bring in Deputies of the House, must turn the whole organisation of legislation by Parliament topsyturvy. If the Government is not going to have the support of the House in giving reasonable time for the discussion of these things, the sooner the Government is got ride of the better, and if there is a majority in the House who want this thing done, let it be done but, as long as the Government is here and has responsibility to the House, it must see that its responsibilities are not taken from it, that its duties and functions are kept to it and are not handed over to some other body.  When all is said and done, that is what is behind that resolution, apart from any merits that there may or may not be in the question of an educational council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not address himself to that particular aspect of the question but I do and I think it is a very, very serious aspect, because the whole question is whether countries have been quite wrong in the past who have built up this system of a representative institution, where the people are represented in Parliament and where Parliament deliberately puts in an <Col N="2169" /> executive to do the executive work from day to day and to be at the will of Parliament, to be thrown out if they do not do their work properly.  That is the view I take of this resolution.  If passed, I feel it is equivalent to a vote of no confidence in the Government.  If that is the intention of the House, be it so, but let us not lose sight of that fundamental fact, that that is what is contained in the resolution.</P>
    <P>Coming to the question of the merits, Deputy Morrissey immediately brought in a question of great public importance, the question of whether primary education should end at the age of 14 years or not.  I say that that is not a question for a council of education. They may give certain advice and so on, but ultimately the decision on a matter of that sort, which involves general public policy, the whole question of the social life of the people and the result that would come from this education, is a question for this Parliament. It is a question for the Government to consider and it is a question for Parliament then to decide either that the Government has a proper policy which it will support or else turn out the Government and say that in this vital issue the Government does not represent the country and is not looking after the country's interests in the proper manner.  The school-leaving age is not the question here at issue.  If Deputy Morrissey's point is that we might get advice from such a council of such a body, that is another question.  As far as we are concerned, it is a matter that came up for discussion on more than one occasion.  It is a question in which I do not mind admitting I have the greatest interest myself, personally.  I should like, if I could, to see every individual in the country getting even university education. I do not think that anybody is the worse for it.  It may make it a little bit more difficult for people who are taken away from a certain life and given higher education to go back and to take up a spade and shovel and work as a farm labourer.  There may be social reactions and it may be held that I am wrong in thinking that every human being ought to cultivate his mind to the utmost that it is possible for him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2170" /> I have, of course, to bear in mind that, whilst, we would desire an extension of the school-leaving age&mdash;every member of the Government would desire that as much, I am sure, as members of the Opposition&mdash;there are reactions which would follow and there are financial and other problems that would arise from it.  Ultimately, I think, we will have to come to a decision on that particular matter one way or the other, but one of the reasons why a decision on the matter at the moment has not been taken is because there is, in fact, a commission sitting which may regard it as one of its functions to consider just that particular aspect and to make recommendations.</P>
    <P>I pass away from that particular subject simply saying this, that the Government are quite alive to the importance of it.  We regard it as a great public question and we regard it, normally, that the place where that has to be debated and worked out has to be here in this Dáil.  I may say also, whether it be a commission or any other body that talks about representation of the parents, that I know no place where we are likely to get such a fair representation of the parents' point of view as here in this Dáil.  That is my view. I feel that otherwise you will be selecting particular sections and may find that you will want to have a very large body indeed to represent parents of different classes, with the different interests they have and the different angles they have upon the education given to their children. Most of us are parents.  One would imagine that the Ministers and the officials of the Department of Education were not parents themselves and had nothing but the remotest contact; that the teachers, inspectors and the rest of them were not parents, that they were some isolated sort of queer individuals that lived some sort of life that kept them far away from the realities of parenthood and the realities of parents' obligations.  That is not so.  Everybody knows that that is not so.</P>
    <P>Nothing is easier than to criticise <Col N="2171" /> something in general terms, with a vague general background.  The less you know, the easier it is to criticise. There is some inhibiting of your criticism when you know all the fact&mdash; it curbs your style.  Your style is much freer when you know nothing about it and you are not deterred by the fact that you have knowledge in your own mind about it that stops you from saying ridiculous things.</P>
    <P>One of the positions with regard to education is this, that there are many critics of it who have never taken the slightest care to make themselves acquainted with what is being done&mdash;not the slighest care. They do not know what is taking place; they do not know the methods that are adopted in the Department of Education in regard to consultation or anything else.  The fact is&mdash;and it is true of other Ministers just as well as of the Ministry of Education&mdash;but, keeping to education, the fact is, as the Minister pointed out, that there is considerable consultation with the various bodies that are immediately and directly in touch with educational matters.  I will admit that there is one big gap, and that is the parents.  I wish there were some way, other than the Dáil, in which the parents could be represented, but I cannot honestly see how you can set up such a committee that will be in any big, real way representative and I believe it is the duty&mdash;one of the principal duties&mdash;of representatives here, in this important matter, when the educational Estimates come up and at any other time that occasion presents itself, as public representatives to bring up this question of education and present it from the point of view of the parents who, as everybody admits, have the primary responsibility with regard to education and the chief interest in education.  They may not be educational experts, but they know where the shoe pinches.  Their judgment is often a great deal better and far wiser than that of a lot of those people who set themselves up as experts.</P>
    <P>The truth is that in primary education there is very little scope for a variety of subjects, and that is one of the reasons&mdash;I do not mind <Col N="2172" /> admitting it&mdash;why I personally would like very much to see the school age extended.  One of the reasons why I should like to see it raised is that I know that within the period which is available for children from the age of seven to 14 say, it is not possible, even with a reasonably restricted programme, to do it sufficiently soundly and sufficiently well to form the basis for the education which everybody must get for himself ultimately in life.  The period is too short.  Although there is a variety of subjects which I should like to see taught to children in primary schools, I am not such a fool as to think that you can give it to them; I am not such a fool as to think that you can cram into the head of a child from eight to 14 years that amount which older people might like to get or all the knowledge that can be crammed into the heads of people who are of university age.  It cannot be done.</P>
    <P>Wherever I have had an opportunity of pressing it I have pressed time after time with regard to primary education that though there is very little that can be done you must see that that little is well done. I am not going to repeat it now, but I spoke for a very long time on a former occasion about the whole thing as I saw it.  I am perfectly certain that all those people who try to get in nature study and all those other things from the age of seven to 14 are on the wrong track.  You can do a lot; a good teacher can do a lot and good readers can do a lot.  You can teach a child certain important facts contained in the readers.  You have a whole lot of things that you try to get in in the period, but it is very difficult to devise a reader which will be of such a general all-round character that you will be able to give the child such things as a child ought to know before it leaves school.</P>
    <P>Coming back to this question of a council of education, I say that the Minister at the present time is getting advice from every section, except the section of the parents as such.  He gets it directly otherwise. The only people under the whole system who are not directly in consultation <Col N="2173" /> with the Minister are the parents.  You do not hear about the meetings which the Minister has with the representatives of the Catholic and Protestant headmasters.  Deputy Morrissey spoke about not accepting advice.  Surely it is not the position that he is to accept everything that is put up to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>He accepts nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be very good reason.  If he has a good reason for not accepting, why should he not refuse?  Surely there must be some reason behind it.  The question is, will a composite council consisting of representatives of the Catholic and Protestant headmasters, the primary teachers, the secondary teachers, and some parents thrown in give better advice to the Minister than the Minister is getting from the specialised bodies at present?  I think it is very doubtful.  I do not think that the vocational commission even asked these various bodies; perhaps they did.  Did they ask the Catholic headmasters? Did they ask the Protestant headmasters?  Did they ask the National Teachers' Association?</P>
      <P>Perhaps they need not ask the teachers, because I think they have already committed themselves to it. They could assume, I take it, from the steps which the national teachers took before, that they would be in favour of a council.  But remember what the Minister said, that we have here a system of denominational education and that the Minister, having met the Catholic headmasters and the others, has to devise a course which will be suitable and satisfactory to all.  I do not want to be committed to this because I have not examined the matter fully, but at first blush I would be inclined to say that I would like to have representatives of the groups meet occasionally just for a general look-over the whole programme, a sort of discussion.  But, if they come to a decision, the question is, what value is the decision to have?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings in the question of representation <Col N="2174" /> for each body, if it is to be by majority vote.  You will have this complicated question as to the number of representatives you will give to the various bodies.  You can, for instance, say that the vote of three representatives of one body is as good as the vote of three representatives of another.  During the time I was in the Department, I do not mind confessing that I had at the back of my mind that I might try to get the representatives of the various groups that were meeting me separately to meet me as a body for some general discussion of one kind or another.  I was not too sure that, if I approached the groups and asked them to come to me as a body, they would be willing. I may be wrong about this, but I do not know that the commission asked these bodies if they would be willing, or if they thought it would be desirable. Surely one of the first things that the Government would have to assure itself of, if it proposed a council of this sort, would be that the various bodies that it would be proposed to bring together would be willing to come together and whether they would think it was the best way of dealing with the matter or not.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the position of the Government is that we have not taken a decision on this matter.  Let nobody go away with the idea that we are against vocationalism altogether.  If we were, we would never have established the commission; the commission would never have been set up. It was set up by the Government and I must take the primary responsibility for the setting up of that commission. It was a very important question which I was anxious to see examined.  When we set up the commission to examine it, that did not mean that we would necessarily accept the findings of the commission.</P>
    <P>It is a very broad question and we had to satisfy ourselves that it would be examined from every particular angle, that all the difficulties would be clearly envisaged, and where difficulties came in the way, that the solution of these difficulties would be suggested. But it is not true to suggest that the <Col N="2175" /> Government were opposed to the idea of vocational organisation.  My own faith in it was that I did believe that government in modern times is becoming so complicated and complex that it is almost impossible, with the duties now being placed on a Government, to see all questions from every possible angle.  In the old days, when the duties of a Government were more confined and when Parliament had more time to deal with these matters, it was a different question.  If, to-day, Parliament had sufficient time to consider all these questions, I believe that the need for vocational organisation would be very slight, because I believe that the representatives who were sent here by the people on the present basis of representation are a fair cross-section, of the community as a whole and that in the long run the decisions which they would take on any particular matter are as likely to represent the public good as decisions that would come from any other body.  I do know that, up to the present, the time which Parliament could devote to the consideration of any particular question has necessarily been limited.  Very often, in the case of some important issue, we have seen that some members on the Government side of the House would have liked to speak, but if they did so, the Government would not have been able to get through its programme at all.  As a result, there has been a self-imposed silence in the case of members on the Government side.  They allow the Minister responsible for a particular measure to pilot the measure through; and very few people on the Government side speak to support it.  It mainly becomes a question between the Minister, representing the Government policy, and the Opposition.</P>
    <P>Of course, that is not as healthy as it would be if you had time enough and had no urge to get through with public business.  If there were plenty of time, every member of the House could express his views, whether on the Government side or the Opposition side.  I realise that, in modern conditions, there are considerable difficulties in a Government giving time to <Col N="2176" /> having questions examined.  I had a hope that if, side by side with the territorial organisation of democracy which we have here, it were possible to set up something else, something like a vocational organisation, these things might be complementary one to another.  We might then be able to place before the vocational bodies many of the questions which come before Parliament and they would already have been sifted and discussed by such bodies.</P>
    <P>I have not been blind at all to the difficulties of that.  As a matter of fact, I believe that, when the commission was being set up, I did say that, if it failed in one thing, it would have failed practically completely, that is, if it failed in getting a satisfactory organisation of the rural community. One of the principal difficulties we have in regard to agriculture is that it cannot organiser itself to protect its own interests.  It cannot organise itself, in the nature of things, in the same way as, say, building organisations organise themselves.  That was one of the problems which the commission had to face.  I do not know if members have read the report of the commission, which is a fairly long one and would take some time to read.  I am very doubtful if the solution that has been suggested is adequate to the task.  It is an extremely difficult task as, in this country, we have not been organised very much on that basis and, being largely a rural community, I doubt if we lend ourselves to it in that way.  It is easy enough for the professions to become organised.  That has been done already and has not presented any real difficulty.  The organisation of trades and industries has been somewhat more complicated, but has not been altogether impossible.  I still believe that the problem of the organisation of our rural community on a vocational basis has not yet been solved.  The question then arises as to whether the State is going to organise the rural community from the top or is to encourage the natural organisations from below, by making suggestions or giving facilities of various kinds.  That was clearly before <Col N="2177" /> the mind of the chairman when he mentioned this.</P>
    <P>It is a very big question, which cannot be settled quickly.  The examination which has been going on in the Departments has been for the purpose of testing the practicability of the suggestions that have been put forward. Everybody admits that it is easy enough to propose a scheme, if you have not placed upon you the responsibility of seeing that it is a scheme which will work in every detail. It has been sent to the Departments, which have experience of these things, in order to find out the flaws that may arise if a particular scheme were put into operation and the difficulties there would be in its working.  Again, that takes time and that examination has not been completed so far by the Government.  We have got preliminary reports and we are waiting for further reports.</P>
    <P>Therefore, two things stand against our acceptance of this resolution, apart from any question of principle.  Firstly, this council of education has to be fitted in, if possible, to the whole scheme.  Secondly, the question of the council of education has to be closely examined on its own merits, apart from that.  The big question arises as to whether, in fact, such a council as is proposed can be brought together by the State and whether it is desirable that that should be done.  Even if it were desirable, can the State influence these bodies to come together? And, if so, what relative representation, and so on, will be given to them, what value will be placed on a decision by a majority vote?  The question immediately arises as to whether a vote on one side by one particular representative is as good as a vote on the other side.</P>
    <P>As one who is very interested, I would say that, as this question has waited over for solution for a considerable period up to the present, it can wait over until this fundamental question has been examined.  If we have proposals in respect of that, they will come before Parliament.  If not, after a reasonable time, it will be for Parliament to ask what are we doing <Col N="2178" /> about this matter.  It will be for Parliament to ask what the Government's policy is regarding a council of education and whether it is in favour of it or not.  It would be for Parliament to ask what the Government's policy is regarding the school leaving age and such related problems.  I ask the House not to press this motion at the present time.  In all the circumstances, it is in fact, though slightly covered over, a vote of no confidence in the Government.  If there were confidence in the Government, the motion would not have been brought forward at all.  That is my view of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am disappointed in the speech of the Minister, I am shocked at the speech of the Taoiseach.  His free interpretation of this motion, which every Deputy can read, is actually a deliberate distortion of the motion before the House. When there is an application by a couple of Deputies in Parliament, that a select committee under the chairmanship of the Minister should be set up, to make recommendations with regard to certain matters, to read into that a vote of censure on the Government is not giving an honest lead to this Assembly.  How is a select committee established by this House?  With the majority Party having a majority on it, with that committee presided over by a Minister, with the type of majority we have opposite&mdash;obedient, docile, disciplined&mdash;it is suggested that the appointment of such a committee, to make recommendations, to advise with regard to legislation, is turning the whole Parliamentary machine topsyturvy. The man who uttered that challenge to Parliament does not know how to spell the word democracy. The man who uttered that challenge in Parliament does not know how a Parliament should work. Surely a Parliament should work through discussion and not through the ringing of bells and gagged votes? A Parliament should investigate questions, either by the whole of Parliament or by a committee of the Parliament.</P>
