      <P>I object to that. I think there is no question of right in it.  A definite time is set apart as a matter of precedent, as a matter of logic, order and decency, in the conduct of our business, in which Private Members can bring forward motions dealing with certain matters of importance. When we come to the period of the year in which financial business is taken, the Government invariably appropriates all the time of the Dáil for their own business.  To-day we are in the position that the Estimates have not yet been circulated and we are, apparently, coming to the time of the year when, without very little notice, we shall have to discuss the Vote on Account.  We are approaching the last two hours of Private Deputies' time, <Col N="1120" /> and there is a motion under discussion which normally would be finished to-day.</P>
      <P>Half of the time allotted to it has already been exhausted, and such time as would be available to other Private Members is being prejudiced by the taking of Private Members' time to day.  There are certain motions on the Order Paper in which we are particularly interested and which have a bearing both on the financial and economic situation.  It is important that at a critical time like this, an opportunity would be afforded of discussing them. The discussion on the motion, which has already been debated for half the time allotted to it, would be completed inside two hours to-day, and I, there fore, object to the Government taking Private Members' time to-day.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the protest made by Deputy Mulcahy against the appropriation of Private Members' time by the Government. An important motion is under consideration. It has been discussed already for an hour and a half, and it requires only another hour and a half to complete the time allowed for discussion of the motion.  I think that the proposal to appropriate Private Members' time to-day is a gross interference with the rights of Private Deputies and of Opposition Parties.  It has been invariably the custom when financial business comes before the House to suspend the allocation of Private Members' time.  In view of that fact, and in view of the fact that we shall be reaching financial business in the course of a week or so, it is most important that we should be allowed to finish the discussion on the motion which is before the House during Private Members' time to-day.</P>
      <P>Question put: &ldquo;That consideration of Government Business be not interrupted to-day at the time fixed for taking business of Private Deputies.&rdquo;</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Racing Board and Racecourses Bill, 1945&mdash;Financial Resolution (Resumed).</Title>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night, in dealing with this matter, I had stated that propaganda in favour of the measure is an essential part of its success.  I am driven more firmly to that conclusion having read the report of a speech made here yesterday evening by Deputy Mrs. Redmond, in the course of which she said that this Bill created a monopoly and that, if it were enacted, it would finish racing.  I do not know what she means by a &ldquo;monopoly&rdquo;. In the ordinary way, monopoly means that a particular individual or body has an exclusive control of, and a right to, operate a certain business or company.  Racing has never been operated as a monopoly here and nothing in this Bill, no matter how it is construed, can give either the new board or anybody connected with racing, a monopoly of control and management.  It is true that the Turf Club and the National Hunt Steeplechase Committee are the only Turf Club and National Hunt Steeplechase Committee in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite sure that Deputy Mrs. Redmond does not suggest that we should have two turf clubs and two national hunt steeplechase committees managing racing.  So far as this Bill is concerned, the Turf Club and the stewards of the National Hunt Steeplechase Committee will continue to exist <Col N="1123" /> but, in addition, the board set up under the Bill will have exclusive control of the management of the funds derived under the Bill.  From Deputy Mrs. Redmond's statement and certain other observations made here, it might appear that the levy proposed to be derived under this Bill would operate as a tax and that the funds would be devoted to the Exchequer.  As an instance of that, the previous tax, which operated directly as an Exchequer tax, was cited.  The previous tax differed entirely from this tax inasmuch as the funds passed into the ordinary Central Fund and did not operate to the benefit of racing except in so far as any moneys out of the Central Fund might do so.  In this case, the revenue proposed to be derived is for the exclusive use of racing&mdash;breeders, racehorse owners and everybody connected or associated with racing.</P>
    <P>The board has wide powers as regards the distribution of the funds which this levy will bring to it.  The Long Title of the Bill sets out the various matters with which it is proposed to deal.  At the risk of recapitulation, I should like to point out that, for the success of this Bill, what it proposes to do must be understood.  It will not help the Bill or the racing public or those connected with racing to misinterpret, either deliberately or innocently, the proposals contained in the measure.  This Bill is exclusively designed to assist horse breeding and everything connected with it.  The most important thing for the success of horse breeding and racing under this Bill is the personnel of the board.  It has been stated, possibly with a certain degree of foundation, that if the governing bodies have a complete majority, racing in the metropolitan area may be developed to the detriment of racing elsewhere.  For that reason, I should like to point out to the Minister the necessity of securing adequate representation for areas in the south and west, and such places as Tramore.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to get a person who will adequately represent all those areas, or the persons concerned, but I am <Col N="1124" /> sure the Minister's advisers will be able to help.  I might add that those advisers are to be complimented on assisting the Minister in drafting and bringing in this measure.  They undertook this work although it might be described as a departure from their usual activities.  They took the trouble to master all the details and necessary facts connected with racing and they deserve a full measure of credit for so doing.  In no way can it be said that this Bill has been drafted by persons who know nothing whatever about racing.  One has only to read the Bill or to have listened to the introductory speech of the Minister to know that if the Minister himself is not fully conversant with all the ins and outs of the subject he has taken the trouble to make himself acquainted with, and his advisers have informed him of, the essential needs.</P>
    <P>This question of meetings outside the metropolitan area is one which might interfere with the success of the board. Since the emergency, a number of people have been forced to the conclusion that racing is being developed exclusively in the metropolitan area and that other areas are being neglected. It is quite easy to understand how racing has become centralised.  Transport is almost impossible except on a very limited scale.  The large racing stables and the people in racing in a big way have their horses centralised at the Curragh and places around the city, such as Phoenix Park and a few other near areas.  These people are faced with the difficulty of getting horses to meetings and it is far more convenient for them and for the large majority of the racing public, who are in the metropolitan area, to attend a race meeting near the city than in the country.  Consequently, the Turf Club and the National Hunt Steeplechase Committee, as well as the emergency committee set up by the Government to deal with the matter, were faced with the difficulty of carrying on racing at all.  They had to hold meetings in or near Dublin, or the Curragh, and a few other important places where large numbers of horses are trained.  While the small meetings have suffered during the emergency, the explanation is that transport and other facilities <Col N="1125" /> which were available before the war were not available during the emergency.</P>
    <P>I am sure that there is no intention on the part of the Turf Club, the National Hunt, the transport authorities, the racing executives or anybody connected with racing to interfere in any way with the smaller meetings after the war, or even during the emergency, if it be possible to hold those meetings.  Running the risk of financial loss and small fields, the committees in some of these cases have held a number of meetings&mdash;successful meetings, which catered exclusively for horses trained in either the southern or western regions.  Since the emergency, racing has been regionalised so as to facilitate trainers and owners in racing in a certain area and give them an opportunity of winning races free from the keen competition to which they would otherwise be subjected from the larger stables at the Curragh and around Dublin.  I should like, therefore, to impress upon the Minister the absolute necessity of ensuring adequate representation for racecourse committees and racing executives outside the metropolitan area in order that no criticism may be heard that this Bill deals exclusively with racing in and around the metropolitan area or exclusively with the large owner.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the second point, that racing depends for its success on a number of factors.  First of all, it depends on the public who attend the meetings and, secondly, on the owners and trainers and jockeys who run, ride and deal with horses at each meeting; and, of course, on the breeders.  Racing in this country is almost entirely composed of small owners, who either train their horses themselves or have them trained locally.  Some of these people breed the horses, others buy them and train them for a while in the hope of winning a race and selling the horse subsequently.  It is also made up of a number of large owners, not all of whom are from foreign parts.  In fact, Deputies who made attacks on those people who are spending large sums of money here, who have invested very large interests in racing, who are of considerable benefit not alone to <Col N="1126" /> racing but to the general economy of the country, forget that for a number of years now Irish people the large Irish owners and some of the small ones, have been the leading owners when the winnings were totalled.  I think that for the last three or four years prominent Irish people have been in the first three or four on the list. While large English strings have come over here, they have been able to compete but have not been able to beat the horses trained and owned by Irishmen.</P>
    <P>If we are to depend here for our success on the public attending the meetings, and on the owners and trainers racing horses, we must ensure that they will have reasonably good stakes to win.  Some people in making their observations seem to forget that pre-war the size of the stake won by any owner here was approximately £38. That was what a winning owner received, after the money for the second and third was taken out.  I do not know whether most Deputies realise the expense entailed in keeping a horse, in paying a jockey and in paying a trainer at the present time.  It costs approximately £4 a week to train a horse.  That entails feeding him, attendance on him and paying stable lads and small incidental expenses.  On top of that, entrance fees have to be met-jockeys' fees have to be paid and transport costs have to be undertaken, in order to bring the horse to a racecourse. Then the owner is faced with the possibility that the horse may meet with a slight injury or slight mishap, even before the race starts.  But, given the ordinary circumstances in which the majority of horses brought to a meeting will complete, the owner is racing for a stake of approximately, when he wins it, £80 at the moment. So that even if an owner wins two races with one horse&mdash;and that is more than a good many horses do&mdash;there is a loss of £120 on the yearly keep of the horse.</P>
    <P>That loss has to be made up by betting, or by some other means.  As Deputy Ruttledge pointed out, the small owner endeavours to secure a good price on his horse and so win the keep and a little more.  That leads to <Col N="1127" /> two undesirable happenings.  One is that, if the horse loses the small owner loses more than he can afford and is worse off than previously.  If he wins, everything is all right.  It also leads to a number of owners doing what is called &ldquo;pulling&rdquo; their horses, in order to secure a good price.  If other people get in before the owner gets his money on, the horse hardens in price and the owner is faced with either accepting a short price or not having a bet at all.  Consequently, he has to stop the horse from winning.  If that very often happens, it is bad for racing, as people take a very poor view of a horse being stopped, particularly if they are backing him.  While that is not confined entirely to small owners, it hits the small owner more than the big one.  I have seen a case of a big stable, a heavy betting stable, anxious to get a horse at a good price, and a small one in the know gets in before them, and the result is that they accept a smaller price or stop the horse.  The Minister can imagine quite well that it is not prayers they say when they discover that someone else is in before them, and that the price has hardened. These people derive a livelihood out of racing and are depending on winning a reasonable stake, or one that at least will cover the running and training costs.</P>
    <P>I believe the levy proposed to be derived under this Bill will assist racecourses, racing owners and executives, in so far as the stakes will be increased. The general improvement which will result therefrom is that races will be run better, that horses will complete on their merits and that there will be no interference by those who are anxious to obtain a good price.  I would not like it to be taken from these remarks that every small owner stops a horse every time he finds someone else getting in before him.  They are faced, however, with the difficulty that they have to make the race pay and if they do not win to-day they have to win some other day, unless they can sell the horse in the meantime.</P>
    <P>Some of these small owners are anxious to sell the horse, when they win a race, particularly with 'chasers. <Col N="1128" /> Pre-war, these chasers were bought up mainly by buyers from England and exported to England.  They made their name there in winning a large number of races or in winning one or two very big races.  I hope that that will continue after the war.  At the moment, there is an unfortunate ban operating between the two countries, under which a horse has to be a certain length of time in training here or in England before it can race, if it comes from the other country.  I think that ban is unfortunate, as it militates against chasers being exported from here and, likewise, people who want to race horses here which were formerly trained in England are unable to do so, unless the horse has been six months trained in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not know what shortsightedness operated to introduce that proposal, but the result of it has been that some very good horses left here last year and are now in the difficulty that they cannot race in either place.  They were under six months in training in England and the ban operated to prevent them racing there and they were over six months out of Ireland, so they cannot race here.  They fall between the two stools.  If the Minister can assist in any way to get that ban lifted it would be an extremely good thing. It does not operate against a very large number of either owners or horses, but it causes a certain amount of friction: it is unnecessary and undesirable and may militate against the general trade afterwards.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a word at this stage about the funds which the Minister hopes to derive.  I do not propose to give an opinion as to a suitable rate, but I would recommend that very considerable care be taken before a rate is decided upon.  It may be that it will not bear the ceiling which is put in the Bill.  On the other hand, it may happen that, if a smaller rate is put on, it will be readily accepted, while if a higher rate were in operation more money would be derived. If the Minister consults his advisers, it should be possible to estimate approximately the most suitable rate.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, the danger of <Col N="1129" /> diminishing returns operating, no matter what rate is put on but I think if the public and those connected with racing generally realise the benefits which should accrue, if this measure is universally accepted as being for the benefit of racing, that the levy is not a tax to benefit the Exchequer, that the funds to be derived will be put back into racing and breeding, and that it will assist racecourse executives to improve racing amenities, so much the better.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned that nobody in racing wants deck chairs, that nobody wants any extravagant degree of comfort.  I quite agree, but, when going to the races, nobody wants to fall over a bicycle or have to push his way through a crowd in an endeavour to get in for the first race.  Many people have that experience when there is a large crowd gathering for the races. There is one small gateway, perhaps, and even that is not leading into any particular enclosure.  Everyone has to get through that small gate.  The difficulty both for the officials and the public is extremely annoying, and it causes all kinds of friction.  People's nerves get a bit frayed when they are in a hurry, and the officials get annoyed when they are flustered, with the result that when people get to the racecourse their minds are far away from the subject of getting the first winner.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to racecourse amenities.  I was at a race meeting recently.  I do not want to name the executive or the racecourse, because it is possible that the managements of racecourses are endeavouring to do their best in the circumstances.  At this particular meeting the weather conditions were not too good.  It was a very wet day, and the going was soft.  There was one towel for all the jockeys to use.  Every jockey riding at that race meeting&mdash;there was possibly an average of 20 horses in each race, and there were six or seven races&mdash;needed a wash afterwards.  It was a muddy day, and yet there was only one towel in the jockey-room and one basin of water. Deputies can imagine the difficulties the jockeys had in washing themselves, taking off the mud, and all having to dry themselves with the one towel. <Col N="1130" /> That is no exaggeration.  It has happened at a number of other racecourses. I will admit that the water supply in this particular instance broke down because of the frost, but, even if there was sufficient water, the jockeys would still be wet because of the lack of towels.</P>
    <P>One of the most essential requirements of racing is that the amenities for jockeys, apprentices and stable boys should be adequate.  Stable boys, a large number of them, travel long distances.  They are up very early and have to attend the horses.  They have to face a journey in the train, possibly a fairly arduous one, and horses are liable to become frightened in transit. The stable boys are faced with the difficulty of getting something to eat at a fairly cheap rate and they have to provide themselves with a wash and other necessary toilet arrangements. No provision is made by racing executives for stable lads, and the provision for jockeys is sometimes wholly inadequate. It is to be hoped this board will devote some of its funds to the improvement of amenities, not perhaps on a grandiose scale, but at least on a scale that will meet with the approval of jockeys and apprentices and those others who are dealing with horses.</P>
    <P>As other Deputies mentioned, these apprentices are paid only a nominal wage, something very low on the scale. The duties of these lads are arduous. They have considerable responsibility. They are dealing with very valuable horses in many cases, and some better provision should be made for them.  A number of them become successful jockeys, but there are others who, either through increasing weight or inability to ride efficiently or skilfully, never become fully-fledged jockeys. They are faced with the alternative of giving up racing or remaining as stable boys.  Although trade union rates of wages are in operation, apprentices are not governed by any such regulations.</P>
    <P>These lads are vital to the interests of racing, from a number of angles. One is that unless a trainer has trustworthy stable lads, the stable may get into the hands of unserupulous individuals. Information may go out, all kinds of interference may take place <Col N="1131" /> with the horses, and so far as the trainer and owner are concerned, the prices may be ruined by information getting out to the public and by the market being taken before they get in. While these matters are incidental to racing, and possibly not essential taken together they mean much in the proper and efficient working of racing establishments and it is very necessary that these people should be carefully considered.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the section of the Bill which deals with the admission of bookmakers and their assistants.  I quite agree that bookmakers are absolutely essential to racing.  The bookmakers here have contributed a good deal to racing over a long period. I would also like to express the view that unless racing is prosperous, bookmakers will not be prosperous.  The argument that racing is prosperous at the moment is wholly useless.  Let us consider the position racing was in ten years ago, when the executives and everyone else connected with racing were clamouring for Government intervention. Merely because it is prosperous at the moment is no reason for not taking adequate steps to deal with the situation and to endeavour to plan, in so far as State intervention can achieve it, that this industry will be prosperous after the war.</P>
    <P>Section 25 (3) amends Section 3 of the Totalisator Act, 1929, and allows the racecourse executive, at the instigation of the board, to charge any particular figure.  I think the Minister will agree that it is undesirable that bookmakers should be prevented from attending, if they conform adequately to the regulations, and it is possible that if the board or a member of it was sufficiently averse to a particular bookmakers, due possibly to some betting experience, he or they might operate this section to the detriment of the bookmaker.  The Minister should consider submitting an amendment to re-insert the section of the 1929 Act or, at any rate, a ceiling should be put on what could be charged to bookmakers and their assistants when entering racecourses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1132" /> I come now to the question of the levy, perhaps the most important portion of the Bill so far as the public are concerned.  I think the public and anyone connected with racing will readily accede to a charge when they see it is to be devoted to the benefit of racing and the improvement of racing amenities.  Any of us who bet may have our own particular fancy either for a bookmaker or the Tote; but the vast majority of small bettors bet with the Tote, possibly because they are not particularly interested in having a chat with the bookmaker or getting a particularly attractive price.  I think most people should be anxious to get as good a price as possible.  At any rate, they accept the price which the Tote gives them, which is usually fairly lengthy odds; they feel more inclined to bet with the Tote and then take their stand somewhere in order to see the race.  There are other people anxious to get a good price and they do not mind how they are buffeted about if they go to the bookmaker and they take a chance on seeing the race as best they can.</P>
    <P>In betting with the Tote the people are paying a tax, but that particular aspect seldom enters their heads.  If you ask people who bet with the Tote if they are paying a tax at the same time, they really do not seem to know whether they are or not.  They think any deduction made is devoted to running expenses and other incidentals. The tax on Tote bets, the proceeds of which are devoted to racing, is 10 per cent. and it has been of considerable benefit.  In conjunction with the Minister, I think that full tribute should be paid to the members of the Tote Board who, without any remuneration for a number of years and, particularly at the start when Tote operations were new in this country, when they ran the risk of failure and encountered all kinds of difficulties incidental to the early management of a scheme, operated the scheme successfully and reached the very high level of turnover which they show at present.</P>
    <P>Ten per cent. is devoted to racing, and the commission set up in 1942 reported very favourably on the <Col N="1133" /> amount of money derived from Tote betting which increased considerably last year.  I think the Minister's figure was that approximately £48,000 had been devoted from Tote betting to the provision of stakes, reduced transport of horses, and so on.  I should like to correct Deputy Mrs. Redmond's impression that the Tote does not make any contribution to racing.  The Tote has been one of the greatest contributors to racing in the last 10 or 12 years, and it is quite likely that but for the money derived from Tote bets, a number of smaller racing executives would have had either to reduce the number of their meetings in the year or abandon them entirely.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a levy and the fund derived from it is to be devoted to increasing stakes, reducing entrance fees and reducing entrance charges to the public.  If racing is to be continued here, the people who are beneficiaries under the Bill, or who will be the beneficiaries, must have a fairly adequate assurance that some reasonable remuneration will be available, and Deputy Briscoe is entirely wrong in his statement that the beneficiaries are not being asked to contribute anything.</P>
    <P>The beneficiaries under this Bill are contributing.  Each owner, each trainer and each member of the public who benefits by racing is contributing in entrance fees, in the payment of the charge into a race meeting and in other ways.  The owner has to pay a very heavy sum in entrance fees, and then is faced with the prospect of winning a small stake.  The biggest punters, as I have been reminded by Deputy Hughes, will possibly pay more than anybody else under the Bill, but these people are able to bet in a big way and the sympathy of the majority of race-goers is possibly not always with them, although they are very necessary to racing.  If a person, however, is able to bet in sums as large as £100 or £500, the few pounds tax taken from him under the Bill is a very small amount compared with the amount he is able to wager, and I think such people might easily afford it in order that racing may be maintained successfully and properly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1134" /> For that reason, if the levy is administered properly and a suitable figure arrived at, and if the public appreciate fully the necessity for maintaining racing at the high level at which it has been maintained, I think they will willingly contribute and will not object to paying it, because if they are asked to pay a little extra in the form of a levy and if an equal reduction is made in the entrance charge, the result, so far as either the owners or the public are concerned, is the same, while racing has benefited.</P>
    <P>The suggestion was made here that the fees derived by owners of sires should be taxed.  A similar tax operated a number of years ago, but was withdrawn because a number of owners got rid of their horses, or brought them over to England.  While the English owner might have been able to take his horse out of this country, the Irish owner was faced with selling him or allowing him to stand in England, and most people do not want to have their horses standing in England if they are living in this country.  I want to resist strongly the suggestion that sires' fees should be taxed.  It might equally be urged that a man who has a number of mares should be taxed on the profits he gets from the sale of yearlings or young horses.</P>
    <P>If sires' fees are taxed, the result will be that good sires will leave the country.  No later than last week two very good English horses came into this country and are to stand here.  They are what might be described as first-class horses, or, if not quite first-class the next thing to it.  These horses are a source of real benefit to this country.  Irish owners will have an opportunity of using them and they will improve the standard of the stock, and if the owner is taxed on the fees, in addition to the ordinary taxes he has to pay, he will be forced to bring those horses back to England.  In fact, since the war, a number of people in England who were paying income-tax on their earnings formed syndicates in order to avoid the tax and that has been detrimental to racing.  A number of these wealthy people formed a syndicate in relation <Col N="1135" /> to a particular horse and auctioned his services at the highest price, or drew lots amongst themselves.  Various poor classes of mares were sent to the horse, with the result that breeding is detrimentally affected.</P>
    <P>This matter was discussed here before and the tax, which operated during the economic war, was withdrawn by the Government.  I think the Government were quite wise in doing so, but, at that time, a couple of very good sires had left the country, and it was quite obvious that more sires were about to leave.  While Deputy Fogarty appears to be under the misapprehension that these horses were taken out of the country because their owners did not like this country or had some bitterness against it, in one particular case, the owner was an Irishman who still has a large stud in this country.  So far as I know, he has neither bitterness nor anything else against the country.  His whole desire is to benefit racing and horse breeding here.  He was forced, because of the tax on sires' fees, to bring his horse out of the country as he could not afford to keep him here, but, since the tax was taken off, he has had at his stud three sires.  Surely that is an indication that the man did not want to bring his horse out of the country.</P>
    <P>Most people interested in racing are interested from two angles: it is either their business, or they are able to afford it as a hobby; but whichever it is, they are a benefit to the country and I want to say that I deplore, as Deputy Ruttledge deplores, the references to the stewards of the Turf Club, the references to these horse owners and horse breeders who have raced horses in this country, some of whom have come from far away and have expended very large sums of money before deriving any benefit, who are maintaining not one large stud but a number of them in this country and who are employing large numbers of people at good rates of wages, buying the produce of the farmers and benefiting the country in every possible way.</P>
    <P>I want to deplore the suggestion that these people should be victimised because <Col N="1136" /> they do not come within the definition of nationalism as given by Deputy Briscoe.  I should be very slow to accept a definition of nationalism from Deputy Briscoe, and that is as far as I shall go in the matter.  I think that nationalism is a term which is bandied about considerably not only here but elsewhere, and that a satisfactory definition of it is not available. I shall await some higher authority for a definition of it than the two Fianna Fáil Deputies who attempted to give the House one.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want again to compliment the Minister, and to recommend the acceptation of the Bill to the House.  I suggest to him that, if necessary, he should leave the Second Reading of the Bill to a free vote of the House to see if those who have endeavoured to misinterpret and misrepresent its provisions can influence the vast majority of Deputies who are not, perhaps, as well informed about racing as other Deputies may be.  I look forward to the day when Irish horses, whether trained here or elsewhere, but at any rate bred in Ireland, will win races not only in England but in America and on the Continent, when once again we shall read in our newspapers graphic descriptions of the big successes of horses, with the addendum &ldquo;bred in Ireland.&rdquo;  The day is not far distant, I hope, when our horses will again act as ambassadors for this country, when our Army jumping team will be again going forth to win fresh triumphs, meeting and beating all-comers in every land.  I am convinced that this Bill will assist racing and everything connected with it, and I heartily recommend it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heskin</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the Bill.  The Minister, I hope, will do all that he can for the small breeder.  The best service that he could render him would be to ensure that the Racing Board will preserve our provincial racecourses whether in the west, south or east.  I hope there is no intention of centralising racing, and that when this Racing Board is set up the small breeders will have representation on it.  In the south we have four race-courses&mdash;at <Col N="1137" /> Tramore, Mallow, Killarney and Tralee.  We look forward to a full programme of racing at each of these centres when the war is over and transport difficulties no longer exist. It would be a serious matter for the small breeder who trains his own horses if there was to be any interference with the provincial racecourses. We all admit, of course, the importance of racing in the metropolitan area where very fine meetings are held.</P>
      <P>The racing industry gives a big amount of employment and provides a fine market for the farmers' produce. I hope the Minister will see to it that under Section 12 the Racing Board will not have the power to dispose of any of our provincial racecourses.  The amount of the stakes is also an important matter for the small breeder. As the Minister probably knows, a big percentage of farmers in the south breed, train, and race horses in a small way.  The horses as a rule get a first trial at point-to-point meetings, and eventually may compete at Punches-town where, of course, there is always a ready market for the good type of chaser or hunter.  The point that I want to impress on the Minister is that unless the stakes at the small provincial meetings are increased to some extent the small man will find it difficult to keep horses.  I hope the Minister will give all the encouragement that he can in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy P.J. Fogarty seemed to think that the tax or levy on bets was going to be a serious matter for the bookmakers.  We all admit that the latter give a good deal of employment in their offices, through the hire of cars and the staffs they require at race meetings.  The position of the small owner should not be forgotten either. It costs a man something to breed and train a horse and he may have to wait a long time before that horse wins a race for him.  I hold that, if some small contribution is asked from the public to help the racing industry, no injustice whatever is being done, especially when one takes into consideration the large crowds that are to be seen outside the cinemas in our cities and towns who quite freely pay the <Col N="1138" /> amusements tax in order to attend the pictures.  Why, therefore, should anybody object to a small levy which is intended to improve racing?  I think the Bill is a good one and that it will receive whole-hearted support from every sportsman in the country.  The Minister is to be congratulated on having brought it forward.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that when the Racing Board is established the obligation should be placed on it to formulate a scheme to help small breeders whereby premiums would be offered to enable them to obtain the services of high-class sires for their brood mares, something on the lines of the scheme for nominations to mares of the draught type which, for years past, has been operated by the county committees of agriculture. There are many small breeders who have suitable mares for stud purposes but who are not in the position to pay the service fees of high-class sires. The most they can afford is a fee of £5, £9 or perhaps 19 guineas and such a fee will not enable them to secure the services of really high-class sires for their brood mares.  I hope the scheme of nominations to which I have referred will be introduced.  Such a scheme would enable the small breeder to take his place amongst the big breeders who because of their financial position, have the advantage in breeding racehorses.</P>
    <P>Last night an attack was made by Deputy P.J. Fogarty on some members of the Turf Club.  He said that under this Bill the bookies were being pole-axed.  Whatever sympathy some of us had with the bookies before Deputy Fogarty's speech, I think Deputy Fogarty himself pole-axed the bookies case.  He referred to men like Major Watt.  I do not like to interrupt in this House, but I was nearly forced to do so last night.  I have known Major Watt for a long number of years and I say that there are too few men like him in the country who come over here to spend their money and put it in the farmer's pocket in the hunting field and who support racing to a very great extent.  In County Cork Major Watt was one of the leading lights on <Col N="1139" /> the racecourse and in the hunting field, and I would be the last to wish to hear anything said against men like him.  I take this opportunity to repudiate the attack that was made by Deputy Fogarty on such men.  We have too few men like Major Watt in the country.  I wish we had more men like him who would ride the races for us, even in the small racecourses, because they are out for the honour and glory of the sport.</P>
    <P>When the board is established I hope that men like Major Watt will be represented as well as the small breeder and the small trainer.  They give their lives, and their money and their very best to the sport.  I think no better men could be on the board than Major Watt and Mr. Justice Wylie, who was also mentioned last night.  I am only small fry, but I have known these men for a long time.  I know that we cannot carry on racing in this country without money.  We must have men with money to make racing a success.  Where would Deputy Fogarty be, where would any bookie be, were it not for the men who put their money into racing?  I do not back horses, although I race them in a small way, because I know the difficulties that may be encountered over the steeplechase course.  There is no certainty in racing.</P>
    <P>I give my wholehearted support to the Bill but I hope the Minister will bear in mind the points I have raised. I trust the Irish horse will maintain its supremacy in the racing world.</P>

      <P>One of the most remarkable and unexpected results of the introduction of the Bill is that it appears to have split the two big Parties in the House from top to bottom.

      <P>I was impressed by the view expressed by Deputy Cosgrave that the Bill should be left to an open vote of the House, because I think it is a Bill in regard to which there can be very little political feeling.  Most of the Deputies who have spoken on the Bill have been experts in one way or another in regard to racing. Possibly, the Minister may be an exception. I am not an expert and, as an impartial outsider, I have been deeply impressed by the case made for the Bill from every possible angle. Most of the arguments against the Bill were, in my opinion, based mainly on misapprehension.  I think that is true in respect of the very able case that was made by Deputy Mrs. Redmond. I think Deputy Mrs. Redmond overestimated the effect the levy would have on bookmakers.  We know that at the present time the Tote pays a levy of 10 per cent.  That has not interfered with the progress of betting on the Tote, which has steadily advanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to raise a fund to be utilised for the benefit of racing.  A principle is involved about which there has been a good deal of discussion in the country. The people who will provide the fund are the people interested in racing. Certain philosophers may say that that system of collecting money from the racing public and the racing industry generally and feeding it to the industry is simply a process of feeding the dog on his own tail.  That argument has been advanced very frequently in regard to the agriculture.  It has been said that, as the farmer is the main taxpayer, any money provided for agriculture out of taxation amounts to feeding the dog on his own tail.  This Bill proposes to feed the horse on his own tail.  Anybody who studies the matter carefully will understand that there is definite reason for carrying out that policy in regard to racing. Much money might be spent by race-goers and the public generally on racing which might not go to the best interests of racing.  In this Bill it is proposed to set up a board which will see that the fund will be utilised to the best advantage of the various <Col N="1141" /> aspects of racing.  A good many Deputies who are experts in this matter commended the principle of raising the stakes at the various race meetings.  After all, is not the stake which they will win the main inducement to people to race?  It is a very considerable inducement, at any rate, and it should therefore be as high as it is possible to make it.  That would get over the difficulty which small owners and breeders have, that if the stakes are not sufficiently high they are forced, as Deputy Cosgrave pointed out, to endeavour to increase the stakes by betting perhaps more heavily than their means would justify.</P>
    <P>I think it is the duty of any impartial person who speaks in this House and of representatives of impartial Parties to express the strongest condemnation of the views expressed by Deputy Briscoe and, to a greater extent, by Deputy Fogarty.  The people who are to continue to control racing under this Bill and who have controlled it for many years may not hold the same political views as the majority of the people.  But who wants to introduce politics into racing?  I think that a good feature of the Bill is that it leaves the control mainly in the hands of those who have controlled racing in the past.</P>
    <P>There is too much of a tendency at present to sweep away old-established systems and institutions and replace them by something new.  But when we have institutions which have achieved considerable success in the past, we should be very slow to interfere with them.  We must remember that tradition plays a very important part in any sport or business, and the people who have controlled racing in the past are people with a racing tradition in their blood.  They and their families have been associated with racing for years, and I believe they are more competent to exercise that control than, shall we say, a board or body set up by competitive examination under some Government Department.  You cannot become an expert in racing in a very short time, and, therefore, we ought not to interfere with those who have controlled racing in the past.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1142" /> Most of those who spoke on this Bill are experts or people engaged in or concerned with racing.  But we must remember that there is in this country a very large section who have very little connection with racing, and it may be no harm to examine the Bill from the point of view of those people. It might be well to ask ourselves: is it a national advantage to promote horse racing as a big industry?  Is it nationally desirable to promote this particular sport?  While I take very little interest in racing, I can advance a few good reasons why it is desirable to promote horse racing in this country.  First of all, we have the fact that it is a recreation for which we have all the raw material in this country.  We can breed the horses, we can provide the trainers and the jockeys and, since people must spend a certain amount of their money on recreation, it is preferable that their money should go to Irish jockeys, Irish trainers, and Irish racehorse owners rather than that it should go to people engaged in the film industry in America.  This is an Irish industry which provides amusement for a large section of the people.  Then we have the fact that it encourages the tourist industry; that it encourages people to come from outside to enjoy the recreations provided in this country and to spend money here.  Lastly, we have the fact that it encourages the export trade in horses which will add to the wealth of a nation.  These are at least three reasons why horse racing should be encouraged as a national industry.</P>
    <P>I believe that this money will be well spent if it is utilised, as provided in the Bill, for increasing the stakes and encouraging people to enter their horses at the various Irish race meetings. It will be well spent if it is used to improve the amenities in connection with racing and racecourses so as to give the racing public better facilities, more comfort, more convenience, and more enjoyment when they are out to enjoy themselves.  In that way, it will be good not only for the racing industry but for the nation generally.  As a non-expert, therefore, I have the <Col N="1143" /> greatest pleasure in expressing my wholehearted support of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as this Bill purports to be for the improvement and development of horse breeding and its ancillaries, such as racecourses and the control of betting, etc., I think there is general agreement with it. But I have listened to Deputy Fogarty and Deputy Briscoe, on the one hand, making the case for the bookmakers, and to Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy Heskin and others making the case for the breeders and I am just in between. I have no brief for the bookmakers or for the members of the Turf Club.  As a matter of fact, I did not know the names of these members until they were read out, although I must have been going to race meetings for 20 years.  As I say, I am in between the two bodies.  I represent the longsuffering, silent persons known as the public.  I want to know why should a man for whom racing is an entertainment have to pay a levy for the improvement of horse racing and racecourses? I have a very simple proposition to put to the Minister.  If I want to start a little industry which would be a good industry from a national point of view, I put before the Department of Industry and Commerce the details of that business and, if it is a good business, I get a loan under the Trade Loans Act.  I pay back my principal and I also pay 5 or 6 per cent on it.  Why should not racing be put on the same basis?  Why should the public have to pay 1/- in the £ for racecourse managements or for horsebreeders?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Put them on their merits as businessmen. We have had a great influx of these people to our racecourses&mdash;there never was such a boom&mdash;and I am not so sure that the real reason why the crowds fell off was on account of the tax, in the first instance.  I say here, quite bluntly, that I do not think the racing public got a fair deal when the &ldquo;fields&rdquo; here were small.  I think it is the general opinion of the majority of people that most of the races at that <Col N="1144" /> time were squared.  I do not think that the people who brought over their stallions and brood mares to this country were actuated solely by love of the Irish.  I think it was because they saw an opportunity of winning stakes here, and also because there is a comparative amount of safety for their stallions and brood mares in this country.</P>
    <P>On the question of the Tote versus the bookmakers' tax, however, I do not think that there is really any comparison. The Tote may be taken to represent what you might call a mutual loan society, somewhat similar to an ordinary loan fund society where people are prepared to pool their money and allow 10 per cent., for running expenses; and that 10 per cent., aggregate, mark you, pays all overheads.  They pool their money and allow that 10 per cent., and there is even a greater element of gambling, even of thrill, in that case than in the case of the bookmaker, because you do not know what you will get from the Tote, and very often, what you do get is very disappointing.  Now, I must admit that my heart does not bleed for the bookmakers, but after all they represent a cross-section of the community. They are composed of all types of men.  There are men standing up on stools, at the present time, inside or outside the ring, who went out with a rifle in 1916.  Certainly, amongst the smaller bookmakers, you will find some of these men still standing up.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to this question of betting shops, whatever you may think of them, the tendency is to put the small man out of business and put the big men in their places.  In this city you can see that all the smaller men&mdash;well, if not all, very large numbers of them&mdash;are being bought out by the monopolists, and I am afraid that that will also happen on racecourses where the small man has to forego the taking of a heavy bet which the big man can afford to take.  There is, for instance, what is known as a &ldquo;silver&rdquo; bookmaker.  That means a man who makes a book to win a little.  He cannot afford to take a chance with a big <Col N="1145" /> bet.  He makes a book, simply in order to make a week's wages, and I think that under this Bill you are going to hurt that man.  For these reasons I think that the Minister should go very carefully into this question of the levy, that he should consider that racecourse managements or the horse-breeding industry in general should be put on a business basis, and that they should seek advances of capital in the ordinary way and be prepared to repay that capital with interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this Bill on the general principle at which it aims, namely, the improvement of racing and horse-breeding in the country. I have listened to the entire debate on this Bill, and I have come to one conclusion: not to bet.  Racing, we are told, is the sport of kings, and I always felt that those who embarked upon this royal sport were motivated only by the most altruistic intentions, but having listened to the contributions to this debate by horsebreeders, owners, bookmakers, and so on, I have come to the conclusion that it is a most greedy sport and that every individual concerned in it is out to make as much as he can for himself and that the unfortunate punter comes into their calculations nowhere. It seems to me, from what I have heard in the course of this debate, that the unfortunate punter has to take the risk of countering the blows and thwarting the plans of the bookmaker, the trainer, the owner, the jockey, and so on; that the whole lot of them are in a conspiracy to make money out of him and that he has very little chance of getting anything out of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone who has read Goldsmith's <i>Deserted Village</i> will probably remember the reference to &ldquo;the royal game of goose.&rdquo;  I once looked that up, and I found that there were 12 rules to the game, attributed to King Charles of England, and amongst these 12 rules there was one which said: &ldquo;Don't wager.&rdquo;  Thinking over the debate on this matter during the last couple of days, I have certainly decided not to wager.  I shall not go into the ethical <Col N="1146" /> aspect of betting.  That has been decided on a previous Bill in this House, and we have accepted betting as a necessary evil but one which, perhaps, should be controlled by the State in one way or another.  There is, however, one aspect of that particular evil which has not been mentioned in this debate.  Under the 1931 Act a bookmaker is prohibited from having a bet with a person under 18 years of age.  There is no similar prohibition imposed in connection with the Tote, and I think that in order that the Tote and the bookmaker should be placed upon a basis of equality in this matter, there should be a similar prohibition in the case of young persons betting with the Tote on racecourses.  It seems to be only fair and reasonable that that should be done, even from the bookmakers' point of view.</P>
    <P>The Bill aims at two things, largely: the improvement of racing and of horse breeding and the better control of racecourses.  I have considerable doubts that this Bill, as framed, will improve horse breeding, and particularly breeding by small owners. Listening to the arguments advanced here for an improvment of stakes, I got the impression that the idea of the improvement of stakes was to attract &mdash;perhaps, not to attract, but to keep in this country&mdash;the big owners whom we have already attracted here, and to ensure that they will not leave us when the war is over.  If that is to be the effect of improving stakes, I can see a position arising where the big owners will stay on in this country and the present condition of things continue here.  I have heard several small owners, including members of this Party, say that at the present time it is a physical impossibility for them to win a stake at any race meeting in the country, in view of the large number of horses that these big owners can put into any particular race.  It might be held that that is due to this particular emergency, but I hold that it is essential that under this Bill we should make sure that the small owner would have a fair chance of winning a stake.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly, but the position at the moment is that where there are, say, 20 horses in a race, the big owner is able to enter a large number of horses in that race, and it is impossible for the small owner to compete, or have any hope of winning a stake, in such circumstances.  He simply cannot do it.  It is a physical impossibility.</P>

      <P>I am taking my facts from a man who breeds, owns and races horses, and that is his experience in the present conditions.  Deputy Ruttledge made that case for the Bill, but if that is to be the effect of the Bill, I think that we must ensure that the small owner gets a fair crack of the whip as against the big fellow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the second point, the improvement of breeding, there is nowhere in this Bill, to my mind, a sufficient guarantee that the small owner will be enabled by this Bill to improve blood-stock. The matters that are set out in Section 15 in regard to the application of the funds of the board, whilst all in a sense palliatives, and in a way assisting towards the reduction of the costs of racing, do not bear directly on this question of breeding.  I think that a certain proportion of the money should be set aside as suggested by Deputy Heskin for the purpose of enabling small owners to bring their mares to sires charging high fees.  By some system of grants, they might be enabled to take their mares to high-priced sires.  Some system of nomination, perhaps, might be introduced, but unless something like that is done I do not think the Bill is going to have the effect intended.  The Bill is full of good intentions, undoubtedly, but the extraordinary thing about the <Col N="1148" /> Bill is that the fulfilment of these intentions is left to a body outside the control of this House, outside the control of the Minister who introduced the Bill, and we have nothing but of these goodwill and the good faith of these people for the fulfilment of these intentions.</P>
    <P>That is a feature of the Bill worthy of consideration.  We do tie them up to a certain extent as to the manner in which they shall apply their funds, but I think the manner in which we achieve that is not sufficiently watertight. We ask these people to give us only an annual report and to furnish an audited statement of accounts once a year.  We do not ask that that report and statement of accounts be laid on the Table of this House.  I think, having regard to the amount of public money which is being contributed under this Bill, it is only right and reasonable that the annual report and statement of accounts should be tabled here.  I would go further and suggest that before these people are permitted to apply their funds in any given direction as under Section 15, they should be made to prepare some form of scheme which would be approved by the Minister in advance, so that at any given time the Minister could be sure that the funds are being applied under an approved scheme.  I think that in that way we could make sure that the objects of the Bill would be achieved.</P>
    <P>There are certain objects set out in the Bill but one extraordinary omission, I think, has been made.  The funds may be applied for the increase of stake money and prizes at horse races, the reduction of entrance fees, smaller charges for the carriage of horses, the reduction of charges to the public for admission, the improvement of racecourses, or to any purpose approved by the Minister conducive to the improvement of the breeding of horses.  I should like to mention the question of advertising.  It has been the subject of a recommendation by the commission which enquired into the matter of horse breeding, and has been mentioned here by Deputy Hughes and a number of other speakers.  The advertising of our <Col N="1149" /> horses and races is an important consideration. Deputy Cosgrave also stressed the necessity for proper propaganda in these matters.  I think that we should specifically include that as one of the objects for which funds may be applied under Section 15. There is no doubt that propaganda and advertising could do a good deal to improve breeding here.  Up to now we have been dependent more or less upon the results of racing at home and abroad and upon the achievements of our Army jumping team to advertise Irish horses.  I think we shall have to go further than that, that we shall have to glamourise this sport and have a widespread propaganda in Britain, the United States, France and in every country where horse racing or horse breeding is a sport, a business or a pastime.</P>
    <P>Much has been said here as to the constitution of the board.  The personnel has been attacked on the grounds that the members of the Turf Club represent certain interests here which are not national.  I do not know what Deputy Briscoe or Deputy Fogarty regards as national.  I should like to put it another way&mdash;that any man who, by his business or private enterprise, does something which improves not only his own business but the business of others, is acting in a patriotic way and that man should not be in any way discouraged from so acting.  The remarks made by these Deputies were altogether in bad taste.  They went even further than that; they were offensive to people who are spending a great deal of money in this country.  In my own constituency we have gentlemen like Major McCalmont.  If Major McCalmont were by reason of the attitude of these Deputies forced to leave this country&mdash;and if we are to believe their remarks, if these Deputies had the power, I think they would compel such people to leave the country&mdash;not only would it be a loss to horse racing, breeding and hunting, but certain places in the country might close down.  Thomastown, for example, in my constituency might simply go out of business.  I think it deplorable that <Col N="1150" /> we should have to listen to that type of criticism here.</P>
    <P>I found it very hard not to interrupt Deputy Briscoe when he assumed the green, white and gold mantle of Kathleen Ni Houlihan and described the people on the Turf Board and the National Hunt Committee as aliens, as people not only alien in race but without sympathy with this country.  I should like to remind Deputy Briscoe that the members of the Anglo-Irish gentry, whom he decries, have perhaps contributed more to the national movement in this country than the people whom Deputy Briscoe has the honour to represent.  I would just remind Deputy Briscoe that Lord Edward Fitzgerald, Wolfe Tone, Emmet, Butt, Parnell, Redmond, Flood, Grattan&mdash;I need not go on&mdash;all came from that stock which is so decried by the Deputy.  Indeed Deputy Fogarty described them at one time as a gang and at another time as reminiscent of a British court martial, in terms which were to say the least of it disgusting to listen to.  I think we should place on record our entire disapproval of comments of that kind.  The Turf Club and the National Hunt Committee are the bodies controlling flat racing, steeplechasing and point-to-point racing. They still continue, and, judging by those Deputies' remarks, one would assume that a number of them were being vested with certain powers under this Bill&mdash;that the whole business of racing was being handed over to them.  That is not the position. They will continue their functions as heretofore in the control of racing; they will exercise the limited functions which they are getting under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been described by Deputy Fogarty as a Bill to pole-axe the bookmaker.  That was his first definition of it.  On the second occasion he seemed to think that it was not exactly a question of the pole-axe but of the humane killer.  There are some grounds for sympathy with Deputy Fogarty's outlook on this matter.  I have a feeling that enthanasia may be practised upon the bookmaker, because two commissions have examined this matter&mdash;the racing commission and the smaller body which inquired <Col N="1151" /> into horse breeding&mdash;and both of them recommended the abolition of the bookmaker.  They recommended that no new licences should be issued&mdash; that existing bookmakers should be allowed to die out.  Both of them made that recommendation.  Those people are largely representative of the board which will be established under this Bill, so that there are grounds for the fears expressed by the bookmaker, having regard to those recommendations. Deputy Ruttledge gave us a new line on that last night.  He said that a smaller committee representative of racing interests had met, and that they had put aside those recommendations &mdash;that they had no intention of killing the bookmaking profession.  It is not at all clear that the intention is not still there.  I want to make myself clear on this matter.  I do not mind if every bookmaker in Ireland is executed, as a bookmaker, in the morning; I do not mind if his profession is done away with.  I have no sympathy in that matter.  I regard the profession of bookmaking as a parasitic profession. I do not think they serve any useful, economic, productive purpose, looking at them in a broad way. Therefore, I hold no brief for them at all.  But, as they are there, and as betting always will be there&mdash;whether you regularise bookmakers or control or prohibit them you will always have bookmakers&mdash;I think we should ensure that they are put on a safe footing, a reasonable footing <i>vis-a-vis</i> the &ldquo;Tote&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill the board may set up the &ldquo;Tote&rdquo;.  It may set up new racecourses and it may set up a &ldquo;Tote&rdquo; on those new racecourses.  There is in addition the extraordinary provision that, in their absolute discretion, they may or may not give a course betting permit to a bookmaker.  The bookmaker has first to go to the State officials, the Gárdaí and the Revenue Commissioners, to be registered as a bookmaker.  Having done that, he must then face the obstacle of getting a course-betting permit.  The board in its absolute discretion may grant it or refuse it, and there is a danger that a certain element in the bookmaking <Col N="1152" /> profession maybe excluded.  There is a danger, as Deputy McCann pointed out, that only the big bookmaker may be encouraged and that the small man may be put out of business.  I am not concerned now with those who have been warned off, and who automatically cannot get on to the course.  But there is the danger to which I have referred, and I think the Minister should take some precautions in this measure to ensure that those people will be permitted to continue to earn their livelihood in that very doubtful way.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (6) of the Totalisator Act does provide that, wherever a &ldquo;Tote&rdquo; is set up, provision must be made for standing accommodation for the bookmaker. At the same time there is, as it were in conflict with that, this peculiar provision here that the board in its absolute discretion may or may not grant a course-betting permit.  If the course-betting permit is refused, there is still the provision under the 1929 Act that accommodation must be provided for the bookmaker.  There is a certain amount of conflict between those two provisions, which will have to be reconciled sooner or later.  I suggest to the Minister that now is the time to do it, rather than await some untoward event which may crop up through a bookmaker insisting on his rights.  Once he has got his betting licence, he is entitled to go on the course.  The 1929 Act says that he is entitled to accommodation on the course.  The conflict between those two provisions will have to be reconciled. In the exercise of that peculiar discretion which the board have they may be influenced by the findings of those two bodies.  My reading of the two reports is that those bodies were definitely biased in favour of the &ldquo;Tote&rdquo; as against the bookmaker, so that the fears expressed by Deputy Fogarty, in his own forcible, expressive Dublinese, are really well-founded.</P>
    <P>With regard to the levy, I think it will present a certain amount of difficulty. Under the Bill as framed, you will have the same condition of things obtaining as obtained under the 1926 Act.  Deputy Bennett went into this matter very fully, and I do not want <Col N="1153" /> to go over the ground again.  I think the Minister is clear that where a man puts on £1 bet the bookmaker treats that as 19/-.  At odds of 5 to 1, instead of the punter getting £6, he gets the odds to 19/-, and his return is, therefore, something like £5 14s.  I think you will have to put a provision in this Bill to deal with that.  It is open to the bookmaker to give it that interpretation. This definition is lifted from the definition in the 1926 Act.  Deputy Ruttledge suggested that it should be an offence for the bookmaker not to accept the tax at the time the bet is made.  That might get over the difficulty of a cash bet, but I do not think it will get over the difficulty of a credit bet.  I should like to see a provision tightening that up in some way&mdash;it could be considered later&mdash;so that the £1 bet would be treated as a £1 bet, and the tax on that paid at the same time, it being compulsory on the punter to pay the tax and on the bookmaker to receive it, and an offence for either of them to evade it.  It may be possible to get over the difficulty in some way like that, but the matter will have to be considered, because the punter feels a definite grievance in this matter.  He is not represented on any of those bodies.  I have spoken to a number of men who are in the habit of going to racing at the present time, and they resent this levy, not so much from the point of view of refusing to contribute to horse breeding or that kind of thing, but they feel that the position of the 1926 to 1931 period is going to be restored.  It was a nuisance before, and they feel it will be a nuisance again.  I think we should attempt to avoid that by inserting some provision on the lines suggested.</P>
    <P>There was a point mentioned by Deputy Mrs. Redmond which, I think, is deserving of consideration.  It arises under Section 28 in regard to the inspection of documents on a book-maker's premises.  The section says that an authorised officer of the board may (subject to the production by him if so required of his authority in writing as such authorised officer) at any time enter any premises in which the business of bookmaking is carried on, and call for the production of <Col N="1154" /> documents.  That means that, at any time of the day or night, an officer of the board may enter the private residence of any man who is in the habit of taking course bets.  The powers there, I think, are rather drastic, and may give rise to a certain amount of difficulty and trouble.  I can imagine cases in which an officer of the board would require the assistance of the Gárda if he were to be permitted to enter in this fashion.  I think that that right should apply only to the registered premises of the bookmaker and not to his private dwelling.  To give officers of the board power to invade a man's private dwelling is rather drastic.  If that is the intention, I ask the Minister to reconsider the point which has been made, which is a good one.  This would give rise to a great deal of friction and trouble.</P>

      <P>These are wide powers to give to a private citizen acting for a private body.  I think that the matter should be considered in Committee, as it may be open to abuse. The only other point to which I desire to refer has reference to the constitution of the board.  This matter was dealt with in England under the Racecourse Betting Act, 1928.  The Racing Board set up under that Act was constituted as follows&mdash;one member appointed by the Home Secretary, one member appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland, one member by the Minister for Agriculture, one member by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, three members of the Jockey Club, two members by the National Hunt Committee, one member by the Racecourse Association, Limited, and one member by the Committee of Tattersall's.  I regard a constitution of that kind as more likely to ensure that the interests of the various people concerned&mdash; owners, jockeys, bookmakers and so forth&mdash;will be protected than will be the case under the omnibus provision <Col N="1156" /> in Section 4.  It is intended to ensure that people connected with racing in any shape or form will be included, and I think that the Minister should set out specifically who should be included. That would leave less room for criticism, and there would be fewer grievances. The opinion has already been expressed here that the bookmaker may not get a fair crack of the whip on this board and that the small breeder and small owner may not be fully represented on it.  It is essential that they should have fair representation.  It would be only right that the Minister should take power to remove any person from the board who is not performing his functions on it.  You might have a person on the board who, by reason of age, would cease to take an interest in it.  It would be only right that such a person should be removed and replaced by an active member.  In England, the body appointing a member of the board has a right to remove him.  However, here we make the appointment for only five years, while, in England, I think they make the appointments indefinitely.  I welcome the Bill, with these reservations.  I have doubts regarding certain matters but, as other Deputies have given expression to these doubts, I do not want to go into them in greater detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LaurenceJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. L.J. Walsh Mr. L.J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of this Party, I want to dissociate myself from, and repudiate, the personal attack made on some very honourable representatives of the racing interests.  Although I am not a racing man, I am keenly interested in our local race meetings.  On behalf of the ordinary citizens, I think that it is only right that I should express my concern regarding the provision in Section 13 of the Bill.  The old racecourses in the country have a fine historical background.  In the vicinity of Drogheda we have courses at Kells, Barronstown, Navan, Bellews-town, Mullacurry and Dundalk.  One would not be so unreasonable as to expect that, during the emergency, these racecourse committees would be accommodated and an occasional meeting held on their courses.  That cannot be expected owing to the difficulty of transport.  But, under <Col N="1157" /> Section 13, the Minister is giving very sweeping powers to the Racing Board. Under that section, the board may, with the consent of the governing bodies, &ldquo;establish, equip and maintain racecourses, and for this purpose may acquire by agreement or lease any land, including any racecourse&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a very wide and sweeping power which the Government proposes to give to the Racing Board.  In many instances, these racecourses are public property, no man's land, yet the board is being given power to take control and dispose of them.  I hate that damnable word &ldquo;centralisation&rdquo;, but I fear this Bill will eventually lead to centralisation and that all our racing will one day find itself in the eastern portion of the country or confined to the metropolitan area.  That will be bad for racing in general.  After all, the foundation of racing was the establishment of such courses as those to which I have referred.  When the local breeder produces an animal it is kept for a year or two and trained and eventually the owner is very anxious to sell it.  I can visualise the position when these people will not be interested enough in producing animals for racing, as they will not be able to avail of the opportunity to go to centralised places like Baldoyle, Leopardstown, the Phoenix Park or the Curragh.  The areas around the racecourses to which I referred previously have been breeding centres and feeding grounds of the racehorse industry generally and it will be a bad thing if this House consents to hand over these all-powerful influences over racecourses to the Racing Board.</P>
      <P>In my district, we have one pillar of the racing world in Ireland to-day, a man very well known to all the racing fraternity.  He has entered the last decade of the century, and I am glad to say that this very morning I saw that man standing on the platform waiting for his train.  He is still able to look after his own racing interests. That man started in this industry around the town of Drogheda.  He is there still, but I am afraid that if these powers are passed over to the Racing Board, such men as he will not be produced in those districts in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1158" /> I wish to congratulate Deputy Cosgrave for the very lucid statement he made here this morning in the interests of the racing fraternity.  I again repudiate the statement made from the Fianna Fáil Benches, in the nature of an attack on certain people. No matter what their political views may be, they have proven to be good citizens in many respects and I, for one, would not tolerate anyone standing up on these benches and using his position to make such a condemnation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should feel very satisfied with the reception which this measure has got from various parts of the House.  The mere fact that the overwhelming majority of speakers have praised the Bill, however, does not entitle us to ignore the points made by the minority.  Deputy Fogarty and Deputy Mrs. Redmond yesterday put their points of view and impressed a number of Deputies.  Because of the reception the Bill has got this morning, the points made by those two speakers should not be overlooked. Deputy Fogarty drew attention to the conditions generally of smaller bookmakers and spoke of their being exterminated and pole-axed.  There is a feeling abroad amongst the smaller bookmakers and their followers that they are on the downward grade on account of this Bill.  First they had the Tote in complete opposition to them and, apparently, doing them a lot of harm.  Now there is a feeling that the bigger bookmaker will be permitted to get away with things that the smaller bookmaker cannot get away with.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fogarty's statement induced Deputy Ruttledge yesterday to put forward the suggestion that Deputy Fogarty was afraid that the bigger bookmaker, in order to curry favour with his followers, may take bets and not collect a levy, whether the backer should win or lose.  If the big bookmaker is able to do so because of his big turnover, and the smaller bookmaker, who is working, as Deputy McCann said, for a week's wages, is not able to do so and must insist on the levy being paid so that he can pass it, on are we not in that way killing the smaller bookmaker?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The mere fact that the Minister has expressed that view is sufficient to encourage the board to see that the bigger men are not put in a position to injure the smaller men.</P>
      <P>I join with the other members of the House in their protests against the apparent insults levelled at the gentlemen whom the Government thought fit to put on boards.  If people go on boards to assist the Government to carry on its functions, and if they are to be attacked without any protest, the time will come when the Government may not find men like those to go on such boards.  In conclusion, I assure the Minister that his statement that the smaller bookmaker will not be crushed out, that further opposition will not be permitted against him and that he will get fair play, is sufficient to enable the House to carry the Bill through practically unanimously.</P>

      <P>I rise to support this Bill wholeheartedly, as I believe it will benefit the greatest number of our people.  From the ordinary Irishman's point of view, I welcome it, as any plans made to improve industry in our own country are welcome to everybody &mdash; the farmers, the labourers, the breeders, the jockeys, the stablemen and everybody else concerned with racing.</P>
      <P>I would like also to support Deputy Walsh as regards the protection of the small racecourses.  There is a feeling among some people living down the country, and in other areas, that the big racecourses may get a monopoly and the small ones will not get an opportunity of developing their amenities. I am sure the Minister will look into that aspect and see that fair treatment will be given to the small courses, so that this fine sport will be carried on in all parts of the country successfully.</P>
      <P>I wish, as a Fianna Fáil Deputy, to disassociate myself from the remarks that were made by at least two Deputies in the House.  I have been very near the Minister all the time, I followed the debate very closely, and I have not observed a pole-axe or anything like that near the Minister.  I think anyone who is out to improve horse breeding and horse racing in this country should be encouraged.  We should do all we can to improve the sport for the labouring man as well as for the wealthy owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of the matter that I should like Deputies to bear in mind, and that is that we have a Tourist Board which is anxious to encourage people to come to our country, and I believe one of the best ways of doing that is to improve racing by every means in our power.  I have heard a good deal about the large breeders and the small breeders.  The large breeders are in a position to help themselves, but I would like the Minister to help the small breeders as much as possible.  The new Racing Board should do something to help the small <Col N="1161" /> breeders and encourage them to develop their activities.</P>
    <P>We have heard a good deal about squeezing out the small bookmakers. I do not see anything in this Bill that squeezes out anybody.  Large numbers of people will benefit by this Bill, in my opinion.  Everybody will have to give something away, and I do not see why one section of the community should not suffer a little in order to help other sections.  Bookmakers are most necessary and are as essential to the sport as the horse breeders or anybody else connected with racing, and I do not see anything in the Bill which seeks to squeeze them out.  I must compliment the Minister for introducing this Bill.  I hope when the new Racing Board is set up that the punters and the racing community generally will have more confidence in racing and will more enjoy such a fine sport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I come from a county which is very deeply interested in racing.  Tipperary Tim was reared beside me; I was beside him in all his moods and tenses.  The Wild Man from Borneo was met at the train in Waterford by a band; he was the most modest of the bunch.  In my county the people love racing, and anything that will improve racing will have my constituents heart and soul with it.  I have known £6,000 to be given in Doncaster by the late Major Wyse for a yearling from my area.  On another occasion £8,000 was given in Doncaster for one of our products.  It is really a great industry.  I was reared in a horse-breeding area and I may assure the Minister that anything that will help on horse breeding and racing will have our warmest support.</P>
      <P>I would like, if I had the time, to dilate a little on the subject of bookmakers. They are a fine crowd of men and among other things they have added quite a number of words to our language.  They were also responsible for originating and spreading stories that, perhaps, would not bear telling in a convent or at a tea table.  Many of those stories originated with the bookmakers and the punters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy <Col N="1162" /> tell us some of those stories?  This is not exactly a convent, Deputy, and perhaps you could afford to tell them here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I daresay the Minister has heard a few of them. There was at least one punter very famous for his stories.  I was somewhat perturbed when Deputy Mrs. Redmond suggested that a plebiscite be taken in Eire a few months hence, obviously on the date selected for the election of county councils.  That would be a rather serious matter for the electors, gentlemen of the fourth estate.  Among other things this year, we shall have to elect a President.  I do not know who is the favoured candidate, but perhaps I could make a rough guess.  Anything might happen on that vote.  The people will have to vote for a President and for a county council, and they will also have to vote for a minister for racing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>And an urban council&mdash; a fourth vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The position for the voters in such circumstances will be a difficult one.  A man going forward for the county council might find himself elected President or perhaps minister for racing, and the man seeking to be minister for racing may find himself elected President, or a county councillor, and the favoured candidate for the Presidency may find himself elected somewhere else.  Maybe if you put up a prominent bookmaker he would give somebody a run for his money and he might find himself elected a county councillor, a minister for racing, or President of Eire.  I do not agree with Deputy Mrs. Redmond's suggestion to have all the elections on the same day.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I trust that it will go a long way towards bringing about an improvement in horse racing and breeding.  Any improvement in that connection will help to bring money into the country.  A close runner-up would be dog-racing, but I do not suppose I would be allowed to refer to that now.  I do hope that something to improve dog-racing and breeding will be considered later.</P>

      <P>I am surprised there is any opposition to this Bill.  In my opinion, this is the type of legislation <Col N="1163" /> that should get the unanimous support of the House.  House breeding is a very important industry.  It is the type of industry that you cannot afford to ignore and we must make every effort to establish it properly.  Our horses have achieved international fame, but I do not think we have reached the peak yet as regards Irish horses.  Our land is most suitable for rearing them and State aid to the highest extent possible should be given so as to make the industry second to the agricultural industry.</P>
      <P>A statement was made here by Deputy Fogarty concerning one of the most respected people in my county and I must repudiate what the Deputy said.  I refer to the statement he made about the Duc de Stacpoole, who is one of the most honoured members of the Meath County Council.  He has been in public life for years, and so was his father before him.  He has Irish aspirations in every vein.  He has always been a good Irishman and he is well-liked, and deservedly so, by the people of the country, and by the people in my county particularly.  In levelling a charge against him such as he has done, Deputy Fogarty was unfair and unjust and mean.  I would like Deputy Fogarty to realise that the Duc de Stacpoole was in public life before he was heard tell of, and probably he will be longer in public life than the Deputy.  I should also like to point out that the title he holds is not a British or Imperialist title, but is one given him by the Pope&mdash;a religious title, of which he is proud, and so are we all.  It comes badly from a man like Deputy Fogarty, who sprang into public life only recently, to accuse this man of being this, that or the other, and I think on that subject Deputy Fogarty ought to dry up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know why Deputy Fogarty got into such a heat.  If you touch &ldquo;bookies,&rdquo; they rear up.  I am one of those who are very glad to see a tightening up in regard to many of our bookmakers.  There is scarcely a race meeting at which one does not see some of these gentlemen clearing away when things are bad, with a crowd <Col N="1164" /> after them who would lynch them if they caught them, and I am glad to see that type of man put out of business.  They are a nuisance to everybody.  If they are not able to stand on their own feet, they should drop out.  It is no harm to tighten up in regard to them.  They are the wealthy section of the people.  You will see them one day with a bicycle: next day with a Ford car; and, in a few years, with a Rolls-Royce.  They make huge money and are the real monopolists of the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fogarty said that many of the lords and other gentlemen he mentioned were millionaires, but he should look to his own class.  They are the people who have the money. If we drive away these moneyed people the Deputy referred to, what will happen?  Is it not on the moneyed classes that our horse-breeding industry depends?  The small breeder is dependent on the moneyed man to buy his horses and to give him a price, and, without them, we will get very little out of racing.  It is the man with the money who can make the industry go ahead, and the small breeder and the moneyed man must work hand-in-hand, because the small man cannot exist if the other man is not there to buy from him.</P>
    <P>I believe this is a good and necessary Bill and one which will have the approval of the majority of the people. We know that at all times people will be found who will oppose everything and who will shout when their corns are trodden on.  The Bill treads on some corns, but it is no harm to tread on corns sometimes.  I think it should get the approval of everybody.  It cannot do any harm to anybody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I may claim that the Bill has had, on the whole, a happy reception.  Even those who have criticised it most from particular points of view have found some good things in it, but the big majority of the fair number of Deputies who addressed themselves to it have welcomed it.  It has been welcomed without regard to Party.  No Party lines or divisions of the kind were <Col N="1165" /> obvious in the discussion.  That is very gratifying.</P>
      <P>The intention of the Bill is to make racing more prosperous, if possible, than it is.  The intention also is to try to ensure that in future racing will not have to go through the hardships and difficulties which it experienced for quite a long number of years in the last couple of decades.  There is an old proverb in Irish: Ní hé lá na gaoithe lá na scolb.  Deputies are familiar with that, I am sure.  It may roughly be translated as &ldquo;The windy day is not the day to thatch your roof.&rdquo; We are trying to make provision now for the windy day, the bad day, which may come again, as it has before, for the racing public as for other people. It is not proposed, and some Deputies have underlined this aspect very properly, that the disciplinary control now exercised by the two old-established bodies in charge of racing in Ireland should be interfered with.  The control and disciplinary powers of the Turf Club and the National Hunt Steeplechase Committee will remain. They have had control of racing in the past, and I think that everybody who knows anything about racing&mdash;and most people know more about it than I do&mdash;will agree that they have done their work well.  They have done their work satisfactorily, and I doubt if there is anybody remotely or closely associated with racing who has any word of criticism to say of those two bodies in the work they have done to build up the position of racing in Ireland as we have known it in the past and as it is to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish racehorse and hunter, in particular, is well known, and, it would not be an exaggeration to say, is famous the world over.  We want to try to make sure, so far as we can in anything we do here, that that excellent reputation will continue and that the trade which naturally follows that reputation will expand and grow and help the country, and, in particular, that section of the agricultural community which is concerned, the horse breeder.  That is the fundamental idea with which this Bill was brought in.  Deputy Ruttledge, who is familiar with racing and who is a <Col N="1166" /> member of a number of these bodies having control of racing, told the House briefly last night what the origin of the Bill was and I therefore need not take up the time of the House in developing it.</P>
    <P>The idea of the Bill is to make racing more prosperous and to provide additional funds for all branches of racing, including the breeding of the horses necessary to run the races.  The Bill is not intended to injure anyone associated directly or indirectly with racing.  I say, and other Deputies have said, that we want to make racing more prosperous, if possible, than it is.  If racing is prosperous, if there are big fields, big attendances and good horses, I cannot see how anybody can claim that the position of the &ldquo;bookie&rdquo; will not be improved as well as the position of the horse owner and horse breeder.  That is what we set out to do.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Redmond talked last night of the Bill being full of good intentions.  That is true.  It was with the best intentions in the world&mdash;to help racing and all associated with it&mdash; that the Bill was brought in, and as such it has been welcomed.  Deputy Hughes, speaking on behalf of his Party, as well as other Deputies sitting behind him, several members of my own Party, members of the Labour Party and of the Farmers' Party, and Independent Deputies&mdash;all have expressed in varying degrees a welcome for the Bill.  I am grateful for the expressions of welcome and goodwill that have been offered.  It is quite true, as some Deputies have said, that I am not an authority on racing.  There is not any man in the House who, perhaps, knows less about it than I do, but for a variety of reasons the introduction of this Bill fell to my lot.  I then had to make a study of the subject.  I went everywhere &mdash; to Deputies in the House, some of them colleagues in my own Party who are acquainted with racing &mdash;and my officials went everywhere to get reliable information.  Judging by the praise which the Bill has received from those who know something about the subject&mdash;evidently Deputy Hughes and a number of his colleagues and, in <Col N="1167" /> fact, the members of all Parties in the House do&mdash;they are all satisfied that the officials who advised me have made a good job of the Bill.  I am grateful to the Deputies who spoke in favour of the measure, as drafted, and of the good work done by my advisers.</P>
    <P>We had a number of interesting speeches on the Bill.  Personally, I thought that some of them were very instructive.  I regret some of the things that were said in one or two speeches that were delivered on this side of the House.  I think that some of the comments that were made about some members of the Turf Club and of the National Hunt Steeplechase Committee were unworthy, and should not have been made.  But it takes all sorts and conditions of men to make up a Dáil and to make up a Party. We are lucky to have here a House in which everybody is free to express his views.  Unfortunately, that is not so in every part of the world to-day, but we are lucky in that respect.  We are free to say here what we please.  I suggest that, in the exercise of the freedom and liberty we enjoy here, we ought to remember the effect that our words may have and should try to be charitable and Christian in our comments on our fellow-men.  Some of the men referred to by some Deputies on my side of the House have given excellent service to this country and to the racing community in particular. As Minister for Finance, I have particular knowledge of the good work done by some of those men.  In 1930, when the Totalisator Board was set up, the gentlemen who were appointed members of it received no remuneration for their work.  They were not even paid their travelling expenses. The board consisted of Judge Wylie, the Duc de Stacpoole, Sir James Nelson, Captain Gargan, Captain Dunne, Mr. Blake, Mr. W.J. Mitchell, Mr. P. Dunne Cullinan and Mr. P.J. Murphy.  Some of those gentlemen were criticised here in the last day or two.  I want to say that they gave excellent public service without fee or reward, and that this House and the country, and more particularly the racing community, should be most grateful to them for the work <Col N="1168" /> they did.  I am most grateful to them and I have already expressed my thanks, in private and in public, to them for their excellent work.  My answer to the criticisms offered here is that we have every reason to be grateful to them for the excellent public services they rendered.</P>
    <P>The Turf Club was founded in 1791, well over a century and a half ago, and the National Hunt Steeplechase Committee was founded in 1870.  Both bodies, therefore, have had a long life and a long experience of racing. Racing men, whether they be owners, breeders or merely spectators at race meetings know of the good work done by these two bodies.  It is only right, therefore, that when a new organisation to control racing is being set up that the knowledge which these two racing bodies have acquired in their long existence, with all their varied experience of racing, should be fully availed of by the Dáil and the Government. Neither of these two racing bodies has had any statutory authority up to now.  Under this Bill they will be given a certain amount of statutory authority if the House, as I think it will, passes this Bill.  As Deputy Ruttledge said last night, the committee which sat a few years ago to investigate the position of racing in the country was set up by these two bodies.  The Government did not set it up.  Representatives of the various interests concerned gave evidence before that committee and largely as a result of its recommendations this Bill has been introduced.</P>
    <P>The interests of small owners have been stressed by a number of Deputies.  I am most anxious that they should be well looked after, and anything that I or my office can do to that end will be done.  The number of members on the board will be 11. Various interests will have to be represented so that it will not be possible to give a numerous representation to any one class.  We shall try to secure as best we can that all the interests that would like to be represented on the board will get representation.  There will certainly be no question of class, politics or anything of that kind introduced. The racing interest will be <Col N="1169" /> represented in all its aspects, as far as the numbers on the board will permit, because that is what we are seeking to preserve and protect here.</P>
    <P>It is true that considerable powers will be given to the board.  First of all, it will have a considerably enlarged fund to draw from.  If racing improves as we hope it will, through the levy and through the Tote, we hope to have about £150,000 and, if things improve, a greater sum of money available for the interests of racing and horse-breeding. It is set out in the Bill how we hope the Racing Board will use these moneys.  The racing board may make regulations of a variety of kinds for the management and control of executives. That gives them great power. They can acquire racecourses and acquire ground for making new racecourses. That board will be a body, I hope, of experts and they will not be out to injure any present executive of a racecourse or any racecourse or to do anything to hurt any existing body. Their job and their responsibility will be to improve every racecourse as far as they can, by grants or by advice or by influence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave in the course of his excellent analysis of this Bill&mdash;he delivered quite objectively a speech on which I should like, with respect, heartily to congratulate him&mdash;emphasised the necessity for improving amenities.  I have been told that amenities in some places certainly are very badly in need of improvement.  It may not be the fault of executives that they have not improved their racecourses in the past.  I have been told of some where it is alleged that they have made big profits and pocketed them.  I do not think that has happened in many cases.  It may have happened in some cases but the Racing Board that we hope will be set up when the Oireachtas passes this Bill will see to it that the public, at any rate, so far as amenities are concerned, will get better value for their money in future than in some cases they have got in the past.  Deputy Cosgrave spoke in detail about the waiting rooms where the stable-lads and jockeys are accommodated at those racecourses, and I hope the Racing Board will see to it that the conditions <Col N="1170" /> Deputy Cosgrave described will soon be put an end to.</P>
    <P>If, as we hope, as a result of the adoption of this Bill, racing is made more prosperous, everybody should benefit.  I hope the public will benefit by having reduced fees, but I do not think the Racing Board should be in a hurry to reduce fees.  I offer that suggestion as one who is not a racegoer. I think it would be wise for them first of all to go slow in regard to the reduction of fees until they get sufficient money so that, if they cannot induce racing executives to improve the amenities, they can go in themselves and improve the amenities with the extra money they will have at their disposal as a result of the improvement in racing and the additional fees that they will get from the increased numbers attending courses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe referred to a number of things.  In dealing with the question of bookmakers in general and the levy in particular, he said the big bets would be made off the course.  As I said earlier, I do not know much about this business of bookmaking, but I understand that it is not possible, at present at any rate, by telephone or telegram, to send bets outside the country.  If the bets are made in the bookmakers' offices in Ireland at present, at any rate in the Twenty-Six Counties, they will pay a bigger levy. They will pay 7½ per cent. in the betting offices&mdash;a bigger levy than they would pay on the course, so that I do not think that would be an attractive way out for them.</P>
    <P>On the question of bookmakers in general, which was dealt with by so many Deputies, again I want to emphasise that we have no animus against the bookmaker and I hope the Racing Board will not have any animus against the bookmaker.  My own personal and official view is that the Racing Board should not have any animus against the bookmaker, that the bookmaker should get a square deal from the board.  That would be my ambition.  I do know that it is true that a number of these bookmakers are men who have served Ireland well.  That is true, as has been emphasised by a number of Deputies. Some of them soldiered in the fight for <Col N="1171" /> freedom with members on all sides of this House but, whether they did or not, or whether or not they soldiered in any other Army, as good citizens who are earning, or trying to earn, an honest living, we do not want them interfered with or hampered and we have no intention of exterminating them. As I said to Deputy Byrne when he asked did we expect that the intention would be to put the small bookmaker out of business, I want to emphasise that that is not our intention and I hope it will not be the intention of the Racing Board to put any bookmaker out of business or to hurt him in any way, on the course or off it. But, I repeat, that it is our desire and intention, and I hope it will be the work of the Racing Board to see to it, that the levy will be collected and will be passed on by the bookie to those who make the bets.  That is our intention and we are giving power, some say, perhaps, too much power, to the Racing Board to see to it that those bookmakers on whom the levy will be placed will pass on the levy.  We want them to pass on the levy to the public and it would be my intention&mdash;and I should like to see the Racing Board operate it&mdash;that they would take any steps that are necessary to see to it that the levy is passed on and that those bookmakers who do not loyally obey that rule of passing on the levy should not be permitted to stand on a course.  That would be my view of the matter.  I hope the Racing Board will operate it in that way.  It is not the intention that the bookmaker should personally bear the tax.  The intention is that he should pass it on.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCann said this morning that he did not see why the punter should be asked to subscribe this 5 per cent. to help to improve racing or to improve horse breeding.  He instanced the case of the industrialist who went to the industrial board and got a loan. What does the industrialist do if he does get a loan to start an industry? He does not pay that himself.  He does not repay the capital.  He passes it on to the consumer&mdash;he probably passes on a good deal more than the amount he has to pay to repay the <Col N="1172" /> loan; in all probability he has a bit left for himself.  We are asking only, with regard to this levy, that it will be passed on to the racegoer, that is the consumer in this particular instance, and I do not think, from anything I have heard, that any racegoer will object, if he wants to bet, to having 5 per cent. taken off.  Anything I have heard does not lead me to believe that there is any great unpopularity attached to that suggestion in the Bill.</P>
    <P>If the bookmaker, as well as the ordinary public connected with race-going, have grievances, I hope the Racing Board will consider carefully, effectively and sympathetically, any grievances that may be brought to their notice.  That will be part of their responsibility.  I, certainly, as Minister responsible for the introduction of the Bill, would much prefer not to be brought in in any way as an arbitrator or appeal board in any matter connected with racing.  Personally, I should not like it and I do not think any other Minister for Finance would care to be brought in in that way and I should prefer that the staff in the Department of Finance would not be brought in in that way in any matter connected with racing.  Certainly, if I got any complaints and if any just grievances were exposed to me by racegoers, bookies, jockeys or anyone else, I would pass them on, as I frequently do and as Deputies do in the ordinary course of their responsibilities as public men, one might say every day in the week.  I would, as Minister, call the attention of the Racing Board to any such grievances, if I thought they were worthy of consideration, and I am certain that the Racing Board, in their desire to help the racing community, the public who go to race meetings, and all connected with racing, will listen carefully and sympathetically to the bookies as well as to the executives, the jockeys and others, if they have real grievances that they wish to bring to their notice. I hope they would at any rate and I feel certain that they will treat the bookies with the same attention and the same courtesy as they would any other branch of the race-going community.</P>
    <P>The bookies will have, I hope, a representative <Col N="1173" /> on the board and, so far as I can, I will try to get a man who is competent to express the views of the bookmakers.  Certainly, with a representative to voice their views and their grievances, if they have any, to the Racing Board&mdash;and even if they had not&mdash;I cannot see that the bookmaking fraternity are likely to suffer any injury or to have their position as we know it to-day to the smallest degree worsened.</P>
    <P>The levy may be an inconvenience&mdash; I do not think we can use any stronger word, but Deputies have stressed, and I should like to underline it, that all the money that will come from the Tote and the levy will be put into the pool to improve racing, and, if it improves racing in general, it should improve the position of the bookmaker rather than disimprove it. At any rate, we have secured, as was our intention, that the interests of the bookmaker will be protected.  If some of the suggestions made by some persons connected with this racing commission, and even by one bookmaker, were listened to, the bookmakers would go out of existence.  As Deputy Ruttledge told us last night, one very well-known and responsible bookmaker recommended that no licences should be issued to new bookmakers.  That was a very selfish recommendation to make and, if it were adopted, not alone would he go out of business but all the bookmakers would be finished.  That is not our intention. As I say, when this Bill goes through we will have secured a certain right for them, a recognition which they have not got up to the present.</P>
    <P>With the exception of the blemish which I referred to earlier, Deputy Fogarty, I think, made a good speech from his point of view.  He referred to certain comments on this Bill in the Press, but the only paper he quoted was one that would not carry very much weight in this country.  I have not seen many comments on this Bill in our own papers&mdash;not as many as I should like to have seen.  Like Deputy Fogarty and other Deputies, in all matters coming before the Dáil, I would like to know the reactions of the public.  But the Press did not give <Col N="1174" /> us a great deal of assistance in finding out the views of the public.  I did, however, read one editorial comment and that was in the <i>Irish Times</i> a couple of days ago.  That dealt with the Bill at considerable length and praised it, I am glad to notice.  In winding up its editorial the <i>Irish Times</i> said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The threat of a Totalisator monopoly and of their own extinction&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that is, the bookmakers&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;has been removed.  They will profit more than any other sections of the racing community if the sport can be maintained at a prosperous level when peace-time conditions return.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Fogarty, I think, would have been better advised to pay attention to Irish commentators in the Press rather than go to the sources to which he did for information as to what was thought of this Bill in Ireland from the point of view of encouraging and promoting the interests of racing in this country.</P>
    <P>There is just one other matter to which I should like to refer with regard to the board.  There is a variety of things that, perhaps, I should comment upon, but probably I shall have to leave some of them over to a later stage.  However, I do want the House to realise and the country to know that our desire is that this board should be absolutely free of Government interference: that the board should take its responsibilities to itself and do its own duty, and that the Government should not in any way try to regulate, control or interfere with this business of racing in Ireland.  I think that the board would fail in its work if it were to be subjected to interference by the Government. I believe that the less interference we have by the Government in a matter of this kind, the better.  That is probably true in the case of a variety of other matters, but it is particularly true here.  The business of racing in this country has been well conducted by those two bodies, which have had disciplinary control for so long a period, and unless they, from their knowledge and experience, had thought it wise to do so, we would not have set up this board.  It is these bodies who know what is needed, and <Col N="1175" /> it is as a result of their special knowledge and experience, and on their recommendation as to what is needed in the future, that we have acted on their suggestion that this board should be set up.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have been worried about the position of the small owners and have suggested that if the large, wealthy owners who are now in the country, whether Irish or foreign, are to continue here, there is no future for the small owner or small breeder.  In that connection, my attention was called to a report of a recent race meeting at Thurles.  This is from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Friday, 2nd March.  According to that report, there was a meeting at Thurles on the Thursday before, and the report of that meeting said:&mdash;&ldquo;Southern-trained horses won the two chief events at Thurles yesterday.&rdquo;  Then, in the description, it went on to say that small owners swept the board, although there were present horses owned, trained, and run by wealthy owners, both Irish and British&mdash;at least, so I understand.  Accordingly, I do not think a great deal can be said for that argument, although I do not say that one can draw a general conclusion from that one case.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister think that the small owner will be able to contribute his part to racing under the Bill as it now stands?  I understand that it is the view of the small <Col N="1176" /> owner, and even of the large trainer, that the small owner will be forced out by this Bill.</P>

      <P>We are anxious to see to it that the small owner, the small breeder, the people who in the past have produced horses of worldrenown will be encouraged to continue and will be supported.  That is our desire. As, I think, Deputy Heskin and other Deputies said to-day, many of the most famous horses that our country produced were bred by very small farmers or breeders&mdash;horses whose names are of world wide fame&mdash;and we want to help that type of small owner and breeder so as to enable him to continue to produce horses that will keep up the world-famous name of our horses and our horse-breeding industry.</P>

      <P>They were the backbone of the industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I think the Deputy is quite right, and that if you had not these small owners, breeding good horses, the horse-breeding industry would die out in this country.  As Deputy Cosgrave and, I think, Deputy Heskin also said, it is not always from the 200, 300 or 500 guinea sire that the greatest horses come.  Some of the greatest horses have been bred from sires, the fees for the service of which were very modest indeed.  These are the people we wish to support and help in order to enable them to continue in the business.  That would be my view, and I think that that has been one of the reasons for the success of racing and horse breeding in this country in the past.  I do not think that the Racing Board, composed of men with knowledge and experience, would be likely to do anything to hurt that tradition, and I hope that it will not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that we ought to consider very carefully how the levy is imposed.  Some are of the opinion that the levy ought to start very low and go up gradually.  That would be a matter, primarily, for the Racing Board, and we shall have to let them consider the matter, and the Minister for Finance, finally, will have to exercise <Col N="1177" /> a veto, but there is more than one point of view about that.  It has been suggested to me that it would probably be wise to begin with the 5 per cent., because it is so much easier to go down than to go up.  That matter, however, will have to await the consideration of the Racing Board, and I, certainly, would give very great weight to any recommendation on that matter that the Racing Board might make to me, because they know their people and they know the problem they have to deal with and, probably, would be best equipped to adjust the fittest amount to begin with.  There were times, in days gone by, I am told&mdash; not so very long ago&mdash;when there were many walk-overs at race meetings and, naturally, that had a very bad effect on the attendances at succeeding race meetings.  We want to do everything we can to secure that that will not happen in the future: that there will be, not alone large attendances, but large numbers of horses to compete for the improved stakes that will be offered.  I was astonished to hear, during the course of the debate in the last few days, that out of the stake won by a horse that came in first, the owner had to pay the second and third prizes also, whatever they amounted to.  I thought that whether the stake was £100, £300 or £500 the winning owner got that clear, but I find that that is not so and that, therefore, owners are under very heavy expenses. That was detailed to-day in an interesting fashion by Deputy Cosgrave and other speakers, and they pointed out the heavy expenses that are on the shoulders of owners, whether they be rich or poor, and, of course, they fall more heavily on the shoulders of the poorer men.</P>
    <P>If this industry is to continue, especially in the light of changed financial conditions, we must try to see to it that the poor man will be able to continue to enter horses at race meetings. A number of Deputies dealt with the entrance charge on bookies, and on the desirability of amending the section dealing with that matter.  I am quite open to consider it, and if Deputies wish to put down amendments I shall be happy to consider them.  If they <Col N="1178" /> think I should have a shot at an amendment I am quite prepared to do so.  It certainly was not the intention, when putting that section in the Bill, that power should be given to increase the charge on the bookies, without limit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That would meet the objections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite prepared to consider it.  The intention was that all entrance fees would probably, be reduced, and therefore we want to leave out the section in the Totalisator Act, so that prices for bookmakers might be in accordance with the new scale.  There was no intention, as was suggested by a deputation of bookmakers, that the fee might be raised by the influence of the executive as high as £30, £40 or £50.  If Deputies think it essential that it should be amended, I would be glad of their help.  I will sympathetically consider any amendment of the kind that is offered.  Another suggestion made by Deputies was that instead of putting a levy on bookmakers the entrance fees for bookies should be raised.  We were told that bookmakers paid £16,000 entrance fees to racecourses for themselves and their staffs in the course of last year.  Suppose we adopted their suggestion, we would have to get roughly £100,000. To what figure would we have to ask the Racing Board or the executive to increase fees for bookies, supposing we had to get half of that sum, £45,000 or £50,000?  Deputies can see that that suggestion is not practicable.  It was suggested that we should tax fees received in respect of sires.  That would be going against the principle enshrined in this Bill, which is to help the breeder.  The desire is not to take money off them but to give them money and to help the breeding industry. Any tax on sires would have the effect suggested, I think, by Deputy Cosgrave, and certainly by other Deputies, of driving sires out of the country, and then the very purpose of the Bill would not be achieved.  Those who offered that suggestion had not fully thought the matter out.  I have no intention of adopting a suggestion <Col N="1179" /> that I think would be hurtful rather than helpful.  There are many other things that I want to deal with, but I shall have an opportunity of doing so on the Committee Stage, when I can answer other points raised during the excellent discussion that we had on this Bill.</P>
