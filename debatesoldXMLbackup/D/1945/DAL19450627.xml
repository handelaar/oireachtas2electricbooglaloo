      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will have inquiries made by the Consul-General in New York and the Consul in Boston as to the availability of staves, hoops and ends of barrels suitable for cured mackerel with a view to their importation and the construction here of barrels so that the gluts of mackerel in the &ldquo;fall season&rdquo; can be handled to the advantage of both fisherman and merchant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had, heretofore, representations by either merchants or fishermen that the lack of barrels prevents them from disposing of cured mackerel.  I understand, however, that during the war there was a market in Great Britain for fresh mackerel and that it was unnecessary to cure the fish, but that it is anticipated that this market will disappear with the resumption of normal operations by British fishing fleets.  I am informed by the Irish Sea Fisheries Association that efforts are being made to find a market for cured mackerel but that the prospects of success are not very good.  I shall be willing to assist the association in any practical manner, but I must point out that it has not yet been found possible to allocate shipping space for the importation of barrel staves for other important industries.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Value of Superphosphate.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state whether any field experiments have been conducted by his Department regarding the economic value of superphosphate at its present price; and, if not, if he will state by what method he has satisfied himself that this commodity has an economic value to farmers at the present price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The average results of extensive field experiments conducted by the Department over a number of years and under varying conditions throughout the country showed clearly that substantially increased yields were obtained from the use of superphosphate and other phosphatic manures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very difficult to express an opinion as to the actual increase which may be expected in individual cases.  An analysis of the results obtained in a long series of field experiments conducted by the Department showed that the following average increases in yield from different crops were obtained from each 1 cwt. of superphosphate used in the dressing for the respective crops:&mdash; Potatoes, about 1/4 ton; Swedes, 24 cwt; Oats, somewhere less than 1 cwt. of grain, 1? cwt. of straw; Mangels, 9 cwts.  Taking the present price of superphosphate at <Col N="1648" /> around 12/- per cwt., the above increases would still be economic.</P>
    <P>These are merely the average of results obtained under ordinary field conditions, and I do not claim that they are scientifically accurate.  On the other hand, it would be entirely unjust to regard these increases as representative of the effects of superphosphate or phosphatic manures generally under all circumstances.  Particularly, for example, where superphosphate is applied in the form of a compound, correspondingly better results are usually obtained, and what is perhaps most important of all is that on very poor land and in the absence of sufficient farmyard manure, a dressing of 4 or 5 cwt. of superphosphate, or of a compound containing superphosphate as its main ingredient, might mean the difference between a reasonably good crop and perhaps little or no crop.  We know, for example, that very frequently a light dressing of artificials to a sickly wheat crop in early spring might make a difference of several barrels of wheat in the ultimate yield.</P>
    <P>Judging from the demand for superphosphate which, indeed, greatly exceeds the supply, it appears that notwithstanding the price of superphosphate, experienced farmers believe its use to be economic in present circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave the increased yields, but he did not give the quantity that was applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said for each cwt. per acre applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is mistaken.  His answer read: &ldquo;From each cwt.&rdquo; and then he went on to say that the yield per acre was thereby increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  The Deputy is right.  It could be understood in that way: &ldquo;from each one cwt. of superphosphate used in the dressing for the respective crops.&rdquo;  Then the yield per acre is given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he has any information <Col N="1649" /> regarding the research work carried out at the instance of the British Ministry of Fisheries into the preservation and processing of fish, particularly into the preservation by way of quick-freezing and kippering of herrings; and, if so, if he will have prepared and published for the benefit of the trade a White Paper on the methods now being put into operation in the Scottish East Coast herring centres; if he will state further if any like research work is being carried out in the matter of mackerel and pilchard in this country; and, if not, if he will have such experiments carried out without delay in respect of such fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen newspaper reports indicating that research work of the kind referred to in the question is being carried out and that methods of fish preservation and processing are about to be tried out on a commercial basis at herring centres on the east coast of Scotland.  Beyond what has appeared in the papers, I have no information as to what is being done in Great Britain and it would be premature, to say the least, for me to direct the preparation and publication of a White Paper on the subject.  No such experimental work is being carried out in this country with regard to mackerel and pilchard, and it would not be possible to do so in existing circumstances, as there is no establishment here suitably equipped for the purpose.</P>

I connected it with the remonstrances of George Bernard Shaw, desiring to prove that he could burn his property, bury his property, or bestow his property on a cats' and dogs' home, but that one thing he could not do was bestow it on a city he wished to benefit.

      <P>In the course of my remarks last evening I dealt with aspects of general industrial policy which had been referred to during the debate.  I have nothing further to add in that regard.  I wish now to deal with some of the specific matters raised by Deputies, and which require elucidation. A number of Deputies referred to matters affecting our transport position.  Deputy Hughes inquired whether Córas Iompair Éireann was receiving preferential treatment in the matter of a petrol allocation, to the detriment of private interests.  I am not quite sure what Deputy Hughes meant by that query, but I should like to explain that during the whole period of the emergency, since petrol and other commodities became scarce, it has been the policy of the Government to maintain the public transport services and to curtail the facilities available to private firms and individuals to whatever extent was required in order to keep the public services going.  I think it will be agreed that it is sound policy, in circumstances such as we are now experiencing, to maintain, at the maximum possible level, the services which are available to members of the public as a whole and not those which are available only to particular classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cogan required an assurance that, on the restoration of normal conditions here, there would be no interference with the operation of mechanically-propelled lorries by private firms or individuals.  I am rather surprised to learn that Deputy Cogan is under any doubt on that point.  We spent a great part of last year discussing transport legislation; in fact, we had a general election which <Col N="1656" /> was contested largely upon issues involved in that transport legislation. The scope of the measure that was then passed and of all previous Acts for the regulation of transport was so fully discussed last year that I am surprised to learn there is a Deputy still under any misunderstanding concerning them. The Deputy should know, what I am sure every other Deputy in the House knows, that there is no power conferred on the Government by permanent legislation to interfere with the operation of mechanically-propelled vehicles by private firms for the carriage of their own goods.  I can say that no new legislation is in contemplation in that regard.  The carriage of goods for reward is entirely a different matter. The carriage of goods by mechanically-propelled vehicles for reward has been subject to control for many years past. Since the Act of 1933, no person is entitled to engage in the carriage of goods for reward unless he has a licence under that Act.  No further amendment of that Act is considered necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keyes expressed the, to me, extraodinary opinion that far more ample rail transport facilities could be provided at the present time and he appears under the delusion that, for some ulterior reason which he did not make clear, the management of the railway companies, and Córas Iompair Éireann in particular, are deliberately restricting rail transport facilities to a point well below what is practicable in relation to available supplies.  I can assure the Deputy that nothing would delight the management of Córas Iompair Éireann or any other railway company more than to receive permission from me, as Minister for Supplies, to expand the rail transport facilities they are now providing.  It is not possible to expand these facilities.</P>
    <P>We hope to be able to permit of an additional service on each of the main lines for one further day in the week during the summer months, but even that additional facility will involve some risk in relation to the accumulation of reserve supplies of coal to meet the very heavy goods transport <Col N="1657" /> that will arise after the harvest.  If there are any limitations on rail passenger services at the moment they are limitations which the companies are required to maintain.  The management of the various companies are continually pressing for sanction to provide additional services and such sanction is withheld from them merely because, in my judgment, the position in regard to coal stocks and future coal supplies does not permit of any increased allocation of coal to the railway companies.</P>

That is a matter entirely within the jurisdiction of the company's management, and Deputies' representations in that regard should be addressed to them.  Similarly, any question of providing ticket facilities, such as the Deputy has referred to, is a matter for the company.  I should say that in present circumstances the railway company are reluctant to issue return tickets, because, in view of the limited facilities available, they cannot guarantee that accommodation will be available for passengers utilising these tickets on return journeys.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon ranted for a lengthy period yesterday on the subject of recent developments within the trade union movement.  He apparently desired to accuse me of some nefarious plot to disorganise trade unionism in Ireland.  His specific allegation was that recent developments in the trade union movement were inspired by the Government for ulterior motives.  I can say that allegation was entirely groundless.  It was a mischievous suggestion.  Deputy Dillon made it either for mischievous purposes or out of the fullness of his ignorance of the position and the history of trade unionism here.</P>
      <P>Anybody familiar with the history of Irish trade unionism is aware that the development which has recently taken place is the outcome of a process which had its origins long before the formation of this Government.  It was not an inevitable development, but one which could with some certainty have been forecast.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, I think, true to say that the somewhat anomalous position of British trade unions operating in this country received the attention of the first Government of the Irish Free State after the Treaty of 1921 became effective.  Some action was taken then, but it was not followed up. The trade union situation here is, to say the least of it, unusual.  It is the result of the fact that the achievement of national independence occurred after the development of modern trade unions in Great Britain, and by modern trade unions, I mean national unions as distinct from purely local organisation. It will, I feel sure, be agreed that if national independence had been accomplished earlier, the British trade unions would not have extended their operations to this country, no more than they extended them to Denmark <Col N="1659" /> or Belgium, or other adjacent independent States.  The Government has, needless to remark, considered that position from time to time, but it has not felt obliged to take any action in relation to it.  It will not, however, create any obstacles&mdash;it will, in fact, assist in the removal of obstacles&mdash;to the development of a movement to promote the establishment and growth of Irish unions to cater for all sections of Irish workers.</P>
      <P>As the question has been raised here, I think I should say that the Government regards the existing disunion within the trade union movement with very grave anxiety.  It is obviously desirable from every point of view that it should not continue.  It will seriously damage the effectiveness of trade unionism and will delay the advent of the day when the trade union movement can take its rightful place in the national organisation.  It renders it more difficult to arrange full and frank discussion with representative trade union organs on legislative and social problems which I have been anxious to promote.  It could conceivably give rise to a situation in industry which the Government could not ignore and compel its intervention in some form, however reluctant we might be to contemplate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government would welcome a development which would lead to a re-establishment of one central organ of Irish trade unionism, an organ with which it could consult, in the confidence that the opinions received would be fully representative, free from political bias and derived solely from consideration of the interests of workers related only to our national circumstances.  If that development should result from a voluntary withdrawal of British trade unions from activity within this State, the Government would have no reason to deplore it and every reason to welcome it.  Certainly the problems of the future, as they affect organised workers, are sufficiently serious to require that their organisations should be in a position to approach their consideration free from the distraction of an issue with which workers' organisations in other independent States have not to contend. <Col N="1660" /> Deputy Dillon referred further to the right to strike.  He commented upon the workers' right to organise and ended his observations in that regard by advocating compulsory arbitration. Personally, I have no faith in compulsory arbitration and certainly not in circumstances in which it would be imposed against the opposition of the trade unions.  For some reason which has never been clear to me, the trade union movement in this country, taking a lead, I think, from the trade union movement in Great Britain, has been opposed to compulsory arbitration.  I express surprise at that opposition, because, as I understand it, compulsory arbitration in industrial disputes is the central plank of the policy of the Labour Party in New Zealand, which is so often held up to us for our guidance.</P>
    <P>I had intended to initiate discussions between trade union and employers' organisations during the course of the present year, with a view to exploring the possiblities of agreement on the creation of some more effective machinery than at present exists for negotiation in trade disputes, whether actual or threatened disputes, and covering many kindred matters, including the general application of collective agreements, their juridical enforcement, the future of the Trade Boards Act, and so forth.  The discussions in the original form which I contemplated have been impeded by the development in the trade union movement to which I have referred, but, as I informed the Dáil yesterday, I am not without hope that it may be possible to proceed with them in another manner.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin referred to a demand which has been recently formulated on behalf of sections of workers employed in food distributing occupations for a fortnight's annual holiday with pay. The development of that demand at present is a matter which is giving the Government grave concern, and not merely because it indicates a complete misunderstanding of the problems and difficulties which Irish workers will have to face in the years immediately ahead.  I hold the personal view, which I have on occasion expressed to representative <Col N="1661" /> trade union leaders, that the improvement of labour conditions which should follow upon improved industrial technique and expanding productive capacity should take the form of longer annual holidays rather than a shorter working week.  It is clear, however, that the movement towards improved conditions for workers should follow on and not precede industrial progress, as otherwise it will operate as a check upon progress, and will defeat its own aims.</P>
    <P>I have urged that the present is not a suitable time for the enforcement of improved annual holidays by industrial action.  Trade and employment are at their lowest ebb; prices are high; and any disorganisation of essential supplies is particularly undesirable.  I have had to make it clear to various classes of employers who were affected by such demands that I would not agree to the raising of controlled prices to meet the cost of conceding it.</P>
    <P>I realise fully that the conditions in all occupations are not similar, and that a demand for conditions which might be regarded as unreasonable in one occupation would be perfectly understandable and reasonable in another.  Nevertheless, I feel that consideration for the interests of citizens generally, and particularly the avoidance of adding to the hardships which war-time conditions have caused, and caused particularly for working-class families, should urge that demands for improved conditions, especially in trades which have not been seriously affected during the emergency in regard to numbers employed, should not be pressed to the point of withdrawal of labour from occupations concerned with the maintenance of essential supplies.  In any event, I feel that a rising standard of living, whether realised in longer annual holidays or otherwise, cannot be achieved for the workers, generally, except as a consequence of rising national productivity which, as Deputies are aware, is not yet practicable, and that the effort to achieve a rising standard of living for particular sections can only succeed, in present circumstances, at the expense of worsened conditions for the workers as a whole.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1662" /> Deputy Keyes referred to the operation of Employment Period Orders, but I think he was under some misapprehension as to the scope of these Orders.  Certainly, he made some observations which suggested to me that he was not aware of the classes of workers who are excluded from the operation of these Orders.  These Employment Period Orders, which operate to deprive certain classes of workers in rural areas of the right to claim unemployment assistance during the period of maximum activity in agriculture, do not apply to married men, with one or more dependents, resident in the scheduled areas, and our experience has shown in recent years that it is only in these scheduled areas that the available supply of labour is in excess of harvest needs.  The Orders do not apply to soldiers discharged from the Defence Forces.  They do not apply to persons living in a house owned by an urban authority but outside the area of that urban authority, provided that the occupier of the house previously resided in the urban district. That special provision was made to deal with the class of persons to whom Deputy Seán McCarthy referred: workers normally resident in Cork City who were transferred outside the area during the housing activities of the Cork Corporation. Neither do these Orders apply to persons whose normal employment was in a factory and whose unemployment was due to a scarcity of materials arising out of the emergency.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keyes also inquired whether we had carried out any examination as to the effect of the Employment Period Orders on the workers concerned, and particularly in regard to the number of them who, in fact, found employment during the time these Orders were in force.  Such an investigation was carried out last year, and 14,602 workers, who were affected by these Orders last year and who applied for unemployment assistance within three weeks of the termination of the operation of the Order, were queried as to their employment experience while the Order was in force.  Fifty per cent. of these <Col N="1663" /> disallowed workers were relatives of farmers, and it must be assumed that some, if not all, of them had work&mdash; although not necessarily work for wages&mdash;upon the holdings of the farmers whose relatives they were, and where they resided.</P>

      <P>Over 65 per cent. of them received work for wages.  Of course, those figures that I am giving will necessarily cover a number of identical persons.  I have said 50 per cent. of them were, in the main, sons of farmers and it may be reasonably assumed occupied upon their fathers' holdings.  Over and above that 50 per cent., and including a high proportion of those in that class, however, 65.3 per cent. received work for wages&mdash; some for the whole period, some for a fairly long period, and some for comparatively short spells.</P>

      <P>I could not give that figure forthwith.  It must be remembered that these statistics are based on information given by the people concerned, and that the accuracy of that information could not very well be checked.  Of those employed, 32.5 per cent. were employed on farm work and 24.5 per cent. on turf work.  In that connection, Deputy Dillon, during yesterday's diatribe, most eloquently pleaded for a new regulation which would ensure that a single, unemployed man who refuses employment in the <Col N="1664" /> Construction Corps should not get unemployment assistance.  If the Deputy were familiar with our regulations, he would know that a single, unemployed man who refuses the offer of employment in the Construction Corps, and assuming that he is eligible for employment there on grounds of health and suitability with regard to age and so on, does not receive unemployment assistance.  Any man who refuses work which, in the opinion, of the officer concerned, is suitable for him from the point of view of age, health, and so on, does not receive unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>A single man, under the prescribed regulations, claiming unemployment assistance, is required to offer himself for employment in the Construction Corps unless his domestic circumstances are such as to make it unduly harsh.  Where the domestic circumstances are normal, and the enrolment of a youth in the Construction Corps would relieve the circumstances of the family, then he is so required to enrol.  If his offer to enrol is rejected on the grounds of ill-health or general unsuitability then, of course, he becomes eligible for unemployment assistance, subject to the other conditions prescribed in the legislation. The regulations in force are, I think, precisely the kind that Deputy Dillon was advocating.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There was another matter on which a number of Deputies thought it necessary to voice their views, and that is the programme and policy of the Tourist Board.  I have frequently regretted the decision to call that particular board a tourist board, and to refer to its activities as tourist development activities.  Its business is to organise the holiday facilities available, not merely for tourists in the ordinary sense of that term, but for the people of this country in particular.  As every Deputy knows, 80 to 90 per cent. of the traffic that will be available at our holiday resorts will be traffic by Irish citizens rather than by visitors from abroad.  Personally, I am not over-keen upon the idea of embarking upon any widespread publicity campaign to attract tourists from abroad until we have overhauled the facilities available here.  I think that a premature campaign of publicity would do us permanent injury.  The first task must be to ensure that there are proper facilities, and when we have these, to spend money on publicising them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cogan very rightly observed that we have a particular problem in the development of holiday resorts here because of our unstable weather, and <Col N="1666" /> urged on that account that special regard should be given to the provision of facilities for amusement and recreation indoors rather than outdoor.  I want to explain that the provision of recreational facilities at our holiday resorts is primarily the function of private enterprise.  The Tourist Board will undertake expenditure on the development of the amenities at these resorts.  It will open up building areas which, it is hoped, will be developed by private enterprise taking advantage of the amenities and facilities created by the Tourist Board.  In so far as the board considers it necessary itself to take the initiative in organising amusement centres in any areas which it has developed, it will, ordinarily, do so through subsidiary companies promoted by it for that purpose.  I should imagine that it would much prefer to deal with enterprising private individuals and firms rather than undertake the task of doing the development work itself.  The Tourist Board and its expert staff will, of course, be at all times available to those contemplating the investment of capital in the provision of holiday facilities to advise them as to the particular method of exploiting the advantages of one resort as compared with another, and on the particular type of facilities that are most likely to attract customers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell in that regard referred to the fact that we require holiday resorts of varying kinds. That is, of course, correct.  Not everybody would like to spend their holidays at resorts such as Blackpool and not everybody would prefer the quieter type of holiday that one can get at Leenane or at some of the other western fishing and shooting centres. The object of the Tourist Board is to develop every possible facility that will cater for all needs.  I agree entirely with Deputy Dockrell's observation concerning the necessity for neatness, cleanliness and tidiness at holiday resorts. I must point out to him that that is the obligation of the local authorities and not of the Tourist Board.  It is only the local authority that can make adequate provision for the neatness, cleanliness and tidiness of these resorts, the importance of <Col N="1667" /> which cannot be over-stressed.  I share very strongly the views expressed by him concerning the desirability of removing the dilapidated ruins and other eyesores which, in an old country like this, inevitably tend to clutter up the countryside unless there is an active local authority determined to remove them.  The Deputy should remember that we enacted legislation some years ago empowering local authorities to remove these eyesores at the expense of the owner, where the owner could be located, and at its expense in certain circumstances where the ownership could not be determined.  I am sorry that a number of local authorities have not been vigorously employing the powers given them under that legislation.</P>
    <P>I am aware that some have represented that the procedure involved is somewhat cumbersome.  The procedure was designed to ensure that every reasonable effort would be made to trace the owner of the property and to consult his interests as well as putting upon him the expense of cleaning up the site.  It would be undesirable, I think, to give the local authorities too drastic powers to interfere with the rights and property of private individuals without consulting them, but I feel sure that if a number of county councils or urban councils interested in this matter made representations to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, with a view to a revision of the requirements of that legislation, their representations would be favourably received. The Minister for Local Government and Public Health, I know, shares with me the desire that the powers given by that measure would be fully utilised by the local authorities in the removal of these unsightly ruins and other eyesores, and I am sure that the Tourist Board, and all those interested in the development of the holiday facilities in the country, will wish God speed to that work.</P>
    <P>I want to say that the Tourist Board has two main functions.  One is the development of the amenities of holiday resorts generally.  That involves the preparation of plans for the <Col N="1668" /> building of promenades, the opening of parks, the construction of bandstands, the location and development of sites for amusement parks, the provision of swimming facilities and all the other amenities that one would expect to find at a properly-equipped holiday resort. It has funds available for the purpose. Normally, it is required to expend these funds in a manner which will enable it to recover, at some future time, the amount so expended.  It is proceeding on that line, and, as I informed the House, it has prepared a large number of schemes for the development of different resorts, some 20 of which have received specific approval on which the board is now fully entitled to go ahead if and when the legal formalities involved in the acquisition of property are completed and the necessary material and equipment can be obtained.  It also has the obligation to improve the standard of hotel accommodation. It has been given control of the use of the word &ldquo;hotel&rdquo;, and no premises may be described as an hotel unless it has been registered as such with the Tourist Board, such registration depending upon the standard of accommodation provided.  It was contemplated, when the Act was passed, that the board would seek to raise the standard of accommodation, and that it would become increasingly strict in its requirements and ruthless in its withdrawal of the right to use the word &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; where its requirements were not met.  Deputies will appreciate that it has not been possible for it to raise the standard of the accommodation which it requires during the emergency, because it would be unreasonable to put an obligation upon hotel keepers, in circumstances in which they could not be met, of procuring new equipment and materials.</P>
    <P>However, the intention is that the standard of accommodation required to entitle premises to be described as hotels will be steadily raised until we can justly claim that no premises in this country described as an hotel falls short of the accommodation which holiday-makers and visitors may reasonably expect to find.  The board have also acquired a number of properties in <Col N="1669" /> various parts which it proposes to develop as hotels.  These are old residences situate in various demesnes or beauty spots.  They will be developed as hotels either for the purpose of leasing to parties to operate as such or sold as such, or, as I would prefer, transferred to another company to be established to operate them.  The development of the hotel business here is apparently attracting interest in a number of quarters, and various proposals have been submitted from commercial interests associated with tourist agencies in other countries, or hotel interests in other countries, for the establishment of chains of hotels here.  Development on that line is not one necessarily to be deplored, but I should not like to see all development in the hotel business taking that form.  For that reason, I think the acquisition of these buildings by the Tourist Board, rather than their sale to housebreakers, was a good step, and if properly developed they will provide a chain of hotels in which an enjoyable holiday in the most renowned beauty spots could be secured.  I do not think there are any other matters which were referred to in the course of the debate to which it is necessary to make specific reference now.  The general policy I referred to at the beginning, and with which I dealt at some length yesterday, will arise again in connection with legislative proposals in contemplation. I am not in a position yet to outline in any detail the nature of the legislative proposals which are under consideration. The general aim of the legislation has been determined.  The precise form is still open and, in respect to some aspects of the Government's intentions in that regard, it will be their desire to receive and to consider representations that trade and other organisations may express.</P>

      <P>The Minister may have noticed that two unfortunate men lost their lives recently in a boating accident at the mouth of the Liffey, whereupon a brisk correspondence has broken out in the columns of the newspapers, comprising allegations and counter-allegations against persons, and in defence of persons, who, I understand, in some measure at least, give their services voluntarily.  It may be that they accept some honorarium and thereby incur certain responsibilites but, if there is any question as to whether the death of these two unfortunate men was due to the laches of anybody or was due to unavoidable error that no care could have avoided, surely it would be desirable that some responsible officer should be appointed to inquire into this matter or that, if necessary, a small commission should be appointed to inquire into it and <Col N="1674" /> give the public a satisfactory report as to what actually happened, and how it came that two men could have their yacht upset under the eyes of hundreds of people and be lost, despite the fact that the lightship mariner alleges that he saw the yacht a very few moments after it turned turtle and that he was making strenuous efforts for a protracted period to get in contact with the life saving service provided for under this Estimate.  I do not want in the slightest degree to prejudice the case of anybody associated with that service but the Minister will recollect that, at the inquest, the oddest evidence was given.  There was talk of a radio set which was ordinarily supposed to be turned on, with a vigilant officer to listen to every message coming over it.  It was alleged that, for the convenience of some ulterior activity, the radio set was turned down so low that nobody could hear it.  That may be false or it may be true but it seems to me that a series of allegations relating to the permanent officers of the Department and voluntary and semi-voluntary helpers were being bandied about.  A situation developed on which the public should get some authoritative report which would allay their uneasiness.</P>

      <P>This matter is at present being considered.  Under the law, as it stands, there is no authority to hold an inquiry in a case such as that to which the Deputy refers.  An inquiry must be held where there is an accident involving a registered vessel.  Under the present circumstances, the only inquiry which can be held in a case of this kind is the coroner's inquiry.  However, the whole of the legislation in that regard is under consideration and the recommendations which have been made arising out of that accident and the general need for improving the law in that regard are being considered.  I cannot say when the new legislation <Col N="1675" /> will be ready, but the matter is being considered at the moment.</P>

My experience is that, unless at some stage somebody in whom we all have confidence says: &ldquo;Very well, I am going to look into the whole matter, fix responsibility and ascertain the precautions necessary to prevent a recurrence&rdquo;, rumour begets rumour, charge begets counter-charge and very often a very disagreeable ruction ensues.  At the back of this incident are two unfortunate bereaved families and we have to try to reassure ourselves and others that what happened was not due to criminal laches on the part of anybody.  If the Minister would say that he has directed an inquiry to be made in his Department into the circumstances of this whole affair and that he would insist on the inquiry being pursued until he was satisfied that every relevant fact was disinterred and every officer responsible for failure of duty was made to account for it, it would meet the situation.</P>

      <P>The general aspect of unemployment insurance has been discussed on the main Vote for the Minister, but there are one or two administrative matters that I should like to raise on this Vote.  Deputies from time to time write to the Department in connection with delay in the payment of unemployment assistance <Col N="1677" /> benefit or in connection with investigations which the Department find it necessary to undertake in individual cases.  My experience has been that it is quite a while after a decision has been arrived at in a particular case before it is communicated to the Deputy who raised the matter.  If a Deputy makes representations to the Department in a particular case and asks that the matter be investigated and if, after such investigation the Department decides that the person is entitled to benefit, is there any reason why it should take a fortnight or three weeks to inform the Deputy of the decision?  A fortnight or three weeks having elapsed since the man was actually paid benefit which was temporarily withheld from him, it does not seem to be sixteen-cylinder efficiency to write to the Deputy and say that the man was paid three weeks ago.  The Deputy writes in the first instance to the Department and gets the case investigated.  On investigation it is perhaps decided that benefit should not have been withheld and payment is resumed.  Then, a fortnight or three weeks afterwards, the Deputy who raised the matter is told that benefit was paid to the man on such and such a date.  You might as well not write to the Deputy at all as write to him three or four weeks after the case has been decided.  Is there any insuperable difficulty in telling the Deputy when a decision is arrived at that payment would be resumed forthwith instead of holding up the letter for three or four weeks after the man has been paid?</P>

      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to the cases of men who are deprived of benefit on the ground that they are not genuinely seeking work, so that he may make some inquiries as to the reasons for such decisions.  In Dublin City there are unfortunately some thousands of men who get only a casual type of work.  Men who are looking for a day's work on relief schemes may do odd jobs in the way of pulling a handcart and when these men look for unemployment insurance they get a reply saying that they are cut off from benefit under section so and so.  When one reads this section, one finds that the <Col N="1679" /> man is cut off because he is not supposed to be genuinely seeking work. I want to know what can a man do, other than go to his local representative, visit half a dozen employers or go to the labour exchange and appeal for work?  If the work is not there it is not his fault.  I know of cases where men come to my door and to the doors of other members of the corporation or to the doors of Deputies for the city, imploring a letter of reference to enable them to get work or asking when the corporation will start some scheme.  Although one does everything possible to get a man of that type work and although one may be prepared to give evidence to that effect, the man is turned down on the ground that he is not genuinely seeking work.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister is it not possible to be a little more lenient with the casual type of worker.  There is no work for him until the State or the municipality provides work and these unfortunate people should not be dealt with so harshly.  Would the Minister be good enough to make inquiries to ascertain the number of people who have been disqualified from benefit within any given period on these grounds?  The sad part of it is that when they are told by a Government Department that they are not genuinely seeking work, the relieving officer of the Dublin Union will use that letter as a means of preventing a man from getting ordinary relief for his wife and family.  There is nothing facing him then but the workhouse simply because a Government Department says that he is not genuinely seeking work.  Yet the work is not there and I and my colleagues can only tell him that relief schemes will not start for the next two or three months.  When he goes to the relieving officer he is told: &ldquo;You are not genuinely seeking work and you are going to get no relief.&rdquo;  I would ask the Minister to inquire into these cases with a view to getting some relaxation of the regulations in favour of these unfortunate people.</P>

      <P>The conditions governing the receipt of unemployment <Col N="1680" /> assistance are prescribed by law and there is no discretion reserved to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The decision as to whether a person is eligible or ineligible for any grant is made, in the first instance, by the unemployment assistance officer.  If an applicant is aggrieved by that decision he has an appeal to the Court of Referees.  The decision of the Court of Referees is final except on a matter of law.  If there is a matter of law involved, the applicant has an appeal to the umpire.  The decision of the umpire is final and binding on all parties.  The Minister is allowed no element of discretion at all in dealing with such matters.</P>

      <P>I want to make a short statement on this Vote.  It will be remembered that when the Minister was introducing the Vote for his own Office, I asked that I should be allowed to make a short statement on this Estimate when it came along.  I heard what the Minister had to say to-day about the limitation the Tourist Board put upon itself in its function to improve the standards of hotels in this country because it realises that the materials for the kind of requirements for which it may stipulate in normal times are not at present available.  I suggest to the Minister that he ought to lose no time in securing that the Tourist Board will exact from hotels at least common comfort and cleanliness. Let me recite a story.  Occasionally, when a matter of this kind comes up, I make an excursion to find out for myself what is doing, and last Sunday I sallied out to a hotel which I knew 12 years ago.  It never put up to be a luxury hotel, but it was then a good plain hotel.  I entered the hotel and found a factotum in the hall that I could not remember seeing there before, a gentleman dressed in a white coat, and he whipped the hat off me before I knew where I was.  I thought this hotel is coming up in the world if you are not allowed to carry your hat, so I drew myself up as best I could and asked him if we might have afternoon tea.  He matched my best accent and said: &ldquo;Certainly&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My hopes were rising. He ushered us into the diningroom and we sat down at a table manifestly laid for luncheon.  From that out I began to feel the staff was getting a bit out <Col N="1682" /> of its depth.  A waiter came and I said I would like to have afternoon tea.  That seemed to create confusion. He withdrew.  He came back and asked me if I wanted meat with my tea.  I said: &ldquo;No, I do not want meat with my tea.  I should like afternoon tea.&rdquo;  He asked me to withdraw to the garden.  That I thought reasonable enough.  There was a number of people there who wanted a more substantial meal and I withdrew to the garden.  I am afraid I will have to shock some of the company before I finish, but there is no other way of getting things done in this country.  I withdrew to the garden with my company and shortly a very genial waiter arrived and provided tea.  The milk was thick so we poured four cups of it over the marigolds and I went in with the milk jug and asked him to milk another cow, whereupon the waiter drank some milk out of the jug, smacked his lips, and said it was very sour and that he would certainly replace it.  He was a very genial, pleasant man and he replaced the milk.  I returned to the tea table and then we found there was no tea in the pot, so I went in with the teapot and a very genial, agreeable man said: &ldquo;Right enough, not a drop, sir.  We will make you a nice fresh pot&rdquo;, and, right enough, shortly, out he came with the fresh tea.  We must all remember, the weather was pretty warm.  I selected a pleasant-looking eclair, having pressed another of them on a lady in the company.  She ate hers valiantly.  I disposed of the greater part of mine amongst the marigolds, because it was sour also. We all tried to pretend we had our tea and I then went in to get my hat, which I found after some considerable search, because the man in the white coat had disappeared and nobody else knew where it was.  I got my hat and I then went to the washroom&mdash;a very elaborate establishment, very handsome, but pervaded by a smell that would lift the hat off your head.  The establishment buried in O'Connell Street was sanitary in comparison with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am familiar with the ways of this country and I appreciated at their full <Col N="1683" /> value the geniality of those over-pressed waiters and waitresses, because they were very busy.  People were coming in, as I was there, to the diningroom looking for evening meals. There never was the slightest evidence of impatience or discourtesy.  On the contrary, they were anxious to repair what had gone wrong.  I appreciated that, because we understood one another.  They were very possibly neighbours' sons, and I appreciated their kindness in trying to put right what went wrong.  That part of the story does not, to my mind, matter so much, the queer flabby inefficiency of producing empty teapots and sour milk and fly-blown cakes, but the dirt does matter when you go into a washroom in a hotel that holds itself out as being one of the very best in a very popular seaside resort.  Imagine the impression that would be created upon our minds if, in a seaside resort in Great Britain or somewhere else, we went into a washroom and found it smelling like the very devil.  Would not your first reaction be: &ldquo;Let us get out of this place because, if this is the way the lavatory is kept, what must the rest of the place be like?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think the Irish Tourist Board would be much better employed making remonstrance to that hotel keeper, bringing him in by the hand and saying, &ldquo;Look.  Terrazzo is no good if you will not wash it; shining chromium-plated plumbing is no good if you will not wash it; and if you are too grand to wash the lavatory, then get out of the hotel business.&rdquo;  I am afraid a great many hotel keepers in this country may feel that once you put in the terrazzo and the chromium you can turn the key in the door and leave the customers to wade into the lavatory because it is beneath everybody's dignity to go in with a mop every half hour and clean the place up and disinfect it decently.  I think it is that kind of thing that is going to do a lot of damage.  To my mind, nothing is more revolting than to go into a place, all leather and prunella, but which manifestly is being run by people who have not the faintest notion of what elementary standards of comfort are.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1684" /> As against that, we all know that you can go into a thatched house in certain parts of rural Ireland which to the unsophisticated may look primitive but which you find is an hotel, the fittings of which are simple but which is a paragon of perfection for any hotel in the world.  It is not that anybody or any Deputy is seeking to stipulate for elaborate equipment or anything else. All any reasonable person can ask for in this country is that amenities typical of a decent home in this country will be made available for visitors who come to stay with us.  A decent home in this country is clean.  Very often its fittings and equipment are antiquated; very often they are somewhat inadequate; but in a decent home they are clean and if a visitor to this country finds the sanitary accommodation clean, the rooms clean, the bedclothes clean, the table furnishing clean and the food healthy, we will have very few complaints from tourists.  You can open parks and build ball alleys, erect bandstands and fountains, and if the visitors who come here go in and find a tea cloth dirty and food sour, the table cutlery, be it silver plate or pewter, greasy and manifestly unwashed, and the lavatories smelly, they will go home and say: &ldquo;God forbid that we should ever find ourselves in those quarters again.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have given one trifling experience. I can give the Minister the name of the hotel privately, later on.  I would not recite that story if I thought it was a unique case or if I thought I was expecting too much of the particular hotel to which I went.  I want to make it clear that it does not hold itself out to be a luxury hotel and I do not think it charges luxury prices. It is a very popular resort and I suppose the more exalted elements of our community would call it a tripperish hotel but, whatever kind of hotel it is, it should be clean and neat and decent.  I think the board must be falling down on their job if, with all the inspectors they have appointed, and they had a good many&mdash;I do not know how many they have now&mdash;that hotel could get away with the inadequate service it was tendering in a district to which, I do not doubt, <Col N="1685" /> already a considerable number of foreign visitors have found their way.</P>
    <P>A word in season helps more than a word spoken too late.  Let the Tourist Board concentrate on that aspect of the question if they are not able to provide the materials to carry out more elaborate reforms.  When I see the Irish Tourist Board delivering the goods in that very limited sphere&mdash; efficient service and cleanliness&mdash;then I will have greater confidence in committing to their care large sums of money for more ambitious schemes, but it fills me with apprehension that we should be investing this board with the very wide powers which it is intended they should exercise later on when I see that, after 18 months and with the legion of inspectors that they did at one time appoint, they cannot, within a very limited distance of this city, secure for the casual visitor a standard of cleanliness which I consider little more than primitive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only say that the Tourist Board, I think, should receive the Deputy's complaint.  I do not think it is fair to expect them to have abolished all smells during the time they have been at work upon this task. The Deputy's time calculation is inaccurate.  I think the board have not actually been engaged on this business for half the period he has mentioned, nor have they had the inspectorial staff on that work for half the period.  In fact, it is only this year that they have actively commenced the task of hotel inspection with a view to improvement. Last year, they were opening their register for the first time, and were concerned with all the problems associated with it.  This year, they are more actively engaged on the task of requiring the execution of specific improvements to safeguard the maintenance of registration by hotels. There is nothing the Deputy has said with which I disagree, and that is an unusual position for me to be in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The House is, I think, aware of the purpose of this Bill.  It is to provide members of the Defence Forces, past, present and future, with a credit in the Unemployment Insurance Fund in respect of their service with the Defence Forces since 3rd September, 1939, so that on their return to civil life they will, if unemployed, be able to obtain unemployment benefit.  The Bill will apply to all members of the Defence Forces who have had at least three months' service.  It will apply to officers, non-commissioned officers and men, the only exception being officers holding permanent commissions or short service commissions in the Air Corps, and members of the Construction Corps.  Credit in the Unemployment Insurance Fund will be given whether or not the members were insured under the Unemployment Insurance Acts before joining.  It will be given, without cost to the men, for all full time service from 3rd September, 1939, to the date of their discharge, excepting only service after the emergency as an officer of the reserve called out on full-time service or for the purpose of annual training, and service rendered under the age of 16 years.  Each member of the Defence Forces will, on discharge, be credited in the unemployment fund with a number of contributions equal to the number of weeks of full-time service in respect of which pay was issuable since September, 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of members of the forces already discharged, the credit will be given from the date on which the Bill becomes law, and, in the case of members discharged after that date, from the date of their discharge.  There is a special scheme of insurance for persons in the insurance industry, and, therefore, members of the Defence Forces who were insured under that special scheme before joining had to have special provision made for them. That provision is made in the Bill. The necessary sums to permit of the credits being opened in the insurance <Col N="1687" /> fund will be payable out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas. Any person who, when he joined the Defence Forces, had unexhausted credit in the unemployment fund will, of course, have that amount plus the benefit of the new contributions credited to him under this Bill.</P>

      <P>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1692" /> This is a Bill to wind up the Department of Supplies and to transfer the powers and functions of that Department to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I made it clear, when referring to this Bill on the Estimate for the Department of Supplies, that its introduction is not because there is any appreciable easement in the general supply position.  The present indications are that it will be necessary to continue all existing rationing schemes for some time, probably for at least another year, and possibly longer in the case of some commodities. These functions of the Department of Supplies will be functions of the Department of Industry and Commerce in the future.</P>
    <P>When the Department of Supplies was set up at the beginning of the emergency, the intention was to terminate its existence as soon as the supply conditions would permit.  Even though there has as yet been no substantial change in the general supply situation, it is believed that not merely can the Department be wound up safely, but that there will be certain advantages resulting from the amalgamation of its functions with those of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  To an extent that we had not altogether foreseen, it has now become clear that, with the cessation of hostilities in Europe and the gradual return to more normal conditions, supply problems are tending to become more and more closely related to the question of post-war development and other considerations of general policy which are properly the concern of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It is considered, moreover, that the amalgamation of the two Departments should lead to greater expedition and efficiency in these circumstances and also to economies in staff.  As it is desirable that, when two Government Departments are being amalgamated, a date should be chosen which would be convenient so as to reduce to a minimum any dislocation which may be caused, it is provided in Section 2 of the Bill that the amalgamation will not take place on the date of the passing of the Bill, but on a date to be fixed later by Order to be made by the Government. <Col N="1693" /> Sections 3 and 4 are the most important sections of the Bill.  Section 3 provides for the transfer of the functions of the Minister for Supplies and for the abolition of his office.  Section 2 of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1939, created the Minister for Supplies as a corporation sole and constituted the Department of Supplies.  The Minister for Supplies is therefore a corporate body and, having transferred all his powers, duties and functions to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Section 3 proceeds to say that his office is abolished, which is the draftsman's way of saying that the corporation which he constitutes is liquidated.</P>
    <P>Section 4 transfers to the Department of Industry and Commerce the administration and business of the public services allocated to the Department of Supplies.  That section is necessary because of the existence of Section 3 of the Ministers and Secretaries Act of 1939, which made provision for the allocation of functions to the Department of Supplies.  These functions will pass automatically to the Department of Industry and Commerce on the appointed day under Section 4 of the Bill.  Section 5 deals with the question of the Estimates for the current year.  The sum of £5,350,059 has been provided in this year for the office of the Minister for Supplies including the payment of certain subsidies and Grants-in-Aid. The principal items included are the Vote of £3,070,000 for food subsidies, £1,433,000 for fuel subsidies and Grants-in-Aid to the Turf Development Board of £640,000.  I think it is quite clear that the services covered by the Vote will have to continue for the current financial year and that the sum voted for the Department of Supplies will be fully required.  The purpose of Section 5 is to provide that these moneys can continue to be used for the purposes for which they were voted by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The remaining Sections 6 to 17 are merely enabling sections to ensure the carrying forward of the powers, duties and functions of the Minister and to the Department of Supplies.  Section <Col N="1694" /> 7 provides for the reversion to the Minister for Industry and Commerce of functions which devolve on him under various Acts and which were transferred from the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the Minister for Supplies.  Section 8 is necessary because Irish Shipping, Limited, and some of the emergency companies are required under their memorandum and articles of association to obtain the consent of the Minister for Supplies before doing certain things.</P>
    <P>The property referred to in Section 11 consists of land and buildings bought through voluntary purchase by the Minister for Supplies in connection with the Government turf camp schemes.  The principal items are the sites for the camps and buildings for housing the camp workers.  Similarly, the reference in Section 12 to land possessed on behalf of the Minister for Supplies relates to land entered into for the production of turf under Government schemes.  Section 15 has been included to ensure that proceedings commenced in the name of the Minister for Supplies for the breach of rationing or price control Orders will be continued.</P>
    <P>The Bill has one main purpose and all the other provisions follow from that&mdash; it is, as the Dáil is aware, to abolish the office of the Minister for Supplies and transfer his powers and functions to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. That change might be of greater significance if there had been separate Ministers in charge of those Departments in the past, but in practice, as the House is aware, the two Departments have worked very closely together.  Their headquarters staffs have been housed in the same building and many of the emergency functions of the Department of Supplies were, in fact, performed by the Department of Industry and Commerce, even to an extent that made it impossible for Deputies sometimes to distinguish between the duties of one Department and another.  It is clearly desirable that we should get into a situation now in which only one Department would have responsibility for all these functions, as well as the obligation of gradually <Col N="1695" /> transferring the organisation set up to handle the problems created by the emergency into an organisation designed to secure the permanent operation and discharge of the functions of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is desirable to have this amalgamation and I can fully appreciate what the Minister has stated with reference to it.  We are now at the cessation of hostilities and facing up to the problems that have to be tackled in the post-war period, which will require more close relations between these two Departments.  The Minister has said that, even during the emergency, it was difficult at times for Deputies to distinguish the fine line which divided the activities of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Supplies.</P>
      <P>Close as were the relations that existed between the two Departments, it is desirable and essential that the amalgamation should take place at this period, in view of the post-war difficulties. I do not suppose that very much economy will be effected at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be some. There are clearly certain economies which must inevitably follow, but they will not be very substantial in relation to the total cost of both Departments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Minister that, at the earliest possible moment, Departmental intervention in private affairs should be withdrawn. We all realise how essential it was, particularly when goods were in short supply, to ensure an equitable distribution of those supplies, so that poor and rich alike got a fair share of whatever goods were there.  That resulted in rationing and quotas.  It has resulted in certain hardships, particularly where people were anxious to start in business.  Young people were getting married and found it rather <Col N="1696" /> difficult to get quotas for new businesses. I have met some people who were anxiously awaiting the time when they could start definitely in business and secure the necessary supplies and I am sure that position applies all over the country.  I hope that the Departmental control over these things will be dropped at the earliest possible moment, even if the drop has to be made gradually.  I would ask the Minister to give the House an assurance that it is his intention to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The result of the setting up of the Department of Supplies and its present merger with the Department of Industry and Commerce is to extend very largely the powers and duties which the Minister exercises as Minister for Industry and Commerce and to increase greatly the cost of that Department.  At the outset of the emergency, the Minister for Industry and Commerce had very considerable powers and a very large and expensive administration.  As a result of the amalgamation of these two offices, he to-day has still larger powers and a still more expensive Department under his control.  The question of the expense will arise on various Estimates, but the powers which the Minister exercises are sufficiently extensive to be alarming to the ordinary citizen.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hughes referred to the hardships on citizens, as a result of the restrictions placed upon them.  Many of those restrictions are inevitable as a result of the emergency.  I would like to endorse what Deputy Hughes said, that, as soon as the emergency conditions have disappeared, it is to be hoped the Minister will not endeavour to hang on to the powers with which he has been restricting private enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like an assurance from the Minister that his Department will not continue to exercise the drastic judicial functions which they have exercised and which I have had occasion to criticise.  With reference to my criticism of the exercise of those functions, the Minister was inclined to treat the rights of the ordinary citizen as a joke.  A citizen who is accused of violating some ministerial <Col N="1697" /> regulation and found guilty by a Government Department, is invariably very harshly treated.  The Minister may think that it is a joke to have the claims of an ordinary citizen put before this House, but the citizen does not regard it as a joke.  I believe that if many of the cases which have been tried in the Minister's Department and dealt with were brought into the District Court they would be dealt with more impartially.</P>
    <P>I think it is a very serious thing that this House should find itself endowing the Minister with such far-reaching powers.  It is also a serious matter when we have not only a huge Department under the Minister's control, but also a large number of State companies of various kinds which have been established under the Minister's control.  Over these companies the Minister exercises a considerable amount of control, and he can exert influence upon them in regard to the manner in which they carry on their business.  Those companies are outside the jurisdiction of this House.  We cannot inquire into the manner in which they are run.  We can only put the blame on the Minister if things go wrong, and we all know that the Minister is fairly expert in side-tracking or meeting any accusations that may be levelled against him.</P>
    <P>It is a serious thing that the State should exercise such far-reaching power in relation to the running of various industries without the governing body of the State, that is, this legislative Assembly, having power to inquire into the manner in which the businesses are conducted.  There is always the danger that those State companies may be used by any Party in power for the purpose of patronage &mdash;to provide jobs for their political adherents.  There is not in this case, as there is in the Civil Service, a system of competitive examination or a system of supervision and control such as the Comptroller and Auditor-General exercises over all Government Departments.</P>
    <P>I think that is an aspect of this merger of two Departments which the House should take serious note of, because inevitably we must accept the view that the Department of Industry <Col N="1698" /> and Commerce will, in the post-war period, be a much more extensive and far-reaching Department than it was before the emergency.  I think some means should be found&mdash;it may not be possible within the scope of this Bill&mdash; so that where subsidiary companies or State created companies are established there will be some way by which this House will have a larger measure of control than it has at present.  It should be put completely outside the power of any Government in the future to run these companies in any way for Party advantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>This Department is now losing its identity and, as certain things have been said about them on the main Estimate, I think I would be wanting in my duty if I did not pay a tribute to the officers of the Department. I think I can truthfully say that in the six years since the outbreak of the second world war I, probably, of all the Deputies, have been the greatest nuisance to that Department and it would ill become me if I did not put on record my appreciation of the splendid services that have been rendered by the officials there.  The things that were said about them when the Estimate for the Department of Supplies was under consideration were of a general character.  A lot of very hard things have been said about the officials in an off-hand way.  Indeed, quite a lot was said about them during the past five or six years without a proper appreciation of the difficulties that confronted them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let Deputies imagine for a moment the manner in which some 2,000 people were collected from various Government Departments.  They had not the faintest idea of the duties they were called upon to undertake.  They might have been accustomed to files and routine civil service work, but they had absolutely no experience of the type of work they were about to undertake in the Department of Supplies.  They were brought together and put in charge of arranging supplies for the whole country. Anybody associated with ordinary business will appreciate the magnitude of the task and the type of problem that confronted this collection of amateurs.  I do not use that word in <Col N="1699" /> any offensive way.  I use it in order to pay a tribute to the fine job they carried out in subsequent years.  They made a splendid job of it.  During the past six years the number of times when I tortured officials in that Department could scarcely be counted.</P>
    <P>I do not like to pay a tribute where it is not deserved, and that would apply particularly to State servants, but these officials were maligned through the years, and I think it is only right that the excellent services they rendered to the State should be appreciated. Perhaps it is not popular for me to defend them, but I am not so lacking in moral courage as that I would not discharge the duty I owe towards a body of officials with whom I have been closely associated.  I had my battles with them with regard to meeting the requirements of my constituents.  I fought hard about many things and ultimately got them.  There were various charges made against those public servants, but I will put it on record, without fear of contradiction, that I do not know any officer of that Department who was not strictly impartial. They were the most honest and impartial men that I could ever wish to be associated with.  I tormented them day in and day out, and I fought hard with them for what I thought my constituents were entitled to.  I must say that I never asked anything for any of my constituents that I did not think they were entitled to.</P>
    <P>Nobody knows the things that were said to the officials better than I and I pay my utmost tribute to the way they discharged their duties.  It is quite easy to give out stuff when you have plenty of it, but what these men and women in the Department had to do was to retain in the country the small quantity of stuff available, so that it might be divided equitably amongst the people.  That was the task which these officers were confronted with.  I know them well.  They stuck steadfastly to the duty imposed on them by the Minister and discharged it faithfully and honestly. Considering the desperate limitations under which they had to work in regard to supplies, they did a tremendous <Col N="1700" /> job, and I should be wanting in my duty if I did not put that tribute on the records of the House, as I was perhaps one of the greatest nuisances with which the officials had to deal.</P>
    <P>My objection is not so much to the Bill itself as to Section 4, which passes over the entire functions of this Department to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I think the Minister will be the first to agree that there are a number of functions exercised by the Department of Supplies which should now, or in the immediate future, be revoked.  I need not enumerate them, but it would be a good thing if the rule were run over all these Emergency Powers Orders relating to 101 things&mdash;some relating to minor matters, but others of a very restrictive character.  I am not disposed to give the Minister his Bill without further information.  He has made an <i>ex parte</i> statement that he expects rationing to continue for another 12 months.  If this Bill becomes law, it passes the legal powers of the Department of Supplies on to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and I think that some more care should have been taken to review all these Orders, with a view to dropping those which are obsolete or semi-obsolete, of which there are quite a number.</P>
    <P>I am very loath to give the Minister the full transfer of all the functions now exercised by the Department of Supplies without an undertaking that these matters will be reviewed.  I expect the purpose was one of economy, but that is not quite good enough, when one considers the arbitrary powers which the House gave to the Minister, and which were essential during a period of strict emergency.  We have passed from much of that atmosphere now.  In my own constituency, boats are very extensively used, and each boat had to get a licence.  The Minister has power to issue, or to refuse to issue, or to revoke, a licence, and in many cases licences were properly revoked because the boats were used to carry goods out to American and British ships in Lough Foyle and to carry other goods shorewards.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1701" /> The American and British boats have now left Lough Foyle and the coast of Donegal, but these Orders still remain and the revocations of licences in respect of some of these boats are still in force.  Will these revocations be withdrawn and freedom to operate be given to their owners? Some of them are fishermen and perhaps it was a son who used the boat to take out silk stockings or butter to an American boat and who was caught, with the result that the licence was withdrawn.  The revocation of his licence is a very serious hardship for a man who has a couple of hundred pounds invested in a boat for fishing purposes.  One could not quarrel with it while the war was on and when the supply position was very serious, but these foreign vessels have now left Lough Foyle, and the Minister should make provision for revoking the Order and cancelling any revocations made.</P>
    <P>There are a number of items of that type which should be looked into and the Minister should give a definite undertaking that he will review them at the earliest opportunity.  Many of these Orders should not be retained for one hour longer than is necessary.  They are very bad for business and nothing but grave emergency can justify them. I should like the Minister, if he does not agree to review them between now and the Final Stages of the Bill, to give an undertaking that he will review these Orders and revoke them at the first opportunity which presents itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as an indication of decontrol and I sincerely hope the Minister can give the House an assurance that, at the first available opportunity, all this system of licensing control will cease.  Undoubtedly the system of quotas, rationing and licences has been a cause of irritation and annoyance to people in trade, but it has also been responsible for many difficult problems in the Department, and I want to compliment the Minister and his officials on the manner in which they did their job during the last five years. We had many criticisms to offer&mdash;perhaps because of personal annoyances or irritations&mdash;but looking back on the period now, I think they did a marvellous <Col N="1702" /> job.  They are to be complimented and should get the best thanks of the House for having risen to the occasion as they did.</P>
      <P>My personal experience of the Department officials is that, where a citizen had a reasonable problem, the problem was faced by them with consideration, courtesy and with, if you like, every kindness.  There were perhaps occasions when hard and difficult things had to be done, but that was necessary in the national interest, and I want to associate myself with Deputy McMenamin's remarks on these lines. If I have any criticism of the Bill, it is that it does not indicate any time when the functions now transferred to the Minister for Industry and Commerce will cease to be exercised by him.  It is a matter which we may consider on Committee Stage&mdash;that some limit of time ought to be placed upon that Minister's administration of these powers.</P>
      <P>The other point on which I should like to have some information is the future of the staffs of the Department of Supplies.  A number of men and women were seconded from various Departments in the Civil Service, and will go back to their normal avocations, but I wonder what proposals the Minister has for the temporary staff who may find themselves unemployed as a result of this fusion.  I should also like to have some information as to the eventual economies he hopes to effect in the staffing of the new Department. Finally, I think the Minister and his staff are to be congratulated on having achieved success in a very difficult situation.  Were it not for the measures they took, this country could not have survived during the war years, and no matter what the citizens had to suffer, the officials of that Department had to suffer also.  They had to find new ways of dealing with new problems, and I think that they rose to the occasion in a very striking manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reminded, Sir, by this discussion of a certain story that used to be told.  It relates to William IV of England, who, when he died, was succeeded by his niece, Queen Victoria. She was afterwards married to Prince Albert, who was a parsimonious man, <Col N="1703" /> and shortly afterwards he undertook the reform of the administration of Windsor Castle.  In the course of his researches, he found that there were being delivered there, every day, 6 dozen lbs. of tallow candles, and that that was the normal perquisite of the cook.  On inquiring into that matter, he found that about 62 years previously George II had a cold in his head and his medical attendant prescribed the use of one tallow candle to be rubbed to the bridge of his nose each day, but those in charge of the administration of the Castle at the time suggested that it was beneath the dignity of the King to buy one tallow candle, and so the order went forth to buy 6 dozen pounds of tallow candles a day, and, as a result, 6 dozen lbs. of candles per day were delivered to Windsor Castle for 62 years.  Now, Sir, I am afraid that we may fall into the same dilemma as Prince Albert found facing him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the last five years, the Department of Supplies has made an immensity of Orders, some of them wise and some of them foolish.  I could recapitulate a great number of the foolish ones, but I would particularly refer to the Order in connection with the repair of sacks&mdash;an Order which, as far as I am aware, is still the law. The Order provided that no sack could be repaired except in a licensed manufacturer's premises.  That meant that if a person tore a bag or sack in a shop in Ballaghaderreen, and if he were to comply strictly with the law, before he took needle and thread to make the repair in that sack or bag, he would have to empty it, consign it to the nearest licensed merchant, probably in Dublin there to be repaired, re-covered and restored, and then returned to him.  A good many Orders of that character were made from time to time under the stress and pressure of the emergency, and as a result of there not being time available for mature reflection. Is it unreasonable to ask the Minister, on the occasion of the amalgamation of those two Departments, that he should set aside some members of his staff and direct them to prepare for, say, the first of October, a complete codex of the Orders made <Col N="1704" /> by his Department, with a view to having it submitted to the Assistant Secretaries of the Department in order to see which of these Orders might now, with propriety, be repealed? Then you could have a general repeal of all Orders which are non-essential and have the publication, as on a given date, of the Orders or amending Orders that were being retained, with a suitable index to facilitate people, particularly merchants and those engaged in trade, such as manufacturers and distributors, in finding out what the law in relation to their own business happens to be.  I make that suggestion now because I appreciate that while the emergency was acute the necessity for a multiplicity of Orders existed and that that, to a certain extent, must remain for some time because circumstances might compel the Minister to alter Orders frequently, and that would make the complication just as great as ever it was before.  I foresee that in the time that lies ahead, albeit some Orders may require to be made under the Emergency Powers Act, the necessity to make so many of them and so often will tend to disappear.</P>
    <P>The second consideration is this.  Up to now, we had two Departments under the one Minister, and those of us who have had some experience of Parliamentary procedure will realise that a Minister can develop some kind of dual character, dependent upon the body of public servants with whom he is working, at a given time.  Now, the attitude of the Department of Supplies during the emergency was that the prime essential was to get necessary goods for the community.  Under the present Minister's direction, the attitude of the Department of Industry and Commerce has primarily been to protect the Irish manufacturer at almost any cost.  Now we have the two Departments coming together and, inevitably, in the transition period from acute world scarcity to comparative plenty, a wide variety of borderline cases are bound to arise, typified by the astonishing case made by Deputy Larkin here last night, which to me seemed to imply that he was in favour of dearer boots for the people so long as the boot manufacturers <Col N="1705" /> were protected : that he would not object to that, provided that the boot manufacturers, the employers, are guaranteed their pound of flesh.  To hear such a doctrine being promulgated by a Labour representative in this country amazes me.  When I think of the price of boots, I ask myself why the unfortunate working man who has to buy a pair of boots and cannot get them here at a reasonable price, should have laid upon him the burden of maintaining the boot industry and the operatives therein, is something that passes my understanding; but problems of that kind will arise.  The distributor will ask to have imported 20,000 pairs of boots to meet a demand which the Irish manufacturers are not in a position to meet at the moment. Will the Department of Supplies say, as it would ordinarily have said during the emergency.  &ldquo;Certainly, Go ahead, and more power to your elbow, and we hope you will succeed&rdquo;?  Or will the Department of Industry and Commerce say: &ldquo;If you can produce a certificate from all the boot manufacturers in Ireland that they cannot meet your requirements, then our Department will put forward your application for consideration by the Revenue Commissioners as to the possibility of a waiver of the tariff normally imposed upon this commodity&rdquo;? If that is to be the case, a conflict of interest will inevitably rise, and I should like the Minister to tell us what the attitude will be.  I suggest that he should tell us now that while scarcity obtains, his attitude to the imports will be : &ldquo;Bring in whatever you can get, and if we can have an abundance of one necessary commodity, that will serve to mitigate the asperities due to the inevitable scarcity of some other commodity, without which we cannot do, and for which there is no other source to which we can turn.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I can illustrate that fairly well. None of us can expect the Minister to get in unlimited supplies of rubber boots at the present time, because rubber is, obviously, going to be scarce until the Japanese war is over. But, on the other hand, if one could get an abundant supply of superior chrome leather heavy boots, which are <Col N="1706" /> very nearly as waterproof, and, conceivably, a corresponding supply of good leggings at prices and of a quality that would protect a working man's leg from his knee to his ankle, you would have a combination which would very materially mitigate the hardships arising from the scarcity of rubber boots.  Will the Minister say, in the event of an application being made to him for an extra quota licence and a recommendation to the Revenue Commissioners for a waiver of import duty : &ldquo;Oh, no, Deputy Larkin's boot operatives and the boot manufacturers do not want me to bring in boots, and you will have to do with whatever boots they can supply you with&rdquo;?  In that situation the working man who has to do drainage work, bog development work, and other work of that kind, will have to go around with a wet trousers flapping round his ankles because he cannot get rubber boots, and he will not be allowed to get the effective alternative that is within his reach but for the tariffs and quotas imposed by our own Government.</P>
    <P>I admit freely that price regulation was, is and will for some time continue to be a necessary part of our economic life, but I put it to the Minister, has not the time come to drop price control of a good many luxury commodities where price control is really of no vital importance, but the enforcement of which takes up a great deal of the time of his officers who should be enforcing rigid price control of the essentials?  For instance, I read in the newspapers recently that the town of Boyle was thrown into a state of pandemonium because the publicans there increased the price of the bottle of porter from sevenpence to sevenpence halfpenny.  It might be all the better for the boys in Boyle if the price of the bottle of stout went up from sevenpence to eightpence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be all the better for him, too.  The Deputy is not going to intimidate me.  For seven or eight years a case was made in this House for a reduction of the duty on whiskey. I am proud to say that I have more intimate personal friends amongst the <Col N="1707" /> publicans of Dublin than most Deputies.  They are old friends of mine and were old friends of my father.  There was not a single occasion on which that matter came before Dáil Eireann that I did not meet a delegation of them downstairs, where we had a cup of tea, etc.  I said to them that nothing would induce me to support a demand for a reduction in that duty, because I remember when I was a child seeing country lads leaping sky-high as a result of drinking too much whiskey. Now, since the duty on whiskey was increased you rarely see a drunken man.  So far as I am concerned, the higher the price whiskey is in this country the better pleased I will be. I believe it is in the best interests of the public at large.  I also want to say that if the price of stout tends to rise, if the price of intoxicating liquors tends to rise, if the price of cigarettes tends to rise and if the price of dances tends to rise&mdash;I am not a blue-stocking or a pussy-foot&mdash;but if all these things, which are good in their own way and of which I have had my share in my day, become a little more expensive, I am not going to worry about it.  If a modest brake is put on the consumptive capacity of boys and men in the matter of tobacco and alcohol, of which I consume my share regularly within the limits imposed by my income, I can see no great harm in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the whole machinery of the State is to be thrown into a state of agitated dismay because the price of porter has gone up from seven pence to eight pence a bottle, that seems to me to be a user of price regulation which was never contemplated by us when we were thinking of controlling the price of bread and the price of raiment for the people.  When I consented to price control, I wanted to be sure that a working woman who had to provide for her husband and family would not be rooked when she went out to buy tea, bread, butter, milk, cheese, sugar and clothing for her children and herself, but if his lordship went down town and found that 2/- would purchase only three bottles of stout instead of four well, I think, that he was making <Col N="1708" /> a very small contribution to the common weal by the abstention imposed on him.  Here, again, I think a little condification might be done.  The lists of articles which the Minister's officers are required to supervise might be looked over again.  I suggest that, where the Minister finds some commodity which he is bound to admit is one that people can get on without, my inclination is that he should take control off it, and that his officers might be otherwise employed, than in clamping down prices in that way. Supplies of most of those luxury commodities are now becoming sufficiently abundant to make it impossible for people to overcharge for them.  When the last ships came in from Lisbon it was most interesting to see how effective competition began to operate. Deputies will excuse me if I illustrate that for them.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable two Departments to be merged.  It does not deal with the functions of either of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a queer Bill if it merged two Departments that had no functions.  It would take more than a Bill of this House to separate a Department from its functions.  A Department without any functions would be a constitutional monstrosity, and functions without a Department would be something for which I cannot find a word.  I am suggesting that certain steps might be taken to economise staff and simplify procedure so as to make this merging of the Departments more efficient and effective for the common weal.  Competition would serve to discharge the task of price control now that more and more supplies of luxury commodities are beginning to come in. That is admirably illustrated by the fact that up to a month ago artificial silk stockings, which are clearly a luxury article, commanded almost any <Col N="1709" /> price which the distributor chose to ask for fully fashioned articles of that sort. But, on the arrival of the last three ships from Lisbon, the distributor, far from being able to get any price that he asked, you had people advertising them and urging their customers to take them away.  The result has been that an article that was marked 7/11 has come down to 6/11.  There you have effective price control in operation.  It is infinitely more effective than anything the Minister can do.  I admit that rigid price control is still required in respect of certain essential commodities which are in short supply.  The Minister's staff will have plenty to do in looking after these things instead of dissipating their activities on the price of silk stockings or the price of stout in the town of Boyle or elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Persuing the Minister's observation when winding up, I noticed a mournful note entered into his acknowledgment of some of the complimentary observations that had been made, and I must say it touched my heart when he commented that he himself had been left out of the tributes that had been paid.</P>
      <P>My earlier remarks regarding the officers of the Department followed a somewhat more restrained line than that adopted by Deputy McMenamin and Deputy Coogan to-day, and adhering to that strain I think it right to say now that but for the Minister these officers, to whom we have been paying tribute, would not have occupied the positions they did.  He chose them&mdash; only a fool tries to do all the work himself.  A really good administrator is a man who can choose executives who are competent to perform the tasks assigned to them.  Someone had to choose them, and if they had not been rightly chosen the work would not have been rightly done.  It is only right to give the devil his due he is entitled to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to transfer the functions of the Department of Supplies to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Any transfer of that character involves the transfer of the staff of the Department of Supplies.  For the same reason, by the relaxation of the Emergency Powers Order by the Department, the apparent intention is to relax the control <Col N="1710" /> imposed by that Order, and that will probably put the Minister in the position that he will shortly have to decide what staff it will be necessary to retain in the Department of Supplies, whether it continues to function on the present basis or to function in a somewhat attenuated form.  There is a considerable temporary staff employed in the Department of Supplies for a number of years.  I assume in the main that they gave satisfaction. They are familiar with the work of the Department, work which, I assume, will continue for a considerable time. I wish to ask the Minister whether he has yet given any consideration to the question of providing for the large temporary staff so employed, or portion of it, an opportunity to compete in an examination in order to secure an established appointment in a Department with the work of which they are familiar.  It would be rather a hardship, after four or five years' service in the Department, or perhaps six or seven years' service there, that, when their period of employment will terminate, they will be thrown out without being allowed to qualify for appointment to the permanent staff.</P>
      <P>It may be rather premature at this stage to ask the Minister what his intentions are in that respect.  Even now the Minister can hardly see ahead. If he is not in a position to indicate in what way his mind is moving, I ask him to keep an open mind and a sympathetic eye on the question of endeavouring to provide, at least, an opportunity for temporary officers who gave good service in the Department to secure an established position on the regular staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With other Deputies I should like to say that my experience during the past five or six years of my contact with the officials of the Department of Supplies I was impressed by their zeal, efficiency and unfailing courtesy.  I do not want to discuss now the wisdom or the lack of wisdom that may have been displayed but prefer to remember the good deeds rather than any that I might regard as bad deeds.  Apart from that I must say that my uniform experience was that when approaching the Department's officials, whether one believed them to be right or wrong in <Col N="1711" /> the judgments they expressed, they were always courteous, always understanding, and always anxious to be helpful.  I say that aside altogether from questions of high politics with which the Department was called on to deal.  Now that we are singing the swan song of the Department I want to pay that tribute to the individuals in it, and to the zeal and efficiency of those with whom I had occasion to have discussions during the past few years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure Deputies who ask for such an assurance that the powers taken under the various Emergency Powers Orders will be relinquished as soon as possible.  Immediately after the conclusion of hostilities in Europe the Government directed each Minister to bring forward for revocation by it Orders which were considered to be no longer essential to the conduct of Government business. A number of Governmental Orders made under emergency powers have been already revoked.  Similarly Ministers were directed to revoke Ministerial Orders made under powers conferred on them by that Act which were deemed to be unnecessary or capable of being dispensed with in the new conditions.  Speaking for myself as Minister for Industry and Commerce and Minister for Supplies I can say that a number of such Orders have been already revoked, and officers in various sections of the Departments have been instructed to examine all Orders in force and to bring them forward for examination, with a view to revocation of every Order which, in their opinion, could be conceivably dispensed with.  Nobody will be gladder than myself to get rid of these powers.  I think it is desirable that we should get back to conditions of normal working as quickly as possible. Deputies need not fear that there will be any inclination to hold on to these powers longer than they are required in the public interest.  I would not agree however that we should relinquish price control to any extent, until supplies are more freely available, certainly as far as goods which could be classed as essential were concerned, <Col N="1712" /> or goods the price of which affects the compilation of the cost-of-living index, whether such control is secured by specific orders or by the general standstill order, which should be maintained until the opening of supplies tends to cause prices to fall.</P>

      <P>A general Standstill Price Order was made about this time last year.  That has been modified in many respects in regard to specific commodities and in due course will disappear entirely at some stage. Personally, I think it would be undesirable to loosen the strings until economic causes tending to force prices upwards cease to be as forcible as they are and some movement in the reverse direction became apparent.  Some Deputies have apparently a misunderstanding of the powers exercised by the Minister for Supplies.  The suggestions that Section 4 of the Bill should be reconsidered, or that some limitation of time should be imposed on the exercise of the powers of the Minister for Supplies were based on a misunderstanding. The various Orders made under the Emergency Powers Act could have been made by any Minister.  The Emergency Powers Act authorised the Government or a member of the Government to do certain things.  The Minister for Supplies made these Orders as a member of the Government. These Orders could have been made by any other member of the Government and, so long as the Emergency Powers Act remains in existence in its present form, Orders of that kind can be made by the Minister for Industry <Col N="1713" /> and Commerce or any other member of the Government, in accordance with the division of functions between members of the Government.  The question, therefore, as to the extent to which it is desirable to retain the use of the powers conferred by the Emergency Powers Act, should more properly be raised on the Emergency Powers (Continuation) Bill, which will be before the Dáil next week.  No purpose would be served by limiting, in respect of time, the exercise of those powers by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The powers would be exercisable, if not by him, by some other member of the Government and, if withdrawn, should be withdrawn from the Government as a whole.</P>
      <P>Deputies have put questions concerning the future of the temporary staff in the Department of Supplies. Temporary staffs are employed in a number of Government Departments and the terms and conditions of employment of those staffs are uniform. Those terms and conditions are fixed by the Department of Finance, and any decisions affecting temporary staffs which may be taken will apply not merely to the staff of the Department of Supplies but to the temporary staffs which may be taken will apply not merely to the staff of the Department of Supplies but to the temporary staffs of other Departments.  Therefore, questions in that regard should be raised with the Minister for Finance, who is responsible for all matters relating to the control of the public service.</P>
      <P>It is precisely because, in the circumstances now developing, there will arise an inevitable conflict of interest between the obtaining of adequate supplies and the promotion or revival of industrial activity, that it is desirable to effect an amalgamation of the two Departments.  That was one of the reasons I gave in support of amalgamation when introducing the Bill.  I do not think that Deputy Dillon was then present, and he was, therefore, not aware that full advertence had been given to the inevitability of that conflict and that the case for amalgamation was based upon the fact that problems arising out of that conflict could be more satisfactorily handled in an amalgamated Department than in two different Departments acting on different principles.</P>

I want to express on behalf of the staff of the Department to various Deputies my thanks for the tributes they have paid to them.  I think that these tributes were well deserved.

Now that the Department is disappearing, I am glad that those tributes were put upon the records of the House.  It is necessary again to remind Deputies that, although the Department is disappearing, its functions are not.  In fact, most of the functions at present being discharged by the Department will continue to be discharged, and will in future be discharged by the same officials, at the same address, under the same management.</P>

I drew his attention to the question of restoring the right to trial by 12 jurymen.

      <P>I referred to that question last week. I think that Deputy Dillon is under a misapprehension as to the present position.  The jury of seven members applies in the case of the Circuit Court but, in the Central Criminal Court, there is a right to trial by 12 jurors.  The introduction of this change was due to a desire to obviate hardship to jurors who had to be called from a restricted area and who might have to stay overnight in towns where the Circuit Court sat.  There was a more or less restricted area to draw from.  That arrangement will disappear when emergency conditions no <Col N="1716" /> longer exist.  These conditions, however, have not altogether disappeared yet and transport facilities are not sufficiently available.  I have no desire to keep on the seven-man jury any longer than is necessary.</P>

    <P>The Government consider it desirable that the State should recognise acts of outstanding bravery in saving or endeavouring to save human life, and <Col N="1717" /> they propose to arrange for the grant of medals and certificates in suitable cases.  A committee will be set up to advise as to the cases in which awards should be made, and the President will be asked to make the awards.  It is proposed that the committee should consist of the Ceann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, the Lord Mayors of Dublin and Cork, the Chairman of the General Council of County Councils, the Chairman of the Red Cross Society and the Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána.  It is proposed that recognition should be granted in respect of all efforts to save human life which involve serious personal risk and which are performed in the State or at sea by members of the crews of Irish ships or by other persons giving assistance to members of the crews of Irish ships, excluding deeds performed by members of the Defence Forces on active service.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point I want to put this consideration to the Minister.  The Minister knows this very well.  It is nothing new to people who know the city well to come across the case of an ordinary working lad, going along the Quay side or the Canal side and jumping into the Liffey or into the Canal, in probably the only suit of clothes he has, to rescue an old man, an old woman or a young boy who has fallen into the water.  The poor unfortunate comes out of the water in the long run and suffers more loss than the person who actually got into the water in the first instance.  He gets home some way or other but he has only got one suit that is in a serviceable condition to clothe him, with the result that his act in jumping in to save life has probably exposed him to an expenditure which he is not able to meet out of his income if, in fact, he has any income at all.  Cases have come to light in which unfortunate unemployed men have been exposed to many of these risks.  I think it is a rather empty kind of recognition to bring a lad of that kind up to Árus an Uachtaráin to give him a medal when, in fact, the poor lad had to sit in his room waiting two or three days for his clothes to dry or waiting until he got the mud of the Canal or of the Liffey out of his boots or socks.  I suggest to the Minister that recognition should take not merely the form of a medal or a parchment certificate; that he should also equip the committee with sufficient funds so that in cases of hardship the committee will have power to make grants immediately to relieve whatever distress may arise as a result of a person being involved in a rescue operation which exposes him to personal loss which he is not able to meet out of his own resources.  The Minister suggests a rather sober, prudent and cautious committee to administer these awards.</P>

It is a prudent, sober and cautious committee and it. <Col N="1719" /> is not likely to engage in any extravagance in the matter of administering any funds which may be available, but I think it should have power to compensate for any article of clothing which might be damaged, articles of clothing belonging to persons suffering from inevitable impecuniosity from the nature of their avocations or lack of them.  I would suggest to the Minister that the committee should have power to make an <i>ex-gratia</i> payment where a person's clothes are in urgent need of repair as a result of his being concerned in a rescue.</P>

      <P>It is generally on a small Estimate of this kind that some very important points arise.  With Deputy Norton's general sentiment, every normal person will find himself in complete sympathy but then, on reflection, you begin to ask yourself if the State gives notice that everyone who pulls an old gentleman out of the canal is going to get £10 for a new suit of clothes, will not old men be falling into the canal like ninepins?  Queues will be formed there and you will see old gentlemen walking about proclaiming: &ldquo;I will fall in for a shilling&rdquo;, with rival firms starting up prepared to go in for 10½d. to accommodate somebody who is prepared to stage a rescue in exchange for fiduciary recognition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton spoke of the sobriety and prudence of the committee chosen to administer this fund. It takes a bad mind to see evil where the ordinary charitable mind would not detect it.  I think Deputy Norton would find from experience that, unhappily, in this world the best-laid plans are made to gang agley by unscrupulous chizzlers and gangsters who take advantage of them; but I agree with Deputy Norton in his solicitude for the average decent chap who does, at great personal risk, jump into the canal or the Liffey and suffers serious loss that he is not able to bear.  i have great sympathy with that person, but I think Deputy Norton will agree with me that usually in cases of that kind <Col N="1720" /> the Lord Mayor of Dublin, or some public officer who is deemed to speak for the whole people, need only mention the matter either to a restricted company or to the citizens at large to secure an ample fund wherewith to repair a minor loss of that kind.</P>
      <P>I think to associate an attempt effectively to compensate a person who has suffered loss in the service of his fellow-man with this particular form of tribute would be an error of judgment. That does not mean that I do not sympathise with Deputy Norton's view that such necessity should be kept in mind, but I think that he will agree with me that if any recipient of this award had suffered any serious loss of the kind he described, it would not take very long for the Lord Mayor of Dublin to raise amongst a limited number of people or from the citizens at large an ample fund to redress the financial loss the recipient of such an award as is envisaged here had suffered. What is this award going to be called?</P>

      <P>That is the kind of awkward thing that arises.  It is wise, if you are going to institute a decoration of this kind, to get it off on the right foot.  Bear this in mind: there are only two decorations in the gift of our Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One is the 1916 Medal and one is the 1922 Medal.  We have no protocol controlling such matters, and as we create awards of this character the protocol is taking form.  It is, therefore, necessary in these very early stages to be more rigid than it is necessary to be in a country where there is a whole mass of precedent into which projects of this kind automatically fall for the guidance of those who have to administer them. The first thing is: what will it be <Col N="1721" /> called?  The next thing is: are there going to be various decorations, or is there going to be one medal which you earn or do not earn?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>My idea was that this committee would consider that matter. We are going to look for designs for the medals.  There will be a competition for designs, and the committee will decide that, I imagine, or make recommendations as to what the name should be and what should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that in certain classes of awards you have a gold medal&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Scott Medal there are three medals&mdash;a gold, a silver and a bronze medal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But in the Gárda you have this peculiar thing associated with it, that every year the Commissioner examines all the acts of gallantry that have taken place; he picks out the first three acts of gallantry, and the most striking instance of devotion to duty gets the gold medal.  That is no reflection on the intrinsic gallantry of the man who gets the silver medal.  It just means that in that particular year some unprecedented incident arose which resulted in the gold medal being awarded to another man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There can be more than one in the one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose an act of gallantry is submitted to this prudent and discriminating committee, and they announce that they have awarded a bronze medal, the recipient may say: &ldquo;It is a pity you did not make it leather.  You gave so-and-so a gold medal and he only jumped into the Royal Canal, whereas I jumped into the Shannon and all I get is a copper one.&rdquo;  These are things that require to be foreseen, so that our purpose will be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we make up our minds to make this a worth while award, then there is a good deal to be said for the argument that there ought not to be any gradation in it, that it ought to be for us what the George medal is in civilian life in England.  It has to be borne in mind, <Col N="1722" /> I think, that the George medal and the Victoria Cross in the sphere of military gallantry carry with them a modest pension.  It is not intended and, I think, rightly not intended, to attach any such addendum to this award, but we cannot foresee that we will be distributing buckets of them in the course of 12 months.  My reading of the thing is that a year might easily pass without any medals being awarded.  Therefore, I think there is a good deal to be said for giving it considerable intrinsic worth, and I do not think I would falter at giving a man a gold medal.  I remember my indignation when I won two gold medals and, having worn them three or four times, discovered the gold plate was coming off the back of them. If you are going to give a man a gold medal, it ought to be a gold medal, and if it is going to be the highest award in the State, to be awarded by the President, I think the story about Alexander applies that, whereas the recipient might be willing to receive a silver medal, Alexander is not content to give less than gold.  It may be all very well for the Taoiseach if the Minister has to be distributing copper and silver but, if the President of the State is going to present someone with a Presidential medal, I think it would be no harm if he gave a good one.</P>
    <P>These are the things that make life worth living.  Another question arises: Does this medal carry a ribbon?  For instance, if a soldier wins it or if a fireman wins it, and he is entitled to wear Army ribbons, does this medal carry a ribbon and, if it does, what priority does it stand in to the other awards that are made?  All those questions arise.  All those questions should be forthwith referred to the Department of External Affairs and the Department of Defence because we have got no protocol to regulate these things and we have to establish it as we go along.</P>
    <P>If a man gets an award of that kind and, in perfect good faith, believing that out of respect to the President he ought to put it on a ribbon, turns out on a ceremonial occasion wearing it, it would be a monstrous thing if, in the presence of all his fellows, perhaps on an Army parade or a 1916 Commemoration, or something of that <Col N="1723" /> kind, some prominent steward were to come up and pull the ribbon off his coat and say, &ldquo;You have no business to have that beside the military medals you are wearing.&rdquo;  He is entitled to be told, when he gets the medal, that it carries with it a ribbon which stands in priority or inferiority to the medals he already holds and should be worn in such a position on State or ceremonial occasions when he would ordinarily expose his medals. Many people think it is old-maidish to be talking about matters of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people believe that it is undignified to ask, on occasions of ceremony and so forth, &ldquo;What ought I to do?&rdquo; Everybody imagines that everybody else knows.  I very well remember on one occasion attending a reception in connection with a Parliamentary delegation that went from here, at Buckingham Palace, and I remember his late Majesty, George V, whispering hoarsely to his gentlemen-in-waiting, &ldquo;What do we do now?&rdquo; and suddenly it dawned upon me that I was not the only one at a loss in that exalted company.  The same is true of the fellow who gets the Presidential medal.  A day dawns when he says to himself, &ldquo;What do I do now?&rdquo; but, unlike His Majesty, he has nobody to instruct him.  All I want is to ensure that if a gentleman living in the Coombe gets this medal and wants to turn out on an Easter Sunday parade to be reviewed by the Taoiseach, or whoever reviews him, there will be somebody to whom he can go and say, &ldquo;What do I do now? Do I put it up or do I put it down?  I do not want to vex the President, and I do not want to get my ear chawed off by Commandant Lawlor who fought beside me 20 years ago.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last question I want to ask is this: It is important, because it is one of the things that are going to regulate the protocol in time to come. During the tenancy of the Presidency by Dr. Hyde, circumstances were such that his health interfered with his minor activities, and so it fell out that <Col N="1724" /> a great many formal acts were done by other officers of the State rather than burden him with an unnecessary amount of detailed work.  But now that President O Ceallaigh is in full vigour, we may anticipate that a great many of those details of ceremonial matter will be attended to by the President's department and household. Here is the first of them. Instead of this medal being presented by the Government or the Oireachtas its presentation is going to be made part of the Presidential duties.  Now, there was attached to the person of the President under the Constitution a body whose function was to advise the President in all cases set out in the Constitution when he had a discretion. They were very few.  In 99 per cent. of cases, the acts of the President are done on the advice of the Taoiseach, but two or three functions were reserved where he acted on his own discretion and in which he was either invited or directed to take counsel with the Council of State, and the Council was designed for him. Here is the first occasion upon which a new function, albeit detailed and ceremonial, is being prescribed for the President, or at least which he is being asked to undertake, and our purpose is to relieve him of the necessity personally to determine the merits of each case submitted.  But is the personnel of the committee drawn from his Council of State?  Not at all.  The usual practice is followed&mdash;the existence of the Council of State is not even acknowledged.  I can speak freely, because with the passing of the seal of office from Dr. Hyde to Mr. O Ceallaigh I fell like an autumn leaf in Vallombrosa and ceased to adorn the Presidential tree.  But the House will remember&mdash;Deputy Norton will remember&mdash;that in every State ceremonial up to the Mass of the Holy Ghost last Monday no acknowledgment was made of the existence of the Council of State as a separate entity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On that occasion, the Council of State for the first time was acknowledged as an entity.  All I want to know is this: Is it going to be the practice hereafter that the advisers of the President in relation to functions where he is not required by the Constitution to act on the advice of the Government are to be drawn from casually chosen bodies or is it going to be the practice to advise the President to consult his own Council of State in matters of that kind?  Mind you, in accordance with the course set at this initial stage, the general trend is going to be&mdash;all of us are aware of Civil Service procedure&mdash;that the moment an analogous problem arises some skilled public servant is going to say: &ldquo;Oh, well, we have a precedent for that in the Presidential Medal.  In that case it was the Ceann Comhairle, the Chairman of the Seanad, the Chief Justice, and so forth.&rdquo;  Are you going to set that precedent, or are you going to set the precedent that when the President is acting on his own discretion he draws his advisers from the Council of State?  Whatever you are going to do, do it with your eyes open. Do not just stumble into something and then say: &ldquo;Begob, that was a pity now.  We should have thought of that.&rdquo;  You observe that in dealing with the Presidential office a great number of points arise where consultation should be taken with the Taoiseach's Department, the Department of External Affairs and, if necessary, the Department of Defence, so that due respect will be shown to medals by the recipients of medals awarded by the President personally and, at the same time, no incongruous preference will be given to such medals over medals awarded for valour by the military authorities of the State.</P>

      <P>With regard to that last question, I am not able to answer it, anyway.  I should not think it would be a matter for the Council of State. The Council of State should be confined to functions definitely assigned to it by the Constitution.  That is what I think.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I admit that it has never entered anyone's head to ask the Council of State to make a recommendation of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>On this matter, it never occurred to us, because we looked upon the Council of State as having definite functions which are laid down in the Constitution, and we thought it the proper thing to confine them to that, as the Council of State, and not to be asking them to undertake other work which they might very well decline to do.  They might say: &ldquo;That is not the sort of work we expected to do&rdquo;.  It never occurred to us, I must confess, to ask them to make a recommendation as to who should get a medal or anything of that kind.  As to the medal itself, the committee, of course, were asked to make recommendations, and in the case of persons who risked their lives my own personal idea would be to provide one medal&mdash;a good one.  I felt the same about the Gárdaí.  When handing out a bronze medal, I certainly did not like it.  There is no doubt about it, there were some outstanding deeds of gallantry, and others may not have been quite the same, but I always thought it was hard luck on the man who got the bronze medal.  That was my personal view.  On this matter, I feel the same way, but there are other circumstances which the committee will go into.  My personal view is that there should be one medal, a gold one.  As to the ribbon, I am sure that will be decided upon.  We expect the committee to make recommendations about that.  As I said in my opening statement, we are going to have a competition for the design and I imagine the medal will have a ribbon attached.  It is unlikely that it will not be a medal with a ribbon.  As to the question of priority, it is too much for me.  Do not ask me that.  I am not an authority. That did not occur to me, I must say. It never occurred to me to come to the question of the compensation for <Col N="1727" /> people who lost their clothing.  I do not suppose there would be many cases, but I am sure that on reflection Deputy Norton will agree that there are people of the type who would take a dive in&mdash;I am not going to say it is very general&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be clear on this. I am by all means standing for the medal.  But if a fellow breaks the only set of artificial debentures he has, or breaks his glasses, it ought not to be necessary for the Lord Mayor to get him new dentures or glasses; he ought to be able to go, in an unostentatious way, and get whatever he lost fixed up for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As to that, I do not think we should associate the two things.  I think it is a sound thing not to do it.  I believe that what Deputy Dillon stated would happen.  A long time ago, a relation of mine jumped into the Liffey to save a boy and, after he came out, he found that his watch was gone.  Some one gave him a watch which we have in the house still.  You will always come across &ldquo;rowdies&rdquo;; you will find them everywhere.  The people who receive a medal are very proud of it, and even poor people do not mind if they lose something.  They are very proud of any honour conferred on them like that.  I do not know whether it is proper for me to refer to this but, where there is loss of life or health, there is an international fund, the Carnegie Hero Fund, for dealing with these cases. I do not think it is any disgrace for a person to make an application to that fund.  The object of that fund is to make such people a little better off <Col N="1728" /> than they were before the occurrence that involved loss of health or something of that kind.  If the persons die, their dependents are looked after.  If there is any deserving case of that kind, I am sure the Irish public would be very quick to come to the rescue of the person concerned.  I think there is a good case of keeping the two things separate&mdash;that the award of a medal or a certificate should not be associated with a money grant.  Even in one case, we would not like a &ldquo;chancer&rdquo; to come along and bring disgrace on the whole thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to divide the House on the Fifth Stage of this Bill. I propose to divide it for this reason. Here is a unique deposit of learning held in trust for the State by the Benchers of the King's Inns.  Their total revenue amounts to less than £500 per year, and that does not represent an <i>ex gratia</i> grant from the State. It was given by the State to take the place of a statutory advantage that they had enjoyed under the British Government for a very protracted period&mdash;the copyright grant.  I think it is niggardly and unworthy of this House that, when the Benchers of the King's Inns report to us that the volumes in the library stand urgently in need of repair in order to prevent their falling to pieces and that the Inns have no funds from which to undertake this work, the best offer we can make to the Benchers is that we will allow them to appropriate one-half of their already exiguous income annually to the business of repair, which implies the presumption that they will reduce their purchases of books hereafter by such sum as they may deem it necessary to expend for the preservation of the volumes that they already have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely, in that situation it would have been a very much more becoming gesture on the part of the State to say: &ldquo;How much would it cost to put the bindings in suitable repair&mdash; £500?&rdquo; There are some splendid old <Col N="1730" /> binders in this city.  It is one of the crafts in which Dublin excelled and certainly equalled every other centre of the craft.  Here is an opportunity of providing lucrative and useful work for a craft which finds very little occupation for its skill.  It would have been a very modest act of generosity if we had given the Benchers £500 and told them to get done all the binding they wanted and then gave them annually a grant of £100 to maintain the books which are the nation's property&mdash;they are held in trust&mdash;in good condition for the rest of time.</P>
    <P>It is a source of amazement to me that the Parliamentary Secretary has trotted in here with this most typical, dry-as-dust, unimaginative proposal which has been worked out in some obscure labyrinth in the Department of Finance.  I urge on the Parliamentary Secretary to do what I know he has not the discretion, the power, or the moral courage to do, and that is to withdraw the Bill and say that, on reflection, he will ask the House to pass a Supplementary Estimate and that in the Estimates for this Department in the years to come we may expect an addition of £75 or £100 to the annual grant to the King's Inns for the purpose of maintenance and purchase of volumes for the library of that institution.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary has made any inquiries in regard to the query put to him on the Second Stage of the Bill.  I should like to know if the Benchers were consulted before this Bill was brought in.  I agree with Deputy Dillon that the condition of the King's Inns Library and of a large number of books there is not all that it might be.  In fact, there is a considerable quantity of books awaiting binding.  Many textbooks are now unprocurable, and even those which are procurable are totally unsuited to the law in this country, as they are English textbooks and their use for students here is practically negligible.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is not able to assure the House that the Benchers have been consulted and have agreed with the proposal in this Bill, I think it would be unwise <Col N="1731" /> for us to pass it.  Unless we can get the assurance that they have been consulted and that they are satisfied it is the best provision that can be made, I must oppose the Bill.</P>

      <P>In reply to the question whether this Department consulted the Benchers regarding these proposals, I give the House an assurance that, not only have the authorities of the Law Library been consulted, but these proposals are the proposals that we were asked by those authorities to accept. We have accepted them.  It is not true to say, as Deputy Dillon said here, that these proposals consist merely of a division of the sum previously made available for the purchase of books as between binding and purchase.  I have explained to the House already that we provided a sum of £3,000 which up to now has completed the task that these authorities felt should be undertaken at once, namely, the work of binding books which were deteriorating.  They further asked that the law should be amended so as to make an equal division as between binding and purchase of the annual grant to the Library.  I say again that these proposals are the proposals of the library authorities and I cannot see why any Deputy here should take exception to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The National Stud Farm at Tully, County Kildare, was established in 1916 as a result of the presentation to &ldquo;The Nation&rdquo; (then regarded as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland) by Colonel William Hall-Walker (later created Lord Wavertree) of his bloodstock for the purposes of a National Stud.  The Government of the then United Kingdom purchased Lord Wavertree's interest in the Tully Estate (then approximately 900 acres, part freehold and part tenant right) for the sum of £47,625.  The purchase was a condition of the gift of the bloodstock to the nation.</P>
      <P>Shortly after the establishment of the Government of Saorstát Eireann a claim resting on Article 11 of the Constitution of 1922 for the possession of the Stud Farm was made to the British Government but the latter would not recognise the claim, on the grounds that the Stud was a gift to the United Kingdom and under the deed of gift could not be alienated.  In the course of discussions which took place from time to time it would appear to have been agreed that at least the land and buildings belonged to the Saorstát but no agreement could be reached as regards the movable assets, including bloodstock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter remained in abeyance until 1935 when the Government decided that the Department of Finance should prepare a claim for presentation to the British Government on the basis that the land and buildings of the Stud Farm were the property of the Saorstát and that the Saorstát had, in addition, a right to a share of the movable assets of the farm as at the 6th December, 1921, and of the net profits earned since that <Col N="1734" /> date.  In addition a claim was to be made for user in lieu of rent of the land and buildings.  Following presentation of the claim a discussion took place between representatives of the two Governments in London in November, 1935, at which it was agreed that the negotiations should be continued by correspondence.</P>
    <P>No further progress was, however, made until 1943, when it was finally agreed as follows:&mdash;(1) that the Government of the United Kingdom would, on 31st December, 1943, hand over possession of the Tully land and buildings; (2) that the Irish Government would take over at an agreed valuation as on 31st December, 1943, the farm equipment and farm livestock and dead stock (the bloodstock was transferred to England), and (3) that the Government of the United Kingdom would pay the Irish Government an agreed sum for user in lieu of rent of the Tully premises as from 6th December, 1922, to 31st December, 1943.</P>
    <P>The transfer was duly carried out and the Irish Government took over possession of the National Stud Farm on 1st January, 1944.  At the end of March, 1944, the British Government paid to the Irish Government a sum of £28,260 9s. 3d. in respect of user in lieu of rent, less a set off of £6,960 9s. 3d. in respect of the value of live and dead stock taken over at the transfer, making a net payment of £21,300.</P>
    <P>The staff at Tully, according to particulars supplied to us before the taking over on the 1st January, 1944, consisted of:&mdash;1 stud groom, 1 assistant groom, 8 stud hands, 1 farm manager, 1 assistant steward, 1 carpenter, 1 herd, 1 milkman, 14 farm hands, 1 gardener, 1 garden hand, 1 secretary (part-time), 1 clerk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I have just indicated the staff that was there according to the particulars given to us before the taking over.  Of these the employment of the following, who had reached 65 years of age, was terminated by the British authorities before the taking <Col N="1735" /> over:&mdash;One stud hand, one farm manager, two farm hands, one clerk.  One stud hand did not accept the offer of re-employment and the stud groom obtained employment elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Were those discharges made when we took them over?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the time of taking over.  The services of the secretary, part-time, and the assistant steward were subsequently terminated as these men were no longer required, and one of the stud hands died.  The remainder were taken over.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I should mention that the Government here, in respect of any farms they are running, such as agricultural colleges, pay a gratuity to the men on retirement, that is, a man working for wages gets a gratuity, and the British Government did the same with their men, with a few exceptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Your gratuity is a week's pay for each year of service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say definitely what it amounts to.  I think it varies somewhat, but perhaps what the Deputy says is right.  Of the staff mentioned, the British authorities have arranged to pay gratuities to the following: 1 assistant groom, 5 stud hands, 1 carpenter, 1 herd, 1 milkman, 11 farm hands and 1 gardener.  A gratuity is also being paid to the stud groom, who did not take employment elsewhere. The matter of gratuities to one of the farm hands and the garden hand, and to the dependents of the stud hand who died, is at present under discussion between us and the British authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>When the British authorities paid the gratuity, the staff, I take it, were still retained in the service; in other words, they paid the accumulated gratuities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  If a man had given 20 years' service, he got his gratuity for that period, and presumably will get it for the other 20 years' period when he has completed it.  We have no information as to the gratuities, if any, paid to the stud hand, farm <Col N="1736" /> manager, two farm hands and the clerk who were not taken over and the stud hand who did not accept the offer of re-employment.  I know that this is not easy to follow, but if any Deputy is interested enough to read it later, he will see that everybody is accounted for, so far as gratuities are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say when the British paid the gratuities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At a recent stage in most cases.  Since the Department came into possession of the property, the following additional appointments have been made: one farm manager, one farm foreman and one garden hand, the former garden hand being transferred to the agricultural staff.  A few casual workers have been employed as well.  The total of the present staff, not including casuals, is 26, and the weekly wage bill about £70.</P>
      <P>In the Bill, no provision has been inserted for the transfer of the existing staff to the National Stud Company. It is felt that it would be unfair to the company to compel them by statute to take over the staff.  The intention is, when the &ldquo;transfer date&rdquo; under the Bill approaches, to give the staff notice of the termination of their employment under the Department and to arrange with the company, subject, of course, to the company's consent, for the taking over on the transfer date of all the existing staff, or of such of them as the company are willing to take over.  In the memorandum of association of the company provision will be made enabling the company to draw up a scheme of pensions and retirement gratuities for their staff, and it will be open to the company to provide in that connection that allowances may be made for service at the National Stud Farm under the Department, or for service there under the British in the case of any employee taken over by the company who may not have been awarded a gratuity by the British authorities.  That completes what I have to say about the staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Stud Farm at present comprises (according to the Valuation Office figures, which are subject to revision) about 871 statute acres consisting of&mdash;a portion containing about 174 acres, <Col N="1737" /> held in fee simple, subject to payment of a Land Commission annuity of £53 18s. 6d. per annum; another portion containing about 23 statute acres held in fee simple absolute ; and portions containing about 674 statute acres held on judicial tenancy from the landlord, Colonel Richard Michael Aylmer, subject to payment to him of a rent of £813 6s. 8d. per annum.  There are 15 dwelling houses on the farm, of which the principal is Tully House.  Close to Tully House are the Japanese Gardens, which are a show-place for visitors.</P>
    <P>One part of the Stud Farm, comprising a small holding, house, out-offices and land, of 7 statute acres, is separately rated in the name of the occupier Thomas Fulham, a former employee of the stud, who pays the Department a rent of £4 10s. per annum. Formerly he rented this holding from the British Government, but without any written agreement.</P>
    <P>Since 1st January, 1944, when it was taken over from the British, the National Stud Farm has been run by the Department of Agriculture as an ordinary farm under a farm manager, pending arrangements for the later use of the farm for stud purposes.  About 150 acres are under tillage.  A good deal of useful work has been and is being done to put into repair the buildings, horse-boxes, fences, etc. which were in a dilapidated condition when the farm was taken over from the British.</P>
    <P>It was decided by the Government, at a meeting on 4th January, 1944, that the Farm will be used for the purposes of running a national stud.  It was not considered that the management of a stud would be work that could appropriately be undertaken by the Department of Agriculture, and accordingly the Government approved of a proposal for the preparation of legislation which will enable a public limited liability company to be set up to which possession of the Stud Farm at Tully will be transferred, and which will be financed by the State for the purpose of running a national stud.  It is also proposed that the company will in addition carry out special schemes for the improvement of thoroughbred horse breeding.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1738" /> The Department of Agriculture has in operation schemes for the improvement of horses required for farm and draught purposes, and also for the improvement of hunters and other light horses.  The breeding of thoroughbred horses has, heretofore, been regarded as a matter for private enterprise, and no scheme has been in operation for assisting breeders of this class of horse.  I am satisfied that there is no necessity for a State-owned stud farm so far as the Department's existing schemes for the development of horse breeding are concerned.  Although the schemes for the improvement of hunters and other light horses are based largely on the use of thoroughbred sires, it has been found more economical and satisfactory to select and purchase such animals after they have finished their racing careers, than to breed them especially for the purpose of the schemes.  Horses raised at an establishment like the National Stud would be too costly and highly-bred for ordinary use, in the sense that sires equally useful for hunter-breeding, but not belonging to the very best lines of blood, can be acquired at a much lower cost.</P>
    <P>A State stud farm could, however, be made the medium of valuable assistance and encouragement for the development of the thoroughbred-breeding industry.  The establishment of such a stud farm would ensure that the services of the best-class sires would be available to small breeders at reasonable fees and would, accordingly, be of distinct advantage to the thoroughbred-breeding industry generally. The big fees charged for the services of high-class sires, most of which are standing outside this country, render it impossible for the small breeders to mate their mares with such stallions and, as a result, numbers of good mares which, if suitably mated, would produce high-class stock, are covered by mediocre sires and their progeny are often inferior animals which entail a loss to the breeders and to the country.  Failure to produce adequate numbers of good-class colts and fillies to meet the demands of buyers would, in due time, occasion a serious depreciation in our horse export trade.  These are the <Col N="1739" /> main reasons in favour of the maintenance of the Tully property as a high-class stud farm.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that this end could be attained by leasing the property to a breeder, or syndicate of breeders, who would undertake to maintain it as a high-class stud.  This proposal is open to the objection that the stud would be run for the personal profit of the individual, or individuals, concerned, and small breeders in particular would derive little or no benefit from its operations.  It is, of course, desirable that the stud should be run for the benefit of the horse-breeding industry in general.  If the property is to be utilised for the purpose for which it was designed and equipped, namely, as a stud farm for breeding high-class thoroughbred horses, it would appear desirable to maintain it as a State-controlled stud farm.</P>
    <P>As regards the management of the stud, it may be mentioned that under the British Government it was run by a Director responsible to the Ministry of Agriculture, London.  I considered, however, that the management of the stud farm is not work appropriate to a State Department, and felt that the best results would be obtained by placing the stud under the management of a non-profit earning company, working within the framework of a general policy laid down by the Minister for Agriculture.  The policy would include the keeping of a number of high-class thoroughbred stallions for the use of small breeders in particular and at fees somewhat lower than would be charged in ordinary commercial circumstances.  A limited number of high-class brood mares would also be kept and their progeny disposed of or utilised for further breeding in the stud as may be decided from time to time.  Visiting mares would have to be kept at the stud for about six months each year.  I might mention that we can hardly hope, of course, to have the number of stallions and brood mares we would like to have for some years.  It will take a long time to get the high-class stock we would <Col N="1740" /> like to have there, but it is hoped to make a commencement before the end of this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On what scale?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on the material available.</P>
      <P>In addition to maintaining a stud at Tully, it is also proposed that the company will be authorised by Section 30 of the Bill to put into operation special schemes for the improvement of thoroughbred horse breeding and to receive subsidies from the State towards defraying the expenses of operation of such schemes, e.g.: (i) a scheme to stand stallions at centres other than Tully if essential for the convenience of breeders of thoroughbreds; (ii) a scheme for location of high-class stallions on sale at reduced prices; (iii) a scheme for the leasing of stallions to suitable breeders; (iv) a scheme to provide an advisory service for breeders in regard to the mating of their thoroughbred mares; (v) any other suitable and desirable scheme for the same general purpose. It is impossible at present to give any accurate idea as to probable extent of the company's normal annual expenditure and receipts.</P>
      <P>The general framework of the proposed Bill will be somewhat similar to that of existing Acts under which other statutory companies have been set up in recent years, e.g., the Industrial Alcohol Act, 1938, the Sugar Manufacturing Act, 1933, etc.  The Bill is a very simple one, although it may appear, at first sight, to be rather long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The salient features of the Bill are as follows:&mdash;(1) Provision for enabling the Minister for Agriculture to procure the formation and registration under the Companies Acts, 1908 to 1924, of a company to be known as the Irish National Stud Company, Limited, whose principal objects will be to take leases and/or licences of Tully Stud Farm and to carry on the business of stud farming; (2) to vest in the Minister for Agriculture the State's estate or interest in the National Stud Farm and to empower him to grant leases or licences of the Stud Farm or any part of it; (3) to make arrangements for the financing of the company, <Col N="1741" /> including the following chief provisions:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  That the company will have an authorised share capital of £250,000 divided into £1 shares, all sums paid from time to time in subscription for shares to be advanced by the Minister for Finance out of the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof; all shares issued to be held by or in trust for the Minister for Finance, to whom also will be paid all bonus or dividend on the shares.</P>
    <P>2. That the company will in addition have power, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, to borrow sums from its bankers but so that the bank borrowings outstanding at any one time shall not exceed £100,000 or the amount of the authorised share capital unissued, whichever is the less.</P>
    <P>3.  That, subject to the approval of the Minister for Agriculture after consultation with the Minister for Finance, the company may apply for capital purposes the moneys in the company's stock replacement fund.</P>
    <P>4. That, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Agriculture will have power to grant subsidies to the company, out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas, towards defraying the expenses of special schemes for the improvement of thoroughbred horse breeding.</P>
    <P>(4) To provide for the fixing by the Minister for Finance of a &ldquo;transfer date&rdquo;, on which the chattels at the National Stud Farm will become the property of the Irish National Stud Company, the company to pay for such chattels by issuing to the Minister for Finance duly paid up shares equal in nominal value to the value of the chattels as certified by that Minister; (5) To provide that the company shall annually furnish a balance sheet, profit and loss account and a report, for submission to the Oireachtas.</P>

It is intended that it will be licensed immediately, but I have already mentioned that a small piece of it was already rented and that part may not immediately be handed over to the company.</P>
      <P>It is not considered necessary to provide in the Bill for the company's right to accept donations or bequests of bloodstock from private persons, or to accept gifts, grants or loans from the board to be established under the Racing Board and Racecourses Act, 1945, but it is intended to insert a suitable provision about this matter in the memorandum of association of the company, so that the new company will be open to receive any gifts made to them.</P>

The intention is to give the company power to draw up a pensions and gratuity scheme for its employees, and it is also the intention to empower the company not only to cover their own term of occupation, but to date this back to the 1st January, 1944, because, otherwise, there would be an interval between that time and the date on which they come into office, during which there could be no scheme for gratuity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that the provision of a national stud is a very valuable provision for an important branch of our primary industry, the bloodstock industry, and I want to put on record our protest at bringing in such an important Bill as this at the end of the Parliamentary session.  I look upon this as a very important Bill, and I am afraid that it is also a controversial Bill.  For that reason, I wish to give my personal experience of this <Col N="1743" /> matter to the House.  I happen to represent the constituency where the Curragh is situated.  Now, the Bill was only circulated last week, and as a result, I got no opportunity of consulting the people who would be keenly interested in this matter of the provision of a national stud, and when we take into consideration the time that the national stud was in our hands and the time that has been occupied in the drafting of this Bill, I consider that it is not fair to the members of this House, or to the people interested in this matter, to bring in the Bill at this stage and try to rush it through the House.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether there is any particular reason for hurrying the Bill through, but I should like the Minister to adjourn it until the autumn session, so as to give us an opportunity of considering it fully.  I think that a national stud, controlled by a body of nationally-minded men, should improve the bloodstock industry here, and should enhance the name of the Irish horse abroad.  I also think that, in view of the bloodstock position in Europe at the moment, the time is now opportune for us to concentrate on horse-breeding here, and on the establishment of a national stud.  I think a national stud should aim at producing only the best class from the best class.  That would react greatly to the benefit of Irish breeders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I need not stress the conditions required for the rearing of young stock and for the production of the finest bloodstock in the world.  As a matter of fact, I have no hesitation in saying that it is quite within our capacity here to lead the world in the production of bloodstock.  Now that the time is opportune, our aim should be to lay the necessary plans to ensure that, so that we will be able to take a commanding lead in the world in the near future in the production of bloodstock. I want to stress what the Minister has said, that the backbone of the industry here is the farmer, the small farmer. He is an expert, and no country in the world has as many small breeders, with that instinctive knowledge and love of <Col N="1744" /> the horse, as we have.  It is that love and knowledge which qualify them to produce animals that command the highest prices at the Dublin and Doncaster sales.  It has been a marvellous achievement on their part.  They have made a reputation for themselves and the country in breeding animals from mares of low price that have commanded the highest prices at Doncaster. That is something that we can be proud of.  Our breeders have achieved that over and over again.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already pointed out that, at the moment, there are no special schemes to help our bloodstock breeders.  We are relying almost entirely on individual effort.  The first aim of the national stud should be the provision of high-class sires.  I agree with the Minister that they should be available to selected mares at comparatively low fees, at least half the fees that would have to be paid in the open market.  Of course, there is the question of how those mares are to be selected and of stocking up the stud with mares for breeding purposes.  In view of the high prices which our bloodstock are making at the moment, we will have to be prepared for a considerable outlay on the provision of sires. So far as the provision of brood mares is concerned, I would advise caution.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that we should not launch out on any scheme which would involve the expenditure of a considerable sum of money.  Some of the finest studs in the world have been built up from low-priced mares, and with extraordinarily good results.  The real success of any national stud can be measured on the brood-mare side.  If the production side is a paying proposition, and in my opinion it ought to be, that, I think, will be the real test as to whether the stud is a success or otherwise.  The Minister said, in respect of the schemes to which he referred, that the purpose is to help the small breeder.  I am in agreement with the suggestions that he made as to the provisions that will be necessary in that respect, and that, we all hope, are going to prove advantageous to this important branch of our main industry.</P>
    <P>The proposal in the Bill to set up a nominal company for the management <Col N="1745" /> of the stud is one that we on this side are vigorously opposed to.  The proposal, I know, is in line with the Government's policy to set up nominal companies of this sort and give them responsibility for looking after State interests.  I think that policy has been abused, and that putting it into effect rarely suited the purpose for which it was intended.  It may have been suitable for handling such problems in our economic life as the Electricity Supply Board, the sugar company and bodies of that sort, but there is no analogy between them and an undertaking of this sort.  The House should insist that this property will be vested in the Minister so that he will be responsible to the House for the administration of the national stud, particularly when we bear in mind that there is in question the selection of mares and the leasing of young fillies for racing that will eventually come back to the stud for breeding purposes. There is also the danger of patronage and preferential treatment. For these reasons the administration of the national stud should be open to discussion in this House.  Deputies should be in a position at any time to question the administration, operation and the policy pursued by the national stud.  All these are matters on which one could change his mind as a result of experience gained.  We may have ideas to-day about the running of the national stud, and in two or three years' time we may find, from experience, that it would be desirable to change the policy in operation.  If the operation of this measure is handed over to a nominal company it will mean that criticism by Deputies will be stifled.  People keenly interested in the national stud will, in that situation, have no medium by which they can express their views, either by way of criticism or suggestion, except perhaps by writing a letter to a member of the board.</P>
    <P>The proposal in this Bill is, I think, the worst example we have had of the policy of the Government in handing over State undertakings to the control of a nominal company.  The principle involved has been vigorously condemned by two commissions set up by the Government, the latest being the <Col N="1746" /> Vocational Education Commission. Bearing in mind the condemnation of that principle contained in the report of that commission, as applied to various State activities, we have here an outstanding example where the House should insist that it should not be applied in this particular case.  The proposal is to appoint four or five people and to give them a salary.  It is to be in the gift of the Minister to bestow the appointments on whomever he likes.  Once the company is set up the members of it will have no responsibility to this House to run the stud efficiently and properly in the national interest, and will be under no obligation to submit their accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor-General and the Public Accounts Committee.  I think it is time that the House called a halt to that sort of thing.  I have said that the House ought to insist that this State property should be vested in the Minister, and that his administration of it should be open for discussion and criticism, either on the Minister's Estimate or, if necessary, by way of motion.</P>
    <P>There is no earthly reason why it should be necessary to form a company at all.  Why not have a control board of three directors who would act in an honorary capacity?  I do not think the members should have any salary.  The farthest that I would go would be to pay their out-of-pocket expenses.  I feel certain that you would get any number of men in the live-stock industry of the country, with the experience and capacity necessary to run the stud well, who would be quite willing to do so and to act in an honorary capacity.</P>
    <P>Have that board of control, have a manager if you like, but reserve to this House control over any authority of the kind.  I think a national stud should prove a tremendous asset and a very great advantage to an important branch of agriculture.  The opportunity is there.  The blood stock industry, generally, in Europe is at a particularly low ebb at present, and we find ourselves in very favourable circumstances to exploit out position in that respect to the fullest.  But the House should not stand for this sort of proposal.  No <Col N="1747" /> matter what side Deputies sit on, if this measure is put into operation, then that is the end of the right and the privilege of any Deputy to ask a question regarding policy.  No matter how anxious a Deputy to may be about a proposal of this kind, is it desirable &mdash;when we are given an opportunity to encourage a great industry, one of which all Irish people feel proud, because the name of the Irish horse is renowned throughout the world&mdash;that we should make a mess of it by having a nominal company, and handing over to three, four or five directors, the direction and selection of mares?</P>
    <P>What class of people are to benefit? Is it to be the big shots or small breeders?  The small farmers are the experts.  It was they made a name for Irish horses.  Are they to benefit? Can we trust a body set up in this way to act honestly and fairly?  I think we would not be doing our duty, or fulfilling our responsibilities as Deputies, if we accepted the proposals in this measure.  At the end of this Parliamentary Session I appeal to the Minister to withdraw the Bill.  There is no urgency about it.  If the Bill were withdrawn it could be dealt with in the Autumn when there will be time to consider it.  I represent the Curragh area in this House and within the last few days I had not an opportunity of speaking to individuals who would be interested in it.  I was particularly anxious to do so.  For that reason I do not think it is fair to the House to rush the Bill now.  I am in violent disagreement with the Minister's proposals, particularly with the rotten example of the type of company that the Government are in the habit of setting up to deal with State activities.  I emphasise that we are in strong opposition to these proposals and will oppose every section. I do not think that is desirable, if it can be avoided.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to withdraw the Bill now and give time for discussion of it before the autumn session, when the Minister will possibly have consulted people in a position to give him wise advice.  I should like him to do that.  If he insists on pushing the measure through the House now we <Col N="1748" /> feel it to be our duty to oppose it to the best of our ability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The establishment of a national stud is not only the concern of the Government Party, but the concern of every Party in this House and of the community at large, because the welfare of that stud concerns the people as a whole.  The methods to be employed in the establishment on sound lines of a national stud ought not to be the subject of keen Party controversy.  In a matter of this kind there ought to be time to discuss the proposals by all Parties, as to how best a national stud could be established. I profoundly regret the method of control which the Minister proposes to establish over the national stud.  I know nothing in this method of establishing a semi-public and semiprivate company that induces us to look upon that method as something worthy of any terrific admiration.  As Deputy Hughes rightly stated, in respect to the establishment of a national stud, this is a device which I do not think ought to have been resorted to.  What we are doing here is setting up a national stud.  The Minister has the property, he is empowered to lease it, to get £250,000 in shares, and he is presumed to put up £100,000 for the establishment of a company which will be empowered to borrow. Virtually the Minister will have no control over the company when it is established, and the House will have no control over it any more than it has effective control over any establishment in Kildare Street or O'Connell Street.  We know that the effect of setting up the company, which will have not less than three and not more than five directors, will be that the day to day contacts will be in the hands of the directors, and that once the board is set up the sole responsibility for the direction and guidance of the national stud will be in the hands of these three or five directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this country love of Irish horses and admiration for their prowess are in the blood of the people, so that there is more than ordinary interest taken in the doings of our national stud and in the welfare of our blood stock.  The Minister can feel sure that the House <Col N="1749" /> would always take a vigilant interest in the welfare of the national stud, and in the blood-stock industry generally. That, in itself, is a reason why the Minister should not throw away control to an independent board of this character, which will be empowered under the Bill to control the destinies of the national stud to be established at Tully.  I would prefer if the Minister for Agriculture had regarded himself as director-in-chief in his Ministerial capacity of the national stud at Tully, with the assistance of a board of directors, paid or honorary, to assist in the day to day work, directing policy in the buying of blood stock, and generally implementing whatever policy was considered best by the Minister and by this House, for the future of the blood-stock industry. Instead of keeping day to day control in his own hands, as well as the power to act as director-in-chief of the establishment, with the right to be guided and advised by directors with whom he would be in intimate contact, the Minister is giving control to some private directors over whom neither he nor this House will have control. I think that it is a fatal mistake on the part of the Minister, and I do not feel at all happy at a situation in which five persons may get control over our national stud, with no responsibility to this House or to the taxpayers who put up the money and with very little responsibility, so far as this Bill is concerned, to the Minister as regards the detailed affairs of the stud. In a matter of this kind, the Minister might well have taken the House into his confidence and sought some guidance from the different Parties as to the method of control of the Tully Stud in the future.  At all events, the control of the stud by the Minister, with the assistance of competent assessors, should have been resorted to in the first instance.  Only if it were shown that that method of control proved, by experience, to be unsatisfactory, should we have resorted to the device of setting up what is, in effect, a privately-directed company, functioning on State capital and State credit, with no real responsibility to those who provide the capital and the credit.  I think that the Minister has <Col N="1750" /> been unwise in launching himself into this commitment without giving the other method of control a trial.</P>
    <P>Even now, I urge him not to persist in this method of control but to give the other type a trial, at least until such time as we can be satisfied that it has imperfections which are not present in the method of control envisaged by him in this Bill.  The Minister will find, on examination, that the method by which he would act as director-in-chief to this undertaking would give better results to the blood-stock industry, greater confidence to the small breeders and a greater sense of assurance to the taxpayer that the Tully Stud was being operated for genuine national purposes and that private and proprietary interests were completely eschewed in its ownership and direction. While I agree with what Deputy Hughes has said as regards control, I do not agree with him that we should be slow in stocking the stud&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister could postpone the operation of this Bill until such time as he has had an opportunity of considering a different type of control, there is nothing to prevent him from getting, by means of a supplementary estimate, funds for the purpose of buying the first-class bloodstock available at present.  We have to bear in mind that, in England, the racing stables are at a low ebb.  The position in continental countries is very much worse.  The moment it is possible to resume normal trading relations and the moment the restriction on currency exchange is lifted to any degree, you will find that the lid is off and the stable door is open, and a number of our best horses will find a market in Europe at tempting prices.  Many of these animals would be valuable in the restocking of the national stud, and it would be a great pity if these animals were permitted to be sold elsewhere while the national stud is denuded of practically any stock of value and must be eagerly looking forward to an opportunity to acquire good stock.  I am wholeheartedly in sympathy with the idea of somebody buying on behalf of the State the valuable bloodstock to be <Col N="1751" /> had to-day but which, whether in the realm of sires or brood mares, will not be available in 12 months.  It is necessary to buy these animals quickly so as to get the cream of the market.</P>
      <P>That need not prevent the Minister from altering the method of control envisaged in this Bill.  We have an unrivalled opportunity of building up a magnificent national stud.  Alone of the horse-loving countries, perhaps, we have kept our bloodstock intact and have been able to shelter it and nurture it in circumstances that were open to no other country during the past five or six years.  We have the cream of the bloodstock of the world and we ought to take an opportunity of utilising it for the benefit of our own national stud.  I believe that a national stud, with the record of the Irish horse for stamina and prowess, is capable of writing our name large throughout the world and, before the bloodstock here is exported, we should buy the best from our own people so that at the earliest opportunity we can build a fully-matured national stud which will radiate the name of Ireland for quality throughout the world and which will be capable of giving us in the post-war years&mdash;perhaps the distant post-war years&mdash;a market for our bloodstock such as we never had before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made reference to the staffing position at Tully.  I should like to appeal to him to recognise that there is a human factor in a national stud and that we are not dealing with animals all the time.  On the Racecourse Bill, I said that the strange thing about racing was that the folk who make it possible&mdash;the lads who gallop and train the horses and who put up with the rigours of stable life&mdash; get the worst end of the stick in the racing industry, generally.  They do not arrive in motor cars at the racecourses. They do not make large bets in the inner ring.  They never own racehorses.  They walk out to the racecourses, and walk home with the hopes of the morning unfulfilled and, generally, they get a bad deal so far as the racing industry is concerned.  Here, we are dealing with a national stud, and I appeal to the Minister to remember <Col N="1752" /> the human element in this matter. The Tully Stud has been established for a number of years and quite a considerable staff was employed there. When the British Administration handed over, some of the staff went off and were paid gratuities by the British Government.  The gratuity was about £2 for each year of service. Some of the staff were taken over by this Administration and continued in the service.  Judging by what the Minister said, some of those who continued also got gratuities&mdash;that is, the gratuity due to them on the basis of so much for each year of service.  They are now continuing in our employment in the expectation that, when they ultimately pass out of the service, they will get a gratuity, as well, from whatever body controls the stud at that time.</P>
    <P>I gathered from the Minister that there was to be no obligation on the new company to take over the existing staff at Tully, that the service of the staff was to be terminated prior to the formal handing over to the new company and that the new company were to be in such a position that they could take over the old staff if they liked but were not to be obliged to do so if they did not like.  Many of these men have been there for 25 years or longer.  They are not now in the prime of life.  The gratuity which they will get will, at best, be a niggardly amount, having regard to the basis on which it is computed and to their age. It is improbable that, having spent 25 years on a stud farm, they will be able easily to get employment elsewhere. We are to set up this company with a capital of £250,000 and authority to borrow another £100,000.  We ought to say to this new company, or whatever body is to control the undertaking, that they have got to take over the staff under the existing terms and conditions, or if, for good reasons&mdash;and they should be very good reasons&mdash; they do not find it possible to retain their services, then they ought to treat them decently and generously.</P>
    <P>It seems to me nothing short of indifference, if I may put it that way, that we say to a private company of this character: &ldquo;We are going to give notice to the men between 50 and 60 <Col N="1753" /> years of age before you take over.  You can take them over if you wish but you are not bound to take them over if you do not like.&rdquo;  I put it to the Minister that these employees are deserving of better treatment.  I have seen old sires and old brood mares trecking around Tully Stud for many years without ever bringing in a halfpenny to that stud.  In the old days the British Government let them treck around the place without ever earning a penny for the institution.  They had the time of their lives but, strangely enough, when they died, because of the method of keeping the accounts of the stud, it was regarded as having incurred the loss of a certain amount of money by the death of these old sires or brood mares.  In fact, many of them brought in no income at all.</P>
    <P>They were really a liability on the place but they were planked in the balance sheet as representing a certain amount of money because that was the sum for which they were purchased. When they died their death was regarded as a loss but the funds were much better off, in fact, as a result of their death.  When you treat old sires and brood mares in that generous fashion surely it ought to be possible to get fair consideration for men who have been there for 25 years or longer, men whose whole economic lot is cast in that particular area, men who have given the best of their lives to the service of the stud.</P>
    <P>I think it would be most unfair, and an ironic commentary on our sense of values, if we were to contemplate a situation in which old employees of the State would be given notice to take their chance of getting employment from the new private company whereas we are concerned so much with the welfare of the bloodstock industry, which, whatever, its importance, should not take precedence over the human considerations that apply in this case. Many pieces of legislation that have passed through this House have compelled amalgamating companies to take over existing staffs.  For instance, the National Health Insurance Society was compelled to take over every employee of every private society whether it liked it or not.  Córas <Col N="1754" /> Iompair Eireann was compelled to take over the existing employees of Great Southern Railways whether it liked it or not.  Surely, in a case of this kind, where the State owns the land, where the State is going to provide capital, the State should not be unwilling to assume responsibilities which it has compelled private companies to assume in other spheres of activity.  I put it to the Minister whatever method of control he is going to have over this stud, he should insist that the employees will be handed over on terms not less favourable than those under which they have been employed in the past. If, for any reason, the new company finds it necessary to dispense with their services&mdash;and the reasons, as I said before, should be substantial&mdash;before their services are dispensed with, the employees should get fair treatment after their long years of service in the employment of the Tully Stud.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that, at all events, he should insist upon automatic transfer, otherwise these unfortunate people will have no bargaining power with the new company.  They live in that particular area, they have had close associations with the stud; that is where their economic destiny is cast.  If they are not taken on by the new company they will find it difficult to get employment elsewhere in the locality.  The Minister should protect these employees from the possibility that they may be relegated by the new company to the unemployment market. I conclude by appealing to the Minister not to let them down, because it would be an unfortunate method of expressing the gratitude of the nation to men who have served the national stud for the last quarter of a century.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my voice to the protest which has been made against the scheme embodied in this Bill for the future administration of the national stud farm.  A considerable number of years ago, when I occupied an official position in this State, it became my duty to consider the position of the stud farm.  It would be quite wrong for me now to make any reference to the considerations which influenced me, or the advice which I tendered in that capacity.  I merely <Col N="1755" /> mention it to indicate that I am speaking with a recollection of 14 or 15 years of the history of the Tully Stud Farm. I have the clearest possible recollection that in pre-Treaty days the Tully Stud was a national trust and I believe it was administered as such by a Department of the British Government. At all events, the outstanding feature of the trust in pre-Treaty days was that it was a national public trust and it was not administered on the basis of a private concern.</P>
      <P>The proposal in this Bill is to set up a private company under the Companies Acts, not to administer a public trust, not to carry out functions on behalf of the Government in relation to that trust, but to carry on a private business.  The only indication which is given in this Bill as to the purpose for which this company is being formed is that in the clause which provides that the memorandum of association, which defines the objects for which the company is to be created and defines its powers and duties, shall set out that the objects of the company shall be so stated as to enable the company as one of its principal, if not its principal objects, to carry on the business of a stud farm.  So that the effect of these proposals in the Bill is to convert what was a national trust into a private business.  That is a principle to which this House should not subscribe.  It is clear on the face of this Bill itself that the Tully Stud Farm is a national concern. The lands which were used for the purposes of the Tully stud in the old pre-Treaty days are now referred to in the Bill as lands belonging to the State.  The name of the farm, the National Stud, again emphasises and underlines the national aspect and the public character of this concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole basis of the claim of this country to get from the British Government the Tully stud, the farm and all its assets, was the fact that it was State property and, as such, that this State, as the successor to the British Government, was entitled to that property. It should have passed under Article 11 of the old Constitution of 1922 as land belonging to the State. That was the basis of our right to claim this farm.  By this Bill we are now <Col N="1756" /> turning that national trust into a private business and on whose behalf is that business to be run?  A business of this kind, with nominees of the Minister, with no control over its concerns by this House, can be managed in such a way as to be run on dishonest lines for the benefit of certain individuals and not for the benefit of the country.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made here to the Electricity Supply Board and to the method by which the electricity undertaking is carried on.  There is no analogy between the proposals in this Bill and the scheme embodied in the Electricity Supply Acts.  This is a Bill &mdash;again I emphasise it, because it requires to be stated and re-stated&mdash;to create a company to carry on a private business.  The principal object is to carry on the business of a stud farm. The whole object of the Tully stud was to carry on a public trust for the benefit of the bloodstock industry in this country, which was one of our greatest national assets.  This national asset is now going to be turned into a private business.  On whose behalf and for whose benefit?  The Electricity Supply Board was set up in order that there should be a company of the public utility type carrying on, for the benefit of electricity consumers, the business of producing, generating and distributing electricity.  This is not a Bill for that purpose.  This is a Bill for carrying on a business.  Had the proposal been to create a board of trustees or a corporate body to carry on the public trust, on behalf of the public, of the Tully Stud Farm and the National Stud Farm then at least we could have discussed calmly whether or not that was a proper method of carrying on the concern.  At least it would have preserved the whole basis of the Tully Stud, that it was a public trust, a national trust.  This converts a national trust into a private business and there is no analogy between the Electricity Supply Board and this company.  The members of the Electricity Supply Board are appointed on a certain basis by the Minister and, even although the whole scheme of the Electricity Supply Acts was to remove a concern which was in the nature of a public utility <Col N="1757" /> from day to day criticism of the Dáil and to enable it to be carried on as a public utility concern for the benefit of electricity consumers, nevertheless, there is far greater touch between this House and the Electricity Supply Board than there can between this House and this company that it is proposed to set up under this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is no provision, so far as I can see, in this Bill for accounting to this House.  There is no provision by which this House can find out how the business is being conducted.  There is no provision for questioning the persons the Minister appoints.  There is nothing like what occurs between this House and the Electricity Supply Board in which case the accounts are presented annually to the Minister and, through the Minister, to this House.  There is nothing of that kind here.  A purely private business is to conduct what was and ought to be a national trust for the improvement of the bloodstock industry for the benefit of the country nationally.</P>
    <P>I entirely agree with the case that has been put forward by Deputy Hughes and Deputy Norton against this Bill.  The proposals are merely another instance of the policy of the Government in farming out governmental activities to private concerns. It is another method by which they can spread their tentacles of patronage right into the business community and grip the business community into their political power.  I protest against the proposals in this Bill on that basis but I protest against the Bill chiefly because of the fact that it is creating a private company to carry out a private business, in the place of what was a national trust, carried on nationally and under Government auspices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reiterate what Deputy Hughes and Deputy Norton have said as to the wisdom of bringing in this measure at this late stage in the session, with very little notice to Deputies and with very little opportunity of getting in touch with people who might give them additional information.  As representing a part of the country in which the breeding of thoroughbred stock is an industry, <Col N="1758" /> I should have welcomed an opportunity of discussing the Bill with people who are concerned.  I have not had such an opportunity as matters stand. I think the Minister would have been well advised to postpone the Bill to the Autumn session.  We have waited a long time, since the Tully Stud Farm came into the possession of the Government, for the introduction of this measure and a few months' postponement would not have adversely affected the eventual conduct of the stud.  On the contrary, probably two months' consideration of the matter and an opportunity of discussing it with the people concerned would have been beneficial.</P>
      <P>I am also in agreement with Deputy Hughes and Deputy Norton in their view of the particular method that the Minister proposes to adopt in this Bill, namely, to introduce a private company to take charge of the thoroughbred industry so far as the national stud is concerned.  I believe that every Deputy who takes an interest in the matter of thoroughbred stock breeding is <i>ipso facto</i> a representative of the small breeder.  Very few of us concerned with this matter represent the rich and more extensive breeder.  Our interest is mainly in the small thoroughbred stock breeder.  We believe that his interests will be best served by giving a chance to those who represent him in this House to discuss openly and annually the conduct of the national stud.  That will not be possible if the proposals in the Bill are carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one studies the history of thoroughbred stock-breeding in this country one finds that the success that has been brought about in horse breeding is mainly due to the small breeder.  I am glad that the Minister, in his references to his policy in regard to the national stud, referred to the small breeder and said that he hoped the interests of the small breeder would be of paramount consideration by whoever controls the stud.  We want to be assured that the interests of the small breeder will be paramount and that is, probably, the main reason why we insist that the control of the national stud should not be given into the hands of what is tantamount to a private company.  Ninety <Col N="1759" /> per cent. of the great racehorses that have been bred in this country have come from the small breeder.  There have been certain notable exceptions of Derby winners and other horses produced by the more extensive and richer studs but, in the main, the industry has been kept going by the small breeder, not always as a financial success.</P>
    <P>Love of horses is inherent in the Irish countryman.  Possibly in no other country is there such a genius for acquiring and mating horses as there is here.  It is almost miraculous that some of the breeders in this country have produced the stock that they have produced with the limited facilities available to them.  The practice of the small breeder has been somewhat like this: The small farmer interested in stock acquires a thoroughbred brood mare.  He cannot afford to expend a tremendous amount of money, but he does the best he can.  His natural ability as a judge of horseflesh and as a student of pedigree probably enables him to get good value for his money. He mates his mare.  With his limited capital and opportunities he cannot afford to go to the best sire, so he probably mates his mare with a fairly cheap thoroughbred sire somewhere in the country.  The resultant progeny is sold at a moderate figure.  Eventually perhaps the progeny turns out successful on the racecourse.  What happens then is that the fee of the sire is immediately raised 100 or 200 per cent., and passes out of reach of that particular breeder.  He is compelled to fall back again, and mate his mare with some other cheap sire.  In fact, up to this the small breeder has been an advertising agent for the large sire owners.</P>
    <P>As I said, my interest in this Bill is from the point of view of the small breeder.  Many of them have gone out of the business, but love of horses is so inherent in the Irish countryman that many others have taken their places, so the small breeders have continued and will continue in this country whether it is a paying proposition or not.  The first duty of Deputies in this House is the protection of those small breeders.  It is our duty to ensure, so far as we can, that the <Col N="1760" /> national stud will be run for their benefit. If it cannot be run for the benefit of the small breeders, it would be better perhaps if it were not run at all, because the rich and more extensive breeders have plenty of opportunities and capital to provide for themselves. Deputy Costello referred to the stud as a national trust.  It is a national trust. It was operated by the British Government as a national trust, but I venture to hope that we will operate that national trust on a somewhat different basis from that adopted by the British Government.</P>
    <P>I believe that the British Government assumed it was a national trust for Britain, and not for the benefit of the small breeder in this country, because as far as I know before the national stud came into our possession the fees were so excessive that they were not at all within the reach of the small breeder.  I hope that in future it will be operated on different lines, that it will be under the control of the Minister, and that we can come here annually, or at more frequent intervals by Motion if necessary, to demand from the Minister an explanation of the conditions under which the stud is being run.  We do not expect the Minister to operate it himself.  He can have a director, or two directors and a manager, or devise some other system by which the stud can be run in such way that he will have control and that the House will eventually have a say in the matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the national stud operated on these lines: that it would acquire a number of sires&mdash;the number of course would be in proportion to the amount of money they intend to expend&mdash;of the highest possible calibre; sires which probably could not be got outside the studs of the millionaire type of breeder that some of us could name; that at least 70 per cent. of the services of those sires would be available to the small breeder; 30 per cent. or 40 per cent. might be reserved for the State, and high fees might be extracted from the rich breeders to enable it to be a paying concern.  I should like to see the stud so run that the services of sires would be available to the small breeder at a very much lower figure than that at which it would be possible <Col N="1761" /> for him to get horses of the same type anywhere else.  Everybody, of course, could not get them, and the mares would have to be selected in some way. The stud could of course specify that the mares should be of very exceptional breeding and performances, with a view to setting up a line of stock such as they have in some of the very rich studs.  The progeny should be disposed of so that a great proportion of the fillies reared in the stud would pass to the small breeders, either by a system of part payment or a lien on the progeny, or some other method.</P>
    <P>Looking back on the history of the small breeder, whether producers of steeplechasers or of flat racers, we find that far and away the greatest number of the best horses produced came from the small breeder.  If you look down the handicap list of great winners in the last 50 years, you will find that Cloghran, Hunter's Pride, Little Leader and several others came from small breeders.  The Grand National winners, as far back as Salamander, The Lamb, Jerry M, Troytown, Reynoldstown, Workman, and others, came from small breeders who got no State aid.  It was to their credit that they carried on.  Most of them never made any money.  They carried on through the love of horses and horse-racing which is inherent in almost every Irishman.  If we are going to spend £250,000 or more on the advancement of live-stock breeding in this country, then unless we expend it to the advantage of this class of breeder it would be better if it were not expended at all.</P>
    <P>Anything else I have to say will be said on the Committee Stage of this Bill.  I will conclude by protesting against the proposal to pass the control of this stud to some private company, with practically no control over its operations by the members of this House.  I hope the Minister will reconsider that portion of his policy.  If he does, I venture to say that he will have the support of the general body of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BridgetMRedmond" hpid="Mrs. Redmond Mrs. Redmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I am very disappointed that we had so little notice of this Bill.  We had no time to get the general opinion of the <Col N="1762" /> public on it.  I should have liked to have had an opportunity of consulting people who have a knowledge of horse-breeding, people who knew what the Tully stud meant, and who had a very practical idea of how it was run.  In that way we would have been in a position to put up suggestions which, I am sure, would be of help to the Minister.  However, I suppose we must just take it as we find it, but, having waited for so many years for this Bill, it was rather a disappointment to have it rushed in so suddenly without giving us any time to look at it.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I think it is a pity that the Minister could not have waited for a couple of months until the autumn session.  Like the other Deputies who have spoken, I must say that I am extremely disappointed after so many years to find, now that we have got this stud, that no longer can we say it is a national stud which is to be run for the benefit of the Irish people, for the benefit of the small owners and the large owners; that we are handing it over to a few hand-picked people perhaps to run for their own ends.  That is really what it amounts to.  People to whom I have been speaking to-day and yesterday are very perturbed.  They feel that the whole thing has been completely misunderstood so far as the Government are concerned.  I wish to make it quite clear that I am sure the Minister did not intend this to be the case, but that is how it appears to me and the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister thought he was doing the best thing.  I suggest that he should now reconsider the matter and take it on himself to be the man responsible for the running of the stud through a manager and some directors, because we in this House should have a right to ask questions about the running of the stud, to make suggestions with regard to it or bring up any supposed scandal that might be talked about throughout the country.  I think it is only fair and just, when it is the people's money that will be used for the running of this stud, that the people's representatives should have a chance of asking how the stud is being run.  I appeal to the Minister before it is too late to take on the responsibility <Col N="1763" /> himself and, as I said, to have a manager and a few directors.</P>
    <P>On that point, I am sure that the Minister realises how very important it is to get proper people to take on these various duties, because we want experienced people; not people who perhaps may have read about horse-breeding, but people who understand it and who have a thorough expert and practical knowledge of horse-breeding. That is what we want, not simply that they are able to talk about pedigrees without understanding the points of a horse and how to mate a horse properly with a brood mare of suitable pedigree. We want to have that made quite clear before we set out on this very big venture of spending £250,000 of public money.  I therefore ask the Minister to be very particular about the people he will select, to select them carefully and to see that they are people who have a wide and general knowledge of horse-breeding.</P>
    <P>We all know that, in the old days, when Colonel Hall Walker, later Lord Wavertree, made a gift of this stud, he had high ideals about the running of it for the nation.  We are now setting out on a new venture, and we are supposed to be running it as a national stud, too.  We should understand that it is for the nation, for the benefit of the small breeder, as well as the big breeder.  We should keep that fact in mind when we are selecting these men, either the manager or the directors. We should keep that definitely in view, because it is well known to the people of the County Kildare that when Lord Wavertree handed over this farm it was his intention to have it run for the benefit of the people of this country. We should have no misunderstanding about that, even if it was lost sight of and the small breeder did not get the benefit he should have got.  We should not lose sight of that fact.  We should keep before us that we want to benefit the small breeder, who is really the foundation of the horse-breeding industry here.  There is quite a lot to be done about it.  I am sure the Minister has his own ideas about it.</P>
    <P>We must get the very best stock, no matter what the price may be.  We <Col N="1764" /> must have the best sires and the best brood mares, which I may say are not so easy to find as some people seem to imagine.  They are not easy to get at present, and the price is tremendously high.  Even if we were only to have a few, it is much better to have a few good ones, and start well, than to have a lot which would not be up to the mark.  As well as having these very high-class thoroughbred sires, I suggest that something should be done towards having good sires which will produce 'chasers.  In this country we had a great name for 'chasers in the old days.  Now, for some reason or another, they are running out.  Those we have are getting old.  Farmers who formerly had one or two have got out of them.  The farmer who always had a good 'chaser of the staying type cannot afford to keep one now, as he is not getting very much encouragement. I feel that we should have some of these sires in the national stud whose services would be given at a reasonable rate so as to encourage the breeding of 'chasers of the staying kind in this country.  There is a good market for the 'chaser now, and there will be in the future, as we know they are very keen in England; and we should set the headline and have these sires available, as well as those of the high-class thoroughbred type.</P>
    <P>In mentioning the lease of fillies and the sale of colts, I would point out to the Minister that much as we want to see the stud filly, we do not want to see the national stud going into opposition with the small breeder and small owner at the Ballsbridge sales, for instance.  The stud should be satisfied to lease them out, and should not enter into competition.  In other words, we should not have the best from the stud, where they have the best care and where no expense is counted, going into competition with the small man from the country who may have one of the same breed at Ballsbridge. There should be some rule to avoid that competition.  I think that is not an unreasonable request.  It would be a different thing if it went over to Doncaster Sales, as they have gone before and always will go, but they should not be put up here, where we <Col N="1765" /> would have sales and buyers in from the other side.  There should not be competition from a stud run with the people's money through State funds.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton mentioned the employees. I am sure that when it has been pointed out to the Minister that so many of these people have lived all their lives in these surroundings, with life-long connections with Tully and the National Stud, the Minister will be able to realise what a terrible hardship it would be if these people were left at the mercy of the new board.  I make the appeal that they be kept on, at least until they prove unsatisfactory to the new board.</P>
    <P>There is another thing which is not actually connected with the stud, but which, with your permission, A Chinn Chomhairle, I would like to speak of; and as the Minister has mentioned it in passing, I suppose I may.  It is about the Japanese Gardens there, which, as everyone knows, are world famous.  They are on the same lands as the Tully stud, and I would ask that, if possible, they be kept up as they were formerly.  They were a show-ground for visitors in the past.  I hope that that matter will be given special attention.  There were some beautiful trees there from many parts of the world, some of them many hundreds of years of age, and it is really something to be proud of to have that garden.  I would ask the Minister to have it inserted in the Bill that these be kept up as they were formerly. Finally, I regret that we have not had much more time to examine the provisions of this Bill, and to consult our friends in the country about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to join with other Deputies here in opposing the character of this Bill.  I agree entirely with the principle of establishing and maintaining a national stud in this country.  I believe that with our history of successful breeding of blood-stock both by private breeders and by the national stud, as it was known in the past, it is up to us to maintain that leading position in the world.  Not alone that, but we should facilitate in every way possible private breeders and particularly small breeders to continue their work and we should assist them in securing the best type of <Col N="1766" /> bloodstock at prices within their command.</P>
      <P>The character of this Bill is one to which I cannot subscribe and one on which Deputies and people outside have recently commented.  A most striking condemnation of its character is contained in the Vocational Commission Report.  That commission was set up by the Government, but what particular cognisance the Government has taken of its findings, I am unable to say.  I followed with some interest certain publicity given to the differences of opinion existing between Ministers and the chairman of the commission.  Like others, I have not been able to follow the finish of that controversy, if it has finished, and if it continued we were not given an opportunity of reading it in the papers. Irrespective of the attention which that received from the Government, it is a matter of some significance that a body of this kind, set up by the Government &mdash;who selected the personnel for, I presume, reasons known to themselves &mdash;should have reported in such an adverse fashion on a company of this nature.  I propose to read the commission's observations on this matter, at page 430, paragraph 683 of their report:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Another method of operating State enterprise has come into Government favour in recent years: it is by means of a nominal company registered under the Companies Acts.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then the commission continues, at the end of that page:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;This method of administration is clearly fraught with great dangers to the prestige and integrity of democratic government.  It offers a wide field for the exercise of political patronage of a very costly and undesirable type, for not merely may large salaries be given to persons as a reward for political services, but large sums of money for capital and working expenses may be placed at their disposal without adequate safeguards.  It could provide an unscrupulous government with a means of making a large number of persons dependent on it for salaries and wages and of obtaining electioneering support by promoting enterprises or industries in certain <Col N="1767" /> localities without due regard to economic factors.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>No words that any Deputy in this House could use could condemn more strongly or more clearly than that the type of company that we now propose to continue.  It may be that the companies which were set up here prior to the establishment of the Commission on Vocational Organisation, or at any rate prior to the introduction of this report, were set up in ignorance; but the Government has seen the report and has had an opportunity of reading it and of realising the dangers the commission points out.  I, for one, am in entire agreement with the commission in their findings on this matter.  I think it is wholly undersirable that this Parliament should abrogate its right of control, which is one of the most sacred principles of Parliamentary institutions, over the expenditure of public money.  Whatever type of board may be set up, and bad as some of the other Bills in this regard have been, this one seems to me to reach the limit.  In Section 13, the Bill says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  The articles of association of the Company shall be in such form consistent with this Act as shall be approved of by the Minister for Agriculture after consultation with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>(2)  The following provisions shall apply in respect of the articles of association of the company, that is to say&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the said articles shall provide that the number of directors (including the chairman) shall not be less than three or more than five;</P>
    <P>(b)  the said articles shall provide that the qualification for a director of the company shall be the holding of at least one share of the company;</P>
    <P>(c)  the said articles shall provide that the chairman and all the other directors of the company shall always be appointed by, and may be removed from office by, the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The very type of board which this commission has found to be fraught <Col N="1768" /> with great dangers to democratic government, which gives first-class opportunities to political patronage, is the type of board envisaged in this section. Further, the section says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(e)  the said articles shall provide that no person shall be nominated as auditor of the company without the approval of the Minister for Finance given after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here, again, the auditor appointed must be appointed because he suits the Government.  While it may be quite reasonable to expect that the Government would appoint an auditor qualified, in the ordinary interpretation of that word, there is no guarantee that the auditor will have proper training or proper knowledge or that he will be in any way beholden to this House, or that the findings of his accounting will be laid on the Table of the House and so put at the disposal of Deputies.</P>
    <P>As a matter of interest, it may be well to read another paragraph out of the report, paragraph 685:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Up to the present the directors of nominal companies have not been appointed on any standard pattern or principle.  The boards of directors are composed in whole or in part of one or more of the following categories: (i) civil servants, (ii) persons without special technical or vocational knowledge, and (iii) persons with special technical or business knowledge and skill.</P>
    <P>The practice of appointing civil servants as salaried directors of Government companies is open to several objections and should be discontinued. In the first place, their position as civil servants is a whole-time position and should not permit the withdrawal of their time and energy from official duties; secondly, civil servants should not be exposed to the accusation that in drafting legislation they create remunerative positions for themselves.  Furthermore, they should be completely judicial and unbiased in administering the affairs of their department, and it would be certainly very difficult for them to be so, if they have actually or prospectively a financial interest in enterprises <Col N="1769" /> which are subject to them in their official capacity.</P>
    <P>There would appear to be little justification for appointing persons without special technical or business ability.  The practice of making appointments on the ground of rank or political affiliation is most questionable and is open to many of the abuses concerned with interlocking directorships and the utilisation of political personages for company promotion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sure many Deputies are aware of the system which company promoters seem to have adopted in having subsidiary companies and having the share-capital held by a subsidiary company which, in fact, has the same personnel of directors as those who held the share capital of the parent company.</P>
    <P>Companies of this nature are able in many ways to prevent the Revenue authorities from ascertaining their actual earnings or anything relating to their activities.  In that way what are known as fictitious companies are promoted and the directors or shareholders are able to avoid taxation, to avoid coming under the full weight of taxation which the original or parent company would normally bear.  This commission points out the grave dangers which are inherent in that type of fictitious company.  Under this Bill it is proposed to continue that type of fictitious company, appointments to the board of which will be largely because of political patronage, if not because of political patronage; there is no indication that it will be because of special technical knowledge, practical experience in administering a stud, any particular business association, management of stud farms or bloodstock breeding for sale.</P>
    <P>There is no mention in this Bill of any activities, beyond that the company shall promote a stud.  There is nothing to prevent the board of the company leasing racehorses among themselves or their friends, engaging in competition with private owners, or indulging in all sorts of subterfuges to prevent the public, whose property this stud is, from ascertaining their true activities.  There is no safeguard which in the normal way would be given to the public in relation to their <Col N="1770" /> money, no method of control over the board, unless it be that it will hold office at the whim and pleasure of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture, who will appoint the board, after consultation.</P>
    <P>However objectionable this may have been in the past, however unknowingly members of the House may have subscribed to companies of this nature, there is no excuse or justification for its continuance, now that we have the report of the Commission on Vocational Organisation.  After very careful consideration, the commission brought in a lengthy report.  They made reference to this particular type of company.  I have no doubt the members of the commission were fully and accurately informed and did not arrive at their conclusions without the most careful consideration.  In the face of that report, I see no justification whatever for supporting this Bill.</P>
    <P>In connection with the provisions of the Bill, the Minister told us very little about what stock it is proposed to acquire.  As Deputy Hughes and other Deputies have pointed out, the acquisition of suitable high-class blood-stock is a costly business at the present time.  Any studs that were established here within recent years must have cost their promoters far larger sums than they would have cost several years ago.  The suitability of the type of animal in a stud of this nature may not always depend on paying the highest price.  It is reasonable to assume that animals will on the average be fairly costly.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the delay in bringing forward this Bill, considering that we have had the stud for at least one and a half years.  Now that the Bill has been introduced, I think it is unreasonable to rush it.  It has been introduced in a week in which there were various distractions and Deputies have been unable to consult the various interests concerned in this industry.  They have not been able properly to ascertain the opinion of bloodstock breeders or inquire into the desirability of purchasing stock. Naturally, Deputies are anxious to come into the House fully armed with the most accurate information on the subject of bloodstock breeding.  This <Col N="1771" /> stud is unique in so far as it is the property of the people, and the interests concerned in establishing and maintaining a stud of this nature are very diverse.  Not merely are blood-stock breeders interested, but there are also other stud owners greatly concerned; indeed, everyone connected with racing, and particularly the people living in the county in which the stud is situated, people in various walks of life, have a direct interest in it and it is only fair that the interests of all those people should be taken into consideration. I suggest that we should have been afforded a reasonable time in which to consult various people before we are called upon to debate this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave very little information as to what the functions of the State are likely to be.  I was glad to hear him state that the main interests so far as he was concerned would be that of the small breeder; that he regarded, and rightly so, the small breeder as the backbone of the industry. That being so, it is not out of place if I dwell for a moment on the difficulties which small breeders have had in procuring suitable sires and mares.  For a number of years, more especially since the emergency, high-class sires have been scarce.  There has been a decline in racing, both here and across the water.  For that reason there has been a reduction in the number of racehorse owners and trainers of racing horses.  The number of horses in training may not have declined very much&mdash;it is difficult at the moment to give any definite figures. Formerly, when we had a large number of valuable races each year&mdash;and there certainly was one high-class race at each meeting&mdash;it was easy to estimate at the end of the year the number of suitable horses which small or large breeders could purchase.</P>
    <P>There are three classes of sires, the first class, such as Derby or Cup winners, the second class and the third class, and, according to the weight of his pocket, a prospective purchaser purchased a first class, a second class, or a third class animal. Since the war started small breeders have found stud fees rising.  In addition to that, the first <Col N="1772" /> class sires are mainly owned by large breeders, and it is only natural that large breeders who have a first class sire will give preference in nominations to other high class breeders who, in turn, will secure for them the services of valuable animals from their studs.  In that way the small breeder is crowded out.  He is pushed aside, not only from the financial point of view, because many small breeders are prepared to make financial sacrifices if they can procure the services of a good sire, but also from the point of view that the large owner is anxious to facilitate the persons who are anxious to assist him.  The position then is that the small breeder is often dependent on second class sires.</P>
    <P>As a result of all this, a number of small breeders have considered the desirability of purchasing a sire and keeping him in joint ownership, establishing some form of association in which they will have first claim on the services of the sire.  There are certain objections to that kind of ownership. First of all, these men may not all live near each other and that means that whoever is responsible for keeping the sire has to bear, among other things, the cost of maintenance, and on small stud farms it is difficult for a man to have all the facilities requisite for maintaining a horse of this character. These people are often put to considerable expense bringing the horse around the country because they may not have sufficient land to meet the requirements of visiting mares.</P>
    <P>I think the small breeders deserve the greatest consideration from this House.  This is the first opportunity we will have of assisting these people. While the Department has here and there through the country certain thoroughbred horses, which are placed at the disposal of small breeders, these horses are mainly for the breeding of hunters.  Small breeders want a thoroughbred that will breed a fast horse and, unless the fee is within the reach of the small breeder, he will not be able to avail of the services of such an animal.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
