      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he is in a position to state the approximate number of Irishmen who have left Éire since hostilities ceased, to assist in the building up of the bombed areas of England; and, if in view of the large number of men who have volunteered to assist in this work and in agricultural activities and other occupations, he will ask the British authorities to grant permission for their wives and families to accompany them if they wish to do so.</P>

      <P>As regards the first part of the question, I am not in a position to say how many of our workers who have gone to employment in England since hostilities ceased are engaged on the type of work indicated by the Deputy.  As regards the second part of the question, the British authorities are not prepared, owing to housing and supply difficulties, to grant facilities to enable Irishmen going to work in England to bring their wives and families with them.</P>

      <P>Where there are special circumstances, say in half-a-dozen or even in 100 cases, in which Irishmen have permanently settled down and have promises that they will be retained in employment in England, will the Minister's Department make a special appeal for reciprocity between <Col N="154" /> the two countries and ask that wives be permitted to go over and bring their children with them?  I ask for this concession only in special cases and not generally.</P>

      <P>When the State issues a permit or passport to a citizen it makes itself liable for his diplomatic protection and, morally, if not in a strictly legal sense, it makes itself responsible in the eyes of other States for the conduct and activities of the individual concerned while in their territory.  Moreover, a citizen who does not accept the authority of the State has hardly a good right to complain if the State feels itself unable to assume responsibility for his diplomatic protection.  The individual concerned is in this category.  He is not willing to give the assurance as to his future conduct which would justify us in accepting the onus of protecting him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my statement on this subject during the course of the debate on the Estimate for my Department on 17th May last.  As I stated then I favour a policy of guaranteed prices, but in considering this question the fact must be borne in mind that in normal times a feature of our agricultural economy is an export surplus sold in a competitive market.  This in effect means that as regards cattle, eggs and similar items our export prices must move in sympathy with world prices or receive heavy subsidies.  The situation is not quite the same as regards commodities of which there is no export surplus but before going more fully into the whole matter I propose to await the publication and full consideration of the final report of the Committee of Inquiry on Post-Emergency Agricultural Policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the conditions of the scheme is that applications are dealt with in the order of their receipt up to the limits of the money available. An intimation to this effect was also made in the Press advertisements. This procedure has been followed. When applications sufficient to absorb all the funds available had been accepted, there still remained a number which had, in the circumstances, to be rejected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a number of people who applied within the prescribed time were disappointed as their applications were rejected?  Will the Minister give an assurance now that these people will be given priority in future schemes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that the applications of some of those who applied in time were rejected but only of those whose applications came in within the last two days of the expiration of the time specified.  I can give the Deputy an undertaking that they will get prior consideration in future schemes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of applications was unexpectedly heavy and we did not anticipate that such a large sum might be required.  Of course it entails something more than the mere provision of money.  It also entails the provision of more staffs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Canadian Oats.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state why it was decided to import Canadian oats into <Col N="158" /> this country; and if any steps were taken to prevent this importation having an adverse effect on the price paid for oats to home producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>For some time past it has been impossible in many places to purchase oatmeal as stocks manufactured from the 1944 oats crop were exhausted. For several months before the harvest there was also a great scarcity of oats for feeding and any supplies obtainable had to be purchased at prices which were excessive having regard to the prices which feeders are getting for their products.</P>
      <P>The area under oats in 1945 is less than that of the previous year by more than 100,000 acres and it is doubtful whether the yield per acre will be any higher.  Consequently it may be anticipated that oats will be even more scarce in the coming months than in the previous season unless home production of cereals can be supplemented by imported feeding stuffs.  There is no immediate prospect of supplies of maize or other feeding stuffs which were imported in large quantities before the emergency, becoming available to any extent.  To avert a serious shortage the opportunity was taken of securing a quantity of oats which it was possible to purchase at a price which enabled provision to be made for a supply of oatmeal for human consumption during the coming winter at prices somewhat higher than those ruling last year.  I do not think growers can complain that reasonably attractive prices are not now being obtained for home-grown oats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Were any precautions taken to ensure that the importation would not have an adverse effect upon the price paid to the producer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>For one thing, the oatmeal millers are taking all the home-grown oats offered to them, at a fair price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Driscoll</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state (a) the price to be paid by the British Ministry for Food for turkeys exported to England during the coming season; (b) the price likely to be paid to the Irish producer; <Col N="159" /> (c) if it is intended to put a tax or levy on turkeys exported, and (d) the amount that was realised from the tax or levy that was imposed last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is anticipated that the prices payable during the coming season in respect of turkeys exported from this country will be the same as last year, viz.: 2/7 per lb. dead weight delivered, payable by the British importer, and 1/10 per lb. live weight payable to producers.  The latter price is a net price after deduction of 3d. per lb. which it is intended to continue in circumstances similar to those which obtained last year.  The amount realised from the deduction made last year was £133,921 which was fully disbursed in payment of higher prices for eggs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle (for Mr. Hughes)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will give for the immediate post-war years an estimate of (a) our import requirements from dollar countries; (b) the corresponding value of our anticipated exports to such countries, and (c) if he will state what steps he proposes to take to secure the necessary exchange facilities to purchase our requirements in dollar goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first two parts of the Deputy's question, it will be appreciated that import requirements from, and anticipated exports to, dollar countries during the immediate post-war years will be governed by so many unpredictable factors such as availability of goods, including raw materials used in the manufacture of goods for export, price levels, alternative sources of supply, exchange restrictions, the shipping position, etc., that it is impossible to give an estimate of any value as to the quantity of goods that will be imported or exported during any stated period in the near future.</P>
      <P>With regard to the third part of the Deputy's question, it may be anticipated that, unless circumstances change considerably, there will be in the immediate future, as in pre-war years, an adverse balance of trade with the dollar countries, but it is hoped that the gap may be narrowed by the expansion and development of exports&mdash;a problem which is receiving the closest attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;and, also, by the expected development of the tourist industry.  In the circumstances envisaged, it will be necessary for the Government to maintain for the present the control of foreign exchange, including the machinery which enables the dollar resources of Irish residents to be acquired by the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that the gap is so enormous &mdash;practically £10,000,000&mdash;that a very radical planning of an export trade will be necessary, so much so as to entail a radical change in policy.

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state (a) what revenue has been received in each of the financial years since the passing of the Finance Act, 1935, as a result of the enactment of Section 6 of that Act; (b) the cost to the Exchequer in each of the said years in connection with the assessment of tax under that section; (c) if he has considered the effect of the tax imposed by Section 6 in discouraging private persons from building interior roads and thus encouraging ribbon building, and (d) if he will consider the advisability of repealing or amending the said section in view of the amount of the revenue received, the work and expense involved in connection with assessments thereunder, and the desirability of encouraging the construction of interior roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the particulars sought by the Deputy under (a) and (b) are not available.  The preparation of a reply under those heads would involve the expenditure of an amount of time and labour that could not be justified in the circumstances. <Col N="162" /> As for the remainder of the question, if a builder working on a building scheme constructs an interior road he may, in the ordinary course, claim the cost of constructing it as a deduction in the computation of his profits.  The broad purpose of Section 6 of the Finance Act, 1935, was to secure that a builder should not escape tax on his profits in the common case where the houses which he built in developing an estate were sold by him subject to a head rent.  I do not consider that the fact that builders are liable to income-tax on their profits should discourage the building of interior roads or encourage ribbon building.</P>
      <P>Whether or not the section applies to the case of a private person who is not a builder and who constructs interior roads depends on the facts.  If the Deputy has a particular case in mind perhaps he will be so good as to communicate with me.</P>

      <P>I was not thinking of the case of a builder.  I was thinking of the case of a private owner. I think the Minister will agree with me that the tax is one of the reasons why sites for building houses are so few and so difficult to obtain.  However, I will have pleasure in giving the Minister the particulars.</P>

      <P>The suggestion that legislation should be introduced to confer full parental rights on persons who adopt children, to the exclusion of the actual parents, has been carefully examined.  While I believe that, in a number of individual cases, this proposal would be advantageous, the result of my inquiries has been to convince me that there are serious difficulties in adopting the principle generally by way of legislation. In particular, it has not been found possible to devise any scheme which would afford satisfactory safeguards against the danger that the question of the child's religion might become involved in a controversial and undesirable manner.  Unless this objection can be met, I do not propose to introduce legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>At a stage like this when the emergency is past and emphasis on the national military problem has eased, it is natural that speculation should have arisen amongst members of the House as to the form the future L.D.F. will take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In public statements already made by the Taoiseach and by me as Minister for Defence, it has been indicated that the intention of the Government is to retain the L.D.F. as a permanent element of our national defence organisation.  Since that general decision was taken, consideration has been given to the preparation of a suitable scheme.  Enough progress has been made to enable me to outline in a general way our plans about the future of the force.  As Deputies are aware, the force has hitherto been based constitutionally on an Emergency Powers Order.  In its new form, a permanent constitutional basis had, of necessity, to be found.  The <Col N="172" /> Defence Forces Act which permits the raising of second line volunteers is, in view of the function of the force and of its military significance, the natural permanent basis of the organisation. It will thus become, even more fully than heretofore, a military organisation and will be more closely knit into the permanent military structure.  As it would be too serious a breach with a worthy tradition to abandon the title of L.D.F., we propose to retain that title and thus enable the new force to carry with it the tradition established during the last five years.  The general organisation of the force will not greatly differ from that with which the Deputies are acquainted.  It will be essentially a territorial organisation, the districts becoming battalions and the present district territories forming the limits of the new battalions. Generally speaking, the active assistance afforded to the force by the regular Army will continue to be afforded, until ultimately, as the Government hopes, a position will be reached when the force will be able to train itself in its military functions.</P>
    <P>In regard to the problems of personnel, the arrangement will be to grant commissions to as many of the present leaders as are qualified to hold them, provided these leaders are of an age suitable for the discharge of their military duties and there are sufficient vacancies in the new establishments for them.  An age limit of 45 years for existing leaders will be fixed.  Leaders of districts, for example, with the necessary qualifications will be commissioned initially in the rank of captain for command of the battalions. There will be appropriate ranks for officers commanding lower formations and leaders of non-commissioned officer status will be appointed to the equivalent Army rank.  Under the scheme, these age limits will naturally render a proportion of the membership inelegible for duty in the new force. To these members and to others who, though qualified for entry into the new force, do not do so, certificates of service will be issued provided they apply for them in writing and have not less than two years' service in the old L.D.F.  I may also mention that a scheme for the issue of service medals <Col N="173" /> to all members of the Army, the L.D.F. and the other auxiliary services who served during the emergency has been approved by the Government and it is hoped to issue them in the new year.</P>
    <P>In regard to the fixing of age limits, the main consideration is to ensure that the L.D.F. will continue largely as a virile, youthful force.  In pursuance of that idea, an upper age limit for recruits at 35 years has been set. This does not mean that all serving members who exceed 35 years of age will be ineligible.  Special provision has been made whereby existing members of the force will be retained in the service, if they have not reached the age of 40 years.  When the  has been completed, the upper age limit for the new force will be fixed at 50 years.  With regard to this matter of age and the importance of securing that the younger members of the community are drawn into the L.D.F., the lower age limit has been reduced to 17 years.  While on full time courses, all ranks will be entitled to the same rates of pay as for corresponding army ranks.</P>
    <P>It may. at this stage, be premature to outline in any detail training policy, but I should say that, while it is obvious that considerable attention must continue to be devoted to normal military training, increased emphasis will be placed on physical training to develop the well-being of our young men and to inculcate, with such training, those duties of citizenship which should be shared by military and civilians alike.  Periodical nightly drills will continue to be a feature of training and provision will be made, at the option of members, for annual summer camps in which the routine training will be brought to its fuller development in a whole time period of from a week to 14 days.  The transition from the present force to the force in its new form will involve a simple process of attestation, in which members will undertake to serve for a period of five years, with provision for a voluntary extension of that period to a maximum of 12 years.</P>
    <P>It will be gathered from this brief <Col N="174" /> outline of the scheme that the L.D.F., as it has been known, will, in its main features, continue.  The least possible disturbance in its traditions is contemplated, so that it will inherit the discipline and traditions which have been established during the emergency years.  The importance of the L.D.F. to the nation need not be stressed. Every thoughtful person recognises that not only is the L.D.F. essential to any serious defence plan but is no less important as a beneficial influence in the life of the community.</P>
    <P>Between now and the day on which the new scheme will be finally initiated, there will necessarily be an interval. Having regard to the easing of the international situation in so far as it affects this country, there is a possibility of an undesirable relaxation in the activities of the L.D.F.  This period, therefore, could easily become one of deterioration, if the energies of the various leaders were not concentrated on an effort to maintain the force.  Even where leaders will be overage and must make way for younger men, their duty to maintain the force during the interval is clear.  They should be urged to make every effort to maintain the interest of the men and the structure of the existing organisation, in order that, when the change over takes place, they will have the satisfaction of handing on a fine tradition of service to the standardbearers of the new generation.  I appeal, therefore, from this House to all L.D.F. leaders of whatever age to continue to stand by their posts and do everything possible to ensure that the L.D.F. of the future will be worthy of the traditions that have been established during the years of stress.</P>

      <P>In relation to Question No. 32, would the Minister say whether it is his intention to fix a date of termination of emergency service in respect of the present L.D.F.?  The Minister will appreciate that there are many people who joined the L.D.F. because of the emergency, and only because of the emergency, and who may not desire to enter into commitments for the next five years.  On the <Col N="175" /> other hand, they do not want to be charged, at the end of their present five years' service, with undesirable relaxation on their part.  Has the Minister considered that there are many officers and men in the L.D.F. who wish to be honourably discharged and who are awaiting a date to be defined upon which they can take that discharge honourably?  Under those circumstances, does the Minister intend to fix a date for the termination of purely emergency service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>That date will be fixed by regulation in due course.  The appeal which I have made to the men now is to stand steady during the particular period between now and the issue of the regulation.  When the regulation is issued, the new force will come into being, and the certificates which I have mentioned will be an issue of honourable discharge to those men who have continued to serve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to understand, then, that the Minister does not see the possibility of giving honourable discharge to men or officers of the L.D.F. earlier than the 1st January next?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that question arises at all.  Any member of the L.D.F. who has continued to serve, who has served up to the present moment, can be discharged at his own request and he will be entitled in due course to the medal which we hope to issue and to the certificate.  There is no such thing as an honourable discharge at the present moment.  The only discharge given will be a certificate of service and that certificate <Col N="176" /> cannot be given until these regulations I have mentioned have been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister planning in any way to give the L.D.F. an opportunity of feeling that, in a communal way, they are marking the end of their emergency service, in the way in which it was thought that the L.S.F. would get the opportunity, in a general way, and that, in many local cases, they did get?  I submit to the Minister that there is a desire on the part of the L.D.F. to feel that they have stood to attention in a communal way for a dismiss from emergency service. There are many men who cannot well afford to give the attention to duty they would like to give between this and the 1st January next, who are anxious&mdash;born out of the sense of discipline, order and service they have learned during that period&mdash;to stand to their positions until they get that gesture of being dismissed from their emergency posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I can make it any more clear.  These men, if they so desire, can continue to serve up to the 1st January next and then they can go out in any way they themselves desire.  They can have any form of parade or reunion and can have their certificates presented, or the medals, if they are ready, in any manner they may desire.  If they want to go out in the meantime, there is no reason in the world why they should not go out.  There will be nothing in the nature of disgrace in going out and they will be presented with their certificates in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister would nominate such a date as, say, the 1st November as the end of this emergency service, men would continue on until that date and then go out in a systematic way.  Otherwise, there may be a tendency to a kind of slovenly discharge from the L.D.F. which would be undesirable in view of the kind of feeling which the men wish to maintain in their service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister clear up one point?  I gather from what he has said that it is intended that those who wish to become members <Col N="177" /> of the new L.D.F. may do so on attesting from the existing force and that it is proposed to have a period of service of five years.  Is it the intention to compel them in any way to serve for that five years, or will they be entitled voluntarily to relinquish their service at any time during that five years' period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>We are following a precedent which, I think, was created in respect of the Old Volunteers.  It did not cause any difficulty then and I do not foresee any great difficulty in what is being done in respect of the L.D.F. In order to get some kind of fixed force, we are asking men to take on for a period of five years.  I suppose there may be a question of a man desiring to resign getting in touch with the officer commanding and making his case clear and getting agreement to his resignation; but the attestation will be for five years.  Of course, the service will be only something like once per week with, perhaps, a monthly duty including some kind of outdoor drill, with a period of annual training.  I do not foresee any difficulty in that sense at all.</P>

Fox asked to be allowed to erect the buildings himself and the Land Commission agreed.  He has not yet done so, though additional financial assistance was offered him in 1938, and he now wants the Land Commission to build the house and out-office for him.

    <P>It is not possible at present to state when the holding will be divided, but its disposal is under investigation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether, in the last 12 months, any ships, which would normally have come to and been unloaded at the port of Dublin, have been diverted to any other port for such unloading; and, if <Col N="189" /> so, how many such ships were diverted and at what ports they were unloaded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No control is exercised at present over the port of discharge of ships engaged on the cross-Channel trade.  The shortage of tonnage made it necessary to exercise a measure of control over the ships employed in the cross-Channel coal trade from May, 1944, to July, 1945.  During that time it was essential to secure the quick turn-round of these vessels.  For that reason, a greater proportion of coal cargoes were discharged at Dublin than would otherwise have been the case.</P>
      <P>The port of discharge of the Irish ocean-going ships is fixed for each voyage by the shipping company concerned in consultation with my Department.  The aim is to use the port which is most convenient for the bulk of the cargo on board but other considerations, such as repair facilities, arise occasionally.  The port of Dublin has been receiving a fair share of this shipping.</P>

      <P>As far as the Carlow County Council is concerned, I might point out that in 1942 the former Board of Health and Public Assistance applied to me for sanction to a loan of £20,000 to acquire and fence 283 plots for labourers' cottages. To date 253 of these have been acquired.  The scarcity of building materials, however, is such that only a very small number of cottages could be erected at present.

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with that motion, I would ask the House to consider what the position is. It is that the Government apparently have very little business for the House, but that does not necessarily mean that there is not a very large amount of business to be discussed by the House.  List No. 7, on which is set out Private Deputies' Business, contains 16 motions.  That means that if the full three hours' discussion is given to each motion, we have there 48 hours' discussion on matters that affect vitally the economic, social and <Col N="199" /> financial interests of the country.  The motions on that list have been put down by Deputies from nearly every county, Deputies with varying contacts, both socially and economically, with the life of the country.  It is rather astonishing to me that the Government should begin the year's work in this spirit, especially in view of the circumstances of the times when the greatest possible thought and the greatest possible discussion in Parliament on matters affecting the lives of the people are necessary.  I would ask the Tánaiste to look at the list that was published on the 19th December, 1944, and to look at the list that was published on the 10th October, 1945. We find that, in the list published on the 10th October, 1945, a motion of mine, which appears there as No. 3, stood as Motion No. 14 on the list that was in circulation a year and a month ago.  That motion is connected with a very important aspect of the finances of the country and of the building of houses.  As I have said, it appeared as No. 14 on the list a year and a month ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that the House should sit every week in the normal way, and that if Government business is not available then private members should be given the opportunity of disposing of last year's motions.  We should not begin to carry on business in the way now suggested by the Government.  I realise that the members of the Government are apparently at variance with one another.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce may be more closely up against the realities of the situation than some of the other Ministers.  The position is that there are matters on that list that call for urgent discussion, and I suggest that it is stultifying the House, that it is degrading the House and injuring the interests of the people both economically and politically, if this Parliament is going to shut down, quite unnecessarily, now because there is not Government business to put before the House.  At this time of the year it may be an advantage that the Government has not business to put before the House, because if we get an opportunity <Col N="200" /> within the next week or two, when Government business is not so pressing, of discussing the matters that are on the Order Paper, then the approach of the Government when dealing with legislation later may be more realistic.  The next week or two would give the House an opportunity for a discussion on the wide range of subjects posed by private Deputies.  I would ask the Government to reconsider the matter both in the interests of our parliamentary institutions and of the economic situation in the country, and to decide that the Dáil will be kept in session week after week, at least on Wednesdays and Thursdays, so as to get rid of the motions that are on the Order Paper, particularly when the position is that Government business is not able to fill the time. When we get down to the discussion of the Rent Restrictions Bill in Committee, and any other measures the Government may have, it looks as if the present lull in Government work may quickly cease.  If that is so, then Private Members may not be given the time and opportunity to which they are entitled for a discussion of their business.  In normal circumstances only one motion can be got through in any week, and indeed it is not often that one Private Member's motion is disposed of in any one week.  It will be seen then that the hope of dealing with the list of Private Members' business is very slight.  I think the Government should be glad to offer the House the opportunity that now arises for discussion of the various items of Private Members' business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Tánaiste to reconsider the decision he has now indicated to the House.  I think it is an unwise decision, even from the Government point of view. There is nothing more calculated to bring this House into disrepute than a set of circumstances in which the House, having adjourned for three months, meets for two days and decides to adjourn for another fortnight.  I imagine the Tánaiste's realistic mind must grasp the fact that that kind of conduct is not calculated to enhance the prestige of the legislative <Col N="201" /> Assembly in the eyes of the people. One could understand this proposed adjournment if there were no business to be dealt with, but yesterday three Bills were set down for Second Reading on Wednesday next.  There is no reason why those Bills should not be available for Second Reading on Wednesday, but, assuming that they are not available, we have Private Deputies' business of a character not only to justify sitting next week but of a character sufficiently important to encourage the Government to ensure that the House does, in fact, sit next week.</P>

    <P>One of those motions deals with the provision of a national water supply. Another deals with the rates at which money is to be made available for house building.  Another deals with the question of the establishment of a Ministry of Social Services.  Another deals with a national free milk scheme. Another deals with the cost of administration of State Departments.  Another deals with the question of ground rents. Another deals with the deterioration in the use of the Irish language, and another with the question of old age pensions.  Is there any Minister or any Deputy on the Government Benches who is not prepared to acknowledge that those are important issues, and that the House could usefully occupy its time in a discussion of those matters, so that the points of view in favour of those schemes and the point of view of the Government in relation to them may be fully understood by the people?  There can be no justification whatever for adjourning the Dáil now, when it has only just resumed after three months.  The Government know they cannot justify it.  It may just suit their temporary convenience not to sit next week, but, so long as those questions are clamouring for discussion, so long as Deputies are available to move the motions and put issues of the importance I have indicated before the House for consideration, I think the Government ought to assemble the House next week if for no other purpose than to discuss those issues.  The Government themselves have business available if they will only go and get the Bills circulated in time.  It is a very bad mistake for the Government <Col N="202" /> to adjourn the House when business is available, and I would ask the Tánaiste to reconsider this decision so that the House may not be made a laughingstock throughout the country.</P>

      <P>While confirming all that the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Labour Party have said, does not this consideration also carry weight?  In normal times, would it not be a good thing if the impression were generally spread in this House that if the Opposition wanted Parliament convened the Government would be glad to convene it at any time the Opposition wanted it?  That is to act on the assumption that the principal Parties in this House will conduct their Parliamentary business in a responsible way.  We have all gone a long way to meet the Government during the emergency. We have given them wide powers to legislate without Parliamentary intervention at all, recognising that they require to conduct their executive work free from the obligation of regular attendance at debates in this Chamber.  As normalcy returns, would it not be a good thing if every body in this country felt that, in addition to having Parliament summoned to do Government business, if the Leaders of the principal Opposition Parties wanted Parliament summoned to consider business other than Government business the Head of the Government would feel an obligation upon himself to call Parliament at once, so that those responsible Parliamentary leaders might ventilate whatever difficulties or grievances they have, and have them discussed by the Legislature?  Surely that is the ideal way to run a Parliament?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Labour Party want Parliament to meet next week to discuss certain matters which to them appear vitally important.  In that week they do not want to take any Government time at all; the Government has given notice that it requires no time next week for the discussion of any business of its own.  Surely the Government does not want to declare it as its policy that it will not let this House meet at all except when the Government wants it to meet?  That <Col N="203" /> is what the attitude of the Tánaiste means at the present time.  I feel that, on reflection, the Government will wish to make it clear that that is not the case.  The Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Labour Party have formally asked that Parliament should meet next week.  Presumably they have done so with the consent of the members of their own Parties who find it just as difficult to come to town as do the back benchers of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I suggest that there is something approximating to a duty on the Leader of the Government to say: &ldquo;Certainly; if the members of the two principal Opposition Parties want Parliament to meet to discuss matters which they wish to raise, it will meet.  On every occasion that they want it to meet, it will meet, subject only to the consideration that Government business must be done. If the responsible Opposition leaders wish Parliament to be summoned, and it is possible to do so consistent with the carrying out of the executive functions of the Government, Parliament will be summoned so that they may ventilate their grievances in a constitutional way&rdquo;.  If people have not access to that method&mdash;and we may be profoundly grateful to Providence that in this country we have&mdash; the only other way is to go out on the streets and start a demonstration.</P>
    <P>We have a Parliament here, and it is unnecessary to start demonstrations in this country or to use violence while that instrument is here.  Withdraw that instrument from constitutional parties, and the people will find other instruments.  I believe in constitutional instruments.  I believe them to be better and more effective for all sections of the community.  The leaders of the two principal Opposition Parties apparently share that view, and are prepared to do their part to make such instruments work in this country.  I think the Government should make it quite clear that, in the effort to make such instruments work effectively, they are prepared to co-operate.  Now that the Tánaiste has an opportunity to alter the interim decision not to meet next week, Parliament <Col N="204" /> should be summoned not for Government business but for Opposition business, thus indicating to the country as a whole that the Government are prepared to attend here to do Opposition business so long as it does not interfere with the effective carrying on of the Government's normal work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving the adjournment of the debate yesterday, apart from calling attention to the provisions of Part III of this measure, I, as well as other speakers, had been discussing the general problem that this Bill is intended to meet, and the burden of the remarks I made yesterday and that I wish to make to-day, is that the general problem is not being met or attempted to be met by this measure.  Only one small angle of the housing difficulty is being met here. The fear here&mdash;a fear that has been expressed by most people&mdash;is that this is only a palliative and that, if and when this measure will go through, there will be a still further restriction on the private builder, and that means a still further gap in the housing problem of this country.  The fear is that there will be a greater restriction than heretofore on the activities of private builders, and Deputies are anxious to find out whether or not that is so.  Deputy Coogan, I think, did not seem to think that that gap existed, but I suggest that the history of the 1914-18 war bore that out, and that recent history has more than borne it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that this Bill aggravates the situation.  In the matter of the building of up-to-date houses, when you had certain restrictions on houses of a particular valuation, up to £30 and more, private building of houses ceased, or practically ceased; but we are now moving on a step further, where houses of £60 valuation will be controlled.  It is said that this measure does not apply to houses, the building of which did not commence after 1934. It is also said that this Bill is only an emergency measure, limited in extent to the year 1950.  Surely, the Minister will not have the hardihood to say that this Bill&mdash;taking into consideration the whole Rent Restrictions code&mdash;is <Col N="208" /> likely to disappear after 1950?  Everybody knows that it will not.  The fear was, with regard to those engaged in the building trade, that previously houses under the £30 or £35 valuation were not included, but that they are now being gathered in.  Now, definitely, the fear in the minds of those engaged in building operations, will be that all houses they built, as long as they are under the £50 valuation, will be gathered in when it comes to 1950. That, undoubtedly, is going to lead, in view of the experience of the past 20 years, to the disappearance of the private-enterprise builder from the field of operation represented by the building of houses up to the £60 valuation point.  That aggravates the difficulty.</P>
    <P>It has been fairly well established, and it was recognised in the report into the Housing of the Working Classes in the City of Dublin, 1939 to 1943, that, for many years, what was once regarded as a field for private enterprise&mdash;the building of cottages for labouring people or for what are called the &ldquo;working classes&rdquo;&mdash;had virtually ceased. Nevertheless, there was a field for the speculative builder in houses beyond £30 valuation.  That is now going to close down.  It means that those people who got that particular type of house of £60 valuation and under, are now going to be crowded into the same sort of area, and the same conditions will operate in connection with the new type of house as prevailed previously with the lower priced houses.  Private enterprise is going to be confined now to houses of the mansion type and big luxury type.  That is a serious departure. In England, prior to the war, four out of every five houses were built by private builders.  I am sure the Minister has statistics by which he would know the number of houses of from £20 or £30 valuation to £60 valuation erected by private builders. I think that is the problem we have to meet&mdash;that the private builder is not going to engage in the building of that type of house.  What is going to supply the gap?  Private builders not seeing sufficient profit to engage in this type of controlled house, are we to be thrown back to the position that the <Col N="209" /> new type of house will be taken in hands by the municipal authorities?  If that is so, the problem will be aggravated in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I have suggested that this matter must be considered in stages.  It is quite clear that from 1914-1918 private enterprise on a commercial basis had practically ceased in relation to houses for the working classes.  Are we to face the situation that some new body in a report in 1955 will say that the provision of houses of the controlled type, anything up to £60 valuation, by private builders had practically ceased since 1945?  If so, what is to be the situation?  Are the municipality going to have the provision of this type of house thrown on their shoulders, as well as the small type of house for what are called the &ldquo;working classes&rdquo;? We must consider speed in the building of sufficient houses.  It is only when you get a competitive market and more houses than there are applicants for that you can throw aside control and let competition operate.  The background of that argument is that if you had private enterprise meeting other people of an enterprising type, you might get down the price of houses, and you might have a better situation than that provided by the municipalities undertaking responsibility.  I doubt, as far as the lower income groups are concerned, if competitive builders will ever produce houses which can be let at the rents which these people could pay.  Some types of housing will have to be regarded as a service in the same way as primary education, the cost to be met by the ratepayers.  How far is that process to go on?  Are we to draw the line at houses rated at £30 or £40? Are we to look for some sort of subvention from the municipality?  Where will the municipality draw the line; where will they stop?</P>
    <P>That raises the other questions which have been ventilated in England but which were, apparently, not considered here.  I saw it stated by people in the building trade that there was no trade so fiercely &ldquo;ringed&rdquo; as the building trade.  One ex-Minister in England stated that everything even to the smallest article in connection with <Col N="210" /> building was zoned by big companies amongst themselves and that until these monopolies and cartels were broken materials would be dear.  That has not been the subject of much inquiry here and, certainly, there has been nothing done to break these rings if they exist.  In England, they decided on another method to meet their problem. They are attempting to make the way easy for those who desire to go in for house building on a big scale.  I think the figures have been varied from time to time, and that people have different views on them.  I have seen one calculation which shows that the numbers in the building trades in England ran to something in the neighbourhood of 1,000,000 before the war, and that that group had been reduced, through people being drafted into military service, to something below the 500,000 mark.  An attempt was, therefore, made to speed up the demobilisation of those engaged in the industry and to get the figure raised to 600,000 or 650,000.  A further approach was made to the trade unions on the other side, as there was going to be a very big field of enterprise opened in housing in England and they appealed to the trade unions to allow easier entry into the trades.  Young men were to be given special training for a brief period and, after another period under supervision, would be allowed to work with those properly qualified.  In that way, it was proposed to raise the number of building operatives to 1,000,000, and then to 1,250,000 or 1,750,000.  Of course, a drive will be made in England to get building operatives trained by this process to the extent of 500,000 or 750,000, and wages and conditions will be offered on the other side that are bound to attract those who have skill here.</P>
    <P>What are we doing?  I see nothing in the way of prevision, no indication of any approach to the trade unions&mdash; if there is a trade union problem here, which I doubt.  The only thing I saw was a laggard effort on the part of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who urged those concerned to take care to get as much Irish timber as they could for fear housing would be affected.  I described that as a laggard <Col N="211" /> effort.  I understand that, in order to make proper use of native timber, it should be felled and put under some seasoning process for a couple of years.  Here, when the rush is on, the Minister sends out a document telling people what they ought to do.  The British have a more aggravated problem, due to the demolition of houses.  They have purchased timber supplies with considerable difficulty. Deputy Byrne asked a question here to-day if we could not get some of the timber that recently came to England and the Minister said it was waste of time to apply for some.  The Minister for Finance told me in July of this year that we had purchased timber from Sweden under a purchase agreement based on the £ sterling.  I am glad to find that the realist of the Government has described it as a waste of time to think that we shall get any fraction of that timber, though the Minister for Finance is of a contrary opinion.  That is the situation. Our lack of prevision and of forethought in failing to keep our skilled building operatives in the country and our lack of forethought as regards getting supplies of timber and other building materials have brought about that situation, which is aggravated by the terrible position revealed in this housing report.</P>
    <P>I have often referred to that notable paragraph, paragraph 133, which speaks of the income level of certain families in the City of Dublin.  The report does more than that.  It relates this whole matter of houses to the rents which can be properly charged to people in these low-income classes. It takes 10,500 families as a sample of the 33,500 working-class families included in the earlier survey of 1938-39.  It says that the group chosen affords a good sample and indicates the incomes that those people had.  In paragraph 133, the report states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A general average over all the families, based on the mean of the foregoing ranges, would be 48/6 per week, but it will be more enlightening to note that 20 per cent. receive less than 20/- per week and can presumably pay no rent if they feed and <Col N="212" /> clothe themselves in even the most meagre fashion; 45½ per cent. receive under 40/- per week, 55 per cent. under 50/-, 67 per cent. under £3, and 84½ per cent. under £4.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Paragraph 134 had this conclusion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It will be necessary to examine similar figures taken from other sources and to inquire more closely into the rent-paying capacity attaching to these incomes, but it may be here observed that if we take the usual rent charged for a corporation four-roomed cottage, about 10/- per week, and if we assume an arbitrary proportion of one-fifth of income for rent, all those receiving under 50/- per week, 55 per cent. of the whole, are unable to pay the rent of a corporation cottage.  Even if we allow for those who could be accommodated in a three-roomed cottage at 7/6 per week and whose income should be 37/6 on the same basis we face the fact that 45½ per cent. receive under 40/- per week.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Paragraph 135 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is important to emphasise that the above calculations and deductions are based on an assumption of a continuity of the weekly earnings specified.  When we consider that there is no guarantee of this continuity, it will be realised that the situation would probably be even worse than we have stated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The proper comment to make on that paragraph is that those incomes had reference to the purchasing power which existed in the year 1938-9.  The purchasing power of those incomes has since been reduced by half.  When reference is made to people receiving £2 per week, we can take it that they are now receiving, in fact, £1, and that applies to 55 per cent. of the 33,000 families in question.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 136 concludes in this way:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Bearing in mind that the proportion of one-fifth income for rent is considered by many authorities to be too heavy; and that the corporation cottage rents are not the economic rents but rents rendered possible only by substantial rate and State subsidy, we begin to understand <Col N="213" /> where lies the real housing problem, to which the other difficulties are only subsidiary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister has dealt with only a small angle of this question.  He is dealing with a particular group of people.  His intention is to preserve those people during the period in which the Bill will operate from the extortions, as they are called, of the landlords.  This is really a Bill to prevent landlords from receiving a proper return on the money they have invested in their houses.  There is no doubt that, if there were no control, a number of them would look for more than a reasonable return.  But no builder will, in my opinion, in future, build houses of the type to which I have referred on the terms set out in the measure.  If that be the situation then, from the long-term point of view, the situation is not being relieved but is being aggravated.</P>
    <P>I cannot believe that this measure would be brought forward by one member of the Government unless other members of the Government who have their part to play in this housing problem had come to conclusions with him and unless they had plans, which we have not had revealed yet, for tackling the aspects of this matter which appertain to their Departments. I think that the fears expressed here are quite real and that the situation disclosed is a very serious one, indeed. The earlier part of this report speaks of the inadequacy of the efforts of private builders.  We are now taking a step to prevent private effort, no matter how inadequate it may have been in the past, providing for the low-income classes.  The effort of the private builder in relation to the low-income groups will disappear practically entirely in respect of houses of from £60 valuation downwards. Somebody will have to tell us what will be done to meet the new difficulty that the passing of this measure is bound to bring because there is going to be a difficulty.  The present Minister cannot simply wash his hands of responsibility by saying that he is attending to his small job in relation to the matter.  He must realise that the Bill is aggravating the other aspect <Col N="214" /> of the situation.  I should like if the Minister would let me know what private effort did in respect of houses of £30-£60 valuation in the 1932-39 period.  In addition, I should like the Minister to inform the House whether, having heard of the difficulties people have experienced in these matters, he has any thought of amending Part 3 of the measure, so as to cut out the provisional order and the application to a district justice and arrange for a situation wherein the application will be made in the first instance to the court which will decide the matter, through the channel of ordinary legal assistance, the Government providing the expenses of poor people who have to apply.</P>

      <P>My first duty is to welcome this Bill.  So long as a situation prevails in which the supply of houses for our people is altogether inadequate to meet the demand, there must be some form of State intervention and State control to protect the interests of those who seek housing accommodation. This Bill is a comprehensive measure to deal with the problem and will, accordingly, commend itself to the Dáil.  Much water has flown under the bridges since farmers were given the right to appeal to the court in respect of the fixing of fair rents on their holdings and it is equally desirable that our urban population, and our working population generally, should enjoy the same right &mdash; the right to appeal to a fair, judicial body and have just rents fixed.  I do not welcome the suggestion that this Bill will completely eliminate private enterprise as far as the building of houses under £60 valuation in the city and under £40 in the country is concerned.  I think that would be a very undesirable situation if it were to arise.  As far as possible, we should endeavour to encourage private enterprise, private builders and private firms to go ahead and produce to the utmost of their capacity. I do not think that the fixing of a judicial rent should automatically have the effect of eliminating the private builder.  In fixing rents the rights of all concerned, those who build houses, those who purchase them and those who have to live in them should, I <Col N="215" /> think, be carefully considered and no section of the community should be forced to suffer real injustice.  I know that the fixing of a judicial rent might impose financial loss on considerable sections of the community, that is, those who are charging excessive rents for the housing accommodation they have to offer but I think there should be enough private enterprise in this country to avail of the opportunity to earn a fair and just profit from their enterprise.  Such enterprise should be encouraged by this Bill.</P>
      <P>I also wholeheartedly approve of Part III of the Bill which seeks to afford to the small city dweller an opportunity of appealing to the courts without incurring any financial expense. I think that such a provision is absolutely necessary, but it is, as has been pointed out already, dependent for its success on the availability of a sufficient number of district justices or the allowance of sufficient time to the district justices to deal with the many cases which will arise.  I should like if the Minister would inform the House if provision will be made to assist our district justices in fixing fair rents, if they will be given guiding principles upon which to base their decisions, because naturally it must be recognised that the different forms of houses, flats and apartments of every kind vary to such an extent and the conditions under which they are held vary to such an extent that a very big problem will be presented to our district justices.  They are only ordinary human beings and they must be given at least assistance to the extent of having certain rules on which they can base their decisions.  It would be very undesirable to have decisions in one area perhaps altogether at variance with the decisions in another area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another omission from the Bill is the absence of any provisions to deal with the ban which is sometimes placed upon children in the letting of housing accommodation in the city and other urban areas.  I think such a ban should be made absolutely illegal.  There does <Col N="216" /> not seem to be any just reason why, in the average case, the owner of property should have a right to debar tenants from rearing children in the accommodation offered.  I think that such a ban is altogether anti-social.  It should be completely eliminated.  While I do not generally approve of the State making contracts entered into between citizens null and void, I think that a contract of tenancy in which there is a proviso that no children shall be kept in the accommodation offered, should be regarded as null and void and that a provision should be made in this Bill to that effect.</P>
    <P>I entirely agree that the real solution of our housing difficulties is to increase the production of houses and until that is done this Bill can only go a very short distance towards meeting the tremendous problem which faces us in regard to housing our people.  I believe that whatever assistance is given by the State to municipal authorities, to county councils and other bodies in the country, to engage in building programmes should also be made available to any private builder who wants to undertake building operations.  I think that local authorities and private firms should be placed upon exactly the same basis in that respect and that whatever steps can be taken to reduce housing costs or the costs of building material should be undertaken because there is no doubt whatever that the real cost of building houses in this country is altogether excessive.  We have in this country a considerable amount of the materials required &mdash; cement and materials of that kind.  They are produced here at home, not at an excessive price.  I think the State should give a lead in designing houses as far as possible in such a manner as to ensure that the cost would be cut to the very lowest minimum. As this is an enterprise in which the State is involved and to which the State has to contribute a very considerable amount of the money required, steps of the most effective and energetic nature should be taken to ensure that there is no profiteering either in the building of the houses or in the production or distribution of the building materials.  I ask the Minister <Col N="217" /> to look particularly into the point which I have raised in regard to the provisions of tenancy contracts which debar children in houses or flats.  I ask him to ensure, as far as possible, that where the private individual undertakes building operations, he will be given fair play.  Finally, I ask him to ensure that there will be expedition in dealing with the many cases which will be brought before our courts in regard to the fixing of rents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We were told during the debate that the policy behind this Bill is a policy of control and that it would interfere with the building of houses for renting by private enterprise and would have the effect of stopping it. We were also told that the policy of the 1926 Act was decontrol and that, therefore, that Act should have encouraged the building of houses for renting.  I am in a position to know the number of houses that were rented of the houses that were built in the district in Dublin in which the greatest number of houses were built.  In the four years from 1926 to 1930 of the new houses that were built in the Clontarf district only two houses were rented. That would not appear to prove that the policy of decontrol in the 1926 Act encouraged the building of houses for renting.  If it had encouraged such building, why did the Government of the day, in 1928, discontinue the policy of decontrol and control houses of £30 and £25 valuation?  It is a fact that under the 1928 Act they controlled rents.  As a matter of fact, in the period of 1936 to 1940, to my knowledge, more newly built houses were rented than were rented at any period since the first world war.  As far as I understand the position, more controlled houses were rented than new houses.  Therefore I do not think that the control exercisable under this Bill will have any appreciable effect on the building of houses for renting.  That is my view at any rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were also told that because of the introduction of this Bill builders will be afraid to build houses for renting because the houses will be controlled. This is the first interference <Col N="218" /> with the Rent Restrictions Act that has occurred during the term of office of this Government and it has been brought about by the fact that there has been a second world war which lasted six years, and that the position in regard to housing has become so acute that control was absolutely necessary in order to prevent people from being fleeced by the imposition of exorbitant rents.  The position is, undoubtedly, more acute than it has ever been and there is absolute necessity for the Bill.  That is the fact that must be faced, irrespective of the problems that arise in connection with its effect on the building of houses. We have to face the fact that there is urgent necessity for this Bill.</P>
    <P>The codification of the rent restrictions law in this Bill has simplified the law in this matter.  As a layman, I have found it far easier to understand the position of rent control under this Bill and I think the Minister is to be congratulated in this respect.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to Part II of the Act. I understand that that is meant to apply to tenements.  As I read it, I do not think, as it stands, it will apply to tenements unless the tenant gets a separate valuation apportioned by the Commissioner of Valuations.  Perhaps I am wrong, but that is my view and, if that is so, I think the cost involved would nullify the benefits of the Act in respect of those poor people.  I would ask the Minister to consider that point.  I approve of the idea of going to the clerk of the court rather than to the court itself because, to the minds of these poor people, going to court represents something to be paid out either by way of fine or as lawyer's fee and, therefore, they would dislike the idea of going before the justice in the first instance.  The question of queuing that was mentioned here yesterday is, I think, merely a matter of organisation that can surely be got over.  It certainly is not any reason why the idea in the Bill should be abandoned.</P>
    <P>Taking the Bill as a whole, I think it is an honest attempt to deal fairly with all parties.  I believe that under <Col N="219" /> the Bill the relative positions of landlord and tenant will become better known and that both parties will be put in a better position to have their just rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, and anybody who has anything to do with the rent code will welcome it.  The former rent legislation was, obviously, out of date and it was open to every landlord, if particulars were demanded of him by a tenant, to say that he had no records.  It is impossible for tenants at the present time to prove the letting value or the standard rent or the rent payable on the 3rd August, 1914.  Therefore, it is time that something was done to bring the law up to date in that matter.</P>
      <P>There is one matter, however, in the Bill against which I wish to protest. The Bill does not deal with the greatest landlords in the country, the local authorities.  The Minister, possibly, may give some reasons as to why local authorities are excluded from the provisions of this Bill just as they are excluded from all legislation of this kind.  It may be suggested that local authorities are such model landlords that there is no necessity to control them in any way.  At the present moment in the town of Westport, County Mayo, there are over 100 tenants under notice to quit by the local authority.  These tenants are in occupation of houses at rents ranging from 5/3 to 8/3 per week.  The houses were built under the 1932 code and the tenants went into them in various years from 1932 to 1938.  I do not know why all the different rents are being charged.  In some cases it is 10/-; in some, 14/-; in some, 5/- and in others, 8/-, and there is one gentleman having the distinction of having a rent of his own of 6/6 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite clear at all events that 70 or 80 of these houses were built under what is called the two-thirds subsidy scheme, the two-thirds State grant, or two-thirds financing from the Commissioners of Public Works. However these rents were arrived at, it is clear that these tenants have been paying the same rents since they went <Col N="220" /> into these houses.  After being for different periods in these houses they are now confronted with a demand from the local authority to add on the current rate to their rents, thereby increasing their rents by from 5d. to 1/2.  The original rent when it was assessed on them was the figure set out in the different agreements and I believe that rates were taken into consideration at that time.  Whether or not they were taken into consideration in arriving at the rents which should be fixed for these houses, the local authority got these tenants to sign an agreement which specified that the local authority would be responsible for all rates payable out of these premises.  I have one of the agreements affecting one of these houses before me and Clause 9 of that agreement sets out that &ldquo;the council shall be responsible for all rates in respect of the said dwellinghouse and premises&rdquo;.  Here were tenants who were allowed into these houses by the local authority at what amounts to a fixed rent set out in their agreements by that local authority which now comes along ten years after the letting is made and endeavours to increase these rents and put the rates assessed on the premises on to the tenants.</P>
    <P>They possibly will suggest that it might have been <i>ultra vires</i> the local authority originally to charge rates but that the varying amounts of the rates from year to year should have been added on to these tenants' rents. At all events, the position is that tenants were put into these houses and given to understand that they had this fixed rent to pay.  Irrespective of Emergency Powers Orders or any other Orders, the local authority is now increasing these rents by amounts varying from 5d. to 1/2 per week. Under the Small Dwellings Act, 1928, rates payable by tenants to their landlords in the cases affected by these Acts would be termed rent.  These rates, whether termed rent or not, mean in fact an increase of rent on these unfortunate tenants.  What is the remedy for these tenants?  Notices to quit have been served upon them. They have no protection from any <Col N="221" /> source whatever because, if they do go into court, they are not protected by the Increase of Rents Acts.  They are specifically excluded from them; they are specifically excluded from the Emergency Powers Order controlling rents in this country, and it is proposed specifically to exclude them under the terms of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Formerly members of local authorities, if there was any injustice being done to a section of the people in connection with their rents, had the power to put matters right.  Members of local authorities have no such power now.  It is a matter that would be dealt with solely by the county manager or the town clerk.  Very often an efficiency expert, wherever the merits of a case may lie, will say that he is entitled to take a particular line of action.  He may not be swayed by considerations that would affect local representatives.  I see no reason for excluding local authorities from the provisions of this Bill.  If the Minister says that matters dealt with by the Bill would not arise with local authorities, or that the county managers concerned or the local authorities concerned would not do anything wrong in the way of charging extortionate rents or of making profits out of rents, then I say there is no reason why they should not be controlled because the tenants concerned would not have to take advantage of that control.  On the other hand, if tenants are liable to suffer hardships, I do not see why the local authority should be excluded from the provisions of the Bill.  If the Minister examines the matter, I am sure he will find that local authorities throughout the country &mdash; I do not know what the position is in the city &mdash; are the people concerned with practically all the houses available in the local towns.</P>
    <P>In the particular cases in Westport which I have before me, the local authority proposes to make a profit out of the rents, because the original rent that they assessed did, I understand, include some portion for rates.  They now want to get the rates on the double &mdash; the amount that was included <Col N="222" /> as the original estimate of the rates and the current rent payable.  It is obvious that the rates of local authorities will be increasing year by year as the social services are extended and that the amount of rates to be raised will be higher.  It is therefore obvious that this great body of people who are housed by local authorities, if the rates are pushed on to them, will be meeting an increased rent year by year with the increase in the rates.  I think it is an extraordinary state of affairs that these tenants should be left high and dry once that notice to quit is served upon them.  There is nothing to prevent the county manager or the local authority firing out these 120 tenants in Westport in the morning, notwithstanding the fact that there is a written agreement with the local authority in existence providing that the local authority have to pay the rates on these houses; that they are in a position under the law to hold a legal gun to the head of these unfortunate tenants and say: &ldquo;Unless you agree to this, no matter how unjust it is, no matter how wrong it is, out you go.  You have no business going to the court because the law provides, simply because the local authority is the landlord, that these houses are outside this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is another difficulty that arises in connection with local authorities being landlords.  Under the old Housing of the Working Classes code, there was a provision under which the tenant could purchase out his house.  That code also provided that those houses were excluded from the Increase of Rents Acts and it is also proposed to exclude them under this particular Bill.  I know several of those houses which were purchased out by the tenant, or rather where the tenant got into bad circumstances and was about to lose his house when some local individual with money came along to him, paid the amount in his name to the local authority and got what amounts to the fee simple of the house, subject to a perpetual annuity of, I think, £1.  By this individual advancing the money to the tenant to purchase out, he acquired a house which he <Col N="223" /> could let at any figure he liked, since, as I say, &ldquo;once within these Acts always within them.&rdquo;  These houses are specifically outside the control, as they were built under this particular code. Once they became the property of the tenant &mdash; and in nine cases out of ten that happened only when someone exploited the tenant &mdash; and were acquired by the exploiter, he could let the house at any figure he wished.  I know several which were so acquired by exploiting the tenant and so let and which have been decontrolled.  I cannot see why that should continue under this particular code.  I cannot see why local authorities should be excluded nor why the tenants of local authorities should not be entitled to some protection, in the same way as their neighbours who were tenants under outside landlords.</P>
    <P>There are some other matters in this Bill with which I am not quite satisfied, but it will be better for me to defer dealing with them until the Committee Stage. Generally, I welcome the principles of the Bill, though I strongly object to local authorities being able to take action such as the Westport Urban Council is taking at present.  I hope the Minister will see that, before the final stages of this Bill are reached, provision will be made whereby tenants cannot be exploited in such a way by any local authorities, whether they be inefficient or otherwise.</P>

      <P>It does seem somewhat peculiar to discuss the problem of rents and rent control without having regard, as Deputy McGilligan says, to the whole housing problem.  Even if we leave aside the last five years of emergency, it has been recognised by many thoughtful people that there was a solution of the housing problem possible in this country, given acceptance of certain basic conditions.  The housing problem is something more than merely a commercial proposition in which some people can invest their money, either in financing building, or as builders or, taking it from the point of view of <Col N="224" /> my Party, as those who earn their livelihood in this way.  Housing is the provision of a national service, in the same way as the other fundamental things to which the citizen is entitled by virtue of his citizenship.</P>
      <P>One of the chief defects we have to face in our whole social outlook, one which is markedly shown in our Constitution, is that the two basic needs in life which should be guaranteed to our citizens by the community and the State, namely, employment and a home, are not governed by any guarantee whatever, nor is any definite provision made in respect to these two basic factors, without which one cannot really be a citizen.  All the physical and financial resources of the State should have been directed towards finding a solution of the housing problem within a reasonably short period.  It is quite fair for the Government to excuse itself during the past five years.  It is equally fair for it to say that, during the previous eight or ten years, they did make a more sharp attempt to deal with the problem than was done up to then. During the ten years immediately prior to this war there was an increase in the rate of housing, especially in Dublin, where the main burden of the problem is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even during the most happy period of that so-called intense building in Dublin, in the provision of houses for those most urgently in need&mdash;that is, the 40,000 families living in conditions condemned by all experts on public health and sanitary conditions &mdash; we never attained a figure in excess of 2,000 houses per year.  However good the intentions of the Government may have been, it is clear that the actual results fell very far short of what was required.  It is doubtful if the provision of houses for working-class families in Dublin during those ten years exceeded to any great extent the ordinary replacements required year by year for a city of the size of Dublin. Certainly, we do not seem to have made any drastic inroads on the figure that has existed in Dublin for the past 30 years, showing the number of <Col N="225" /> families living in insanitary conditions. I remember that, as far back as 1930, the Dublin Corporation had 12,000 families listed as complying with all their rigid requirements for housing accommodation.  Yet, if you went, in 1939 or 1940, nine years later, to the Housing Department of the Dublin Corporation you would still find the same figures there, despite the building activity during the previous nine years.  To-day, after six years of a standstill in the building trade, that figure is still there, although the Dublin Corporation, to its credit, maintained a higher rate of building than was attained in the whole of England during the same period.  During the past six years the number awaiting accommodation through the corporation has grown to outrageous proportions and is probably beyond handling under existing conditions.</P>
    <P>Since the problem is there and since rent control is part of that problem, there is no reason why we should not welcome any effort made to deal with one of its worst features.  It is true that overcrowding, dangerous and insanitary buildings, the crowding in of persons suffering from tuberculosis with healthy people, the mixing of sexes without any privacy, the lack of the ordinary decencies of life, are some of the ordinary things that immediately strike our eyes; but back of that is the problem of rent, translated into the share of the income of the family that comes in and the amount required for food, clothes and other necessities, now denied to the family because of the amount of rent they have to pay.  I believe it is correct to welcome this Bill and to say that, even if it has defects, we should try to accept it, at least as a measure towards dealing with the immediate problem of rent.</P>
    <P>At the same time, we should not lose sight of the bigger problem.  As Deputy Colley says, I do not think it is sufficient.  This is the first effort by the present Government to deal with the control of rent and it has been brought in really as an urgent emergency matter, because of our experience during the past five years. This Bill was just as necessary in 1939 <Col N="226" /> as it is in 1945.  Indeed, the problem has become a little more urgent.  It was just as necessary in 1930 as in 1939. It has been as necessary in the City of Dublin and in most of our towns during the past 50 years as it is to-day.</P>
    <P>This problem of rents and the relationship of rent to income is not one that has arisen merely during the last six years or that arose merely during the four years of the last war: it has always been with us and will continue so, as long as there are insufficient houses for the number of people requiring them.  It will continue as long as we have people prepared to invest their money in house property and utilise that property, not for ordinary, straightforward, commercial purposes, but as a rack and screw to squeeze out of the unfortunate people the absolute limit they can secure in obtaining a return on the money invested.  That is why the problem of rent is so urgent and so desperate that, even though we recognise this Bill is only tinkering with the larger housing problem, we should not hesitate for a moment to take advantage of the effort of the Government in this direction, but should use it to the utmost advantage, to see to what extent we can give the benefit of this legislation to the people who are in urgent need to-day.  The housing problem is not insoluble.  It does, however, require an approach that apparently this Government is not prepared to make and, until we get some change of heart, there is no use in expecting any great strides to be made in the provision of houses.</P>
    <P>Expression has been given in the House to certain fears as to the effect of this extension of control on the activities of private builders.  I have heard the experiences not only of people up against the paying of excessive rents but &mdash; and it is an experience common to most people in the Dublin area &mdash; of people trying to get a house to rent.  I would be glad to know where, during the past 25 years, private builders have erected houses and rented them to ordinary working-class or small middle-class families at a rent which those families could pay. So far as I am aware, within recent years the only efforts made by private <Col N="227" /> builders to provide small scale houses were those made out in Crumlin by the Dublin Artisans Dwellings Company. They are operating there on a system of tenant purchase.  The houses are small and the rents are largely within the means of higher-paid tradesmen.</P>
    <P>Taking Dublin generally, so far as private builders are concerned they have not catered for families desiring to rent houses and it would seem they have no intention of doing so.  Many families prepared to pay rents for houses up to a valuation of £40 cannot get such a house to rent.  There are many families prepared to enter into financial arrangements so as to purchase a house suitable for their needs. On the other hand, there are families with strictly limited means and they are obliged to pay rent and very often they are victimised and squeezed and squeezed to an extent that leaves them in financial difficulty.  There is no provision at all for the erection of houses for families of that type, at a rent which they can afford to pay.  In some instances house owners consider that renting the house is a better investment than selling it.</P>
    <P>From that point of view, I do not believe that extended control, or a more rigid enforcement of control, will affect in any vital way the provision of houses by private builders.  I think the erection of houses by private builders will continue and the houses will be erected mainly for the purposes of sale.  Builders will take advantage of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act and they will utilise local authorities as a cheap source of finance for the building of houses which will be for them purely a commercial speculation. That type of thing will continue and I do not think we need worry very much about it.</P>
    <P>The main problem in regard to the provision of houses will rest with the local authorities.  We are up against the problem of how the local authorities will cater not only for the smaller type of house which can be let at a reasonable rent to working-class families, but also for the type of house &mdash; and this is a problem which has <Col N="228" /> developed sharply in Dublin &mdash; which can be rented to the families of such people as tradesmen, clerks, civil servants of the lower grades and Gárdaí. That is the type of problem which has to be tackled by the local authorities. If they are going to operate on a basis which will allow them to let those houses at rents within the means of the different groups I have referred to, then I feel we shall have to look at this matter from another angle.</P>
    <P>The experience of the Dublin Corporation has been that it would be a physical impossibility to let houses as a sound commercial proposition, and at a rent within the means of the average tenant, unless there is a large subsidy paid by the State or by the corporation.  So far as the prices paid in connection with Dublin housing schemes are concerned, various considerations arise.  There was a statement made by Deputy McGilligan with reference to English housing schemes. He said that the building trade there is largely controlled by rings.  That may not be borne out exactly here, but there is a close parallel.</P>
    <P>Some three years before the war the Dublin Corporation carried out a building experiment.  The scheme was a success, not only in relation to the type of house and the quality of the building, but also on the basis of cost.  That experiment could be of the utmost value to local authorities.  Those figures could have been closely examined and made the basis of future schemes and consideration could be given to direct labour as a means of reducing the cost, but to-day, some nine years after the scheme was carried out, there are still arguments in the corporation as to cost.  In other words, the direct labour factor will be killed before it gets a chance of justifying itself.</P>
    <P>We should welcome this Bill and be careful to see that we do not leave loopholes or loose phrasing in its provisions because such things might give rise to considerable difficulties.  One of the main difficulties about legislation that we have passed, dealing with various forms of social amelioration, is that somewhere throughout that legislation there has been some laxity either <Col N="229" /> on the part of those who drafted it or members of the House charged with the examination of it, and various little things have slipped out which have caused difficulty and suffering on the part of people anxious to take advantage of our Acts.</P>
    <P>There is one matter which I should like to emphasise.  There is not a sufficient approach in the Bill to the position of furnished rooms, furnished apartments.  I think a more rigid definition should be introduced so as to give protection to those people who in one sense are complete outcasts.  Whatever protection the tenant of a house or unfurnished apartment may have, the tenant of the furnished flat is in a most unfortunate position.  These people feel the strain.  Very often there are newly-married couples who may have small savings.  They are forced into this type of habitation because they cannot get any other place in which to set up a home.  They are there from week to week, completely at the mercy of the landlord, and so high are the rents for what are little better than glorified bug boxes, they never get a chance of putting money by so that they can lift themselves out of that particular condition and hope to obtain an unfurnished apartment or, if they are lucky, a small house.  That problem should be more closely examined and particular attention should be paid to it on the next stage.</P>
    <P>I notice also that it is proposed that the Act will not apply to houses which are converted into tenements in a <i>bona fide</i> fashion on and after a certain date.  That, I think, is one of the greatest difficulties we have to deal with in the larger cities, and I am speaking not only of Dublin.  There has been carried on over a period of years a deliberate and consistent policy by certain groups of people of taking over large houses, very often at comparatively low purchase prices, turning them into flats, and, within a period of two to three years, getting back the whole of their capital and such moneys as they may have expended on the conversion of the houses.  Even though it may be suggested that to bring these houses within the scope of the Bill will place <Col N="230" /> certain restrictions on that kind of activity, I think it is an activity which requires to be most closely examined.</P>
    <P>There are certain areas in Dublin where, in recent years, that form of activity has spread almost like a sore. It started in Mountjoy Square and went right around the square.  Houses were bought for £300 or £400, turned into flats or rooms, and, out of one house bought for £300, an income of up to £400 a year taken.  The disease has spread to the south side and you find house after house along such streets as Baggot Street and Mount Street, and in certain sections of Merrion Square, also falling under the same objectionable system.  If this is to continue, as it will so long as we have not got sufficient houses for the people, why should these people not be afforded the protection of the control we propose in this measure?</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan referred to one very difficult problem, that is, the objection put forward in the letting of rooms and apartments to people having children. I do not know whether the Minister can find a way of dealing with this problem.  I am quite sure he recognises that it is a big problem, that it is not merely a problem of rent but a vital social problem and one which is having tremendous and dire effects on hundreds of people entering into married life, who very shortly after setting up homes suddenly find that the very duty they are called on to fulfil as citizens of the State, that is, to raise and maintain a family and contribute to the continuance of the race is the cause of their being put out on the side of the road.</P>
    <P>You can see what the implications are.  Surely we can find some way, if we apply our minds to the problem, of inserting in this Bill some form of protection for these people or some form of condition which would prevent this being utilised as a means of throwing people out on the side of the road.  Trying to find places for young married couples with one or two children when they have been put out of the rooms or flats they occupied has become a regular and persistent job week after <Col N="231" /> week.  It is a problem which cannot be ignored year after year.</P>

      <P>Whether it is legal or not is not the problem.  What we are dealing with is a human problem. It is quite true that a family is not told that they must get out because they have two children, but the children are the reason they are put out, although, so far as the law is concerned, they may be put out because they cause disturbance or annoyance.  That is a recognised position and anybody who lives in Dublin or other large cities knows very well that families with children are not wanted, that people who go in newly-married, and who in the course of time have families, are very soon not wanted.  There is a public outcry developing, especially in the cities, against this condition of affairs which has grown up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is bad enough for people with one or two children to find that they are suddenly no longer wanted in the flat in which they have been living for some years because children have arrived since they went there and apparently cause some annoyance, but how much more difficult is it for people who are faced with the problem of getting accommodation and who are politely told that because they have five or six children they are not wanted?  I know that that is not the problem we are dealing with in the Bill, because they are already on the street, but it starts with the coming of the children. A whole vicious system grows up and becomes one of these vicious spirals about which we hear so much in relation to prices and wages.  This is a far <Col N="232" /> more vicious spiral because it is a spiral around the bodies of children and the whole future of the Irish race.</P>
    <P>A question was raised by one Deputy as to whether we could possibly bring Part III out of the orbit of the ordinary court.  I do not know what the experience of other Deputies is, but my experience of the ordinary citizen, the ordinary working man or woman, is that he goes into a kind of trance when he comes near anything which has to do with courts or solicitors or barristers.  I do not know whether he is justified or not, but that is his reaction.  Even when dealing with the old Rent Acts, when you tried to explain in a very simple way how a tenant could secure legal redress of grievances, you immediately came up against the problem.  As soon as you mentioned solicitors or courts, they sheered off and decided to put up with the trouble.</P>
    <P>Would it not be possible, in so far as the first stage envisaged in Part III, the making of a provisional order, is concerned, to have it done by some other form of tribunal or by some officer not in the immediate vicinity of the court? It is merely a declaration and there is provision in this Part of the Bill for a review of that declaration in a more judicial manner.  Once, however, the tenant takes advantage of the provisions of the measure to the extent of getting a provisional order, this fear of becoming involved in the meshes of the law, in expensive legal costs and in matters which he cannot comprehend, would be broken down and afterwards the ordinary judicial procedure could go ahead, especially when there is provision for dealing with the main problem of the average tenant, that is, the problem of how to find the money to secure his rights under any form of rent control.</P>
    <P>If these particular points could be given further consideration and if we could get improvement and tightening up on the next stage, we will have done something valuable.  To the extent to which the terms of the Bill are popularised and made known to the general mass of tenants, to the extent to which they are made fully <Col N="233" /> aware, in simple language, not only of the provisions of the Bill, but of how to go about seeking the protection of the Bill and of where to make their claims, we shall have dealt, if not with the housing problem as a whole, at least with one of the most burning questions in relation to it in the bigger cities and towns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Rent Restrictions Bill, and, like any matter which touches on rent, it has repercussions on the whole housing problem. Almost every speaker has spoken about that problem, which is the kernel of the whole situation.  We are suffering from a shortage of houses in Dublin, and more or less in the whole of Ireland.  If we had more houses the necessity for rent restrictions would probably, in the main, disappear, but that situation unfortunately does not exist, and it is necessary to see that justice is done to the tenant and also that justice is done to the landlord. Not all landlords are rapacious.  Some of them are benevolent institutions, old widows, and so on.  It does not essentially matter what class of landlord you are dealing with.  It is the rent that the house gets is the important thing.  To-day we have tenants who would pay almost any price to get into a house or a room. Those people have to be protected from themselves as well as from certain types of landlords.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One may say that, in the main, there is nothing very new in this Bill.  It is mainly a codification Bill.  For that reason we are all glad to see the 1923 Act, the 1926 Act and Emergency Powers Order 313 merged into one Bill.  We hope that this codification will make a very complicated matter perhaps a shade less complicated.  It is Part III of the Bill which is really bringing about a change.  We are all glad to see that the very poor section of the population will receive a form of protection which they have not had in the past.  As other Deputies have said, I wonder whether the machinery envisaged in the Bill is not too cumbersome. Will the district justices be able to deal with it, and will their clerks, in the main, be competent to <Col N="234" /> deal with it?  As regards the valuers to be appointed, I presume the Minister has in mind valuers who will be competent.  What I am thinking of is that there may be so many valuers required for the operation of this measure that it may be difficult to find men who have the necessary qualifications. I imagine, however, that the Minister will look into that.</P>
    <P>Since the circulation of the Bill a number of people have come to me to ask if the definition of the word &ldquo;premises&rdquo; covers a tenement room. I think it does, because it seems to refer to the word &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; in a sub-section of the definition.  Several people, as I have said, have raised the matter with me.  It is one which we can discuss more fully on the Committee Stage.  One may say that the general question of housing is one of the most complicated things which any legislature has to consider to-day. There is a shortage of houses.  We all know that very little building has been done during the last six years.  There is not only a shortage of houses to rent, but a shortage of houses to sell. The shortage of houses to rent is one of the reasons why rent restriction is necessary at all.  One of the reasons for that is that the number of houses which it pays the owner to rent are getting fewer and fewer.  Some people are afraid that this Bill will interfere with building.  I fervently hope that it will not.  But I do say that this Bill is not going to help building.  Rent restriction and rent controls have unfortunately played a part in restricting the number of houses that come on the market for renting.  Rent restriction and rent control are necessary. While we must have them to protect the tenant, we must not blind ourselves to the fact that they do not help the ultimate question, which is to provide as many houses as possible. I have no solution for that dilemma, but it exists.  For some years now, as regards a house of almost any valuation, it would not pay either the builder of it to let it, or the man who might buy it from him for the purpose of letting.  Of course, a builder can very seldom afford to build houses to rent.  He usually has to get quick <Col N="235" /> sale for the houses he builds.  In the past, builders used very often sell their houses to members of the public who wished to invest their money in house property.  Those men in turn set the houses to tenants, but within the past 25 years or so that has become very rare, because the cost of the houses was such that tenants could not pay a price which would in any way remunerate the landlord.  Therefore, the houses that were open for renting were mainly those which had been built a long time ago, houses bought at a comparatively low price. That situation has become more and more common.</P>
    <P>During the last six years any tenanted house on becoming vacant was immediately put up for sale.  It was sold whether it was a controlled house, a decontrolled house or a house outside all control.  The house was so valuable with vacant possession that no tenant could afford to pay a rent which would remunerate the landlord for the sum of money he had spent in buying it.  Therefore you had a situation in which you had less and less houses becoming available to members of the public who wanted to rent them. It is not every family that can afford to buy a house.  Young people starting out in life cannot, as a rule, do so, because they have not got the necessary capital.  Even in a great number of cases they are not prepared to go to a building society to get an advance of money to enable them to buy.  Therefore one may say that, ultimately, it is not in the public interest that rented houses should disappear.  We cannot, however, close our eyes to the fact that they are disappearing very rapidly around Dublin, and I am sure that much the same situation obtains throughout the country.  The only remedy for it is the provision of more houses and cheaper houses, but we know that with the present shortage of supplies we cannot do very much in that direction.  I would like to say that, in the main, I welcome this Bill, and hope that it will not have the effect of hindering building, because that would be a very serious matter.  I am inclined to think it will not hinder building, but it certainly will not be any assistance to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>It was inevitable in discussing this Bill that the general problem of housing should arise, but, as Deputy McGilligan said, it was only with an angle of the problem I had to deal in this Bill.  I do not propose to intrude on the province of the Minister for Local Government, to whom is assigned the task of dealing with the housing problem.  I do admit, of course, that there is a matter of collective responsibility there, and that every member of the Government must take his share of that responsibility. Nevertheless, it is a well-recognised policy here that certain aspects of certain problems are assigned to certain Ministers, and it is with the question of rents and rent control I am dealing here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason this Bill was brought in at all was that, as Deputies have already been reminded, practically every year up to 1930 a Bill was introduced dealing with rent restrictions.  It was hoped by the late Government that rent control could be disposed of gradually; that each year the valuation of protected houses could be reduced, until finally it was hoped that by 1929 it would disappear altogether, and that as a result there would be a large increase in building.  The Government of the day saw that that was not happening, and in 1928, when the control level had reached £30 for Dublin and £25 for outside it, they brought in a Bill stabilising it at that, and kept repeating that measure every year, until finally, in 1930 it was relegated to the category of Expiring Laws Bills.  That was not satisfactory, and I imagine that a more permanent Bill would have been introduced much earlier if it had not been for the fact that the Town Tenants Tribunal was inquiring into the whole question, and it would not have been proper to bring in a Bill until their report had been made.  As everyone knows, there were great differences of opinion expressed by the different members of that tribunal&mdash;some of them were diametrically opposed to others &mdash; but certain things were agreed on, and my Department in due course presented a Bill dealing with matters which had been more or less agreed upon by the tribunal, <Col N="237" /> although not exactly in the form in which they had recommended them.</P>
    <P>Then it occurred to me anyway that it would be a bad thing to have another Rent Restrictions (Amending) Act, we had so many already. Being a layman, and not liking legislation by reference, I said that I would prefer to have the whole of the rent restrictions code put into one Act, so that we would not have to be referring from Act to Act.  Consequently, that was undertaken.  Then came the new control under the Emergency Powers Order made last year.  I do not think any great harm has been done to people who want to build houses, because the Emergency Powers Order applies only to houses which were built prior to February, 1944.  Of course everyone knows that houses built after 1919 were not controlled in the original Acts, and anyone who did build houses for rent between that and the making of the Emergency Powers Order got an economic rent.  I think there was no question about that.  I was very hesitant to bring in any Rent Restrictions Order until I was satisfied that there was a very definite move in the direction of profiteering.  There was abundant evidence presented to me that landlords were undoubtedly serving people whose salaries and wages had been subject to the Standstill Order with notices to quit if they did not pay substantial increases of rent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>And there was no defence against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no defence, and nobody in this House or the other House made any objection to the making of that Order.  We had that Order as well as those different Acts, and the best thing to do was to incorporate that also in this particular Bill. There does not appear to me at any rate to be any prospect of anything like a big building programme within five years.  I do not think there is, but, if there is, the question can be tackled again within five years.  At any rate, it must be dealt with at the end of five years, when, let us hope, there will be a better chance of proceeding with building.  I cannot for the life of me see how the Bill can <Col N="238" /> affect any building that may be going on.  It was put to me by the representatives of a society which has done very good work in building houses for rent here, the Associated Properties Company, that if this Emergency Powers Order were not amended to exclude houses which were built under emergency conditions, when the prices of materials had gone up, they would have to stop building immediately.  On going into that question, I was quite satisfied that that was so, and that it was reasonable that any houses built under the new conditions should not be subject to the Emergency Powers Order, so they were excluded.  Everyone must understand and admit that their prices are higher, and, therefore, if people are to build as an investment &mdash;as far as I know, that society gets only a moderate return on its investment&mdash;they will have to be allowed to charge a figure which will give them some return on their investment. Otherwise, of course, there would be no such thing as building.  That amendment was brought in and is now incorporated in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The matter dealt with in Part III dealing with poor tenants is the most important one, but there is another very important change in the 1923 Act cases, as they are called, and that is in regard to the determination of the rent.  Where it was impossible or very difficult to ascertain the actual rent paid in 1914, we are now providing another method.  I think that will be found to be a big improvement.  Other smaller things which were suggested by that tribunal have been brought in too, but the big thing that is new in this Bill is the part I have mentioned, that is Part III.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not certain, of course, that the proposals which I have laid down in the Bill are the very best that can be devised.  If Deputies, on the Committee Stage, are able to suggest a better scheme &mdash; something that they think will work better&mdash;I have an open mind on the matter, and am prepared to consider it, but I think it would be very hard to beat the scheme proposed in the Bill.  I know it is true that, as has been said here, people feel a good deal of trepidation when they have to meet anyone in the legal <Col N="239" /> business, but some way will have to be found to overcome that.  In the Saint Vincent de Paul Society there is a legal section which is prepared to help those people.  I think some way will be found to get over the reluctance of people who have a case. Going to the clerk's office should not be a very difficult thing.  During the debate yesterday, someone suggested that it would be better if they made their application in writing, but I think a lot of people of the type that will be involved in those cases would prefer to go in person.  They are not the best in the world at putting things in writing.  Moreover, they might not make a full statement, and, at an interview, the clerk would have an opportunity of asking them questions. However, as I said, if a better scheme can be hammered out here on the Committee Stage, I am prepared to consider it.</P>
    <P>I think no one will suggest that there is anything of a Party nature in this.  It is a matter of common concern to everybody, in spite of what Deputy Dillon said about the small fellow and about there being more small people than big people and that, therefore, you will get more support. That is not so.  Everybody, I am sure, is concerned with the solution of this problem and will do the best he can to bring about its solution.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan spoke about &ldquo;rings&rdquo; being in operation.  I do not know about that, and in any case it would not be within my province.  That would be a matter for another Department. I might be tempted to go into it, but it is not my end of things. I could not understand Deputy Costello.  At one time, he seemed to say that it was necessary to have a Bill of this kind to prevent landlords from charging exorbitant rents, and then he said that it was dangerous, as it might prevent building.  You cannot have it both ways, and if something of this kind is not done, then there is nothing to stop people charging any rent they wish.  Unfortunately, due to <Col N="240" /> the shortage of housing accommodation, people are willing to pay higher rents than they would be willing to pay normally, and then, if they find themselves unable to pay and are thrown out, others would be coming along and agreeing to pay the same, or even a higher rent, and then find themselves unable to pay the rent they had agreed to pay.  As a result, you would have an intolerable situation, and I suggest that there is no good in complicating the problem by bringing in all these forebodings, which ought not to be brought into a Bill of this kind.  This is only dealing with the existing law and codifying it. It is merely trying to make better provisions for speedy and cheap access to the courts for those who feel that they have paid too high a rent.  That is all that this Bill is doing.</P>
    <P>I think that a lot of the points that have been raised by various speakers could be better dealt with in Committee. Take the question of furnished lettings&mdash;flats or whatever they might be.  I had inquiries made into this whole question, so far as I could.  I admit that, perhaps, I had not the same means of inquiry that some Deputies had, but through any channels of inquiry that were at my disposal, I found that there was no very great increase in the rents for flats or lettings of that kind.  There may be a few exceptions, of course. There may be also the question of an increase in the cost of furniture.  Of course, putting in a table and a chair will not work, because, in order that the premises may escape control, the furniture must account for at least one-quarter of the total rent.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I do not think that a pretence at furnishing would be accepted if people tested it out, but, of course, if people themselves will not fight that, then nothing that we can do here can help them.  I think that that will be admitted.  We may pass a law here for the protection of people, but if the people concerned will not take advantage of it, then that is their affair and not ours.  In this <Col N="241" /> matter of whether or not a flat is furnished, if a test is made in the court by the tenant concerned, the landlord will have to satisfy the court that the value of the furniture he put in is at least a quarter of the gross rent. But, if people will not avail, themselves of that, then what can we do?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I am quite prepared to consider any proposal, if I can find one, which would deal with that matter.  At any rate, I shall go into the whole question.  Another question that arose was connected with the matter of tenements.  The contention has been made that, if the tenant cannot prove that the premises are under £10 valuation, he will not be able to come in under Part III.  I think that under Section 28 it is laid down that all a person has to do is to allege that the place he is living in is a small dwelling.  The district justice then has got to go into the matter, and I think we are entitled to assume that the district justice will use commonsense in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot do that.  In Section 27 it says that the expression &ldquo;small premises&rdquo; means controlled premises the rateable valuation of which does not exceed £10, and anybody who goes into court has to bring evidence to show that the premises are of a certain valuation. That was Deputy O'Connor's point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Section 28 the tenant has to make a claim that it is a small dwelling.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>An inspector is then sent to inspect the premises by the district justice, and he has to say whether or not he is satisfied that these rooms &mdash; say, the two-pair back &mdash; are under £10 valuation.  He is going to say whether or not it is a small dwelling and comes under this section.  At any rate, that is the way I have been advised, and it will be done under Section 29.  However, if, on further examination, I find that that is not so, I shall make it more definite.  I myself think it is all right, and if the district justice sends his assessor to view a tenement of this kind, and if the assessor says that this is obviously one of the type of premises which are covered in Part III of this Bill, then I am sure it will be covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, there is where the dispute will come in.  I admit that the question of the valuation of a room may be a difficult thing. However, as I have said, I will have the matter examined, but I am satisfied myself that Sections 28 and 29 will settle that.  I do not think we should go into it now, but we shall try to make it as watertight as possible.  I am perfectly satisfied that when the district justice gets the report of his assessor that the valuation of the premises is under £10&mdash;particularly if it is a case of a big house divided into several flats &mdash; the assessor will make that plain to the district justice.  We could make that more definite, if necessary.  As to the children, that presents a terrible problem.  I do not know of any way to deal with it.  Of course what Deputy O'Connor said to Deputy Larkin is right: &ldquo;People cannot be put out if they have children.&rdquo;  What way is there of forcing people with apartments to let to take in children? It would be very desirable if we could do that.  I do not know of any way <Col N="243" /> in which we could force people to do so.</P>

      <P>I do not think we are going to have the big queues that Deputy Dillon foresees.  I also do not think that rents are as exorbitant as people allege.  I was acting on one occasion for the Minister for Local Government in reference to certain houses which were to be demolished under a clearance Order, and I was surprised at the average rents paid, something like 2/3 or 2/6 per room. There may be numbers of people paying exorbitant rents, but that will be dealt with.  If this Bill does not deal with it, the situation can be remedied. This is the best I can do, but I am open to any amendment that will improve any part of the Bill.  On the whole, this Bill was pretty well received, and it represents a genuine effort to try to deal with a pressing problem.  The general housing problem is not one for me to deal with. That is another Minister's duty.  He is going thoroughly into it and, at the proper time, will deal with it.</P>

      <P>The Minister has extended <Col N="244" /> the provisions of the Emergency Powers Order restricting the powers of landlords to increase rents, but in this Bill he is enabling new builders to get away from that provision. Is it possible under this Bill to have a provision preventing builders of new houses fixing new rents, or would it be necessary to get another Emergency Powers Order to prevent landlords extorting from their tenants?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>There was not much building done in recent years.  The society with which Deputy O'Connor is connected was prepared to build 300 houses, and had arrangements made to build 1,200.  Naturally, such societies will see that if the provision in the Order is going to apply to such houses, which will be built at an increased cost, they cannot continue.  They will have to get a certain profit.  I say that is reasonable, and I imagine that no Government would try to restrict rents unless they found evidence of an attempt at extortion.  If they did, I think the Government would be bound to act.  If I happened to be a member of the Government when that happened, and if I found that there was an attempt to charge extortionate rents, or rents far in excess of what they should be, I would have no hesitation in asking the Government to bring in further restrictions.  This Bill allows a reasonable return, as otherwise nobody would build.  I agree with Deputy Dillon that most Deputies, or anybody with money to invest, will not put it into building if they cannot make a profit.  I will have no hesitation, if I am in the Government, if there is any attempt at extortion, in asking to have it stopped.</P>

On the point raised by Deputy Moran regarding the exclusion of houses of local authorities, I do not see how we could bring them in.  There may be something exceptional in the Westport case but, as far as I know, houses built by local authorities <Col N="245" /> are subsidised houses and should, therefore, be outside the scope of rent restrictions.</P>

      <P>When the House adjourned last night, I was dealing with the occasions of public scandal associated with the present method of electing the Seanad.  I was referring to the manner in which the Taoiseach had exercised his power, under the existing scheme, to appoint Senators. I described his 11 appointees.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not repeat them. I shall just refresh the memory of Deputies with the list of appointments which the Taoiseach made.  I want to invite Deputies from all sides of the House to take this list, examine it, and ask themselves if there is a single name on the list of a person who might, under any conceivable circumstances, be expected to do anything else than walk into the Fianna Fáil Lobby in Seanad Eireann.  Here is the list: Seán P. Campbell, Dr. Farnan, T. Foran, T.V. Honan, Miss Margaret Kennedy, William Magennis, Liam O Buachalla, Padraic O Maille, Miss Margaret Pearse, Matthew Stafford, with the addition of Sir John Keane. There are the ten independent souls, the ten individuals divorced from Party associations, the ten individuals intended to represent elements in the <Col N="246" /> community which might not otherwise be expected to have adequate representation in the Seanad; the ten individuals who were to carry into the Seanad intellectual and administrative capabilities that no elected Senator could reasonably be expected to have in his equipment.  Is it any wonder that we say that the present system of choosing the Seanad stinks?</P>
      <P>I do not want to depart from condemnation of the existing situation without envisaging an alternative that would be acceptable, at least, to me. The motion requests that a committee be set up to examine this question. That is a sensible kind of proposal. When that committee comes to sit, the first thing to which they will have to turn its mind is as to whether a Second Chamber is necessary at all or not. Then their minds will turn back to Sam Adams and John Adams, because they will doubtless scan the pages of the report of the debate that took place here when the Taoiseach was getting rid of the Seanad. They will read a description of the scene which we witnessed when the Taoiseach struck the desk before him and said: &ldquo;Adams was in favour of Second Chamber government.&rdquo;  It was suggested to him that John Adams clearly was not in favour of Second Chamber government and the voice of the Taoiseach was heard three weeks later to ask: &ldquo;Did nobody ever hear of Sam Adams?&rdquo;  If I said: &ldquo;De Valera is the greatest cutthroat and scoundrel in the country,&rdquo; I venture to say that the Chair would call me to order and tell me that that was no way to refer to the Taoiseach.</P>

If a method of election is to be determined, the committee will have to <Col N="247" /> decide whether, in principle, it is a good thing to have a Seanad or not.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether it is within their strict terms of reference or not, they will have to consider it and, on that question, they will have all the Taoiseach's arguments for abolishing the Seanad and all the Taoiseach's arguments for reinstating the Seanad. They will have a most interesting time reading the arguments on both sides, in respect of which he was very eloquent, and listening to such arguments as he has to advance now.  They will, certainly, have to determine what the functions of that body should be. As it is unlikely that I shall be a member of that committee, if it is set up, I venture to suggest to the House now that one pitfall which should be sedulously avoided is the danger of setting up a rival authority to this House and that, therefore, the idea should be to establish a Seanad which would have a delaying function and an advisory function.  There should be agreement on that.  Members should be swayed to agreement by the consideration that not only are delay and second thoughts desirable, but that the very presence of these things <i>in potentia</i> acts as a deterrent on the Dáil from doing things impetuously which it might, otherwise, attempt to do but which it would not attempt if these impetuous acts were to be subject to the review of such a body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That accepted, we must ask ourselves what type of person we want in the Seanad.  The theory that the legislative authority in the country must be representative of all the people is right, not because it is founded on any great, moral principle, but because every adult person in the State having <Col N="248" /> a right to a voice in the choice of the members of Dáil Eireann, the Government chosen by that Dáil is in a moral position to say to all comers: &ldquo;We shall not tolerate any attempt to change the law by violence because there is no necessity for violence where every man may, if he can secure the agreement of his neighbours, achieve his ends by constitutional means and by using his vote in preference to a gun.&rdquo;  In the last analysis the Government of a free country must be in a moral position to confront those who would overthrow the State by force of arms, with force and, if necessary, order troops under the Government's command to fire on those who would overthrow the State by violence.  Unless the Government is in a position to say: &ldquo;You can achieve everything by your vote that you could achieve by violence,&rdquo; they are not morally in a position to use such force to vindicate the authority of the majority of the people who elect this Dáil.</P>
    <P>These considerations, however, do not apply in choosing a Seanad, because there is no suggestion to transfer the ultimate authority of the elected representatives of the people to the Seanad.  We want them to advise us, and even to gain time for second thought.  Therefore, I should like to see a Seanad established in this country chosen by that section of the community from which Senators themselves must be drawn, persons over 30 years of age.  At present we have an electorate designated which might serve, that is, all citizens of the State who hold ration books with the three red stripes upon them.  There is a great deal to be said for electing a Seanad, not on the basis of universal suffrage, but on the basis of families &mdash;to allow it to be a House representing the heads of households.  Oddly enough, circumstances have imposed upon the community the necessity of establishing under the rationing regulations with reasonable precision who these persons are.  Hereafter, admission to the roll of voters as the head of a household should be subject to application and adjudication by a body whose permanent function it would be to consider whether an applicant for admission to the roll in fact qualified <Col N="249" /> for that title or not.  Of course, if we choose that electorate of heads of families, it would not mean that every person on it would be over 30 years of age, but it would mean that every voter in the Seanad election would be the head of a household with family responsibilities.  It would mean that it would be a poll of families rather than of individuals.  I think that such a Chamber in our Legislature might have a very positive value.</P>
    <P>I know that Clann na Talmhan believes that there is some peculiar value in a vocational Seanad, and I grant you that it appealed to me at one time, but the more I reflected on it, the less I believed in it, because &mdash; as far as I see &mdash; if you attempt to organise a legislative Chamber on vocational grounds, the only consequence is that you gather in to that Assembly a whole series of powerful vested interests, each vigorously fighting for its own sectional interests, with comparatively little concern for the welfare of the community as a whole. If, on the other hand, you gather into an advisory legislative Chamber all the heads of the families of the State, you have an extraordinarily representative body of persons chosen by an extraordinarily representative cross section of the community, every one of whom shares in a multiplicity of interests represented by the vocations and callings not only of themselves but of their children for the time and in the time to come.</P>
    <P>In making that choice I should like to see in this country 32-county constituences&mdash;this will shock some of my more orthodox friends &mdash; with one or two Senators from each county.  Whether it will be necessary to add some other Senators from the boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, etc., is a matter that could be considered on expert advice.  If the right of this country to be united is challenged from outside or within, I think it is foolish simply to make futile gestures on the one hand or, on the other hand, simply to do nothing at all.  I do not think it desirable to have in this effective legislative Chamber of the Twenty-Six Counties persons who are not directly representative of those over whom the <Col N="250" /> law of this country is to have effect, but I think it would be quite legitimate to have in a Seanad, which was designed as an advisory body for the Dáil, representatives of the six northern counties to which we lay claim and which we may wish to have represented in some way in our Legislature as a standing reminder to the world that we claim them for our own and, as a salutary help to ourselves, to hear the representations and the advice of the heads of families resident in the Six Counties which some time we hope will constitute part of the nation.</P>

I implore the House to be expeditious in putting an end to it for this reason.  It is important to bear it in mind that the repetition of jobbery in the country not only nauseates the public, not only shakes their confidence in the integrity of public men but, what is infinitely worse, it begins to blunt the people's sense of public duty and citizenship.  I do not think that the Taoiseach ten years ago would have made himself responsible for the job that has been put through in the last couple of days.</P>

I say that ten years ago things that are being done to-day no one would have dared to do in this country because they would have apprehended an uprising of nauseated disgust on the part of our people.  But they are done now and those who do them have rightly judged that there is no nausea, there is no uprising of disgust.  Why?  Because the people's sense of integrity, the people's sense of public duty in their own representatives has become blunted.</P>

      <P>And they have come to believe that if you can get away with it, that is what counts.  I want them to try to wake up to the fact that so long as there are some of us left in this House they will not get away with it in silence.  There is a difference between private sin and public sin. Private sins are the individual's own business.  Those who do slippery things by stealth have at least left to them their sense of shame, but those who flagrantly and blatantly come out in public and do slippery things, firm in the conviction that they will get away with it and that there is nobody left <Col N="254" /> now who cares sufficiently to fight for standards of decency, rectitude and duty and that there will be no voice raised to challenge things of that kind, they are the public sinners that not only want to do their dirty deeds but want so to corrupt the whole community in which they live that they will be allowed to do them without protest. God forbid that our country should ever be lowered to that depth of degradation. It may be that in every generation we have had a certain measure of questionable practice.  At least, in my recollection, those who stooped so low had at least retained their sense of shame; they feared to be found out.  So long as I am here in any case, and I think there are others who feel the same, those who want to do those things in public will answer for them in public and they will not get away with them on the ground that they have been done before, why worry about doing them now?</P>
      <P>Jobbery corrupts the soul of a people.  It is not the first time that an attempt has been made by people in this country to persuade our people to sell their souls for penny rolls and lumps of hairy bacon and the attempt was made to make that act of purchase something that was to be boasted of at the cross-roads as conversion. There are politicians in this country who have learned that lesson but it is not penny rolls and lumps of hairy bacon that they are offering for the souls of our people, but jobs and patronage.  Toe the line, climb on the band wagon and there will be a pension or a job or some little concession to compensate you for your trouble.

      <P>In the atmosphere which has been created it is not easy to make a calm approach to the motion and amendment before us dealing with the question of the Seanad.  Unlike the last speaker, I am not particularly keen as to whether we should have a Seanad or not.  I recollect very clearly the convincing arguments of the Taoiseach when he decided, in his wisdom, that the Seanad should be abolished.  With that decision I was in wholehearted agreement.  With the reinstitution of the Second Chamber I was not in agreement.  I was not only averse to it but to the method of formation of the Second Chamber.  The history of that Chamber has given me reason to be completely opposed to the method of election.  I wonder if the Taoiseach and the Government are happy about the new method of election of the Second Chamber.  I am not a doctrinaire in my views, but I did hold then, and I hold now, that the elected representatives of the country in the Dáil ought to be the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous Seanad had certain powers which were proven clearly by the arguments of the Taoiseach and by common sense to be a menace to the functions of the elected representative Chamber here because of the fact that the members would be willy-nilly <Col N="256" /> supporters or opponents of the Government in power.  They could not be impartial in one way or the other. In the first instance, they would be partisans of the existing Government and, with the lapse of time, would become opponents of the Government in power.  They would thereby range themselves in opposition to the will and wishes of the people by the operation of their delaying power.  I am quite sure that when the Taoiseach decided to reinstitute the Second Chamber, after having decided that one Chamber would be good enough, his intentions were of the best to try to provide a better Second Chamber. But whatever the Taoiseach thinks about it now, I can say that there is not a man or woman in this country but believes that the Second Chamber is an unfortunate imposition on the State.  The election which took place recently reduced our people to a status that they should never have been reduced to when dealing with the election of a legislative Assembly.</P>
    <P>I do not want to introduce any more heat into this discussion.  I have expressed my views as to a Second Chamber.  I do not care whether we have one or not.  Personally I would prefer to have no Second Chamber. But, if we are to have one, it ought to be elected on decent, above-board lines and the utterly impossible system under which it is elected at present ought to be scrapped.  The opportunities for corruption and graft that are being put before our people throughout the length and breadth of the country ought to be taken away. It would not be by any means impossible to devise a method by which a Second Chamber could be elected which would be representative of the best interests of the country and remove the dangers and possibilities of the present system.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a Second Chamber, I think a case has been made for the setting up of a committee of all Parties in the House to examine impartially what has been the result of the present method of electing the Seanad; whether it is to continue or what improvements could be made on it; or what is the best method of electing a Second Chamber.  That, I believe, <Col N="257" /> is a duty imposed on the members of this House and, particularly, on the Government.  I say that this motion and amendment ought to lead to the setting up immediately of an all-Party committee.  The interests of the country are at stake; the interests of Parliamentary institutions are at stake.  Whether in the Government or in the Opposition, I do not think anyone will stand over what has been happening. I would therefore appeal for a committee to be set up, from all Parties in the House, to inquire into this matter, which would be imbued with the intention to devise a more equitable, simple and easy method of election that will make it possible for the country to elect a Second Chamber, if there is to be a Second Chamber, representative of various interests. The dominating factor would possibly be to have a vocational Seanad.  You can call it by any other name if you like.  But we want to have the various interests of the country represented &mdash; industrial, agricultural, professional and workers.  The method of selecting them must be different from what it has been, because the panel system is utterly impossible and should not be allowed to continue.  If we cannot improve on the present method, I say we should scrap the Second Chamber.  I believe that we can improve on the method.  I believe that a committee of all Parties in this House could easily devise a simple method for electing a Second Chamber, and I suggest that the discussion on this motion ought to result in the setting up of an all-Party committee to devise a method of electing a Second Chamber which would remove the objectionable practices incidental to the present method.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I subscribe to the amendment which, I understand, has been adopted by the movers of the original motion.  The Deputy has stated his objection to a Second Chamber and, at the same time, implied that he would not oppose the setting up of a Second Chamber.  Now I am supporting the amendment for the reason that he suggests, that we should have vocational representation in any Second Chamber.  I remember <Col N="258" /> being present with the Taoiseach and others who were appointed as a Committee in this House to go into the whole matter of the constitution of the Seanad.  When vocationalism was suggested we found we were presented with very many difficulties, some of which were almost insurmountable. In the case of the commercial panel, for instance, we found that it was very difficult to define who was a commercial person, who should be included on the commercial panel.  Then there was the professional panel.  I had the feeling during these conversations that we could quite easily have had at that particular period a truly representative Second House.</P>
      <P>Now, if the principle of vocationalism is accepted &mdash; and in my belief, it should be accepted &mdash; it should not be too difficult to decide who are the agriculturists, who are the industrialists, who are the persons who constitute the teaching profession, the legal profession, the medical profession, and so on.  There are one or two headings under which it would be very difficult to place certain elements in our community &mdash; the commercial panel, for instance &mdash; but that could be overcome by having a register of all persons who claimed to come under that category.  I have a feeling that that proposal would satisfy both the proposer of this motion and those who seek to have it amended.</P>
      <P>I am not going to go into the question of the need for a Second Chamber, nor of its virtues or vices.  I know it is almost impossible to get an ideal chamber under present conditions. I know that there was one occasion when, whether it was designed to have a slap at the then Labour Party or not, there was a bogus institution, which received the benediction of the Taoiseach at the time.  That was an organisation known as the Cottiers' and Tenants' Organisation, from which body one or two people were selected.  It was purely a bogus organisation, and everybody knew that.  It kept no books, as far as was known at the time, it had no treasurer or secretary and its organisation was an unknown quantity, so far as I knew or even the Labour Party knew.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is necessary to discuss the utility of a Second Chamber now, as it does not come within the terms of this motion, except in regard to the constitution of the Assembly.  However, I think it has a useful function under present circumstances as a revising body, which is a necessity in this country. We know that on two occasions the Seanad has proved its worth by withholding measures, and that was afterwards found out to be the correct procedure in those cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Taoiseach would accept the suggestion thrown out by Deputy Keyes, of establishing a committee to deal with the whole matter of the Seanad, in regard to its functions and the method of selection of Senators, it would be worth while.  In view of what we have heard here and what we have heard outside, and in view of the circumstances, which are within the knowledge of many Deputies, it is <Col N="260" /> essential that some other kind of machinery be established to cope with what has become a public scandal.  In regard to one particular case I know of, I asked the gentleman concerned if he would make his knowledge public and inform some of the Government Ministers, as it was an open case of corruption; but he told me he was not going to do any such thing.  It was a case where a man wrote him a letter &mdash; which letter I read &mdash; saying that he would vote for Mr. A. provided Mr. A. gave him more than Mr. B.  By the way, Mr. A. had not sent him a circular at all.  He said the price offered by Mr. B. was rather small and if Mr. A. gave him more he would give him his vote.  Now, we know that that was fairly rampant during the last election, that there was a large amount of canvassing and that much pressure was brought to bear here on members of borough councils and county councils to vote for certain persons.  That scandal has been brought to light through the agency of the police courts.</P>
    <P>I think it is high time we set about putting that particular House in order, by getting personnel of a character that would be a credit to our country. I believe the vocational system is the better one, as then the Seanad would be thoroughly representative.  At the present moment, agriculture is not represented to its full capacity.  It is our principal industry and yet agriculture has not the representation to which it is entitled.  Therefore, I have pleasure in supporting the amendment and supporting in principle the motion before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Keyes has said, this is a matter which should be approached in a calm atmosphere and on the merits of the case.  The great defect, if not the viciousness, of the present system of election exists in the time-lag which operates between the receipt of the ballot paper and its return to the returning officer.  During that interval, pressure of all kinds is brought to bear upon the councillor, member of a corporation, or Deputy who has a vote.  The second great defect I see in the existing system is that, whilst we aim in theory at a vocational Seanad by segregating our <Col N="261" /> candidates into various panels on vocational lines, there is no vocational electorate to elect that panel and candidates on the particular panel have to depend for their return upon a political vote.</P>
      <P>If there is any merit or virtue in an Upper House, it is that that House should be conservative in its outlook towards legislation coming from the Lower House or, alternatively, that it should be a more expert body through which legislation passed by the Lower House might be sieved.  I would deprecate anything in the nature of a House of nominees, the kind of House which, in the later Roman days, deteriorated into a body which assembled simply for the purpose of hearing the imperial decree and then adjourning, or a House of the type of more recent times, of the Reichstag where again a Fuehrer announced his decision and the House endorsed it and then dispersed.  There is a case for an Upper House if you regard it purely and simply as a House to review legislation passed by the Lower House, to check perhaps hasty decisions reached on legislation by the Lower House and, perhaps, on occasion to check the rapaciousness of a particular Government.</P>
      <P>Looking broadly at the democratic principle, the Government of the day should have the right to have its will endorsed in legislation and executed in the country.  Some remedy will have to be found, in times of crisis, whereby the Government will have to get its way, if necessary, over the Upper House.  A crisis of that kind once developed in England, but never came to the actual abolition of the Upper House.  In 1911, when that crisis did arise, it was clear that the House would have to go or be swamped by nominees of the Government, and when that threat was made the Upper House yielded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not quite follow Deputy Dillon in his argument that a large percentage of the Upper House are political hacks, nominated by the Taoiseach.  I think that some degree of nomination will have to exist in any House if the Government of the day <Col N="262" /> are to have their way and I think, broadly speaking, as a democrat, that the Government of the day elected by the people are the superior authority and should have their way and that the Upper House must yield.  If that is the position, I suggest some means should be found by which the democratic principle would be preserved and the Government of the day would have their way in legislation.  I suggest that could be done by devising an electorate on a restricted franchise, perhaps on the lines Deputy Dillon has suggested, though I do not sympathise with the ration book system.  You could get a good Upper House by direct election, giving a vote only to the rated occupier of a house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is virtually the same thing.  There would be difficulty in establishing a register of heads of families.  I think it would be more appropriate to give the vote to the registered occupier, the rated occupier of the house, who is, in 99 per cent. of cases, the head of the family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not greatly enamoured of the suggestion that a vocational Seanad will be an improvement. I can see that if you set up a register of agriculturists to give representation to agriculture in the Upper House it is really going to be a reflex of what you have at the moment.  The farmers complain that they are not represented in this and in the Upper House but, if you examine the professions of the members of both Houses, you will find that the farmers are well represented here.  I do not think they will get any more representation by means of a vocational system than they have at the moment.  It would be easy to devise a system by which the agricultural industry could get representation here on the basis of the registered holder of land, but it is not so easy to <Col N="263" /> provide representation for, say, commercial trades, industry and other professions.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, if you get an Upper House purely representative of professions, I cannot see doctors or engineers or industrialists taking any keener interest in legislation that does not affect their own professions than under the present system.  My suggestion would be an Upper House on a restricted franchise based, shall we say, on the present constituencies, on the basis of one to every three Deputies, continuing the present University representation and the nomination of the balance by the Prime Minister.</P>
      <P>As regards Deputy Dillon's suggestion of giving representation to the Six Counties, I cannot see how that would work at the moment, except by nomination. Incidentally, if it were attempted here it would be open to the Six-County Government to prohibit any members so nominated from attending this House.  I think that suggestion is impracticable in existing circumstances.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to take up the time of the House any longer.  I agree entirely with the motion and I ask the Taoiseach and the other members of the Government seriously to consider setting up a Committee representative of all Parties to consider this matter in a calm, cold atmosphere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, my contribution to this debate will be very brief. In the main, the motion seeks to have a committee set up for the purpose of having the present method of election to the Seanad investigated and a more satisfactory system of election devised. I am one of those who have never been impressed by the necessity for a Second Chamber.  I warmly supported the proposal to abolish the Seanad when the Taoiseach, in his salad days, did not want bi-cameral government. I was most enthusiastic to get rid of the Seanad as it was then constituted. I was appointed on a committee to advise as to what type of Second Chamber we could have in substitution for the first Chamber when the Taoiseach had, as he said, a hankering after a Second Chamber, but when the chairman of the committee told me it was not within my province to recommend that we should not have a Second Chamber, I ceased to take any further interest in the committee.</P>
      <P>My interest now in Second Chambers is as cool and disinterested as it was on that occasion.  I do not see any necessity for a Second Chamber. What I do see is the pitiful efforts of people who have some kind of a longing for Second Chambers, and who try to justify the necessity for one in this country.  Some people think you must have a Second Chamber here, simply because there are Second Chambers in other countries.  Some people think that somehow or other you have got to have a kind of legislative aristocracy here, and that you cannot trust the representatives who are thrown up in an election in which the plain people have the determining voice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never been impressed by these arguments, and any knowledge I have <Col N="266" /> of the Seanad sittings, its deliberations, the character of its work, and the duration of its sittings, leaves me completely cold as to the necessity for the establishment of a Second Chamber.  I have never once heard an argument of any quality in favour of the establishment of a Second Chamber, and I think the Taoiseach was unwise and unstable, politically, if I may say so, when, having abolished the Seanad on one occasion, he was coddled back to the theory that we could not transact business legislatively in this country unless we had a Second Chamber.</P>
    <P>I doubt if any Deputy here will attempt to make a case even for the present Seanad.  One would not be impressed by the way the work is done in the Seanad or by the personnel of the Seanad.  If anybody cares to look at the Official Reports of the Seanad, and sees the number of days on which the Seanad sits in a year, and the leisurely way in which it deals with business, he will find it very difficult, if he speaks the truth, to show that a body of that kind, by its constitution and by its methods, is essential to the passage of legislation through a House representative of the people.</P>
    <P>We are supposed to have a vocational Seanad.  There never was a greater fraud, a greater sham, in the public life of this country than to pretend that we have a vocational Seanad. There has never been a more cruel joke upon the credulity of the people than the suggestion that we have a vocational Seanad.  The biggest vocation in this country, of course, is the vocation of unemployment, but to imagine that we have in this country vocational groups of a kind to justify us in establishing a vocational Seanad is simply daftness.  Nobody has ever made any serious attempt to pretend that such kind of structural vocational organisation as we have had in this country at all justifies the selection of a Seanad on vocational lines.</P>
    <P>Of course, in case we should have a vocational Seanad, we make sure that the vocations will have no votes at all. We decide to set up a method of electing a vocational Seanad, but in order to make sure that the vocations do not <Col N="267" /> get too much say in the election, we create an electorate consisting purely of members of political Parties.  We throw in the Dáil first, and then we throw in seven members of each county council and borough council, all of whom have been elected on political tickets.  We say to that purely political body: &ldquo;We entrust to you, as the most suitable electorate in this country, the selection of a vocational Seanad.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does anybody looking at the present Seanad imagine it is a vocational Seanad?  You could probably get a better vocational Seanad out of the defeated candidates than you could out of the elected candidates, because political machines work in such a way that those who might most claim to be vocational candidates are all honoured by getting no vote at all, whereas those who know how to pull strings, who have pals here and there, who have good cheque books and can get good election agents, all manage to get into the Seanad and then they adorn our vocational Seanad.  Does not everybody, including the Taoiseach, know perfectly well, from our experiences of Seanad elections, that it is, in the main, a kind of casualty station where we treat all the warriors, so far as we can provide for them, who go down in the Dáil electoral battles?  Does not everybody know perfectly well that the moment the Dáil election results are announced and certain well-known Deputies are found to have lost the confidence of the people, this House is infested immediately with defeated candidates?</P>

      <P>County councillors are importuned and the whole set-up is designed for the purpose of getting poor so-and-so who was unfortunately defeated in the last election into the Seanad.  Has everybody not got that experience?  Take the last election.  It was not safe to be in the lobbies.  One had to keep out of the way of the main stream of Seanad candidates who coursed and cruised around the House at a disconcerting rate, and when you looked at the Seanad election results <Col N="268" /> and saw the way the ballot papers were marked you found that all the boys who were active around Leinster House, who toured the country in motor cars importuning county council electors, all the lads who had cheque books, who had political managers in the country, romped home and all the poor vocationalists were left wondering why nobody thought of giving them a vote at all.</P>
      <P>There is a story told in regard to one of the Seanad elections of a candidate who was certain of five votes.  The returning officer counted up the votes and said he had three, and the candidate said: &ldquo;My God, I bought more than that.&rdquo;  That is the kind of thing which is thrown up by this so-called vocational Seanad which we were daft enough to constitute.  I know &mdash; and I speak from knowledge of the facts &mdash; that in County Kildare, the constituency I have the honour to represent, we had three Labour members who had votes in the recent Seanad election. The lives of these unfortunate people were not worth living until the election was over.  People with all kinds of motor-cars arrived day and night.  They admired their dogs and said they were magnificent dogs.  Any poor old tom-cat with its ribs sticking out turned out to be a prize cat while the candidate was there.  The children were the most gorgeous-looking children that ever lived in the country. The whole house was admired and the wife was the finest-looking woman in the country &mdash; all while the lad was trying to soak the votes out of the poor county councillors.  One of the candidates, after spending a very hard day trying to get some of the Labour votes to go in his direction, finally confessed to one of the county councillors: &ldquo;You are a tough collection of people in Kildare.  I did not succeed in shifting one of you.&rdquo;  As a recent prosecution in the courts showed, two of the county councillors were actually bribed with money to part with their votes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Taoiseach does not know that the present electoral method so far as the Seanad is concerned reeks with graft and &ldquo;hoofling&rdquo;, the Taoiseach is a very simple man, and, if he does not know it, he is the only person in Ireland who does not know it.  There is <Col N="269" /> a smell from the whole method of electing people to the Seanad.  It reeks with corruption, and the sooner we end that method of election the better for all concerned.  I am not terribly impressed by, and would not waste very much time on an investigation of the method of electing people to the Seanad.  I think the Seanad ought to go, and the sooner the better, but the present method of election cannot be defended on any grounds, and in the interest of public confidence and a clean public life, it is desirable that the present method of election should be investigated by an impartial committee.  I support the proposal to establish that committee in order to sift the corruption, in order to end the corruption, and if we must have a Second Chamber, in order that we will at least get one by a system of election which will not reek with the graft which surrounds the method of election to our Seanad to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to say anything on this motion or the amendment, because I am not in agreement with the idea of a Second Chamber at all.  I feel, from experience, that a Second Chamber is of no value.  One is entitled to ask what is the function of a Second Chamber.  If it criticises legislation passed in this House and votes against it, the Government has a power of veto, and, that being so, the Seanad has no function whatever, except the function of criticism which does not warrant the money spent on its maintenance.  What has been said about corruption is true, but my belief is that no matter what form of election is devised, except on the basis of a properly constituted register, there will be corruption.  I am convinced that, even if you were to give to vocational bodies the power of electing a Second Chamber, you would still have corruption to a certain extent.  Some Deputies suggested that we should form a kind of register representing the heads of families.  I do not see why the heads of families should be given a privilege over and above people who have reached the age of 21.  I think that if you had any sort of system, with a register set up for the election of a Seanad, every <Col N="270" /> man and woman over the age of 21 should be entitled to vote.  It does not follow that a man must have grey hairs and the responsibility of maintaining a family before he can be regarded as being capable of casting a vote for some individual who is to be one of the members of a Second Chamber in this country.</P>
      <P>My objection to a Second Chamber is that it has not a function.  If it had, I would be in agreement with it.  It is argued that legislation may be passed in haste in this House, and that careful consideration of it in the other House will help to bring out any defects that are in it.  That may be so, but still I do not know of any suggestion which has ever been accepted by the Government from the Second Chamber.  During the time that I have been a member of this House, I do not know of any suggestions brought forward by the Opposition which have been accepted by the Government. If some have been accepted, they were very few, and not of any great importance.  Even supposing that we were able to devise something which would give us a favourable system of electing a Seanad, I cannot imagine that that Seanad would be independent of Party politics and would not be interested as to whether it was the Government or the Opposition that was responsible for legislation, and would, therefore, criticise the legislation on its merits.  I know quite well that the Government would be opposed to any Second Chamber that set out to oppose legislation passed by it.  In that situation how would a Second Chamber function?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what happened in the case of the old Seanad.  I well remember the Taoiseach making it very clear that he could not govern, that he could not have legislation of the type he desired passed, due to the reactionary methods of the old Seanad, and to the fact that it had a certain political make-up.  The same could happen if you have a Seanad which was elected independently of the political Parties.  I listened to Deputy Coogan say that he did not agree with Deputy Dillon's suggestion that the Taoiseach should not have the power or the right to <Col N="271" /> elect 11 men to the Seanad, men that the Taoiseach believed it was necessary for the Seanad to have, men whose outlook, he will say, would be in keeping with the Government.  If the Seanad is to have an outlook in keeping with the Government, if the majority of Senators believe in and endorse Government policy, then it is quite evident that they are not going to oppose legislation passed by the Government in this House.</P>
    <P>The truth about the whole matter is that the Seanad of to-day, the Seanad in the past, and the Seanad in the future, no matter how the method of election to it may be devised, is a kind of convalescent home for torpedoed politicians, a kind of dry dock for torpedoed T.D.s.  We are spending a sum of over £21,000 a year on the Seanad.  In my opinion the existence of that Chamber does not justify that expenditure at all.  We have a motion before the House for the setting up of a committee to try to devise a better means of electing a Seanad.  I do not disagree with that motion.  I support it, and I support the amendment, but I do so only because it may be possible to devise a better system.  My personal opinion is that no matter what system is devised, the corruption and the political atmosphere which we are trying to make out do not exist and should not exist, will be in the Seanad as long as there is a Seanad.  An argument which some people put forward for the existence of a Second Chamber is that some hot-headed Deputies might be responsible for the passing of legislation in this Chamber which would be contrary to good government, and that with a Second Chamber such legislation would be carefully examined and scrutinised, and that anything contained in it which would not be a benefit to the people could be removed.  I do not believe it is necessary to have that kind of Chamber.  I believe that the elected members of this House give a fair share of their time to a careful examination of the various Bills presented to them here.  I think that, if the records are looked up, it will be found that very few useful reforms or suggestions have been made by the Second <Col N="272" /> Chamber.  Senators do not help to make a Bill or a piece of legislation anything more perfect than it was before it left this House.</P>
    <P>For that reason I myself believe that the wisest and the best method would be to abolish the Seanad altogether and to have a single Chamber.  That may seem an extreme view, but we must remember that for a year or more, under the Fianna Fáil Administration, we had only the one Chamber, and I do not think that anything rash or drastic was done during that period.  In that time we passed a good deal of legislation, all of which stands good to-day.  I honestly believe that the sooner we admit the truth that the Second Chamber is a mere hobby for certain individuals the better: that it is a kind of place for the grandfathers to meet and criticise their sons, the sons taking no notice of the criticism made by the grandfathers. It is slapped back in their faces.  The sooner we admit that the better and not be wasting public money on a Second Chamber.  I know that Deputy Dillon and men like him do not agree with me in that, because big men, big industrialists and the upper classes in this country, like the upper classes in Great Britain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>And the big farmers, believe that such Houses should exist. They believe that without a Second Chamber they all might be executed overnight or thrown into a concentration camp.  I do not think they need have any fear of that.  If they were to be executed overnight or thrown into a concentration camp, then I do not believe that the existence of a Second Chamber would save them one bit.  I do not think they have any reason to remain awake at night fearing that without a Second Chamber their wealth is going to be confiscated. If it were, then I do not think a Second Chamber would save them. The sooner they get such ideas about a Second Chamber out of their heads the better.  What good can it be to them since it has not the power of veto? It has no power to veto the Government, because the Government can <Col N="273" /> over-ride its veto.  It is from that point of view that I suggest in all fairness that the expenditure of £21,600 on allowances for the members of this Upper Chamber, apart from the expenditure on stationery and various other things which I suppose amounts to another £1,000 or more, is really waste of public money.  We have seen no fruit from the expenditure of this public money in the past 20 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The last two speakers have expressed a view with which I think it would be found that quite a large number of the people of the country are in agreement.  Here on a former occasion, at the time when we were getting rid of the old Seanad, I discussed this whole question of a Second House.  I examined as fully as I could the arguments which had been put forward in favour of a Second Chamber, and I think I showed fairly conclusively that they were most illusory &mdash; that, in fact, it boiled down to this: that if the Second House were to be opposed to the First, and to have a power of vetoing the actions of the directly-elected representatives of the people, then we were going to have a situation in which there would be a definite conflict, and the Second House was going to become a nuisance instead of any advantage.  On the other hand, if it were going to be of the same opinion as the First House, the need for it was hard to prove.  I made it quite clear when the new Constitution was coming in that the Second House was introduced not because I or the Government was particularly strongly in favour of it or had changed our fundamental views but because we believed that there was a large section of public opinion which felt that a Second House would be an advantage, and we were not willing to have a big political contest and to have more important matters side-tracked on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We made it quite clear in the Constitution that the Second House we were going to have would be one which could not effectively interfere with the will of the directly-elected representatives of the Primary Chamber.  Then the question was: could we have a Second House which would be of such <Col N="274" /> a character that it might add something to the deliberations of the First House?  Could it be of such a character that we might get a different type of approach to some of those questions? Could we have it of a type where the individuals might express their opinions less tied by Party affiliations? It is clear to everybody that the Second House, the Seanad, is a part of the Legislature; that it is dealing with political questions; that the questions which come up for decision are of a political character; that most people in the country, no matter what their avocations or their callings may be, are likely to have opinions on those questions, and that when it comes down to a direct conflict between the views which might be largely represented by one Party or another here in this House, they are likely to take Party views.  That must be quite clear to everybody, and you cannot avoid it. The first thing, then, that is quite clear is, that we are dealing with a political question, and that the talk of leaving politics aside is just nonsense. All you can say is that perhaps the individuals who would be dealing with them will approach the consideration of those question less tied by Party affiliations.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested here that we have talked about this as if it were a vocational Seanad.  We did not talk about it as a vocational Seanad.  The Constitution expresses fairly clearly what the intention is in regard to the panels.  It says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Before each general election of the members of Seanad Eireann to be elected from panels of candidates, five panels of candidates shall be formed in the manner provided by law containing respectively the names of persons having knowledge and practical experience of the following interests and services....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Having knowledge and practical experience of the following interests and services.&rdquo;  The intention clearly is that, at least as far as the panel section of it is concerned, the House should be built up of persons having practical experience of certain things and personal knowledge of them, so that they might, if you like, have an expert knowledge <Col N="275" /> of them.  The Second House, therefore, as far as the panel section was concerned, was to be made up of people having a special knowledge of matters dealing with the national language and culture; of persons having special knowledge of agriculture and its allied interests, together with fisheries, of persons having special knowledge of labour, whether organised or unorganised; of persons having special knowledge of industry and commerce, including banking, finance and so on; and of persons having special knowledge of public administration.  The purpose there was clearly to try to get in the Seanad a body in which those interests would have spokesmen, not directly representing them, but spokesmen who had a knowledge of those interests, and who, when matters came up for consideration, would understand the repercussions of those measures upon those several interests &mdash; not that they were to be direct representatives of them.  They might be, but their duty as members of the Second Chamber is not to look out for the interests of this particular section or that particular section.  Their interests as legislators ought to be to consider each measure that comes before them for their consideration from the point of view of the general welfare.  From their special knowledge, they would know how far the measure dealt with the particular section.</P>
    <P>We have been asked here to set up a committee to examine certain things &mdash; to devise a better scheme of election. I should like to point out that there have been very many committees and commissions dealing with this matter, and this particular type of Seanad &mdash; leaving the method of election out of it &mdash; was the result of a suggestion in a minority report of a commission which was set up in regard to a Second House.  It suggested a certain division, so that certain interests might have spokesmen.  Again, I want it to be understood that they are simply to be spokesmen as indicating from their special knowledge of certain interests, how any special measure would affect those interests.  The commission suggested something of that sort, and we <Col N="276" /> tried to work it out.  The working out of it was based on the idea that we could, where there were any of those interests organised, get those interests to nominate people for the Second Chamber who would have a knowledge of those interests.</P>
    <P>Somebody, criticising the results of these elections, said that if the president, let us say, of some particular learned body went up for election he might be turned down and another person who might have a knowledge of the same sort of interests might be elected. It is quite possible that the person elected to represent certain interests might be a good one and that the person who had been elected as the head of a learned body or society or a particular professional body might not be the best person to send to the Legislature. We might have an eminent chemist at the head of a learned body, and yet he might not be the best person to send to the Legislature as a representative for the common good or even representing a particular interest. The point was that the people elected on that particular panel would have a knowledge of the interests of the people to be represented and it might happen that the person best suited to do so might not be the person who had been elected as president of that body for the time being.</P>
    <P>The point was made that people were being sent to the Seanad as a mark of honour.  They are sent there to do a practical job &mdash; a job which requires a close knowledge of the lives of our people, and the various ways in which our life is divided.  They are not sent there simply as ornaments.  Now, as I say, we tried to work that out, and the system devised was that we would get nominations from these bodies &mdash; that we would get the nominations partly from these bodies and partly from the Dáil.  It might be said: &ldquo;Why did you not leave it altogether to these bodies?&rdquo;  For the simple reason that we are not vocationally organised, and I wonder whether we ever will be vocationally organised, in the sense which these people are talking about. We are not organised in that way, and it would be quite wrong to give to <Col N="277" /> people who are only partly representative of the life of the country the sole right to determine who the members of the Second House should be.  If you confine the nominations altogether to these bodies, it is quite clear that you cannot go outside the nominations, no matter what the electorate is.  If the nominations confine you to a certain class of people, you cannot go outside it, and the hope was that if you could get one-half of the members nominated from these vocational and professional bodies, you would get the rest nominated in a way which was proposed, in many cases, as the way in which the Seanad should be elected. There have been several proposals as to the way in which the Seanad would be elected by the Primary House.</P>
    <P>This proposal gave practically half the nominations to the members of the House.  Theoretically, it seemed all right.  We have all seen it in practice now, and I do not think we are satisfied with it.  Certainly, I am not satisfied with it.  I was not satisfied with it in the case of the last two elections, but I doubt if a single person put his finger on the real weakness of the scheme.  The weakness of the scheme is a thing that follows from proportional representation.  Whenever you have proportional representation, and the electorate is not very large in comparison with the number of people to be elected, you will get the position in which a small quota can elect a member, and the whole weakness here is due to the fact that a member can be elected by a small quota.  When you have a small quota it is possible for people to go around and, by one means or another, get a sufficient number of that quota for election.  I think it was the Labour Party that suggested that it would be better to have the Dáil only as the electorate, but I have to confess that, when that matter was being discussed, I was anxious to have a larger electorate, if it could be got, and it did not occur to me at all that the real objection that there should be to the Dáil alone electing it was that a still smaller number could elect a Seanad.  That is the main cause of weakness here, because it puts a temptation in the way of people who are candidates to <Col N="278" /> get the necessary quota by any means they can, and if that quota is small they will go through all means to do it.</P>
    <P>I deplore what has happened.  I felt pretty certain, from what I had heard after the last election and the previous one, that there was something wrong. I believed that there was so much smoke there was bound to be some fire under it.  I was determined that we ourselves, if nobody else did it, would begin to propose a change in the method of election to the Seanad.  It happened that the last election came very shortly after the first one &mdash; almost on its heels, so to speak &mdash; and in that case we had court cases which appeared to me to have proved conclusively that there were some Senators elected through corrupt practices &mdash; through bribery.  Now, the question is: how far has it gone?  I believe that there has been exaggeration as to the distance it has gone, but it does not matter if there was only a single case of it, we should take care that opportunities for similar action in the future should not occur, and the occurrence of a single case is sufficient because, in a matter of that sort, it is quite clear that the bad example then set would be followed by others and that, as time went on instead of improving we would probably get worse.  So, I agree with everybody who says that the time has come when we will have to change the method of election.  It is easier, however, to wish to change it than to get a suitable substitute.</P>
    <P>When speaking originally on this matter of the method of election to a Seanad or Second Chamber, I suggested that the difficulty was to get any method by which a suitable Second House could be secured.  Many methods have been tried, but the only method that has been tried, with reasonable support, as far as I can make out, is where you have a federal system in which each of the States concerned get equal representation, and where the small States, by the system, are put in equality with the large States.  Where that is done, you will find that very special functions have been given to the Seanad in order to protect the rights of the small States and to see that the interests of <Col N="279" /> the small States are not overwhelmed by the power of the larger States. Those are the only cases that I know of where there has not been intense public dissatisfaction.</P>
    <P>In that connection I might say that a very interesting thing happened with reference to the election before the last one.  A representative of a foreign country came to me and talked about how dissatisfied they were in that country with their Second Chamber. He said: &ldquo;You seem to have a rather interesting system here.  It gives you a sort of semi-vocationalism of a different type.  It means that the Second Chamber will not be an exact replica of the First.  I was thinking of urging a similar sort.&rdquo;  I said to him: &ldquo;For Heaven's sake, go slowly; don't attempt to do it.  We heard that things have appeared in the working out of the system which we did not anticipate when evolving it.  I certainly would not recommend you to have anything of the sort of system we have at the moment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, I say that the time has come when we are agreed absolutely that the method of election to the Second Chamber will have to be changed &mdash; changed because of the fact that the quota is so small.  In other words, the number of seats is so large in comparison with the size of the electoral college, that there is an attempt to get after the necessary number of small voters to secure election.  I have given it a certain amount of consideration, and the Department of Local Government, and the officers who have been following the elections very closely, were engaged on it.  When it was suggested that this particular motion might be postponed, it was a request of the Department of Local Government to me that we should not go ahead, as there was a number of things they were examining, which they would like to put before us before this debate would take place.  However, the Opposition wished to have it, and I do not think we will lose very much by having it at present.  Any information they have will be available to any committee we may set up.</P>
    <P>I think I have indicated to the House my own views on this matter.  I have <Col N="280" /> been thinking how we might improve it.  One of the things obvious to anybody who takes part in the election is that the ballot paper itself becomes so large that it is almost impossible to go through the whole of it and attempt to vote in order of preference.  That is almost impossible.  There may be objections.  One thing that suggests itself is: why did we have the system of voting for all the panels together? Suppose we had a separate vote for each panel, would we improve matters? We would improve matters to this extent, that we would have a far higher quota.  If you had to vote for each separate panel there would be a far higher quota.</P>
    <P>It would be said then, in objection, that the proportional system would not work out, that each panel would have representation based on whatever might be the dominating vote in the electoral college.  In other words, that the dominating vote would be more effective than in the series of panels as a whole.  It was to give proportional representation greater play that it was suggested, in the first instance, to take the panels as a whole. One improvement in the way of increasing the quota, and diminishing the likelihood of a person trying to get the quota, would be to have voting on each panel separately.  It would be a much easier system to handle. The next thing is to try to limit the number of candidates that go up for election.  That could be done.  There is the system we have used in the case of casual vacancies.  In the case of casual vacancies on any particular panel, what happens is that various nominating bodies in the panel send, I think, three representatives to a meeting, and three names selected at the meeting are sent up afterwards to the Taoiseach for his final selection.  The idea of getting them together is to limit the number of candidates who go forward for any particular vacancy.  You might say that that might be allowed to diminish the number to one or two more than, or perhaps double, the number of candidates that could be elected.  In that way you would diminish the number going forward. But you would have diminution <Col N="281" /> of the number brought about by a body which would have certain common interests, inasmuch as they belonged to one particular group, such as agriculture, industry or labour, and would be able to eliminate a number of candidates, and to try to get those who represented the greatest common measure of the interests of the panel as a whole.  In ways like that you could improve the present system to give a more workable and more easily handled ballot paper, and by the other method I suggested you could also increase the quota.</P>
    <P>There has been strong objection to another aspect which again developed without anybody anticipating it, and that is that in the present system, on account of the local councils having very nearly a quota &mdash; I think it is seven from each particular county council&mdash; with the local Deputies, a quota could be got.  There is very strong pressure used and local influence to form a quota, therefore, giving back something like the geographical representation we have in the Dáil.  A question would arise there as to whether you would diminish the number in the county councils.  There has been another objection put up against the county councils, and it was raised, I think, in this debate, that they were not trustworthy, that members elected are not trustworthy to vote.  I think that is a terrible reflection on the whole of our public life.  Personally I think that our whole aim should be, as far as possible, to try not to centralise, but to decentralise, and to give local bodies as much power as we could possibly give them.  But any attempt to move in that direction is frustrated, if there is on the part of local representatives any suggestion that they cannot be trusted as voters, that they are capable of being interfered with, or that they can be easily led away by corrupt influences.  The suggestion to eliminate local representatives altogether, and to deal with the Dáil as the sole electorate, would mean that we would diminish the number in the quota.</P>

      <P>If you are trying to have a Second Chamber in that way, you are simply going to make it a replica of the first one.  It is suggested that under the present system is becomes that.  It could be said that that is what is happening. It is happening because, in the case of the panel candidates, the local bodies and T.D.s with local affiliations, combine to elect some person who is outstanding locally. Therefore, you find, for example, that persons are elected to the Seanad who have been public representatives and who, it is thought, were thrown out by accident.  For instance, the leader of the Opposition in this House was defeated in one election and went into the Seanad.  Some other ex-Ministers also went into the Seanad. These things occur, and I do not think that, limited to a reasonable number, they do any harm.  If people have given considerable public service and if they were regarded as good representatives and had acquired useful knowledge of public affairs, I do not see that there would be any harm in giving them an opportunity in a Chamber with restricted functions of doing work in another connection for the country. We must be careful, however, that the Second House will not have power commensurate with the power of the First House.  If that were so, we should defeat the whole purpose of <Col N="283" /> appealing to the people and getting an expression of public opinion at a particular time.</P>
      <P>In the Constitution, we have provided for a Second Chamber with limited powers.  If there is any question of a change as regards that provision, a Bill to amend the Constitution will have to be brought in, but I take it that that is not the intention of the movers of the present motion.  The motion merely provides for the setting up of a committee to examine how, under the Constitution, a better system of election can be obtained. It was suggested at one period that every person in the State should be registered vocationally and that there should be a nation-wide election, with those registered persons as electors, for the different labour and other vocational panels.  If you did that, I think you would have a Second House which would not fundamentally be very much different from the First House.  That it would add much to the present system, I doubt.  I think that it would hardly be worth while to proceed in that fashion.  I remember considering that suggestion and coming to the conclusion that, if it were adopted, the result would not be commensurate with the labour involved. The suggestion in this motion is that we set up a committee.  The motion does not indicate what type of committee should be set up or how we should proceed to set it up.  With the idea that a committee should be set up to examine the matter in the light of the experience gained, the Government is in agreement and we accept the motion from that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the amendment, I do not think that it would help.  The best thing to do is, I think, to leave the wider motion without any particular directive, other than the directive given in the Constitution.  There is a directive in the Constitution as regards the panels and I do not think that there is need for any special directive beyond that.  The best thing to do would be to set up this committee and give it the widest possible scope in trying to get a satisfactory system of election within the Constitution.  If it is suggested <Col N="284" /> that we should change the Constitution, I remind the House that I have many times challenged anybody to put forward a system which would give us a satisfactory Seanad.  There is dissatisfaction with their Second Chamber in practically every country, for a variety of reasons.  I know that democracy itself can be questioned. People ask why, say, a young girl, under our system, who has thought very little of political matters should have a vote amounting in value to that which an Edmund Burke, an Aristotle or a Plato, who had given deep thought to such matters, would have under similar circumstances. We know that there are weaknesses in democracy but, in the long run, it is the only system that seems to work.  It is quite easy to design a rifle which would be much more accurate than the ordinary service rifle but the service rifle is forged for a particular piece of work and is fitted to the situation in which it would be handled.  So also in these political matters, it is not possible to get a system that is really perfect.  There will be faults in all systems.  On more than one occasion, I have given my view that, whatever its faults, the democratic system works out best in the long run.  In this country, and in most democratic countries, it is based upon universal suffrage.  If we have to depend upon it, I think that it is useless to try by artificial means to introduce checks such as those who are devoted to the idea of a Second House think they can introduce.  We did not devise the Second House from the point of view of being a definite check but rather as a House in which a question might be approached from a slightly different angle and in which new views might be expressed in virtue of which amendments would follow.</P>
    <P>I should like to stop at this point but an attack has been made &mdash; within the limits of Parliamentary etiquette I dare not characterise it as I should like &mdash; upon me personally and upon 11 persons whose names I propose to read and to whose qualifications I propose to refer.  I shall ask any decent person in the country if the Deputy who attacked those persons is worthy to clean their boots.  Some Deputies talk very <Col N="285" /> glibly and very loquaciously here about high principles in public life.  If there is anything detestable in public life, it is the action of those who talk of those principles and who behave on all occasions with a meanness which shows that they are unworthy even to preach those principles.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When the question of nomination by the Taoiseach was suggested, in the first instance, here, I pointed out its difficulties.  It was not a question of my being Taoiseach or anybody else being Taoiseach.  It was a question of the working out of political life in the community.  When this was being accepted, it was accepted on the basis that the Taoiseach would have an opportunity &mdash; having seen how the panel elections and the other elections had worked out, having seen the composition of the Seanad which these had brought about, to the extent to which it had been brought about before nominations took place, and having surveyed the situation&mdash;to use the nomination power to put on the Seanad such people as might represent or speak with a knowledge of certain aspects of the national life which had been neglected or overlooked. That was one basis.  The other basis on which nominations were devised was with the clear idea that the Second House was not to be an Opposition House.  No Government that believes either in itself or in its policy wants to have shackles and chains put upon the actions it considers necessary in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was deliberately foreseen in the case of these nominations that the power of nomination might be used, as it is used in a number of other cases where nomination by the Government takes place to a Second House, to ensure in so far as it could be ensured, that the Second House was not going to be there to nullify the programme which had been put before the people and for which the Government stood.  I have nominated on two or three occasions.  The Deputy who made this attack said that it was all right on the first occasion but what does he say about the last occasion? <Col N="286" /> That there was jobbery.  Jobbery has a certain meaning in the minds of our people.  Where is the jobbery?  What did these people pay for it and what did they get out of it?  What did they sell themselves for?  I shall take them in alphabetical order.</P>
    <P>Seán Campbell was nominated by me because he was a fit and proper person in my opinion to be a member of the Second House.  He was formerly honorary treasurer of the Irish Trade Union Congress, a position certainly comparable to anything that the Deputy who has attacked him has ever achieved.  He was also formerly president of the National Agricultural and Industrial Development Association and he was chairman of the Dublin Printing Trade Group of the Dublin Trades Union Council.  He was honorary secretary of the General Branch of Sinn Féin in the old days, when there was not much to be got out of being a member of Sinn Féin. He was honorary secretary of the Anti-Conscription Committee in 1915. He was a member of the Irish Banking Commission and of the Commission on Vocational Organisation and he had been a member of the Seanad since 1938.  It was not I nominated him to the Seanad in the first instance.  Will the Deputy tell me what was the job I perpetrated and what was the job this man accepted in that nomination?</P>
    <P>I pass on to another nominee &mdash; Dr. Robert Farnan.  He has been for many years an eminent gynaecologist on the staff of the Mater Misericordiæ Hospital.  He was Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in University College, Dublin, for many years.  He is an extensive farmer, a scientific farmer and breeder of pedigree stock, a man of sound commonsense and a good national record. Will the Deputy tell me what job was perpetrated when I appointed him &mdash; when I did myself the honour of appointing him?  Again, I say the Deputy is not worthy to black his boots.</P>
    <P>Thomas Foran &mdash; he was formerly General President of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union.  He was a member of Seanad Eireann since <Col N="287" /> 1923.  He was there from 1923 to 1936, and he has been there again from 1938. Is the Deputy going to tell me that when I nominated him I made a job for Thomas Foran?  Is he going to tell me that Thomas Foran sold himself to me?  The Deputy should be ashamed of himself to make allegations of that sort about decent men, but he has the cheek of the devil.</P>
    <P>T.V. Honan. &mdash; T.V. Honan was at one time President of the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, and for 20 years he was chairman of the Ennis Urban Council.  He was a member of the Seanad from 1934 to 1936, and again since 1943.  He is from my constituency &mdash; Clare.  By my duties here I am prevented from doing things in my constituency which other Deputies have an opportunity of doing.  If I think that a man who has been chairman of the Ennis Urban Council for 20 years, and who has been President of the Association of Municipal Authorities, is worthy of a seat in the Seanad, am I creating a job, or is he selling himself to me, when I nominate him?  Again I say that the Deputy who made the charge against him is not worthy to black his boots.</P>
    <P>Sir John Keane.&mdash;Sir John Keane is said to be the alibi.  Sir John Keane was first nominated by me when he was Governor of the Bank of Ireland. One of the interests supposed to be represented amongst others is the banking interest&mdash;those who are in the commercial and industrial life of the country.  Again I ask, has Sir John Keane sold himself to me, or have I made a job for him?</P>
    <P>Miss Margaret Kennedy.&mdash;Miss Margaret Kennedy is President of the United Conference of the old I.R.A. Associations.  She was Commandant of Cumann na mBan, in complete charge of Cumann na mBan, in the dangerous years from 1919 to 1921.  I made a job for her, too!  I appointed her because I thought she would bring to the Seanad a useful point of view and I felt certain that, if it came to a decision on a question where national issues were involved, there would be no doubt of the way her vote was likely <Col N="288" /> to go in the national interest.  Have I made a job for her, and has she sold herself to me?</P>
    <P>Professor William Magennis.&mdash;Professor William Magennis was Professor of Metaphysics in University College, Dublin, from the time the college was founded.  He was a Senator of the National University during the whole of that period practically, and a member of the Governing Body of his college. He was here in the Dáil and he did something in this Dáil when here that many people would be very glad to have to their credit.  He opposed the proposition with regard to Partition. He did another thing.  He and Colonel Moore brought the attention of the public to the fact that £5,000,000 a year of Irish money was being sent out of the country in a manner in which it should not have been sent and without any real fundamental reason for doing it.  The result was that these sums &mdash; about £100,000,000 was the capital value of the sums involved &mdash; afterwards became the subject of an agreement in which, instead of £100,000,000 capital value, the thing was settled for £10,000,000.  I think Professor Magennis's services to the country, both as an educationist, and as a public representative, would justify anybody in nominating him as a member of the Second House.  Of course, there is a job!  My nominating him was jobbery!</P>
    <P>Next there is the case of Liam O Buachalla.  Liam O Buachalla is Lecturer in Economics through Irish in University College, Galway.  He was President at one period of the Gaelic League and a member of the Coiste Gnotha of that body.  I nominated him and I should like to ask the Deputy what fault he has to find with that nomination.  Is it a job?  The Deputy, who does not mind what he soils with the slime which exudes from him, calls it &ldquo;the father and mother of jobbery&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Pádraic O Maille.&mdash;Pádraic O Maille was good enough at one time in this House to have been chosen as Vice-Chairman of it.  He has spent the greater part of his life in the national service, one way or the other.  He has been devoted to the national language. The first time I saw him was long ago, <Col N="289" /> 1907 or so, at an Ard Fheis of the Gaelic League, in the days when the Gaelic League was strong.  Was it jobbery to appoint him or were his merits such that I dare not appoint him?</P>
    <P>There was Miss Pearse.  I will not soil her name by dealing with it in this connection.</P>
    <P>Matt Stafford &mdash; Matt Stafford is an old man.  He is the longest link we have going back to the Fenian days. He has been in every national movement since then.  If we are now and again to use the opportunity that comes for nomination to honour people, why should we not honour an old veteran of that sort?  One thing I can say, he may not be as glib or as loquacious, and he may not fill as many columns of the reports as the Deputy who has attacked him, but there is one thing certain &mdash; he can be depended upon to know good from evil and to know what is good nationally from what is bad nationally, very much better, I would say, than the Deputy who accused him.</P>
    <P>That is the list, the proposing of which is supposed to have been the father and mother of jobbery.  However, thank God, fortunately our people know Deputy Dillon.  They know his views and they know his judgment. Unfortunately, people outside this country do not know it and the words which he uses are taken abroad by those who want to soil the fame of this country and the good name of this country.  When he talks as he does he is talking about people who have been honoured by the confidence of the nation on many occasions, and when he attacks us in the filthy way in which he does it he is damaging, not me, not these men and women who have been nominated, but he is soiling the whole of our national life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was to get 20 minutes.  It is a very good thing to find that even at this late stage the Taoiseach has now come round to the acceptance of the views which were put up in this House by many members when his fantastic proposals for this fantastic Seanad came before the House.  It was then stated that opportunities for corruption would be there and would be used.  However, in any <Col N="290" /> event, it is accepted now.  The Taoiseach goes further than I would have gone.  I am not sure that he has any right to say it.  He accepts that certain people hold their seats because they have bribed and corrupted.  If that is his condemnation of the system, it is one that we are not parties to, except very unwillingly.  We heard the Taoiseach's dispassionate statement defending himself against the charge of jobbery.  I have here a quotation from himself as to how nominations would be made under the system which he proposed.  Here are his words when he was speaking in the Dáil on the 12th December, 1935, on this question of nominating people:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Is any person so foolish as to think that the Leader of a political Party is in such a position of independence that he could nominate the persons he thinks best?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is before the event &mdash; is any person so foolish as to think that that person could nominate the people he thinks best?</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The history of these nominations shows that people are nominated by the Prime Minister for the time being, who puts into the Seanad people of his own way of thinking, people who have rendered service to him in a political way in the Party, and so on.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is what the ordinary person knows of making or doing a job for a political adherent.  That is the way in which the phrase was used.  In the minds of these people the Seanad is filled with jobbers of that type, and the nominations are particularly characterised by that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had to laugh when the Taoiseach was reading here the list of all those great Irishmen that he nominated. Towards the end of it he mentioned a man that he met at the Gaelic League meeting whose whole service was given to this country.  It did not save an attempt being made on the man's life, and it did not prevent an attempt being made, near O'Connell Bridge, to murder another Deputy of this Dáil, who was coming here to do his duty in opposition to the Taoiseach's viewpoint. Although an attempt was made <Col N="291" /> upon his life, with that grand record of his in Irish history, he has now got to the point that he can be put into the Seanad by the Taoiseach, and the Taoiseach feels he can put him in without anybody suggesting that he had recently become an adherent of the Taoiseach and had got his reward in that way.</P>
    <P>The Emperor Caligula, according to Roman history, decided that he would make a complete mess of the Conscript Fathers of Rome, and it is on record that he nominated his horse to be a member of the Senate.</P>
    <P>History repeats itself.  The Taoiseach has 11 hacks &mdash; and I use that word in the way in which the country understands it &mdash; people who are trotting after the Taoiseach, who will be guided by the pressure of his knees or his touch upon the bridle and will not swerve from the road because he has them bitted and saddled and spurred and under his control.  That is the reason why I quote him again &mdash; the people who have rendered service in a political way to the Party; they are the people who are to be put in and let us forget the nonsense in the Constitution about practical experience or knowledge.  It is Party service that counts.  On the 12th December, 1935, the Taoiseach was honest enough to admit that.</P>
    <P>We have it now accepted, after many years of warning, that there was corruption. Let it be understood how much the corruption was.  The Taoiseach mentioned that our public life is very bad if we have to admit that local authorities are corrupt.  I heard Deputy P.J. Fogarty in this House, when the second County Management Bill was brought in, say that everyone in public life knew there was corruption in local authorities.  I gave him a chance later to give us examples, but he ran away from it.  What did the recent case bring out?  A member of a local authority was entrusted with a Seanad vote.  He put himself on oath that from one contract he had made £16,000 profit.  That contract was given to him by a board, one member of which was a Senator.  That Senator was the man for whom he intended to vote and when an attempt was made <Col N="292" /> to bribe him, he turned his car and went to that Senator.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the £16,000 profit from one contract, he had been in <i>Stubbs'</i> several times, and in the court there was produced a registered judgment.  He waived that aside as being due to embarrassment at certain times.  Since then he has been in <i>Stubbs'</i> again for about £250.  He was questioned as to what were his activities with regard to Seanad elections and he said that it had been his habit always to send his ballot paper over to the chairman of the Party.  He was asked why he did that; was it because there was a suspicion that he had voted contrary to the way in which he promised to vote, and his attitude was that that was what everybody did; everybody had to do it because everybody was under suspicion of being bribed unless the Party managers saw the ballot paper.  That is what we built up and it is from that we are supposed to get a good Seanad.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has now admitted that his system has broken down; that as long as you have a small electorate that sort of thing is possible.  He admits that that sort of thing possibly was happening.  I listened to hear him make suggestions as to how the matter should be remedied.  There is one simple way in which a great improvement can be effected.  This has emerged to the knowledge of anyone dealing with the matter.  Once you got the system of buying votes it became clear that a man who was ready to sell his vote was ready to sell it more than once and when a man went to him with £40 or £50 it was not as a consideration merely to get a promise that his name would go down No. 1; the only safeguard was to get the ballot paper into his hand, because the person who allows himself to be bribed may be bribed a second time. It is very easy to put No. 1 on a ballot paper before a man's eyes and change it afterwards into 100 when his back is turned.  The huge ballot paper gave opportunities for that; it was down to 125 the last time.</P>
    <P>One suggestion has been made repeatedly, a very simple matter of procedure.  Why not insist on the <Col N="293" /> ballot paper being filled in in the polling booth and bring the man up to vote?  You certainly then would do away with a great deal of corruption, because the man who wants to spend his £60 or £70 on a certainty will not feel that it is a certainty.  If the gentleman who is open to corruption goes to the polling booth, he has to take his ballot paper and mark it inside, according to how he desires to vote.  Then the man who wants to buy the vote is at least euchred.  There are other suggestions which can be made.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to find that this motion has been accepted inside the framework of the Constitution.  If necessary, we can debate on another occasion whether it is proper to have a Second House or not.  I think there will be almost unanimity, anyway agreement, over the country that it would be better to have no Second House than to have the present one or one elected by the present system.  If the matter is to be discussed, and if there are people who think of making such a retrograde move as to abolish the second House, I should like to get an opportunity of putting Opposition views before those who are going to vote upon it.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach gets back to the same two old roots he had, both of the French revolution: the Abbé Sieyès, the unfrocked priest who was described as a by-word for political incompetence, and de Condorcet.  It was the Abbé Sieyès who said that if a Second Chamber disagreed with the first it was mischievous and, if it merely agreed, it was then useless. That was put as a syllogism, as a dilemma and a sort of end to the whole question.  I think we have better wisdom than that nowadays. We have discovered in this country, which boasts of democracy, that people can be swayed by argument and what has been described as the clash of mind on mind.</P>
    <P>There is something to be said for having a Second House with limited powers where arguments can be adduced by people in the hope, not of converting the Government but Government supporters, of creating a public opinion by leading it to certain conclusions. We have a Seanad set up <Col N="294" /> under the Constitution with certain powers.  There is no question of that Seanad ever holding up the Government. The power of delay with regard to legislation introduced by a Government amounts to no more than 90 days.  There are certain powers with regard to asking the President whether he will refer to the people a piece of legislation that has been passed as being a matter of national importance. There is power to sit in judgment upon a judge, if ever a case should arise where a motion is put down to remove him for misbehaviour or incapacity. There is power to sit in judgment on the President, if ever an impeachment be taken against him on the ground of misbehaviour.  These are the only powers the Seanad has.</P>
    <P>But the Seanad has this function; it is one of the three this House has.  The classical statement with regard to the powers of any Parliament is that it has something to do with passing and moulding legislation and, secondly, something to do with financial control. So far as financial control is concerned, this House rules; the Seanad has very little say in the matter.  There is a period of merely three weeks' delay. So far as legislation is concerned, it can only delay it at the highest point for 90 days.  But the third function of any Parliamentary Assembly is to inform the public, to be a forum of debate, to be a place where every public grievance can be stated and where public opinion can be created and moulded.  The Seanad has that power. Why should it not have it?</P>
    <P>Nobody here believes, after the incompetence we have had over the years, that the people who are in power are so good that they can be allowed to go along in their own sweet way without being subjected even to the force of argument.  The Seanad has that power.  The Seanad has used that fairly well and it would be a good thing still to give it that power.</P>
    <P>Inside the framework of the Constitution it is still possible, even without operating Article 19, to get a Seanad better than the one we have.  It is easy to make a proposal of a procedural type that will give a better system, and even, by utilising the <Col N="295" /> same panel system, to get a better group of people.  It is also possible to make proposals which will enable those who are nominating bodies to become to some extent, to some fraction of the whole assembly, the electing bodies, the electoral college, and not merely nominating bodies.  It is possible again to operate Article 19 to the extent that the vocational or functional groups or associations or councils should be allowed, not as they are now, merely to nominate, but definitely to elect.  We have to rely in the end upon the honour of certain people.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with what has been said here in the loose way in which Deputy Fogarty said it, that people who are interested in local politics in this country must be castigated as being corrupt or open to corruption. In any event, there are ways of making corruption just not so easy by putting temptation away from them, instead of under their noses, as was done by this fatuous scheme of the Taoiseach's when the original Seanad proposal was brought in.  It would be possible by transferring the electorate to certain other groups and by taking other safeguards to make sure of getting <Col N="296" /> a Seanad better representative of classes of people than the Taoiseach apparently agrees now the present one is.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the motion has been accepted and I suggest that the motion should be adopted as meaning that a Parliamentary Committee be set up, appointed in the usual way by the Committee of Selection, and with the usual powers with regard to calling witnesses and taking evidence.  I think the Committee should not be too large in numbers and that it might usefully have attached to it as advisers, or possibly called as witnesses, members of various Senates.  I should not like anyone who was ever nominated for a position in the Seanad to come in.</P>

      <P>The figures for the values of &ldquo;Total Exports&rdquo; given in Table II of the committee's report are the declared f.o.b. values of the commodities at the time of export including the cost of any transformation they may have undergone by process of manufacture, the cost of transport to the sea or land frontier, etc., whereas the figures for agricultural exports in the next column represent only the amount received first hand by the agricultural community for that portion of its &ldquo;output&rdquo; estimated to have been subsequently exported.  The two sets <Col N="196" /> of figures are, therefore, not comparable and, accordingly, the figures in the Deputy's question do not correctly represent the values of the non-agricultural exports.</P>
      <P>The figures in the committee's table are for the agricultural year (in general the 12 months June to May).  The statistics of imports and exports are already compiled for calendar years and it would be onerous to compile figures for the precise 12 months' periods corresponding to those in the committee's report.</P>
      <P>I am, accordingly, furnishing to the Deputy and publishing in the Official Report a table giving, for the calendar years 1929, 1938 and 1940, the f.o.b. values of those exports which may be regarded as non-agricultural products. It is, of course, impossible to define precisely the term &ldquo;non-agricultural products&rdquo;, but an attempt has been made to include all goods the major increment in the value of which was not contributed by agriculture.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to segregate the value of the parcel post as the exports are not classified by description.</P>
      <P>Following is the table.</P>
      <P Just="Center">DESCRIPTION AND VALUE (f.o.b.) OF EXPORTS, OTHER THAN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, IN EACH OF THE YEARS 1929, 1938 AND 1940.</P>
