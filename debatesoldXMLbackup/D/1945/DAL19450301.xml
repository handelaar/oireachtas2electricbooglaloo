    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state how many meetings of the sub-committee of the Cabinet, dealing with post-war conditions, have been held; if the sub-committee have decided on any definite programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already replied to a number of questions in regard to the work of the Cabinet Committee set up in November, 1942.  The function of the committee, as I have previously explained, is to keep under observation the progress made by Departments in formulating proposals for post-war activities and to make suggestions as to steps which might be taken to expedite planning and the carrying out of preparatory work in existing conditions.  I have also pointed out that the primary responsibility for the preparation of plans rests on the Departments concerned under instructions from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee has held 45 meetings to date.  As to whether it has decided on any definite programme: I have already said that it has had before it and has approved in principle quite a number of programmes including, for example, some relating to agriculture, afforestation, fisheries, housing and other constructional works, transport and communications and general industrial development.  Details of certain of these projects such as rural <Col N="694" /> electrification, arterial drainage, and transport, have already been made public and other plans will be published from time to time according as they reach the appropriate stage.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy knows, a separate branch was established in the Department of Industry and Commerce at the end of 1943 for the purpose of ensuring the execution, on a basis planned in consultation with the various interests concerned, of all building activities in the post-war years.  This branch is about to publish a White Paper setting out details of the measures which it is proposed to take to secure this end.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise again that plans prepared now can only be given effect to gradually in the post-war period according as the supply position improves, and that for some time a system of priorities will have to be operated.  This aspect of the matter will be dealt with in some detail in so far as the building programme is concerned in the proposed White Paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach, or the Government, consider the question of publishing White Papers in connection with major schemes, such as the electrification scheme, where there was a certain amount of publicity before the matter was brought to the attention of this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, that is a somewhat different matter, but I think that this will be brought before the attention of the public, through the Dáil and in other ways.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state (1) the number of completely assembled lorries imported in each of the months of November and December, 1944, and January and February, 1945; (2) the number of completely assembled lorries due for delivery during the months of March and April; (3) the rate of duty payable on completely assembled lorries, and (4) the future policy of his Department regarding the importation of completely assembled vehicles where similar vehicles can be manufactured or assembled in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of completely assembled lorries imported each month during the period from November, 1944, to February, 1945, were eight, 16, 27 and 23, respectively. The figure in respect of the month of February, 1945 covers the period up to the 24th of that month only.</P>
      <P>I have no information as to the number of assembled lorries which are due for delivery in the months of March and April.</P>
      <P>Assembled lorries are at present liable to duty at the rate of 15 per cent., <i>ad valorem</i> (flat rate).</P>
      <P>When it becomes possible to undertake again the assembly and construction of these vehicles the industry will be accorded a reasonable measure of protection against the importation of completely assembled vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the workers engaged in the motor assembly trade here submit that these vehicles could be assembled here; that both the labour and the materials for such assembling are available here, and <Col N="696" /> that of the number of completely assembled lorries, now held up in the customs, something like 300 of them could have been assembled here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware that these lorries could be assembled here in normal times, but the fact is that we cannot procure lorries except in the condition in which they are now imported. Having regard to the scarcity of vehicles of this character in this country, I see no reason why we should not take them in the only form in which we can get them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, in view of the fact that the men engaged in this industry of the assembling of parts, are very much concerned about this matter, will the Minister consider receiving a deputation on behalf of these men, as they are very much concerned, not alone with what is happening at the present moment, but with what may happen in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that a firm of motor agents in Kingston-on-Thames have recently advertised in the Dublin newspapers offering bargains in reconditioned lorries; and, if so, if he will state if it is the policy of his Department to permit the importation freely of these vehicles where the livelihood of many workers in this industry is imperilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that advertisements of the nature referred to have appeared from time to time in the Dublin newspapers.  It is not my policy to discourage for the present the importation of completely assembled commercial vehicles in view of the shortage of these vehicles and the difficulty in procuring them in any condition of assembly since the emergency.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that there is any avoidable delay in the preparation and issue by the Land Commission of copy maps of non-vested holdings.  Every effort is made to deal promptly with applications for copy maps, but time must be allowed for identification of the holding; verification of the particulars; procuring of the relevant estate map (which may be away in the country in use by a local inspector); assessment, notification and receipt of the appropriate fees; and preparation and checking of the copy map.  It is quite out of the question to expect (as some applicants appear to do) the supply of a copy map by return of post.</P>
      <P>As regards the case of County Dublin to which the Deputy refers, the holdings are sometimes so small that it is necessary to requisition 25-inch scale maps from the Ordnance Survey Office, and this causes delay, particularly as maps on this scale are at present in short supply.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy has yet received a letter which I caused to be directed to Dublin Deputies.  The position is, I understand, that the proposal they submitted, to extend the life of the corporation to five years, would be a fundamental change in the whole system of local government, and I could not possibly consider that on a Bill which deals only incidentally with the position in Dublin City.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister <Col N="704" /> and his colleagues to hesitate before they, by their votes, agree to enshrine in this or in any other Bill the vicious proposal contained in the Minister's amendment.  If the amendment is carried by the votes of the majority of the Deputies, it is going to deprive High Court and Supreme Court judges, appointed by this Government and by their predecessors in some cases, of the discretion which they hitherto had of assessing costs according to their own judgment.  I would ask the Minister or any Deputy to quote any case in the history of the Legislature of this State or of any democratic State where parliamentary government is in existence, where the citizen successfully taking action against the State must pay not only his own costs but the costs of the defendant who loses the case.  If that kind of vicious proposal is the right kind of principle to insert in a Bill of this kind, the same principle can be inserted in every other type of legislation under which a case can be made by the citizen against the State or by the State against the citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The majority of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, including the Ministers, are either in receipt of pensions or are entitled to receive pensions under the Act of 1934.  They secured certificates&mdash;properly so, I am sure&mdash; under the cheap and easy method of going before the civil servants nominated by the Referee, who heard their cases and decided them in their favour. I am sure they claim to be the representatives of their colleagues in the Old I.R.A., and, as such, are they, by this amendment, going to make it impossible for all their old colleagues&mdash;good claimants or genuine applicants&mdash;who, according to themselves, did not receive fair and just treatment, to succeed in securing pensions?  Is there going to be one law for Deputies and the deciding or verifying officers and those who have received pensions already and another law in the future for all these cases which every Fianna Fáil Deputy who has spoken has said are still outstanding and have not been fairly treated?  I have heard Deputy after Deputy saying that there was a number of such cases.  Some said there were hundreds.  One Deputy said there <Col N="705" /> were at least 2,000 appellants under the 1934 Act who had not been fairly treated.  Another Deputy said 5,000. I am not sure of the number, but the Minister has certainly admitted there are hundreds.  Is there going to be one law or one kind of procedure for the Minister and the people in privileged positions to get their pensions&mdash;an easy and cheap method&mdash;and another procedure, an impossible or, at any rate, excessively costly method, for these other cases?  By this amendment, if it is inserted in the Bill, they will make it impossible for any good applicant to go to the courts, if he fails to get the necessary justice from the Referee or those who will act for the Referee in disposing of the outstanding claims. That is the issue here, apart from the constitutional question.</P>
    <P>When I read this amendment, early on Monday morning&mdash;I had nobody to guide me legally in the matter and I have had no opportunity since of discussing the matter with any lawyer member of the House&mdash;I said it was the most amazing proposal I had ever seen put on paper by a Minister since I became a member of this House.  If the Old I.R.A. are not going to do their job for the remainder of their colleagues who have not been given justice in the past, either under the 1924 Act or the 1934 Act, I hope if this amendment is enshrined in the Military Service Pensions (Amendment) Bill that the constitutional nature of the amendment will be challenged in the Supreme Court or some other court.</P>
    <P>I have heard, of course, about the method of dealing with applications by the Referee or by those who have been authorised, without legal power, to act for him in the past.  I have had one case brought under my notice within the last few days of a prominent Old I.R.A. man who, at any rate, lost his job in connection with his activities in the pre-Truce and civil war period, who was out of work for nearly seven years after the civil war ended, who did not go back to his old profession and who, when called before the Referee, was not sworn.  Until I got the particulars of that case, I always understood that the first thing that happened when a <Col N="706" /> person went before the Referee was that he was sworn and, in many cases, if not in all cases, was passed on to civil servants who took the evidence or cross-examined the applicant.  That is a case, at any rate, that was not properly dealt with under the terms of the 1934 Act.  This Bill, of course, is to legalise the irregularities which the Minister and everybody else admits have taken place in dealing with the applications already disposed of.</P>
    <P>I have also been informed by a verifying officer whom I know very well that when some of these appeals were being dealt with before the local brigade committee, a verifying officer in one case at any rate stated that there was only a limited amount of money allocated for every area in connection with the payment of military service pensions.  Therefore, of course, the boys who got in first scooped up whatever was made available by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the sincerity&mdash;I put it that way&mdash;of the Minister and his colleagues and I ask them to say whether or not they would be justified in prescribing, under the terms of this amendment, a different kind of procedure for dealing with the remaining cases from that which was adopted in the past and under which their own claims were dealt with and approved. That is the issue involved in this amendment, apart from the grave constitutional issue that I believe is involved and that will have to be raised if this amendment is inserted in the Bill.</P>

He talks about the difference in the pensions, the difference in the methods of securing the pensions for Ministers and <Col N="707" /> the ordinary man in the street.  If the Deputy has any experience whatever of the court of the Referee, he will know that every person that goes before the Referee is equal, each one getting the same amount of attention.  The suggestion contained throughout the Deputy's speech is that there is one law for one person and another law for another.</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact, we were listening to a Second Reading speech.  I was rather surprised that the Deputy was allowed to develop his speech in the way he did.  In fact, I think I am correct in saying that he repeated a certain amount of his speech on the Second Reading.  If he did not, then he took advantage to say at this stage what he forgot to say on the Second Reading.  It is typical of the Deputy, as it was typical of the Deputy last night to rush in here for the first time in the discussion and draw the attention of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to the fact that there was not a House, when he had come in for the first time, for about five minutes, and had with him only one other Deputy of his Party.  If the Deputies of this Party were supposed to be displaying a lack of interest, as was suggested, what greater interest was being taken by the Deputy's Party?</P>

      <P>Another suggestion which the Deputy made and which is quite unfounded is that there was a limited amount of money allocated for the various areas.  I doubt very much if the Deputy believes that, although he stated it.  He must surely know, as every other Deputy in the House <Col N="708" /> knows, that the judge heard the cases irrespective of the number of applicants that came from any area, and that there was only one thing required and that was proof of service.  If the applicant was able to prove service to the Referee and his board, the applicant got justice.  If there are any people in respect of whom the Deputy has any doubts as to whether they got justice or not&mdash;we will leave out the question of justice&mdash;if there are any cases where he has any doubt about their not having got what in their opinion they were entitled to, there is there, within the Act, the specific remedy for dealing with that matter. The applicants in whom the Deputy is interested can very easily take advantage of that particular clause in the Act.</P>

If anyone gets anything out of the costs, it will be the counsel who will be appearing on behalf of the applicant.

      <P>So far as this amendment is concerned, its purpose is as much to protect the applicant who, to <Col N="709" /> my mind, will be exploited in respect of bringing these cases into court, as the State.

      <P>The men concerned in this are people who are being induced to bring their cases into court irrespectice of what chance they have of succeeding.  All that the court is doing in these cases is granting a rehearing and not, as some Deputies seem to suggest, granting pensions.  The decision of the court does not do anything of the kind.  It merely grants a rehearing. These men have already got a hearing.  They got a hearing with all the facilities that every other member of the forces who applied got.  If, in their opinion, they can produce any more or any better evidence than they have already produced, there is, as I have informed Deputy Davin, the means there in the Act to go forward as often as they like, as often as they can produce new evidence.  If they can convince the Referee eventually, as some 500 have been able to do, through the medium of evidence which was not formerly available, they too will get pensions.  I think that is as much as can be done at the moment.  The 70 cases which have already been dealt with will cost between £3,000 and £4,000 and that money is just being handed out for the sake of the people who stand up in court and talk&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>The most peculiar thing about this Bill, the debate on which I have not so far participated in, is not so much what is being done to men and women who are making applications under the 1934 Act as the extent to which the Minister is violating very many basic principles in relation both to the ordinary law of the country and the ordinary rights of the citizens.  We had another example of that in the Customs (Amendment) Bill.  It is one thing to recognise that there is an unhappy state of affairs that has to be remedied; it is another thing to remedy that by violating certain principles which are important not only to applicants under the 1934 Act but to the citizens of the country as a whole and the members of this House.  It seems to me that, in the heat of the debate, we are tending to lose sight of these factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this particular amendment the Minister takes it upon himself to say that he wants to protect those persons who have initiated proceedings because, if they do recover any costs, it will be no benefit to them, but only to the members of the legal fraternity. Something of the same line was taken by Deputy O Cléirigh from another angle yesterday.  If I instruct solicitor and counsel to pursue a case on my behalf in the High Court and they accumulate costs on my behalf, somebody has to pay them.  Surely it is not equitable to say that, merely because certain people might take advantage of flaws in the Act to incur costs from a professional point of view, we should step in and make a drastic change in the discretionary power of the courts. That is the important issue.  It is not a question of whether we are to be involved to the extent of several thousands of pounds of public money. There is something more important than that.  Only the other day we were <Col N="711" /> given information by the Minister for Justice in regard to expenses incurred by the State in law costs and many of us, including the Minister for Justice, were of the opinion that a good deal of the expense incurred could have been avoided; in other words, the money of the taxpayers can be wilfully and, in many cases, foolishly expended, so long as it is expended on behalf of officers of this State; but, when an ordinary citizen desires to avail of the courts to protect himself against the State, then we are to step in and deny him certain rights to which he is entitled.</P>
    <P>The starting point of this Bill was the departure from procedure laid down in the original Act.  When the original cases were first listed, surely it was open both to the Minister and his legal advisers to check up on the position and see if there was a likelihood of the court ruling that the procedure had been departed from, and either accepting that position and making the necessary corrections or coming before the House at that time, instead of allowing the cases to pursue their way through the courts until finally we get to the point where certain litigants have committed themselves in regard to costs for professional services.  Now we are to step in and say at the last moment that we, by virtue of the powers of this House, are going to deny them any relief whatever that the court may see fit to grant; relief in relation to costs, not arising out of any misdemeanour or any act of omission or commission on the part of the litigants, but arising out of a departure from the procedure laid down in the Act by servants of this House and of the Minister.  Because of an effort, apparently, to correct what the Minister said is a very difficult position, we are, step by step, to depart from long-established and long-accepted principles.  It seems to me that what we are doing in this Bill is not protecting either the members of the Old I.R.A. or those who desire to make applications under the Act and under this amending Bill, but using the unfortunate position that has arisen <Col N="712" /> out of the 1934 Act to bring ourselves and the law of the State that we are supposed to uphold into ridicule in the eyes of the citizens.  Unfortunately the Minister, in taking the easiest way out of a very difficult situation, is doing violence not only to his conscience but to this House, because he is able to force through this Bill by the aid of his majority.  He is doing violence to principles that had been established over a long period in this House.  I think it is most unfortunate that we should be forced to go along this particular path.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene further in the debate, but in view of the Minister's remarks which cast aspersions on the legal profession, I think I am entitled to rise again and to explain that I had no professional interest in this matter good, bad or indifferent.  None of these cases has brought any grist to my mill.  I am entirely disinterested as far as that goes.  I think it unfair of the Minister and of the Taoiseach to describe the legal profession as attempting to set up an El Dorado out of the proceedings which are the subject of this Bill. Everybody knows that if you go to litigation, costs must necessarily be incurred. There are court fees of all kinds to be paid.  The solicitor who does the correspondence has to be paid.  The counsel who gives his opinion on the case and has to present it in court has to be paid, but these are not the major portion of the costs. The legal gentlemen do not get the lion's share and it is unfair of the Minister to come here and represent these costs as being, as it were, taken into the maw of the legal profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was not the legal profession that promoted the litigation that is now the subject of this Bill.  This litigation arose out of a number of genuine grievances of a large body of patriotic Irishmen who felt so keenly on the matter that they, through their brigades all over the country, collected money to get the opinion of learned counsel as to whether they had a case. Having got the opinion that they had a stone-wall case to go to the courts, they collected further moneys to have <Col N="713" /> their case threshed out in court. Surely the solicitor and counsel who appeared on behalf of the I.R.A. men in court are entitled to a fair recompense for their labours on behalf of these men?  Surely no aspersion should be cast by any Minister on counsel simply because they acted for these men?  Is it the Minister's contention that solicitors or counsel, unlike any other section in the country, should work for nothing?  I think the Minister's comment is uncalled for.  I do not wish to say anything further. Personally I am not concerned with the professional aspect of the matter. I think a great injustice has been done to a body of Irishmen who risked life and limb in dark and evil times for their country.  That is the kernel of the matter.  I think also that the Minister in trying to rectify what was perhaps an impossible situation has gone the wrong way, as Deputy Larkin and others who spoke against the Bill have pointed out.  You are sacrificing the rights of these decent Irishmen; you are violating principles of law which have operated in this country heretofore and you are introducing a procedure which is a negation of all law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister tried to frighten any Deputies who might listen to him too attentively by giving the costs of the several cases brought before the court at a figure of something like £4,000.  He indicated that there were 400 further cases pending which, if this Bill is not passed in its present form, will cost the taxpayers £25,000.  How does he arrive at £25,000 as representing the cost of 400 cases not yet heard and that are never likely to be heard if this Bill becomes law?  Is it not the fact that the 70 cases which cost £4,000 had to be brought to the courts by members of the Old I.R.A., as citizens claiming constitutional rights of which they were deprived by the Referee or those who were authorised to act for the Referee in certain circumstances?  Was it not the defective nature of the legislation contained in the Act of 1934, or the method by which the Government administered the Act of 1934 that was the cause of bringing these cases <Col N="714" /> before the court?  I should like to assume, and on that matter perhaps Deputy O Cléirigh, an eminent member of the legal profession, might assure us, that this Bill is now watertight and that it will prevent in future any of these cases coming to court.  If that is not so I do not know what the Bill was brought in for.  I think, however, it is possible in the best regulated communities and with the most sincere desire on the part of any Minister to do justice to all citizens of the State, even after the Bill becomes law that cases to be reheard will still leave one or two outstanding in which the members of the House will feel that the applicants have not been fairly and squarely dealt with.  Is it not proper that if a few Old I.R.A. men still believe, after their cases have been reheard, that they have not been given the justice which they were entitled to receive under the original Act or under the terms of this amending Bill, they should have the right as citizens to go to the highest court of the land where they may get judgment in their favour?  If this Bill passes, we may anticipate that the same kind of amendments will be introduced in regard to every other Bill, which means that the judges of the country, instead of being real judges will become civil servants, directed, as they will be directed in cases of this kind, to give costs against the plaintiff who wins his case, and double costs against a plaintiff who loses his case.  Surely to goodness ordinary members of the Fianna Fáil Party will see the seriousness of depriving judges of the power of discretion which they had in the past in dealing with cases of this kind in which the rights of citizens who have not got fair treatment from a Minister under any particular Act are concerned.  It is not too late to appeal to the Minister, I hope, to review the serious decision he has made.  I hope that he will hold over this matter for further consideration.  I should like to know has he submitted this amendment for the consideration of the Attorney-General and is it being put forward with the consent of the legal advisers of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I appealed to the <Col N="715" /> Minister yesterday evening to withdraw this amendment.  It is quite clear that this amendment is not necessary because Section 2 of the Bill has already been passed.  Section 2 of this Bill is to prevent anybody from going to court after 1st February.  Between 1st February and the passing of this Bill there are people who may go to court and win their cases, and the Minister requires this section in order to make sure that, if they do, they will get no benefit and they will pay all the costs.  If the Minister tells us that that is the attitude, then we can understand it.  We may argue against the injustice of it, but that is what he is doing.  I do not think anybody will deny that if, before this Bill is signed by the Uachtarán and becomes the law of the land, there are rights that might be obtained by any people, they should not be denied them.  The Minister is going to deny those rights.  Not only that, but if those people avail of the rights which the law of the land gives them they are going to be punished by having to pay both their own and the Minister's costs.  The Minister is not accurate when he says that the benefits would go to the solicitors.  If this section is included when this Bill becomes law, the applicant then has to pay his own and the Minister's costs.  Therefore, there is a direct loss imposed upon the applicant.  I hold no brief for the legal profession, but I think the Minister should consider withdrawing the innuendo which he applied to Deputy Coogan&mdash;that he knew the reason why Deputy Coogan was advocating this.  I do not think that is a fair argument.</P>

      <P>It is news to me. Speaking as a distinguished member of the legal profession&mdash;those are Deputy Davin's words&mdash;I might have taken a different view altogether of the amendment if it had been hinted to me beforehand that not only was it intended to benefit all the Old I.R.A. men, but also intended by the Opposition to bring at least £4,000 safe money into the pockets of members of my profession.  That is a new angle on this Bill.  I am proud to see that members of the various Parties are prepared to do that at the expense of the taxpayers.  It is an advance from the narrow-minded, class type of legislation and argumentative politics that Deputy Larkin and other Deputies put forward from time to time.  There is no class distinction here.  The lawyer is entitled to collect his fees, on chance <Col N="717" /> if you like, under this Bill, and for that reason the amendment here now must be defeated, and the members of my profession must get £4,000 or £5,000 of easy money, the safest money they ever budgeted for, by taking their chance&mdash;which is really no chance&mdash;in launching all the claims they can get on their lists between now and the day on which this Bill is to become law, because every case they register is a dead cert for a kill and for costs against the State, but in not one single case will there be the slightest bit of benefit to any member of the Old I.R.A. organisation.  I argued that yesterday, and that is the only point in which I am interested.  Will the bringing of any further single case before the courts, on the same grounds as it was brought heretofore, mean the slightest bit of benefit to any member of the Old I.R.A. organisation?  The answer is: &ldquo;No, not one single benefit&rdquo;.  I challenge any member of the Opposition to contradict that.  It may bring a fresh hearing on the same basis as that on which the case was heard before, but there will be no decision other than the decision that was given before, unless there is a change of tactics, a change of values in estimating what military service is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no argument on this amendment that if those cases are heard by the court there should be a change of heart as far as the awarding of pensions is concerned, or a change of values as far as the Referee is concerned in deciding on the claims so heard.  Therefore, without the slightest doubt, it is the intention that members of the legal profession should benefit by having 4,000 cases heard at a cost of several thousand pounds.  I know it does, if you like, deny certain citizens certain benefits, but there are the bigger issues to be considered&mdash; whether it is wise in the interests of the State to deny certain rights which are established, and remember those rights have been established by the court decision recently given.  It is because those rights have been established that this Bill had to be introduced. There was a technical flaw, if you like.  Forty thousand cases should be brought before the courts and a <Col N="718" /> favourable decision given.  What argument can Deputy Davin or anybody else put forward against the 40,000 cases being brought before 1st April or whenever this Bill comes into operation?  A certain number could be brought, because they have been listed; roughly 400 cases have been listed.  Why not the 40,000?  What right is there to give rights to 400 and refuse them to the balance of the 40,000?  Is not that the point?  Does Deputy Davin argue that 40,000 people should go before the courts to get the obvious decision, with costs against the State?</P>

      <P>You are arguing that 40,000 people who have certain rights should get a hearing.  Are you prepared to allow the expenditure on all those cases to go into the hands of members of the legal profession, distinguished or otherwise, without any benefit accruing to the men whom we all, according to our arguments, want to benefit&mdash;the members of the Old I.R.A.?  That is the point, and no Deputy has yet proved in argument here that if you brought the 40,000 cases before the court you will benefit even one member of the Old I.R.A. by the court decision.  But you are undoubtedly going to benefit the members of a certain profession.</P>

      <Col N="719" /> It has been argued that many people have gone to expense and have incurred costs.  That is not so.  They have not incurred costs; they have only given instructions to bring their cases before the courts.  That may mean some cost, all right, but the amount would be very small.  The cases have not yet been taken.  It is when the cases are taken to court and when you have set the legal wheels in motion that the costs will be incurred. You will not be depriving any Old I.R.A. members of costs.</P>

      <P>We have listened to a very extraordinary speech and I think if the Deputy will examine it when the Official Report is issued at the end of the week he, too, will consider it a very extraordinary speech.  The Deputy really spoke with two voices. In the first place, he tried to convey the impression&mdash;he and other members of his Party tried to convey the same impression during the past fortnight&mdash; that members of the Opposition have said that the fact of I.R.A. members having their cases heard before the High Court is equivalent to granting them pensions.  I defy Deputy O Cléirigh to indicate when and where any member of Parties in Opposition made such a statement.  On the contrary, Deputy O Cléirigh and the members of his Party, especially Deputies who are also members of county councils, when confronted with resolutions condemning the Government for the action they are taking, went out of their way to tell the other members of the county council that this Bill was brought in only to validate pensions already granted.  That was their stock argument all over the country.  Notwithstanding that, there are Deputies who have gone the whole way with the Minister in trying to take constitutional rights from the people of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that this is something more than a Bill to amend an Act; it is really an amendment of the Constitution. I contend that everybody has a perfect right to go to the highest court in the land in order to secure justice. Deputy O Cléirigh tells us, as the <Col N="720" /> Taoiseach has told us, that what has happened in so far as the Referee and the tribunal are concerned was what was in his mind; but the law of the country cannot be interpreted by what is in the Taoiseach's or Deputy O Cléirigh's mind.  The law laid it down very definitely that a certain procedure should be adopted.  That procedure has not been adopted and people who were prepared to give their lives for this country have taken advantage of the only avenue open to them by going to the High Court in order to secure that the legislation passed by this House would be put into operation in their favour.  I do not see anything wrong about that.  Deputy O Cléirigh talks about lawyers on chance.  I do not think that is a very happy phrase. I do not think the Deputy should refer to the members of any profession in that way.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will behave himself.  Deputy O Cléirigh says that this does deprive some people of certain rights, but there are <Col N="721" /> greater things.  I cannot understand that.  Surely there are no greater things than the rights of the people of this country.  The people are entitled to their constitutional rights. Yesterday, when it suited Deputy O Cléirigh's argument, he told us that the cases that had gone before the High Court were test cases.  If they are test cases, then the Minister should, from a constitutional point of view, agree to hear all the other cases that have been turned down.  A test case to me has no other meaning.</P>
      <P>In the amendment we are discussing the Minister claims extraordinary powers.  He wants to ensure that nobody will go to the High Court between now and the passage of this Bill, which Deputy O Cléirigh expects will be about the 1st April.  Perhaps it is a good day, April Fool's Day. Nobody will be able to go to the High Court, because the dice have been loaded against him.  Surely the Minister ought to be satisfied with getting this Bill through the Dáil and not let us have any more retrospective machinery placed at his disposal in order to prevent good Irishmen from getting the rights to which they are entitled.</P>

      <P>As usual, propaganda has troubled Deputy O Cléirigh very much.  His view is that every Deputy who stands up on this side of the House has only propaganda in view &mdash;that with such Deputies propaganda is No. 1.  There is an old saying and it is a true one, that a guilty conscience haunts a guilty mind.  The Minister referred to the taxpayers and he said: &ldquo;I should consider the taxpayers&rdquo;.  I agree.  It is the duty of every member of this House to consider the taxpayers; but surely the Minister will agree that the taxpayers would not be considered by interfering with the rights of ordinary citizens.  As Deputy O Cléirigh knows perfectly well, in many instances his profession will not take a case without being sure, win, lose or draw, that they will get paid.</P>

      <P>The Deputy spoke of the people's rights.  The right of the people of this country is the right to take their cases to court, and yet this amendment tells the people who are to act for them, solicitors and counsel whom they have to get to state their cases: &ldquo;You must depend on Pat Murphy, the Old I.R.A. man, for payment of your expenses and he is not able to pay them.&rdquo;  Therefore, that solicitor or counsel, distinguished or otherwise, will not take the case when he knows he cannot get his costs.  I ask the Minister to withdraw this amendment which I regard as a desperate effort on his part.  I wonder how does it compare with the circular sent out in the different counties by some T.D's explaining this Bill. Deputy Killilea referred to my statement at a county council meeting.  I wonder, when I bring back this amendment which says to these men that, even though they win their case in court, they must pay their own expenses, or that, as they are not able to pay, the legal profession will not represent them and therefore they cannot go to court, how it will be regarded.</P>

      <P>It is <Col N="723" /> very interesting to hear some of the speeches made here to-day on this amendment.  The fact of the matter is that according to this Bill any case entered after 1st February, even though a conditional order is granted, will not be reheard, but without this amendment, even though an Old I.R.A. man whose case had been entered in the courts did not win a rehearing against the law as proposed to be made in this Bill his lawyer would get all the expenses involved.  Deputy O Cléirigh made a calculation&mdash;4,000 cases reheard at £50 each, or £200,000. I can understand people making the case that the Supreme Court decision should have been allowed to stand and that all the 40,000 cases should be reheard under the conditions they laid down, but I do not know what case there is for this State, the taxpayers of the State, paying £200,000, not to secure a rehearing for an Old I.R.A. man under the terms of the Supreme Court decision, but to secure £200,000 for the lawyers.</P>
      <P>There was a system in vogue in certain cities of the world where lawyers who sat in their offices and could not attract clients took to the streets and became ambulance chasers.  They were a disreputable crowd and regarded as such by the honourable men of the profession.  Not all the lawyers in this country have since 1st February canvassed Old I.R.A. men who are without knowledge of the Bill or how the law stood, but one gentleman alone, in his own immediate neighbourhood, got 447 men to agree to enter their cases in the courts.  Suppose this amendment does not go through.  What will be the result in these 447 cases?  They are entered in the courts and the Bill, without this amendment, goes through. They cannot be reheard according to Section 2, but the fact is that the lawyer, because he has the 447 signatures to whatever papers are put into court, will draw a cold £23,500 from the people of this country.  Deputy Davin may laugh but that is the fact.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Davin and Deputy Donnellan could succeed in defeating this amendment, this particular gentleman would draw his £23,500, but the 447 men would be no better off. They would not get a rehearing under the other clauses of the Bill.  It is all very well for some Deputies to talk about the rights of the citizens.  The citizens have to be protected by the Oireachtas against court decisions which would create chaos.  The Supreme Court has no responsibility for the results of its decisions, but this House has.  The Supreme Court tomorrow by interpreting some old Act could create chaos in many ways and this House would have to say that as such and such results would flow from its interpretation of the law, causing chaos and disruption in the country, the law would have to be amended, or a new law introduced to prevent these results from flowing from its interpretation of the law as it stood.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court had not to administer the 1924 and 1934 Acts and it can form a very detached judgment on them, but the Oireachtas and the people of this country have to have the matter settled in a reasonable way. It is being settled here.  The ill-effects which the Supreme Court's decision would have on the country are being prevented, so far as is humanly possible, by this Bill, and there is no disrespect of the law in seeing that the laws which are in force, or which are said to be in force by the Supreme Court, are in fact enforceable and give reasonable justice to the people.  It is only justice to the Old I.R.A. man and the people of the State that the I.R.A. pensions proceedings of all kinds should be dealt with and wound up as quickly as is reasonably possible.  This Bill proposes and makes an effort to ensure that that will be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is an Old I.R.A. man in the country who would be interested in securing for ambulance-chasing lawyers a sum of £200,000 without its resulting in even one case, apart from the 70 already decided by the Supreme Court, being reheard. <Col N="725" /> Every effort has been made under the procedure operated by the various judges who acted as referees to date to give a fair hearing to all the applicants. As the Minister pointed out, there is still in the 1934 Act a clause which gives to any of the 40,000, as well as to the 70 who have got a Supreme Court decision for rehearing, the right to have their cases reheard if they can bring forward evidence not previously available.  The 70 who have had their cases adjudged by the Supreme Court have the same right to bring forward evidence that was not previously available, if it is available, in order to back up the cases which they have lost long ago.  I think that this House would be very foolish indeed if it were to take up the attitude that, when a court declares the law to be other than this House wants it to be, and other than what it is in the interests of the people it should be, it cannot be amended.  The Supreme Court have their function, a very useful function indeed.  In this particular case, by giving a decision that the law is as they say it is, would lead to complete disruption.  It would lead to a very grave injustice to the men who would be strung along for another number of years, as well as to the people of the country who have to find the taxes which are paid to the State, particularly if those taxes are to be frittered away in court cases, and in large sums to be given to the ambulance-chasing type of lawyer.</P>

      <P>The Minister is like a cooing dove, but I think it would have been preferable if he had left the dissertation that he has given us on law to Deputy O Cléirigh, who put his foot into it quite openly and unashamedly.  The Minister seems to have overlooked one or two points. Everyone recognises that a difficult situation has arisen in regard to the procedure laid down in the 1934 Act. Nobody is taking up the point of view that this House has not the power to remedy defects in the existing law. What objection is taken to is the method by which the remedy is being applied.  May I point out to the Minister and to Deputy O Cléirigh that on <Col N="726" /> the Second Reading of the Bill a very mild, and, I thought, constructive suggestion was made.  It was this, that the House as a whole, and not the political Parties, would try to find a way out of the dilemma.  The Government Party, however, are persisting with the Bill and with their remedies to deal with the situation.  They can hardly blame us then if our criticism is somewhat sharp as to the remedies they are proposing.  It is correct to say that some 70 persons&mdash;former applicants&mdash;have obtained orders from the High Court.  It was also correct for the Minister to say that 40,000 more could make application.  Is it not also correct to say that there are a number of others who have already instructed their solicitors and have entered into commitments in regard to legal-costs?  Since those persons have taken advantage of the existing law and have entered into commitments which they were entitled to enter into, is it right that we should suddenly step in all because we believe, as the Minister has said, that there are ambulance-chasing lawyers prepared to take a chance?  In order to do that, are we also to penalise individuals who, quite properly, took legal action to expose the position that has arisen under the 1934 Act because of the failure of the Minister or his officials to carry out the procedure laid down or because of the failure of this House to lay down a workable procedure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely the Minister recognises that the cases that were taken to court, and in respect of which orders have been taken, were not, in the ordinary sense, individual cases.  These were cases that were representative of a group of persons who had consulted together and had possibly received collective advice.  I think it is correct to say that far more than the 70 who have succeeded in obtaining orders from the court are already committed to the payment of expenses.  Is it a fair proposition that we should step in and arbitrarily decide that these men are not entitled to any relief in relation to the expenses which they have incurred, particularly in view of the fact that all this has arisen because of a defect, due <Col N="727" /> either to the Minister or to this House? Surely we can find some way other than this of stopping the ambulance-chasing in order to get out of what is admittedly a very difficult situation. We should not adopt the method of doing things that, in themselves, are wrong.</P>
    <P>Deputy O Cléirigh has been referred to as a distinguished member of the legal profession.  I think it is a good thing that the members of his profession do not give us the type of lecture that we have had to listen to from him this evening.  Recently, there has been a great deal of talk about reconstituting the Second Chamber on a vocational basis.  I think that Deputy O Cléirigh is himself the best argument against that because if his speech this evening is to be taken as typical of the contributions that we are going to get from members of that profession on matters affecting the profession, then I think we had better keep to the political paths where we are likely to get a little common sense and, I suggest, some little honesty.</P>
    <P>The Deputy sat here during the Second Reading debate.  He knew that we had tried to get an all-Party committee to find a happy way out of the present situation.  Yet, he charged us with completely attempting to ignore the difficulties of the Minister and with trying to make political propaganda out of them.  He asked if we had considered that a number of persons may find themselves in difficulties in relation to the amendment we are discussing, and, further, why we did not claim the right for the 40,000 also. He deliberately cited the fact that we had a division on that very point yesterday.  He proceeded in that way right down the list, the suggestion being that the only persons in this House who have any interest in the welfare of the Old I.R.A. are those who sit on that side of the House.  Running right through Deputy O Cléirigh's contribution, and that of many other speakers on the Government Benches, was the suggestion that, since we have got into this difficult position and since there are certain <Col N="728" /> possible financial commitments that may be thrown on the State and on the taxpayer, we are just entitled to do anything, even though our action transgresses against the ordinary accepted principles.  The suggestion is that we can deprive citizens of their lawful rights, and then defend ourselves by saying that, in our judgment, we are doing what is best.  A wiser attitude was adopted on another occasion when it was said that &ldquo;it would be far better that the whole structure of the State should be placed under the greatest stress and strain rather than that an injustice should be done even to one citizen.&rdquo;  We seem, however, to be departing from that principle.  I agree that it is important to save the taxpayers' money.  May I point out that, because of the failure to prepare cases for the State in other instances, we have had to hand out the taxpayers' money, and yet we do not seem to worry about it?  The important point is not whether the Supreme Court or the High Court was right in law, but whether, in respect of certain citizens of this State, we should step in and interfere with a certain right and prerogative which the Supreme Court has enjoyed up to this.  That is important.  We could deal with what the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures referred to as ambulance-chasers if, instead of the Government trying to push through its own arbitrary view, it was prepared to listen to advice, not from my side of the House only but from those intimately concerned with the carrying out of the Act.  This Party is interested not only in getting equitable treatment for applicants under the 1934 Act but in getting a system of machinery that will not merely resolve the present tangle but leave all Parties satisfied that they did the best under the circumstances and with the feeling that, whatever the difficulties, fresh dissatisfaction and friction will not arise.  I suggest that, even now, the Minister might reconsider the terms of this amendment and see if it is not possible to do what is desired without taking such drastic powers in relation to what is the prerogative of the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>Deputy Larkin must be aware of the public history of these cases.  Last year, a few cases were entered in the courts against the procedure upon which the referees have been acting since 1934.  A couple of those cases were decided and a remainder, numbering about 70, was listed for hearing.  The decision of the Supreme Court having been given in the couple of cases to which I have referred, the Government immediately announced that they proposed to accept that decision as not merely binding in the couple of cases decided but in the remaining 70 cases.  No action was taken, and no action is proposed in this Bill, to deprive any one of those 70 claimants of his full and complete rights under the law, with all the costs going to his lawyer.  Long before the 70 cases had been entered, as a pure matter of form, for judgment, the Government had announced that the parties concerned would get their complete rights and their costs.  In making that announcement, the Government stated that they did not propose to grant costs in any future cases that might be entered.  The law, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, would have caused such chaos and disruption that no Government could take responsibility for the consequences. No sooner was this public warning given, that no further costs would be allowed in cases listed in future, than certain gentlemen&mdash;let us call them &ldquo;ambulance-chasing lawyers&rdquo; to distinguish them from the honourable professions of solicitor and barrister&mdash;thought that they could, by merely collecting a list of names and by entering cases in the courts, obtain £50 per head.  A gentleman in one small district in the country proposed to enter 447 cases and draw £23,000 simply by canvassing for the names of people.  This amendment would not be submitted if that &ldquo;ambulance chasing&rdquo; had not occurred.  The Government would have been doing less than its duty if it had allowed the taxpayers' money to be <Col N="730" /> squandered by giving a cold £23,000, which was not going to forward his clients' cases, into the hands of this gentleman.  Under this Bill, if it goes through, his 447 clients, even if they got an order from the court, would not get the advantage of the rehearing which the 70 original cases got, but this gentleman would get his £23,500.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 3, Sir.  Of course, it is true to say that once Section 2 of this Bill has been passed there is very little use in arguing on Section 3, but there are so many restrictions upon the rights of applicants in asserting their claims&mdash; particularly in view of certain things that can be done by the Minister&mdash; that I feel that Section 3 should not be passed by the House.  I understand that we are now discussing an amendment to Section 3.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 27:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the section after the word &ldquo;power&rdquo; in line 46 the words:&mdash;&ldquo;and where an appeal by a brigade committee has been made on behalf of an applicant to the Minister to exercise the power conferred on him by sub-section (5) of Section 8, and sub-section (1) of Section 13 of the Act of 1934 the Minister shall refer back to the Referee each such appeal and that in such case the evidence of the nominees of the brigade committee may be accepted as sufficient evidence to discharge the onus of proof in each case: Provided always that the applicant shall have the right to give oral evidence and call any witnesses that he may consider necessary and that no person save the Minister shall have the right to call rebutting evidence and where such rebutting evidence is being called a summary of such evidence shall be forwarded to the applicant 14 clear days before hearing or rehearing.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is an important amendment and I ask the Minister to accept it.  In Section 4 the Minister fixes a final date after which he cannot exercise the power that Deputy O Cléirigh and others dwelt on.  After 1st January, 1946, the Minister shall not have the right to refer a case back to the Referee for reconsideration, no matter what additional evidence may be available.  The Minister is now binding himself by statute to take away that right.  The date mentioned in the Bill, January 1, 1946, is a positive one and does not give much time.  It would be true to say that great hardship will always exist, no matter what date is fixed.  Section 4 reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;On and after the 1st day of January, 1946, the power conferred on the <Col N="734" /> Minister by sub-section (5) of Section 8 of the Act of 1934 and the power conferred on the Minister by sub-section (1) of Section 13 of the Act of 1934 shall cease to be exercisable, save in respect of any report in reference to which the Minister has, before the said date, received an application or request for the exercise of that power.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That power is taken from sub-section (5) of Section 8 of the Act of 1934.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a report has been made by the Referee under this section on an application for a service certificate, the Minister may, on the ground that evidence not available prior to the making of such a report has since become available, request the Referee to review such report, and the Referee shall thereupon review such report and, after considering such additional evidence and any evidence which the person to whom such report relates, may adduce, may either, as he thinks proper, confirm or vary such report.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sub-section (6) of the same section reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where the Minister requests the Referee to review a report under this section on the grounds that evidence not available prior to the making of such a report has since become available, he shall inform the person to whom such report relates of such request, and, unless such request was made on the motion of such person, furnish him with a statement of such evidence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I move this amendment in order to clarify the position.  If the Minister accepts the amendment it means that instead of being forced to hear a number of cases, he would only hear cases on which a brigade committee made representations or submitted further evidence on behalf of applicants. From information at my disposal as a member of a brigade committee I know that the number of cases is not large. It would only be 5,000 or 6,000 in all. Even if there were 6,000 cases I think a rehearing on additional evidence would meet much of the criticism that <Col N="735" /> has been levelled against the administration of the Act, and would eliminate a large number of errors that have been committed, not only by the Referee and by brigade committees, but by everybody else who gave evidence.  It was only on re-examination that mistakes were finally established. On the Second Reading I gave an example of what constituted additional evidence, but the Minister held a different opinion.  I did not make the charge that Deputy O Cléirigh suggested I had made, that one had to be a member of a Fianna Fáil club to get a pension.  I never made any such charge.  As far as my knowledge of the Referee and of the board goes, they have been beyond reproach in that respect.  There was no question about that.  The charge I made yesterday was that when brigade committees were being formed an attempt was made by certain Fianna Fáil Deputies to confine them to members of Fianna Fáil clubs.  That is a completely different version of the matter.  That was the fault of the Deputies concerned. I am not making a charge against the Government.  As far as the Referee and the board are concerned, they gave justice to everybody within the rules that they laid down.  In no case did I see any political partisanship in the granting or refusing of pensions.  I want to make that clear. If the Minister accepts the amendment it will go a long way towards meeting the dissatisfaction that exists, and it will eliminate errors that have been made in some cases by the Referee and the board and in other instances by brigade committees.  These errors were perfectly <i>bona fide</i>, but they imposed hardship which was just as great as if they had been made deliberately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of rebutting evidence the Referee does not necessarily and deliberately look for someone to refute statements made by applicants.  That is not the purpose. What usually happens is that a witness is brought along to give positive evidence.  Perhaps he is on his oath and is unable to give the positive type <Col N="736" /> of evidence which would entitle a man to have his claim substantiated and it fails.  I want to make it clear that there is no deliberate attempt.  It is not part of the machinery of the hearing to bring anybody forward with the deliberate purpose of disproving a claim.  It is just that the Referee may believe that an individual could help in the matter but he just fails to give the particular type of evidence required. In the amendment the Deputy is referring to brigade committees. Brigade committees have no statutory existence whatever under the Act.  As far as the Act is concerned, they do not exist.  It is part of the procedure which the Referee adopted as a way and means of having these cases dealt with reasonably expeditiously.  The principal Act places the onus of proof on the applicant and this amendment suggests that it be placed on the brigade committees.  I do not think that I could accept the amendment, from that point of view.  I should say that I am not a party to the proceedings before the Referee in any respect. The Minister does not enter into it. The case is heard by the Referee and the Advisory Committee.  It is examined by these people and the only point at which the Minister enters into the position at all is when the decision, one way or the other, is forwarded to the Minister.  The latter portion of the amendment seems to be providing against slander, or something like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not moved that yet.  I take it that the Minister is not aware of the fact that there has been a large number of cases in which huge numbers of witnesses have been called.  I do not know whether they are called by the Referee or at the instance of some members of the board but I know cases where the applicant brought, say, two or three witnesses, to substantiate and to discharge the onus of proof.  After that, a very large number of witnesses was called who could give evidence only of a negative nature and the situation was created that to all intents and purposes they were refuting the evidence given by the applicant and, in that sense, it was rebutting evidence. <Col N="737" /> That is not the important part of this amendment.  I am quite willing to drop that part of the amendment if the Minister agrees to refer back to the Referee for consideration such cases as the brigade committee, between this and 31st January, put up to him for consideration.  Having done that, instead of calling the applicant, all the Referee has to do is to notify him that his case will be heard on such a date and that he is prepared to take the brigade nominee's evidence in the particular case on a certain date.  If that were done, the number of cases involved would not be very large, in my opinion, because I think the brigade committees themselves would have to act, as they have acted for a considerable time, as referees to a certain degree.  I am prepared to drop the question of the rebutting evidence if the Minister is prepared to accept the first part of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I could not do that, but I can point out to the Deputy that if there are any special cases in which he thinks justice has not been done and full examination has not been completed in regard to the evidence brought forward, and if he can bring sufficient evidence to bring the cases within the clauses of the Act, I certainly will have them forwarded to the Referee for examination.  That proposal is not as wide as the Deputy's amendment would make it but, certainly, if the Deputy can produce cases of the type I have mentioned, cases in respect of which the proper type of evidence can be produced, I will undertake to have them dealt with as sympathetically as it is possible to have them dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Minister for that, but that is a personal thing to me.  I am aware of cases myself, but I want the Minister to realise that I want to establish it as the right of any brigade committee, not the brigade committee of which I happen to be in charge.  There are brigade committees of other areas that have not a Deputy as chairman and I want the Minister to give the same privilege or the same right to all the other brigade committees to do the <Col N="738" /> same tning.  I want him to make it a right, if possible.  I am very grateful to the Minister for saying that he will accept cases from me, but these are cases that I am going to prepare.  That means a good deal of hardship and it is putting the obligation upon me.  I accept that, but that is an advantage to the Longford Brigade Committee because I happen to be the chairman. There is no reason in the world why the Leitrim Brigade Committee, which has not got Deputy MacEoin as chairman, should not have the same right. I want the Minister to accept the principle that, where a brigade committee, no matter who the chairman may be, makes representation that, in connection with cases, (a), (b), (c), (d), etc., justice has not been done and that certain evidence was not considered, a reconsideration by the Referee would take place.  If I get that accepted, the Minister will have gone a long distance to satisfy me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make the position clear.  What I have said to Deputy MacEoin goes for every brigade chairman throughout the country, within the terms I have stated.  If it is possible to bring the type of evidence which we can take as coming within the meaning of a particular section of the Act, there is no question but that we can have it sent forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be prepared to put in an amendment to that effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am saying if it comes within the present section of the Act, that is, if the evidence is of the type which we require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only a verbal statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing tricky about the statement at all.  I want to make it clear that what I am saying is that, as far as we can take cases within the particular section dealing with appeals, we will take them in.  The point I want to make is, that there has been the suggestion throughout the debate&mdash;Deputy MacEoin made it <Col N="739" /> a few moments ago&mdash;that certain types of cases, where there was evidence which, in his opinion, was the type of evidence that came within the meaning of the particular section, were turned down by the Referee.  I am suggesting that the evidence given was not additional evidence within the meaning of the Act.  Does Deputy MacEoin hold that it was?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I want to get at.  I say that if my attention is drawn to cases that Deputy MacEoin or any other brigade chairman has in mind, where there is evidence which they think is the type of evidence that comes within the meaning of the Act, and if the cases are still being turned down, I will have them re-examined from the point of view of seeing if by any chance a mistake was made.  I do not believe a mistake was made but, if by any chance, a mistake was made, the mere fact that it is being brought forward for re-examination will allay the fears that Deputy MacEoin may have as to what other people may be thinking.  That is as far as I can go.  That is one of the difficulties we have had throughout this Bill, and when the Taoiseach was asking for a solution of the particular difficulty with which we were faced, that is what he was referring to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that there are 3,000 or 5,000 people to whom justice has not been done.  How can we bring these people in without amending that particular section or without bringing in the whole 48,000 who have had their cases examined and who have not been given satisfaction?  It cannot be done. If we are to bring 3,000 people in, it means we must bring the other 45,000, otherwise we are just doing what has been suggested here from time to time &mdash;we are dealing with certain sections of applicants favourably and with other sections unfavourably.  We are trying to avoid anything in the nature of that, even by way of suggestion. There is the difficulty of being able to amend that particular section in such a way that we would not have to deal <Col N="740" /> with the whole 48,000&mdash;the difficulty of dealing with the numbers referred to without doing an injustice to the remainder of the 48,000.  No solution from this House, or our own Party, or any Party, so far as I can see, because they were all invited to suggest something, has been given.  Apparently it has not been found.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave me the impression, in the first instance, that if a brigade committee put forward cases, or if Deputies put forward cases in which they felt that justice was not done, these cases would be considered.  Then he veered around again and said that it must come within the section of the Act.  Therefore, we are back where we started. It must be additional evidence in the opinion of somebody.  It is a matter of opinion.  In my opinion and in the opinion of the brigade committee a particular type of evidence is additional evidence.  In the Minister's opinion, or in the opinion, as he told us yesterday, of the secretary to the Referee it is not additional evidence. Then it is not referred back to the Referee.  The secretary to the Referee is exercising the power conferred on the Minister under the Act.  It is the Minister's responsibility under this section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a report has been made by the Referee under this section on an application for a service certificate the Minister may, on the ground that evidence not available prior to the making of such report has since become available, request the Referee to review such report....&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know well that the Minister cannot do it, but it is the Minister on whom the responsibility is placed for referring back a case.  Now the Minister tells us that it is the secretary to the Referee who deals with these particular matters, that it is the secretary who says whether the new evidence is additional or not.  If the members of a brigade committee, who are aware of the evidence given and what evidence was omitted, set out this additional evidence, then, if this amendment is accepted, the Minister must refer the case back to the Referee for rehearing. <Col N="741" /> But, if we accept the statement which the Minister now makes, we revert back to the original situation and the applicant is no nearer to a rehearing.</P>
    <P>I cited an example on the Second Reading of a person who did not qualify because it was held that his service was broken.  That happened owing to an error.  Documentary evidence, which established the fact that his service was not broken, was clearly on its face additional evidence. Yet the Minister's Department wrote back to the applicant and to the brigade committee that, in the opinion of the Minister, it was not additional evidence.  Although every single member of the brigade committee was satisfied that that person was entitled to a certificate of service, that person has not got what he is entitled to.  I admit that, in the first instance, the blame was on the applicant himself and, secondly, upon the brigade committee for not making sure of the facts of the case.  Thirdly, it rests on the Referee and the Minister for not <Col N="742" /> accepting the additional evidence when it became available.  This amendment, if it were accepted, would allow that case to be reheard upon that evidence.  The evidence of the brigade committee could be accepted by the Referee as conclusive that they had discharged the onus of proof which was on the applicant.  The right of the applicant to come forward and give evidence would be preserved.  I think the Minister should accept that portion of the amendment in principle, because I think he has agreed that there should be a greater widening of the scope of that section than there has been up to the present.  It might let in a few more who should not be let in under the present definition, but it would certainly let in those who are entitled to come in and who should be given the opportunity.  Can the Minister not accept the amendment?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 28:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Where rebutting evidence is given against a claimant on appeal such evidence, whether sustained or rejected, shall be privileged and no action shall lie for slander or libel against any witness who may have tendered such evidence before the Referee or before members of brigade committees or who may discuss such evidence with other persons after such meeting.</P>
      <P>As amendment No. 27 has not been accepted, this amendment loses much of its force.  I just want to make the point that at brigade committee meetings there may be heated discussions as to whether a person did or did not take part in certain engagements.  In a perfectly <i>bona fide</i> way the assertion may be made that X did not take part in an engagement and X may regard that statement as a slander. At the brigade committee meeting, the statement might be held to be privileged, but as happens in some cases, the discussion may go on outside sometime after the meeting or there may be a conversation between two members going home.  There may be a good deal of discussion on the question as to who is or who is not entitled to have an appeal made to the Minister on his behalf and this question of slander could arise very easily. I think the Minister should take note of it, and see what is the legal position. I do not want to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not think the question really arises.  The position as far as I know is that evidence given before the Referee in any circumstances is secret and confidential. There is no possibility of slander or libel or anything else arising as a result, so I do not think the Deputy need have any fears on the point.</P>

      <P>I admit that evidence tendered before the Referee is privileged, and that it can be held that a statement made before a brigade committee is also privileged. But outside of that, the discussion goes on sometimes between members in regard to claims and all that kind of thing, in which they say: &ldquo;So-and-so did not take part in such and such a thing,&rdquo; and that might be regarded as slander at the moment.</P>

      <P>On Section 4, I think the Minister, having refused to amend it in any way, should now extend the date.  He cannot possibly have the whole thing dealt with in 11 months.  He is allowing himself a very narrow margin, and I think that date should be extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">

      <P>The original decision was not to have it beyond the end of July, and it was generally believed that <Col N="745" /> even that date was somewhat prolonged. Then I decided that it would be better to make it the end of the year rather than the middle of the year.  It was decided that only those cases which were heard by the end of the year would be regarded as decided, and those not decided would be ruled out.  Now, I again thought that that would be unfair, and I put it up to the Government that every case that was in by that date, whether it was heard or not, should be regarded as being legally entitled to be heard.  I think it would be unreasonable&mdash; and I am sure the Deputy will agree&mdash;to go on extending the date. We are giving them practically nine months, and in that time any man can make up his mind as to whether he has the possibility of making a case.  I think to ask for an extension beyond that would be asking too much, especially in view of the original decisions which were thought fully to meet the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a number of people in America and all over the world who will have to be contacted and told about this particular date. When you fix 1st January, 1946, you are giving those people very little chance. I am aware that there were attempts to make applications under the 1924 Act from people who were in America and who only got in touch with their relatives in the last nine or ten years. After a great number of years they were still unaware of rejections and that sort of thing.  The Minister is tying his own hands.  I am glad he took the view that July was too near &mdash;that it was not allowing sufficient time.  I think this date should be extended, particularly for overseas applications.  If you put in the words &ldquo;except in the case of overseas applications&rdquo; that would meet the point.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to move the amendment, but I wanted first to raise this point of order, if I may, with your permission.  I am informed that this amendment was ruled out of order on the grounds that it involves expenditure, either potential or actual.  The Taoiseach submitted that if a scheme were put up which would meet the difficulties of the Government it would be considered. I suggest that such an amendment as I have here would meet the case.  On the point as to whether it involves a liability or a potential charge on public funds, I submit that the Chair has ruled harshly, in view of the fact that a person is entitled to a service certificate if he was a member of the Volunteers and has active service, and that the method by which active service is established is by a rule of a referee.  My submission is that that was already covered, and that this definition of mine was not an addition to what is already there.  I submit, Sir, that the matter should be reconsidered.</P>
      <P>On a point of personal explanation, it has been alleged that, in putting in that section, I knew it would be ruled out of order, and that, therefore, I did not mean that section.  Now, the Chair knows that I only got the notice that it was out of order when I came into this Front Bench yesterday.  I believed it was in order, and I am submitting to you now that it is in order.  What I really wanted to do was to try to meet the wishes of the Taoiseach by putting up this section.  I think that, under the circumstances, the amendment should be allowed.  On a point of order, I submit that amendment No. 1, which was dealt with yesterday, did impose a charge, because it was proposing to appoint five referees instead of one.  I submit that it could be argued that it was out of order because it was imposing a charge.  This amendment, in my submission, is not at all on that line.  The charge is already imposed in the Act of 1934. Therefore, Sir, you should admit this amendment, and allow me to make a case for it.</P>

      <P>When amendment No. 29 was not allowed, there is very little use in allowing me to move amendment No. 32, because you have taken anything that is any good out of the amendments.  However, I will move amendment No. 32:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 5 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The First Schedule of the Act of 1934 is hereby amended by the addition to Rule 4 of the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>4 (A)  The brigade committee's certificate as shown by their records shall be conclusive evidence of the rank held by the applicant on the first or second critical date as may apply.</P>
      <P>4 (B)  Evidence of the rank held by an applicant when given by the brigade committee nominees shall be sufficient to discharge the onus of proof and shall be final and conclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment, with the Act being administered as it is, there are hardships imposed upon various applicants as regards the question of rank.  There are all sorts of difficulties about ranks. The brigade committees were asked to submit records of the various companies of Volunteers and Cumann na mBan.  They have done so.  If a company was one short of its prescribed figure the company officer failed to get his rank.  I do not hold any brief for those who fought in the executive forces during the civil war, <Col N="748" /> but I submit that the question of rank under the 1924 Act was governed by the rank one held in the National Army and it did not matter whether one commanded ten men or 1,000, it was the rank one held in the Army that governed the rank for military service pension purposes.  All that I am arguing is that the people on the executive forces side should have the same right.  Once they commanded a certain number that should be accepted as their rank, particularly when the brigade committee gave a certificate that they occupied such rank.  These certificates are in already and, therefore, there is no chance of anybody mending his hand.  The records are there.</P>
    <P>Where the brigade committee has made such a record, and where it has not been accepted by the Referee, this amendment will impose the obligation on the Referee of accepting that certificate. The 1924 Act was governed by staff duties at G.H.Q. as to what rank a person held, and they were bound by that.  If, for instance, staff duties gave a certificate that I was captain in 1924, that automatically gave me my rank.  I say that for the purposes of this Act the brigade committees should be taken as the staff duties of that particular period and their certificate of rank should be accepted and that should apply both to Volunteers and Cumann na mBan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the Referee has dual duties.  He has a duty, in the first instance, to the applicant, and he has a duty, in the second place, to the State or the people.  In the first instance, he endeavoured to ensure that the applicant would be given every possible facility in order that he might be granted whatever rights he was entitled to, and, in the second instance, he had to ensure that no claimant would get something to which he was not entitled.  Therefore, the Referee must be entitled to call all and sundry before him that he believes will be able to help him in reaching his decision.  This amendment, which I could not, under any circumstances, accept, suggests in as many words <Col N="749" /> that the brigade committees will not alone be the verifying authority but that they will also be the people responsible for the final decision in a case.  Of course, that would be out of the question.  The Referee must continue to deal with whatever cases he has to deal with, whether they be new cases or cases on appeal, in identically the same fashion as he has dealt with them up to the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how that could be taken out of the amendment&mdash;that the brigade committees were to be the final court of appeal.  The intention is that they would act on the records already existing and that are in the possession of the Referee&mdash;that they would be taken as conclusive evidence by the Referee for the purpose of determining rank.  I am not very strong on that, but I do suggest there is injustice done. I will give an example of what I mean. A split unfortunately took place.  Prior to the split, Company A of such a battalion had 110 or 100 men.  After the split there were 45 on the side of the executive forces, 40 in the National Army, and the remainder were neutral. The company captain had the same work to do with the smaller number, and it was a greater hardship on him to perform his duties.  I say it was a more difficult task and it required greater ingenuity on the part of the officer to perform his duties.  Because of the split he there and then lost his rank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am putting the case that if he was company captain on 11th July, 1921, he automatically got that rank.  If he was captain of the whole company, then that was all right, but if he was section commander on the 11th July, 1921, and in 1922 he became company officer of the attenuated company, with which he had to take part in various activities, he now found himself with a much smaller company having to do the same work as the large company did, but he does not get his rank.  I am suggesting that the brigade records relating to his rank should be sufficient and ought to be accepted and the brigade committee, for the purposes of <Col N="750" /> this Act, should be regarded as staff duties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think that, on the whole, the Deputy will agree that the brigade committees' recommendations are usually accepted.  The position is that there can be only one person holding the rank.  You cannot just give three or four ranks away to one unit and it may be that, in the early stages, one man has proved his case to the satisfaction of the Referee. <Col N="751" /> The question then arises of somebody else claiming a similar rank.  In these cases, of course, I admit that the brigade committees' recommendations or statements might not be acceptable, mainly for the reason I have given that some other applicant had already secured the rank in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that there is something wrong.  In reply to a question yesterday on this point, the Minister said that the Referee had exercised his power under Rule 4 in 189 cases of higher ranks.  There are a number of people who have higher ranks and some who have none at all, which creates a difficulty, and I submit that if the brigade records are accepted as final and conclusive, all that controversy would be avoided, and where a case arises in which the Referee has awarded a rank to an applicant and the brigade records cannot now be accepted, Rule 4 should apply.  That is what Rule 4 was intended to apply to.  It was designed to enable the Referee, if he were unable to grant a rank on the schedule, to grant it under the rule because of service rendered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>In some cases, I should say that the particular rank&mdash; taking the grade in the reply to which the Deputy referred&mdash;could be held by one individual on the first critical date and by another on the second critical date, but after that I do not think it could be acceptable, and if there was any question of some person being strongly recommended by a brigade committee for that same rank, it would appear that one or other of the two individuals who had already secured that rank had secured it by false pretences or some other means.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934, and may, according to the Short Title, be so cited.  I think that for the future this Bill may be cited as an Act for the destruction of all legislation relating to military service pensions in this country and as an Act under which the Government of the day runs away from its responsibilities.  Under the Act of 1934, every person who was a member of certain organisations and who had active service is entitled to a certificate of service.  It was left to the Referee to decide by rule what constituted active service.  The Referee made the rule himself and then administered it.  In other words, it was left to the judge to make the law, to administer it and to give it the judicial interpretation he wished.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that this Bill has failed in every respect but one, that is, in that it gives the Government power to override every applicant, to refuse them any recognition whatever if they are amongst the 48,352, the number given by the Minister yesterday as the number of rejects. If the amendment defining active service which I suggested were accepted, it would meet all the requirements in relation to the Act of 1934, and would only make statutory what under various referees are and have been rules.  Under some of the referees, a person who rendered essential services but never fired a shot was granted a certificate and naturally a pension.  Immediately after, that was almost thrown overboard and essential service became almost impossible to prove.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to recommit the Bill on Report Stage, to adopt this amendment relating to service and to do the decent thing by these people who have done the decent thing by this country.  If he does, the solution asked for by the Taoiseach will have been achieved.  Justice will be done to everybody and any errors eliminated. I put it to him as strongly as I can that, in justice, he should do so, keeping in mind that, on the basis of this definition of service, the total expenditure involved would be very slight compared <Col N="753" /> with other expenditure, such as R.I.C. pensions.  The total expenditure involved in respect of all the military service pensions would not be one-third of the amount of the old R.I.C. pensions which this Government no longer pays.  That is all that would be required by accepting this amendment to give justice to the members of the I.R.A.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is much necessity to delay the House with further speeches.  I think it quite unnecessary for Deputy MacEoin or anybody else to appeal to this Government to do the decent thing by the Old I.R.A.  They have been doing it since they came into office.  They have given them the fairest possible treatment any Government could give any section of the people without interfering with the rights of the ordinary man in the street.  One has only to look down the list of various things done for the Old I.R.A. men to realise this.  We have provided, for example, disability pensions as well as the present pension scheme which to my mind, has been administered fairly and justly without any <Col N="754" /> question of sectionalism or anything else.  Therefore, to make an appeal to this Government to do better than that is, I think, just to use extravagant language.  As far as this Bill is concerned, I do not think it is going to interfere in the slightest way with the interests of a single Old I.R.A. man in the country.  The cases, as I said earlier, have been to all intents and purposes heard and examined fairly, and adjustments have been given on them, so that at this stage there are practically no cases to be heard.  If, however, there are any men who think they have a good case they have ways and means up to the 31st December of this year by which they can have their cases re-examined.  On that point, I may say that upwards of 500 people have already made use of that section, and have done so successfully.  If there are still a number of people who feel that they have not been given as fair a deal as they themselves thought they should have got and are in a position to produce the necessary evidence, their cases can still be reheard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £29,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1945, for Wound and Disability Pensions, Further Pensions and Married Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 26 of 1923, No. 12 of 1927, No. 24 of 1932, No. 15 of 1937, No. 2 of 1941 and No. 14 of 1943); Military Service Pensions, <Col N="757" /> Allowances and Gratuities (No. 48 of 1924, No. 26 of 1932, No. 43 of 1934, No. 33 of 1938 and No. 5 of 1944); Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 37 of 1936); Payments in respect of Compensation for Members of the Local Defence Force (No. 28 of 1939); and for sundry Contributions and Expenses in respect thereof, etc.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate for the gross sum of £29,691 is necessitated by several varying factors which may be best explained by dealing with the various sub-heads for which an increased provision is necessary. Under sub-head C, which deals with the salaries, wages and allowances of the Referee and Advisory Committee, the increase of £3,096 is due to the facts (a)  that when the annual estimate was framed the Referee's salary was borne on the Central Fund, but is now borne on the Pensions Vote; (b)  the original Estimate was based on the assumption that the Advisory Committee would only be employed for 30 days during the year, whereas it has been fully employed since last November and was employed part-time before that; (c)  it was hoped that the Referee's staff would be needed for only four months, whereas it has been necessary to keep it in existence throughout the whole year.</P>
    <P>Sub-head E provides for wound and disability pensions and gratuities and the increase here is due to an increase in the number of pensions mainly in respect of disease.  We budgeted for 1,341 such pensions, but, at the end of January, there were 1,340 under payment and, by the end of March, we expect to have dealt with another 27. The increase is chiefly in respect of tuberculosis cases and the average allowed for is, consequently, higher because most of these applicants receive the maximum pension allowable under the Acts.  Here we require £10,000.</P>
    <P>Sub-head F provides for the widows, children and other dependents of deceased personnel.  The original Estimate provided for 295 allowances, but at the end of January that number had <Col N="758" /> jumped to 350 and by March we expect that six more cases will have to be dealt with.  The extra cost will be £3,000.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head I, we had not allowed sufficient margin for contingent liabilities.  For instance, towards the end of the last financial year, there were about 325 persons living abroad who had received service certificates but who had not claimed pensions amounting to about £56,000.  Many of these have now claimed their pensions with arrears and this is mainly the cause of the increase of £8,100.</P>
    <P>Sub-head J deals with the pensions for the Army.  We budgeted for 111 cases, but at the end of January there were 118 actually under payment, and we expect 29 more by the end of March.</P>
    <P>Sub-head K, which provides for the expenses of applicants under the Army Pensions Acts and for witnesses under the Military Service Pensions Acts, requires an additional £1,095.  This increase is consequential to the increased activities of the Referee and Advisory Committee, and to the increased number of applicants for wound and disability pensions.</P>
    <P>Sub-head L requires an increase of £400, mainly because we have taken special steps to deal expeditiously with applicants for wound and disability pensions.  Last October, we found that the Army Pensions Board could not deal quickly enough with the numerous applications under the Acts, and we decided to relieve the pressure by appointing pensions medical officers all over the country to examine locally the applicants, and to report to the board who would then assess their claims.  In this way, we have in the space of three months dealt with about 140 cases.</P>
    <P>In connection with this Supplementary Estimate for the Army Pensions Vote, I should like to draw the attention of the House to one point.  On the account for 1936-37 there was a surrender of £176,843 out of a Vote for £615,926 and the accounting officer of the Vote, when appearing before the Committee of Public Accounts, was advised to &ldquo;estimate as closely as <Col N="759" /> possible even at the risk of having to come to the Dáil for a Supplementary Estimate rather than to be piling up large sums for surrender&rdquo;.  It is because the Department has followed that advice in framing its Estimate for this Vote that this supplementary amount is necessary.</P>

      <P>I am quite prepared to accept the amendment proposed by the Minister, which is contained on a separate sheet, because I think it meets the anomalous position of members of the Dublin Corporation, with which my amendment was concerned. That anomalous position has existed since the passing of the 1930 Act, and it was necessary that it should be remedied.  I feel quite certain that the position in regard to an alderman or councillor, acting in such a capacity, is covered by the Minister's amendment, and I am quite happy to accept his amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Every Order under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as conveniently may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the Order is passed by either such House within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after the Order is laid before it, the Order shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
      <P>The members of the Dublin Corporation, as a whole, are very much concerned about this matter, and that is the reason why I have proposed this amendment which, I understand, the Minister is prepared to accept, at least, in principle.  I would be satisfied if the Minister would say that he is prepared to meet the stuation so far as is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I should like to meet the principle proposed by the Deputy in this amendment, I think it is inadvisable to lay down a period of 21 sitting days.  If I were to accept <Col N="761" /> the principle of this amendment, it would be on condition that that period should be reduced very considerably. I do not know whether 21 consecutive days would be sufficient.  On the other hand, 21 sitting days might mean that the orders would have to lie on the Table of the House for a very long period, during which people concerned, like prospective candidates and their organisations, would not know what the final decision in regard to these electoral divisions was going to be, or how long they might have to wait before they could come to a decision as to which electoral area they would contest.  After all, if one were to stipulate 21 sitting days of the Dáil, that might mean a period of five, six or even 7 months, if the Dáil were not sitting; and, accordingly, I think that that would be too long a period.  I suggest that four sitting days would be better.  That would give to the members of the corporation at least a week within which to consider the matter and to come here if necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Actually, the Deputy has put his finger on what is the real objection to this amendment&mdash;that the mere fact of making the Order subject to annulment creates uncertainty.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it does.  It puts those concerned in the position of living from hand to mouth, as the Deputy has said, and that is why I suggest that we should reduce the period, at least as much as we can.  I am quite prepared to meet Deputy Doyle's point of view, but I think it would be sufficient to give a week instead of this qualification of 21 sitting days, because, if we are to agree to 21 sitting days, without any qualification, it would mean that, if the Dáil did not happen to be sitting during the period concerned, there would be no certainty. I do not want that, and I am sure that the Deputy does not want it.  I do not want, any more than, I am sure, the <Col N="762" /> Deputy does, to prolong the period of uncertainty.  I think that everybody would desire to have this matter decided within a very short period after the Order is made.  I suggest four sitting days until the Order becomes final are enough.  If any people want to put down a motion to annul the Order that would give them ample time for complying with Standing Orders and to make up their minds.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to the Minister making an accommodation in this matter but we are creating a precedent.  If the areas of representation in the city or in the country are going to be changed, long and mature deliberation as well as open consultation is required beforehand. The real guarantee that there would be no uncertainty with regard to any Order that may be made setting up these areas would be that there was the necessary consultation over a suitable period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition was responsible for putting through the Local Government Act of 1930 and that principle is not to be found in it, nor in the Act of 1941.  I am creating a precedent, and I do so because I want people to be satisfied. If there is to be any consultation, it will be after the Order is made, and if <Col N="763" /> a good case is made for amendment of that Order then, as far as I am concerned, it will be amended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a grotesque conception of the Minister's responsibility in relation to the setting up of areas of representation, whether for municipal or Parliamentary purposes, to say that he will not have consultation with anybody until after he has made and printed the Order.

      <P>Perhaps very reluctantly I have departed from the situation as I found it but I can point to the principle embodied in the Act of 1930.  I did not want to do that. But if it is going to be said that I am putting myself in a grotesque position by proposing to give the Dáil the opportunity to discuss the matter, I do not see what else I can do.  The Act of 1930 says: &ldquo;As soon as may be after the passing of this Act the Minister shall divide the area consisting of the existing city, the added urban districts, and the added rural area into five borough electoral areas.&rdquo; There is not a word there about consultation with the Dáil or with anybody else.  That is the principle the Deputy stood over when he was Minister for Local Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister omitted to make any definite statement as to what changes he proposed to make.  I assume that he is not yet in a position to announce the proposed changes.  At this stage, when the Bill gives him power to postpone elections for one year, and for a further two years, if necessary, we should have an indication as to when it is proposed to hold county council elections, as well as elections for the areas of Balrothery and Rathdown, and whether it is proposed to continue these two bodies in existence after the next local elections. While I agree that the Minister's plans could be put into operation, never the-less, I consider that the representatives of the people in this House should voice their opinions on the matter.  The Dublin County Council has now been abolished for quite a considerable time and, while certain successes and improvements have been achieved, nevertheless it is undesirable that any drastic or far-reaching change such as the Minister envisages should be undertaken without consultation with elected representatives such as we would have if the county council were elected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>My position with regard to this matter was very fully stated on the Second Stage of the Bill.  I have said, as far as I am concerned, that there will be no drastic change in the existing system of local authorities in Dublin until the representatives of the Dublin ratepayers and the Dáil have had an opportunity to consider the proposals.  I pointed out, when I was introducing this Bill, that I was asking, first of all, for the unconditional power to defer the elections for the Dublin County Council for one year.  I emphasised that a number of <Col N="766" /> proposals of a constructive nature had reached a critical stage, that arrangements would be made in regard to some of them to hold the necessary public inquiries towards the end of this year, and that I felt it would unduly retard the completion of these proposals and plans if we were to have a change in the administration of the county council affairs at this stage.</P>
      <P>The section proposes to give the Minister power to defer for a further two years the holding of elections for the County Council of Dublin, but that power is conditional upon the Dáil assenting to the Order which the Minister will make.  I do not think there is anything I can usefully add to the very full case which I made on the Second Reading of this Bill, dealing with the powers which are sought in Section 4.  The only additional point, I think, that Deputy Cosgrave raised was that he seemed to want some assurance that nothing of a radical nature would be done without the representatives of the ratepayers of County Dublin having an opportunity to consider the matter and I can give him that assurance without any hesitation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite true that the Minister has nothing to add to what he said on the Second Reading in this matter.  His attitude at that particular time was that a very considerable amount of expenditure on important works was being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated the nature of the works; he stated the amount of money that was going to be expended.  It may be that none of the work is being done now but plans have been made and, in the making of plans, the carrying out of which will be important for the citizens of the county, and a large part of the expenditure on which will have to be borne by them, the Minister is deliberately preventing them from <Col N="767" /> having any representative council that could in any authoritative way review or discuss these plans while they are under formation or while the work is being initiated.  That is one very important matter that is happening at the present time, namely, the development of plans for the expenditure of a very considerable amount of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next thing the Minister indicated was that he has not made up his mind as to what he is going to do with regard to the division of the administrative areas in the city and county and the organisation of their management. The report of the first tribunal that was set up under the Act of 1930 has been in the Minister's hands for seven years and the Minister has given no sign that he has begun to do any thinking about these proposals in any practical way.  During the last four or five years, every section of the people in the City and County of Dublin has been mobilised and propagandised to form all kinds of most intricate organisations to deal with difficult and emergency circumstances.  Voluntary work is expected of them.  They have come together magnificently and they have performed a magnificent piece of civic work, but the Minister now decides that they are not fit to review, through local representatives, what is being planned for the future of the area, either in constructive work or administrative reorganisation.  I think it is a complete insult to the whole adult population of the County of Dublin.  Even if there was a danger in putting the responsibility on the electorate of the County of Dublin at the present time, I think it is dangerous to relieve the electorate of their responsibility in the matter.  I think the Minister is atrophying a certain sense of responsibility that ought to be developed in the county and he is removing to some back room in the Department of Local Government the development of important plans, committing the area to a considerable amount of expenditure.  In my opinion, that is entirely wrong.  I think there is enough ordinary work to be done in the Department of Local Government and sufficient desire on the part of <Col N="768" /> various sections of the people throughout the country to get that work speeded up and made more definite without the Minister adding to himself the unnecessary trouble of trying to do work that could properly be done by the representatives of the County of Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is my fault, but I do not think Deputies have really grasped what I tried to indicate to them when I introduced this Bill. I said that we have many important proposals for the constructive development of certain of those services, that these are under immediate consideration and will have reached a critical stage about the period of June next, that these proposals envisage the construction of over 1,350 houses, the execution of water supply and sewerage schemes to the value of £358,818, and the construction and improvement of roads at an ultimate cost of over £5,000,000; that the actual execution of these works, except to a minor degree, will not be possible until the end of hostilities in Europe renders the procural of the necessary plant and materials more feasible than it is now. I did not say that these works were going to be carried out now.  I pointed out what the difficulties are.  I am not sanguine enough to believe that before the elections in the year 1946 are held, if they are held then, we will be in a position to carry out these undertakings, but I do think that it is desirable that we should be ready with our plans to undertake the works as soon as it is possible to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has a very practical interest in ensuring that these works are properly planned, because the Government is going to be a very large contributor towards the cost of these works.  The houses will be heavily subsidised, the water supply and sewerage schemes will be heavily subsidised and I believe that a very large part of the road expenditure will have to be subsidised by the Exchequer.  Therefore I have no apology to make for anything we might do in the Department of Local Government to ensure that these works are properly planned and that they are carried out in a very different way from the way in which certain <Col N="769" /> works were carried out when the county council was in existence.  I think that is a reasonable request to make&mdash;that we should have, at this critical period in the projection of these development schemes, this further respite; that we should be assured that there will not be a change in the administration until these plans are completed and ready to be put before the public.  The necessary public inquiries will have to be held in connection with the housing schemes and I think they will be held at the end of this year, as I mentioned on the Second Reading.</P>
    <P>In addition to that we hope to have the joint planning schemes for Dublin City and County.  These schemes will have to be submitted to the public; they will be open to the inspection of the public.  The public will be able to formulate their criticisms of them and these will be considered.  When we have done that, we will be in a position then to come down and give close consideration to what actually are to be the local government authorities in the city and county and what the relationship is to be between them.  After that it will be time enough then to have the elections for the local authority.  There is no use proceeding to elect the authority now, as I said, changing the whole administration, and then, before these plans are even completed, perhaps having to change the whole thing again.  We are not in a position to say now what will be the ultimate arrangement for the general administration of the city and county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement is wholly inexplicable and entirely without point unless he adds something which he has apparently carefully refrained from adding, namely, that the ratepayers of the County Dublin are not to be trusted to carry out or initiate the plans that the Minister has in mind.  I can see no other justification for the Minister's attitude.  The Minister says that his Department has these plans.  These plans are not to come into operation for some years.  He does not even know when they are to come into operation.  In the meantime, there is to be no county council election in <Col N="770" /> County Dublin, although these plans are not finally prepared and will not come into operation for many years.  I fail to understand the justification of that line of argument for postponing the election.  The only justification which could be given is that the Minister will not trust the County Dublin ratepayers to do their duty.  If that is the reason for asking the House to give this power of postponing the county council elections in County Dublin, why not say so?  All this talk about plans, reconstruction and construction is all nonsense.</P>
      <P>Under the system of local government that subsists in most counties at present, presumably the county council, through the local manager and the council themselves, are carrying out plans or preparing plans for the postwar period.  Why pick upon the Dublin County Council and say that the County Dublin ratepayers are not to be trusted to carry out these grandiose plans in County Dublin?  I entirely fail to follow the Minister's argument.</P>
      <P>I could understand, while possibly not agreeing with him, the argument that the County Dublin ratepayers are not to be trusted.  But, apparently, what the Minister says is: &ldquo;We have plans in the Department.  We do not know whether the County Dublin ratepayers would approve of these plans or not.  We are not going to take the risk that they will not and some years ahead we propose to impose these plans upon whatever authority is carrying out the local affairs of the County Dublin.&rdquo;  That appears to be the case for this section.  In my view, it is no case for the section.  If the Minister said that he does not trust the County Dublin ratepayers, I could understand that as a case, and I think I could put up an answer to it.  But to say that, because there are plans in preparation in the Department which are not even finished and which it is not intended to put into execution for some years, the County Dublin ratepayers should not at present have their own local affairs conducted locally, the same as most other counties, passes my comprehension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any county in which it would <Col N="771" /> be more important or necessary, if any changes are taking place, or any important work is being done, to have the county council elected by the people than in the County of Dublin because of the particular nature of that area.  It has three very different areas.  In the first place, there is the Borough of Dublin.  Then there is the portion of the county lying south of the Borough of Dun Laoghaire and the City of Dublin and the portion of the county lying north of the County Borough of Dublin.  These are three very distinct areas with different interests of their own no doubt, but their different interests impinging on the interests of their neighbour in a very peculiar way.  Because of the very diversity that exists in the county, it is all the more necessary and imperative that there should be a council elected to review what is being done and to advise the Minister and consult with the Minister, if the Minister had particular plans that he thought should be put into operation in their area. The nature of the county is such that it is imperative that the county council should exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing I want to add.  If the Minister is not inclined to reply, I assume that the case I have made is the correct one, that the Minister thinks that the County Dublin ratepayers are not to be trusted.  In the absence of any answer to the points put forward, the public must assume that the stand the Minister is taking is that the County Dublin ratepayers are not to be trusted. Assuming for the moment that those ratepayers who were responsible for the election of the Dublin County Council which was abolished some years ago were not to be trusted and were proved not to be trusted to carry out their duties, a number of entirely different people have now come on the register and will come on the register. It must be assumed that if there was any dereliction of duty in the past, that has now been purged, that the affairs of the Dublin County Council have been put on a proper basis by the county commissioner, and that the <Col N="772" /> position is now clear for those new electors who have come upon the register in recent years to give proof of their ability to carry on their own affairs and that they ought to get an opportunity of doing it.  They are being denied it in this Bill, in my view, on an entirely false case.  Something about the plans being in preparation is put forward as the reason for asking for this power in this section.  That, in my view, is a wrong, false and untenable case.</P>
      <P>In the previous section power is taken by the Minister to increase the number of representatives of the citizens of Dublin on the Dublin Corporation. So that in one part of this Bill we are giving more representation to the citizens of the City of Dublin and in another part of the Bill we are depriving the people of the County of Dublin of any representation on their own local authorities.  I fail to see the logic of or the justification for that except the one thing, that in the case of the City of Dublin the Minister is anxious to increase the representation in the corporation for political purposes. I stated on Second Reading that I was against that; that I could not see any reason why there should be ten more politicians put into the Dublin Corporation.  In my view, these ten are being put in for political purposes in an endeavour by the Party or the organisation to capture the Lord Mayoralty of the city.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;any more than the suggestion that the reason why I am asking the House to give me power to defer the election of the county council is that I do not trust the ratepayers of County Dublin.  Now, if we could find any way of taking a plebiscite of the ratepayers of County Dublin on this matter, I am perfectly certain that by an overwhelming majority they would all support me in the perfectly reasonable request I make that when the commissioner administering the affairs of the county council is preparing plans which have reached a critical stage, he should be permitted to go ahead, finish that stage and put his plans before the people.  While he may not be able to carry out any of these schemes for the present, they will show at least his intention in regard to future development. When he has got as far as that, the citizens of County Dublin themselves will be in a position to form an opinion on the proposals which will be ultimately put before them for the local government of the county.  That is all I am asking.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reply to Deputy Cosgrave lifts the veil a little more.  It suggests that under Section 3 we are saying good-bye for ever to a Dublin county council such as existed in the past and that he proposes under the powers of this Bill to keep public representation for the Dublin County area completely choked off until he has introduced legislation to reconstitute the administrative boundaries of the City and County of Dublin. That is now the point we arrived at in elaborating the Minister's plans. I submit, that being so, it becomes more important that Parliament should face its responsibilities in this matter and that Deputies should ask themselves whether they are satisfied, when <Col N="776" /> elaborate plans are being made to readjust the administrative areas in the city and county, that one section which was under the county council in the past should be completely disfranchised in any public consideration of the Minister's plans.  Again I want to ask the members of the Party behind him, if the Minister continues to remain silent about the matter, why is it that above all the part of the city and county that is the rural area is to be the part that is to be choked out of any representative discussion of plans that are going to affect their administrative future?</P>
      <P>As I say, in a very round about way, only by a reply to a chance question from Deputy Cosgrave, the Minister has disclosed that we are not going to see any public body representing the rural parts of County Dublin until such time as the Minister has by his machine put the plans for the reordering of the administrative boundaries of the county before the House. According to his new administrative plan the new administrative machinery will be forced on the city and the county.  In the meantime there will be no rural representation standing in any kind of official position to review what is happening and what is being planned or to discuss that plan.  It is all going to be left to the Fianna Fáil Party here in this House.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether Deputy Cosgrave understood that what Deputy Mulcahy has represented as being the position which arose after the exchange of remarks between himself and myself is, in fact, the position, but I certainly did not understand that.  It seems to me that there is no use in trying to meet the Opposition reasonably in regard to these matters, because they will not be reasonable.  I am beginning to wonder whether, in view of the trend of the discussion here this evening, it is worth while retaining sub-section (7)  in this section at all.  I am asking for powers to postpone the elections until 1946, and, if necessary, to come to the House again to have the matter further discussed should a further postponement be necessary.  But if the discussion on <Col N="777" /> the remaining sections of the Bill is going to follow the lines it has followed on this one, I am going to consider my attitude in regard to sub-section (7)  on the Report Stage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister is showing very plainly that he has been completely found out, and that the intention of this Bill is completely to disfranchise the County of Dublin, particularly the rural part of it which has no representation of any kind in the Borough of Dun Laoghaire&mdash;that the rural part of it particularly is going to be completely disfranchised while he is hacking up the organisation of the city and county.</P>

      <P>I think it is well that the public should realise the frightful threat which is now hanging over them through the Minister's last observation. The Minister will carefully consider on the Report Stage the dropping of sub-section (7).  I am sure the ratepayers of County Dublin will be appalled when they hear that in the morning, and when they realise the dreadful fate that is going to overtake them because of the Minister's attitude in the House.  The Minister said that the Opposition are unreasonable. Because we will not meet him when he is running away from us he says he is going to drop sub-section (7).  Sub-section (7)  says that the Minister will graciously lay on the Table of the House the Order that he made under this section, and, if that Order is annulled by a resolution passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, then it shall be annulled.  The Minister, with his over-all majority, is giving the <Col N="778" /> tremendous concession to the House that, within the next two years, he is going to lay an Order on the Table of the House, and, if this House annuls it, then of course there will be no Order. A bright chance this House has of annulling any Order made by the Minister for Local Government in the next two years, with his over-all majority. There was never such a fatuous suggestion made by any Minister, and there was never such a childish exhibition by any Minister as the Minister for Local Government has given by the threat he has made here to-night to the trembling people of County Dublin.</P>

      <P>I should like to satisfy General Mulcahy. The people of County Dublin are very grateful to the Minister for Local Government for the attitude he has taken up during the last few years.  The work which has been carried out by the county commissioner has been very much praised by every ratepayer in County Dublin who was at all times anxious to pay his rates and to pay his way generally.  Before the Minister intervened, the position was that one or two men paid their rates while three or four others did not pay theirs.</P>
      <P>That was the position with which the Minister for Local Government found himself faced when he had to put a commissioner in County Dublin.  Mr. O'Donovan has done his job very well.  Since he took over the administration of County Dublin his various schemes have been accepted generally by the people.  He has not proved himself to be the ordinary office clerk at all; he has proved himself to be a man who has a deep interest in the welfare of County Dublin and in the welfare of the country.  The attitude adopted by the Minister in postponing the County Dublin elections has, I am sure, the backing of 90 per cent. of the people of County Dublin generally.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask Deputy Burke to face what exactly is being done by himself and the <Col N="779" /> Minister in this matter&mdash;a thing which, as I say, we only found out by teasing the situation about.  The rural part of County Dublin is to be completely deprived of representation until such time as there has been a complete reshaping of the administrative machinery in the city.  As Deputy Costello pointed out, during that period the county borough is going to have increased representation, and the Dun Laoghaire Borough is going to have its full representation, but the county outside of that is going to be deprived completely and utterly of any kind of public representation while all this great planning is going on.  The plans are going to be put into the form of legislation, and passed with the assistance of the Minister and the Deputy through this House, before anybody in the rural part of County Dublin will be in a position, as a representative, to say what he thinks about it.</P>

      <P>Yes; that can easily be done by going to the county commissioner, and he has received representations at all times.  Furthermore, post-war planning, as far as County Dublin is concerned, has been done in a most methodical manner.  He has got his officers to go around County Dublin to see how things can be done and to do them impartially.  It is not a case of putting a light here or a cottage there because two or three members want it.  I believe that the Minister's attitude is the right one, and that the people of County Dublin will be grateful to him for what he has done.  I am speaking not altogether as a politician; I am speaking out my mind; I am saying what I believe and what I think the people of County Dublin believe.  Time will tell.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Minister's reason for the abolition of the Dublin Board of Assistance, or rather for his failure to make provision in the Bill for restoring representation to the Dublin Corporation on that very important body, is that he has further plans in mind.  I submit that it was quite unjustifiable to abolish that board at any time.  If the Minister feels there is any particular aspect of administration in respect of which he thinks it necessary to have his own representative, he had that opportunity in the past, and there is no use in his saying that he is anxious to meet the wishes of the citizens and desirous of getting representatives drawn from people who will take a keen interest in the work when he denies representation to the corporation on this body. The corporation is represented on all the public boards, on the boards of hospitals and mental hospitals, and to fail to provide representation on the board of assistance is not in keeping with these statements.  He may have ideas of his own, but I think it only right that we should know to what extent he proposes the development of plans for depriving members of the Dublin Corporation of representation. That board should never have been abolished, but the Minister is now taking power to refuse that representation to the citizens for another three years.  To deprive the citizens of representation on such an important body as St. Kevin's is unfair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the plea made by Deputy Doyle. Under the old arrangement with the board of assistance, a good deal of dissatisfaction was occasioned by the fact that the representation of the Dublin City Council was fixed on a very low basis.  I believe the numbers were five or seven, and if troubles arose in the board of assistance, very possibly they might have been traceable to the fact that the members of the city council were not all able to give constant attendance at meetings of the board of assistance; but, now that there is to be increased membership of 45 instead of 35 members, it would be wholly inconsistent, to say <Col N="783" /> the least of it, that the parent body should be deprived of any representation on the subsidiary body.  I suggest that, as that increase is provided for, the basis of representation on the board of assistance should be similarly increased.  In that way, you will get the attention which was possibly&mdash;I say, possibly&mdash;lacking, due to the limited number of members of the corporation on the board of assistance. Having regard to the expenditure of that body&mdash;over £500,000&mdash;which has to be paid on demand by the corporation, the time has arrived when the representatives of the city should have some voice in its administration.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy McGilligan, I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 7, Section 9 (1), to delete all words after the word &ldquo;court&rdquo; in line 6 down to and including the word &ldquo;dismissal&rdquo; in line 7 and substitute therefore the words &ldquo;the Justice of the District Court may, on the application of the complainant refer any question of law arising in such proceedings by way of case stated&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to provide that the only appeal from a dismiss in a prosecution of this kind under this measure will be on a question of law, arising in the course of the proceedings, and then only by way of case stated.  This Section 9 introduces for the first time a very serious and far-reaching principle in criminal procedure. I do not know how this particular section eluded the vigilance of the Ceann Comhairle, when it was put in by way of amendment on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  It was only by accident that I saw it at the time, and, certainly, if it had been possible for us to have been present when the amendment was introduced, we would have taken objection on a point of order that it was entirely outside the scope of the Bill and introduced a principle which had not been embodied on the Second Reading of the Bill. Deputies should be aware of this fact, that this section, introduced by way of <Col N="785" /> amendment on the Committee Stage of the Bill, brought into the Bill a principle which was not in the Bill when it was passed on Second Reading.  The principle is that, for the first time in a criminal case, there is an appeal given by the person who is entitled to bring the proceedings, in other words, in a State case there is an appeal given from a dismiss by the district justice. I am not aware that any justification was given for the introduction of that principle on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  Unfortunately, I was not able to be present.  I missed it by a few moments.</P>
    <P>Deputies, perhaps, are not aware of the fact that in a recent case the Supreme Court decided that a customs prosecution was a criminal cause or matter, and that that being so no appeal lay from a dismiss in favour of the citizen to the Circuit Court.  The right of the citizen always has been, where he is convicted, to appeal to the Circuit Court.  The prosecution has not that right.  The Supreme Court held, notwithstanding the fact that it had been previously held in other cases that the Revenue Commissioners had the right of appeal to the Circuit Court, that that was not the law at all, and that a customs prosecution was a criminal cause or matter.  It is interesting to notice that in the case decided in the Supreme Court&mdash;the Gethings case&mdash;which was, I think, a case for exporting prohibited goods, namely 240 dozen of eggs, it was brought under the Scrap Iron Act of 1938; in other words, that the exporting of eggs was contrary to the Scrap Iron Act.  The Supreme Court held &mdash;having teased the matter out&mdash;that a prosecution under the Scrap Iron Act of 1938 for exporting eggs was a criminal cause or matter and that, therefore, there was no appeal.</P>
    <P>At the very time that this House was discussing the Military Service Pensions Act and the advisability of interfering with the decisions of our courts, this amendment was slipped in on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  I want to register my formal protest against that procedure and against the principle embodied in this Bill.  I do not know why that was not seen by the Ceann <Col N="786" /> Comhairle.  Private Deputies know that their amendments are subjected to the greatest possible scrutiny.  Even up to yesterday, a number of amendments that we put in to various Bills were rejected by the Ceann Comhairle on the ground that they introduced on the Committee Stage something that had not been embodied in the principle of the Bill on the Second Reading.</P>

      <P>At all events, I am trying to make this last effort to direct public attention to this.  It is not possible to enter a negative on Report Stage providing that there should be no appeal.  The purpose of the amendment is to provide that there shall be no appeal except by way of case stated <Col N="787" /> on a question of law: in other words, that the citizen's rights, which have, been formally established by the Supreme Court, should be given effect to.  But no sooner was the decision of the Supreme Court given effect to than this section was slipped in unnoticed and, as I say, unwanted by the people.  It is contrary to the general principle of the criminal law. In a case where a person is prosecuted on a criminal charge the State or any State Department ought not to have any right to appeal.  It is the right of the citizen to appeal against a conviction, and was never the right and ought not to be the right of the State to prosecute a rehearing by way of appeal.  I want to register my protest against that without any hope that it will even be considered.</P>

The amendment is there and it is there by the will of the people. Deputy Costello says that the people do not want it.  What right has he to speak for the people any more than I have?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak for the majority of the people who are represented here by the Government of the day.  I can also say that the House made no protest when this amendment was introduced and passed in Committee. The Deputy said that he himself did not happen to be here.  If he was not here there were colleagues of his here, and a number of them took a considerable part in the Second Reading and Committee Stage discussions on the Bill.  Some of the lawyers amongst them were here, and they made their case against the amendment on the Committee Stage.  The House accepted the amendment and <Col N="788" /> there was no protest against its being inserted in the Bill.  Argument was made against it, and was carried on at considerable length, but as I have said, the House accepted the amendment and it is now in the Bill.  I think I would have to regard myself as being out of order if I were to refer to the matter further.</P>
      <P>I think the State ought to have the right to bring an appeal in the type of case covered by that new section which was put into the Bill on Committee. I am resisting the Deputy's amendment because the effect of it would be to abrogate, as far as that could be done at this stage, what the House did when it accepted that new section in Committee.  Deputy Costello has referred to the prosecution of persons suspected of being concerned in the export of eggs under the Scrap Iron Act.  It was to end that anomaly that this Bill was brought in. I may say that we had to proceed under the Scrap Iron Act because we had no other law for dealing with the smuggling of goods out of the country. That is our difficulty.  Because we have no other suitable law at present, we are using the Scrap Iron Act.  I admit that it looks ridiculous to bring a prosecution for the illegal export of eggs under the Scrap Iron Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be of considerable help to us.  There is too much smuggling and we have not been able to convict half the number of people we should like to convict. Some of the courts have not sometimes been as helpful as, I think, they should be.  I am not now speaking of the Supreme Court or the High Court.  We want to put power into the hands of our officers to enable the laws passed by the Oireachtas for the protection of the people to be put into operation.  This is a necessary step and it is not a unique step. Deputy Costello, if he examines the matter, will find that there are precedents.</P>

The Government wants to implement the law and to put a stop to the commission of crime&mdash;that is the blunt way of putting it.  The right of appeal is as necessary a part of the instrument as was the section introduced. I should be inclined to go a certain distance with the Deputy as regards the amendment introduced on the last stage, but it is there now.  I was not aware of its ramifications.</P>

They, probably, agreed that it was in order.  It may be that what Deputy Costello says is correct.  An argument could be put up to support that but the amendment is there and Deputy Costello wants to take from us the power which was given us on Committee Stage.  As Minister for Finance, I get reports of numerous cases of successful smuggling and of unsuccessful prosecutions for smuggling.  We want this amendment so as to bring to the courts of law and have punished people who are every day bringing goods out of the country which are required here.</P>

It is because that principle is embodied in this provision I am opposing it and not because I want to hamper the Revenue Commissioners in the prosecution of the law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>When we were discussing this matter in Committee, the Minister said that the main inspiration <Col N="790" /> behind the desire for right of appeal to a higher court was to obtain a high legal interpretation of what the custom law was.  Now the reason advanced seems to be different.  The Minister wants power to appeal now so as to get after those who break the law.  I am with the Minister in so far as he wants to chase wrongdoers and bring them to justice.  It has been stated&mdash;I think correctly&mdash;that a customs offence is a criminal offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Not all customs offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain customs offences.  When a person is tried before a district court for a customs offence which has a criminal taint and is acquitted by that court, that person should enjoy his acquittal in the same way as if he were acquitted of any other type of criminal offence.  If the State cannot marshal its evidence before the district court so as to obtain a conviction, they should put up with that in the same way as they have to put up with failure in other cases to bring people to justice.  If the purpose of the Minister was to get the highest possible interpretation of the law, I suggest that this amendment gives him a way out.  If the Minister's legal advisers lose a case in which it is important, from their point of view, to obtain clarification of the law from a higher tribunal, the district justice would be willing to state a case, I think, if the matter were put cogently to him and if counsel stated that he was acting on the instructions of the Attorney-General who, in matters of this kind, is the watchdog of the State. In that way, the law could be resolved by a higher tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Giving the Minister power to do that is giving him fairly wide power but it is, at least, protecting the ordinary citizen, who should be deemed innocent until he is proved guilty.  Under the Bill as it stands, a citizen may be forced, perhaps by misguided judgment, after he has secured an acquittal in the District Court, into the Circuit Court and there found guilty, possibly on a variety of grounds none of which might be associated with his actual offence.  If the Minister is anxious to <Col N="791" /> get a reasonable way out of the amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Deputy McGilligan I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 7, Section 9 (1), line 6, after the word &ldquo;court&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;and where the Attorney-General certifies that the decision of the court involves a point of law of exceptional public interest and that it is desirable in the public interest that an appeal should be taken&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose there is not the smallest hope of this amendment being considered, that there should be no appeal, except &ldquo;where the Attorney-General certifies that the decision of <Col N="793" /> the court involves a point of law of exceptional public interest, and that it is desirable in the public interest that an appeal should be taken.&rdquo;  That power is given the Attorney-General in respect of the right of appeal from the Central Criminal Court to the Supreme Court.  The idea is that if there is a proper case and if the Attorney-General can bring himself to give a certificate then the Revenue authorities would have the right of appeal.  This amendment goes some distance to meet the Minister's point of view and, at the same time, endeavours to maintain the general principle that there should be no right of appeal to the prosecutor in criminal cases.</P>

      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £9,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1945, for Transport and Meteorological Services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additional sums are required under a number of sub-heads on this Vote. The first is in respect of payment for steamer services.  As the House is aware, the steamer service between Galway and the Aran Islands is subsidised by the State, and during the emergency, because of the higher price of coal and less frequent sailings, a substantial loss upon that service has accrued, which was not offset by the amount voted in the subsidy.  During the course of this year a position arose in which additional money had to be made available to the company operating the service, or they would have to stop it, although authority had been given by various Orders to the company to enable it to increase freights. <Col N="795" /> The amount of the subsidy was fixed by the Aran Island Transport Act, 1936.  It was necessary to make a temporary amendment of that Act by an Emergency Powers Order, to permit additional subsidy being made available. The service, of course, is essential to the people resident on the Aran Islands, and the £700 which is asked for, in addition to the original subsidy of £300, will merely meet the loss on working the service during the present year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a first increase of 25 per cent. and a further increase of 20 per cent.  A number of the smaller harbour authorities had their sources of revenue dried up by reason of the stoppage of cross-Channel steamer services.  In some cases some essential maintenance works could not be undertaken because these harbour authorities had no revenue.  During the course of last year the Government decided that where a local authority in an adjoining area was willing to make a contribution to the cost of maintaining these harbours, the Government would also make a contribution.  Under that arrangement applications for assistance were received from a number of harbours and, in some cases, they have been granted.  In the case of Galway Harbour, a grant of £1,000 has been approved, half the estimated deficit for the year 1944.  The Galway County Council have agreed to contribute towards the deficit from its funds.  The amount which will be paid to the harbour authority will be £715, the balance being held until the actual deficit of the year has been more definitely ascertained. There was also an application from the Wexford Harbour Commissioners and in their case approval has been given for a grant not exceeding £718, the Wexford Corporation and the Wexford County Council having agreed <Col N="796" /> to strike a rate to make good the balance required to defray the harbour deficit.  In that case payment of £580 has been made and the balance will be retained until the audited accounts for the year are available.  In the case of the Ballina Harbour Authority a grant not exceeding £480 for the deficit of the year has been approved and the Mayo County Council have agreed to make a contribution, although the precise amount of its contribution has not yet been decided.</P>
      <P>Applications have been received from the Westport Harbour Commissioners, but in their case the execution of constructional works is necessary, and before any recommendation could be made as to the work to be done a detailed survey is necessary and arrangements have been made to have that detailed survey carried out by an engineer of the Board of Works.  Application was also received for assistance under this arrangement from the Tralee and Fenit Harbour Commissioners, but the application in that case has not yet been decided, so that no expenditure will arise in consequence of it in this financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other sub-heads of the Supplementary Estimate relate mainly to airports and air services.  The additional travelling expenses were due mainly to accountancy problems such as the accumulation of certain arrears of allowances payable to radio staff at the Dublin Airport and expenses incurred in the use of taxi vehicles for the transportation of staff from Limerick to Rineanna.  In connection with the Shannon Airport, bus services had to be provided for the staff now working at Foynes.  As the House is aware, there has been a substantial development at Foynes, which involved the bringing into that area of a large number of officials of one kind or another, officials of the Government or of the air operating companies. There was no housing accommodation in Foynes for them and; under present circumstances, that housing accommodation could not be provided.  The problem was met by the provision of special bus services from Limerick so that the position is that a large number of the staff employed at Foynes <Col N="797" /> reside in Limerick and are transported to and from Foynes by this special bus service every day.  During the course of the year it became necessary to provide a helper bus on that route and additional expenditure was incurred on that account.  Now that staff is being employed at the Rineanna Airport, it is necessary also to provide a bus service from Limerick to Rineanna. There are plans for the construction of hostel accommodation as well as ordinary housing in the vicinity of the Rineanna Airport, but for the present the staff employed there must reside in Limerick and be transported by bus.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The staff at Rineanna is, in the main, staff of the Department of Industry and Commerce, but there would, of course, be officials of the operating companies there as well. Deputies will note that there was a substantial loss in the catering service at Foynes.  That loss will not be a recurring loss.  The catering service was established in this year and substantial expenditure was incurred in ensuring that there would be available at Foynes restaurant and catering accommodation as good as existed at any airport anywhere.  I am sure the House will agree with the decision taken to ensure, by incurring whatever expenditure was necessary, that no complaint could be made as to the adequacy and standard of the catering accommodation at Foynes.  The circumstances under which these air services operate at the moment, however, make it impossible to operate the catering service there without loss.  Services are irregular.  The arrival of planes carrying passengers cannot be made known publicly at any substantial period in advance of their arrival.  The planes frequently come in late at night or early in the morning, but the services must be always ready to cater for them.  In normal circumstances, with greater regularity of traffic and the better circumstances that might be expected to exist in peaceful conditions, it is anticipated that the catering service there can be run without <Col N="798" /> loss.  In the meantime, however, it is desired to maintain the standard of the service, and, on that account, the State has undertaken the responsibility of meeting any loss that may occur.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to provide an additional £3,500 under the sub-head of Subsidy for Air Services.  The reason for that additional subsidy is the fact that our air service was suspended for a substantial period last year by the British authorities, for security reasons, prior to the commencement of military operations in Western Europe.  The fact that the service was completely grounded during these months increased the loss upon it and makes it necessary to provide an additional subsidy at this stage.</P>
      <P>The total amount required, as the House will see from the paper circulated, is £16,555.  There have, however, been savings upon other sub-heads amounting to £7,555, so that the net total of the Supplementary Estimate is £9,000, the amount now sought.</P>

As far as I can see, we are on the eve of fairly big air developments.

The ships of Irish Shipping Limited are serving only the larger harbours, and they have revenue from that service.  Therefore, these harbour authorities are excluded from the proposal.  Secondly, it is conditional on the local authority in the adjoining area being willing to contribute from the rates half of the cost of maintenance.  If there is a contribution from the local rates, the Government provides the other half.  The only applications we have had in which these conditions are complied with are those mentioned.</P>

      <P>On the adjournment Deputy Sheldon has given notice of his intention to raise the subject matter of Question 13 on to-day's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>At Question Time I asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he would state what were the special considerations which led him to select the location of the new sub-post office in Carndonagh, County Donegal. His answer, to my mind, evaded the question and therefore I felt bound to press the matter further.  That there were some special considerations taken into account I hope to demonstrate. That there were special considerations taken into account, no one in the town <Col N="802" /> of Carndonagh has any doubt.  The grounds they give are not the grounds upon which I propose to go.  They go on what you might call rumour or what you might call boasting on the part of certain people before the appointment was made at all that they were bound to get it, because certain representations were made on their behalf.  These are not the grounds upon which I propose to go.</P>
      <P>I suggest that in any appointment of this type, three main considerations are bound to be considered.  They are all of approximately equal importance, and the order in which I give them is not intended to convey any order of precedence.  They are (1) the suitability of the applicant; (2) the suitability of the premises offered by the applicant; (3) the location of the premises offered by the applicant, having regard to the convenience of the public in general, and, in the case of a town, the business community.  These three considerations, I think, can be demonstrated to be approximately equal.  Assuming that any two of them have been met satisfactorily, and that the third one is not satisfactory, I think it will be then found that the whole position is unsatisfactory.  For instance, if we assume that there are palatial and commodious premises situated in the geographical centre of the town concerned, but that the applicant was obviously uneducated or failing in some marked degree, then the fact that the applicant has palatial premises, and that they are centrally situated, should have very little bearing on the case.  In the same way, I suggest that even where the applicant is eminently suitable and the premises are eminently suitable, if the premises are located in such a way that the public is inconvenienced, then such an applicant would not be suitable.  I think it is fair to put the case in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I have to show then is that the Minister knew that the location was unsatisfactory in the main.  The most lucid way of explaining the matter would be to begin with a slight historical outline in order to show that the Minister has been thoroughly warned as to the unsuitability of the location of the premises.  On 4th December last <Col N="803" /> I received a telephone message from Carndonagh, saying that it had become known there that a certain person had succeeded in his application for the sub-post office, and that the premises concerned were located in a very unsuitable place.  They were, in fact, at the foot of an extremely steep hill.  In order to get from the new post office to the business centre of Carndonagh, one has to ascend a very steep hill, and the business community was very perturbed at this.</P>
    <P>On the following day, the 5th December, I came to Dublin.  I tried at 5 o'clock to get in touch with the Minister by telephone, but I was told he was busy.  The secretary suggested that I might make a minute of my observations and send them on to him. I pointed out to the secretary that the matter was very urgent.  I gave him certain details and asked him to give them to the Minister.  As well as that, I made the required minute and posted it to the Minister so that by the morning of the 6th December, assuming that the Post Office was able to transmit my letter to the G.P.O. overnight, the Minister was aware that there was perturbation in Carndonagh in regard to the location of these premises.</P>
    <P>The next thing I am aware of is that a telegram was sent from a meeting of businessmen in Carndonagh asking the Minister to receive a deputation in regard to the matter.  Later on, a reply was received that, as the appointment had been made&mdash;it was in fact made on the 6th December&mdash;he could see no useful purpose in a deputation coming so far&mdash;a very reasonable attitude. The next thing that happened was that the business community who were not satisfied sent a memorial to the Taoiseach which, I understand, was forwarded to the Minister.  I suggest that all this shows very clearly that just about the time the official appointment was made the Minister was very well aware that it was not considered a suitable appointment in Carndonagh.  I wrote to him on several occasions in reference to the matter and his replies were evasive.  He refused to answer the particular matter which I raised, namely, the location of the office.  He <Col N="804" /> talked about the suitability of the person, which I was not questioning, about the suitability of the premises, which I was not questioning, and I think he finished by referring to disappointed applicants kicking up rows.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it perfectly plain that I am not interested in any applicant.  I think the Minister should be aware of that; I made it clear in my letter.  I am looking at it from the point of view of the convenience of the public in Carndonagh.  It is a matter of no moment to me what applicant is selected so long as the premises are centrally situated.  I assume the Minister did not go to Carndonagh himself to interview the applicants, but I presume some competent official was sent up there for that purpose.  I presume that official made a report.  Since we are bound to assume that he was competent, I think it fair to assume also that the three considerations which I have mentioned would be borne in mind by that official in considering who was the most suitable applicant.  He would be bound to tell the Minister what he thought of the applicant as a person, what he thought of the premises offered by the applicant and what he thought of the position of the premises in relation to the geographical centre of the town.  I think it fair to assume that the Minister must be aware from his report that the particular premises which the Minister finally selected were not too well situated.  I should like the Minister to say, did the official report given to him by his own official indicate any priority and did the official state which applicant he thought most suitable, taking the three considerations into account and not just the merits of the applicant alone?  Was any recommendation made to him by his permanent staff at the Secretary's office?  Was this recommendation in accordance with the Minister's final decision?</P>
    <P>I suggest, Sir, that the Minister must have some extraordinary reason for selecting this peculiarly located office, and I want to know from the Minister what was that special reason.  As I say, the people of Carndonagh are not in the slightest doubt as to what that <Col N="805" /> special reason is, but I think it fair to give the Minister a chance of saying what was his special reason.  Were the qualifications of the applicant the Minister picked so outstanding that the others were nowhere?  Were the premises so superior to other premises offered that he could ignore the location? Is the Minister aware that the new premises are only half the size of the old premises, and will the Minister say that none of the other applicants had premises bigger than the new premises?</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be taken as querying the capabilities of the successful applicant, but I think it only fair to point out that the new office has been in operation since the 2nd February and it is still being run by a staff from Lifford Post Office.  I do not think that that shows any great capability on the part of the person selected by the Minister.  Perhaps the Minister would inform us who is paying the staff now operating the post office in Carndonagh.  Does the money come out of the emoluments of the person appointed, or is the staff being paid apart from these emoluments?  How long is the present arrangement going to continue?  I should say that there is no great indication of remarkable competence on the part of the person appointed.  Is the Minister aware, on the other hand, that one other applicant had seven years' post office experience, that another had very extensive clerical experience of a type particularly suitable to the operation of a country post office?  Now, as I say, I do not wish to be taken as suggesting that there was anything wrong with the person who was selected, but I do suggest that there were others who were at least equally suitable.  I further suggest that they had equally commodious premises and that they had more satisfactory premises from the point of view of the convenience of the public.</P>
    <P>Turning to the question of the expense of transferring business from the old post office to the new building, perhaps it is going a little outside the subject matter of the question, but I should like to know what, approximately, is the cost of the transfer, and <Col N="806" /> if the Minister could give us any idea at all as to how much it would have cost if the Minister had selected, as he could have selected, premises very much nearer to the old post office.  The appointment was made on the 6th December, but the work was not started, I think, until the 23rd January.  These figures are subject to verification by the Minister, because my local informant may very well have nodded, but I think they are substantially accurate.  Work was begun on the 23rd January and continued until the 23rd February, a period of one calendar month.  In that time, six post office workers, linesmen, were employed.</P>
    <P>As well as that, there were six unskilled labourers, which number dwindled later on to one or two.  I suggest that that is very considerable expense.  When you add to that the distance of the new post office from the old one, particularly at this time when the Minister is so carefully informing anyone who is looking for a new telephone that such things as lines are very difficult to get, I think there has been considerable unnecessary expense.  In view of all I have said&mdash;I do not wish to exaggerate&mdash;I think I am being perfectly fair in suggesting to the Minister that he must have some special reason. I think I am being perfectly fair also in refusing to be satisfied with the sort of half-answer which the Minister gave me at question time.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Carndonagh post office, I am willing to admit that a change to better premises now would mean great extra expense on the State, but what is the Minister's future policy going to be on this matter of appointments to post offices?  Are we to have a copy of the American spoils system?  There is in County Donegal an even more important post office than that in Carndonagh&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Very well&mdash;not that it does not make me even more suspicious to find the Minister so touchy.

The most important one is this: Was he aware before he made the appointment that the position was not quite satisfactory? Did the official report on the location of the various premises give any indication that the premises which the Minister had in fact selected were not satisfactory?  Did the Minister act on the official recommendation, or was he swayed by some other person?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The appointment was made on 30th November.  The person appointed was appointed on her qualifications; she was extremely suitable. It would be most undesirable for me to enter into the comparative qualifications of the other people, or to suggest any reasons why I did not appoint the other people.  I do not think we could discuss the matter from that point of view.  The candidate had sacrificed another business&mdash;had given up a licence which was attached to the premises, and had undertaken not to carry on a liquor trade there any more.  My Department had put all the facts before me, and the decision was my sole responsibility.  I decided to take her, in spite of the fact that very great personal friends of mine had made recommendations to me on behalf of other people.  No one can suggest for a moment that politics entered into the appointment which was made.  It is true that the premises are at the bottom of the hill.  There is a fairly steep hill there.  On the other hand, the premises are near the barracks and near a factory, and there is a very fair population on the other side, in the country parts, including a good many old age pensioners.  I did not put the hill there.</P>

They receive all the fats which can be made available to them from the Irish Oil and Cake Mills, Drogheda, and there is no other source from which I can arrange to procure supplies for them.

      <P>I am not aware of any avoidable delay in the issue of official footwear after vouchers have been distributed.  Owing to a strike in a tannery towards the end of 1944 the output of children's footwear fell below expectations.  The local authorities are being advised at short intervals by my Department as to the numbers of vouchers which may be released by them according to current information on the extent of production.  The production of official footwear achieved by the manufacturers in the December quarter was 30,000 approximately, and in the month of January, 1945, 31,000 approximately; total 61,000.  Authority for the issue of vouchers in respect of that number has been issued and the boots have been distributed or are in process of distribution. Meanwhile footwear manufactured in February is being distributed to retailers and supplies should at present exceed the number of vouchers issued.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that a married man (name supplied), who is suffering from tuberculosis and who has three children, all of whom occupy one room, has been unable to gain admission to Rialto Hospital, Dublin; and, if so, if he will cause inquiries to be made into this case; and if he will ensure that immediate temporary accommodation is provided for all patients urgently in need of treatment.</P>

      <P>From inquiries I have made in this case it is not correct to say that the person referred to has been unable to gain admission to Rialto Hospital.  In fact the patient only reported to the tuberculosis officer for the first time on the 1st ultimo and arrangements have been made by the local authority to admit him to Rialto Hospital for treatment. As regards the latter part of the question I have nothing to add to the full statements I made in the matter during the recent discussions on the Tuberculosis (Establishment of Sanatoria) Bill.</P>
