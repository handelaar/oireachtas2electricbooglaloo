      <P>The Leix County Council passed a resolution on the 3rd February requesting the county manager &ldquo;to make arrangements to ensure that as from 1st April, 1945, all employees of the board of health section work not more than 50 hours per week&rdquo;.  A copy of the resolution was transmitted to my Department by the manager on the 20th February. The manager at the same time intimated that he had informed the county council that even if it was decided to give effect to the terms of the resolution there is no living accommodation available for any extra staff which might thereby become necessary.</P>

    <P>No action by my Department is called for pending the submission of any specific proposals which the <Col N="994" /> manager may find it desirable and practicable to make.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state the total amount of money devoted during the past five years to medical research by Government grant and through Sweepstake funds; and if he proposes to increase the amount, which is considered to be totally inadequate, to meet the requirements of those endeavouring to improve the lot of sufferers from cancer, tuberculosis, rheumatism and other diseases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The total amount is £30,700.  Grants for medical research are reviewed at intervals, and the requests of the Medical Research Council are invariably carefully considered. It is not proposed to depart from this policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will make a statement <Col N="995" /> regarding supplies of tractors and binders for the coming sowing and harvesting seasons; how he proposes to allocate these, and whether a permit from his Department will be necessary for purchase; and, if so, whether applicants not supplied last year will get first consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Arrangements have been made for the importation of 600 Fordson tractors and 20 Marshall Diesel tractors.  Delays in transport are inevitable, but one cargo of 104 has already arrived and has been distributed.  Every person who was last year nominated for a tractor has received an offer of one this year.  Since last year over 1,500 new applications have been received for tractors.</P>
      <P>Arrangements have been made to import 750 reapers and binders.  Two hundred of these will be made by the International Harvester Company, 200 by Messrs.  Massey Harris, Ltd., of Canada, and 350 by the Cockshutt Company, Canada.  It is hoped to have them here in time to be assembled and delivered for use this season, but no guarantee of that can be given.  All these machines are subject to the availability of supply and shipping.</P>
      <P>We were short of 110 binders of last season's allocation.  These have now arrived and are being assembled.  They will be delivered to farmers who were nominated last year but were, unfortunately, disappointed.  Close on 2,000 new applications for binders have been received in my Department.</P>
      <P>The machinery mentioned will be purchased subject to permit issued by my Department and will be distributed through the ordinary trade channels. Arrangements have been made to allocate both tractors and binders on a county basis, and a quota has been tentatively fixed for each county.  I intend to ask the special committee in each county to assist me in selecting purchasers for the reapers and binders, and applicants who were not supplied last year will, I have no doubt, be given every consideration by the special committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tractors began to arrive almost <Col N="996" /> as soon as we received information of the number allocated and there was not time to consult the special committee; but the name and address of every applicant have been forwarded to Messrs.  Ford and Son. Ltd., and their agents are working on those lists. Approved purchasers will receive permits, but as the demand far exceeds the supply there will be many intending purchasers whose orders cannot be filled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say what he means by an approved purchaser? Is it approved by his Department?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for agriculture if he will state if it is his intention to close down the creamery known as the Rineen branch of the Cork and Kerry Creamery Company situated in West Cork; if so, if he is aware that the closing of this creamery <Col N="997" /> will cause serious inconvenience and hardship to many of the suppliers, and if he will make a statement in the matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that, as a result of the taking over of the privately-owned creameries in West Cork, certain creamery employees, some with long years of service, will lose their employment; and, if so, if he will state what provision is made to compensate or pension these persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take Questions Nos. 9, 10 and 11 together.  No decision has yet been reached in regard to the closing of any creamery properties in West Cork which may be acquired under the Creameries (Acquisition) Act, 1943.</P>
      <P>As regards compensation, I would refer the Deputy to my closing speech in the Dáil on the final stage of the Creameries (Acquisition) Act, 1943 (Columns 2454 and 2455 of the Official Report of May, 1943), in which I indicated the compensation to be paid to employees who lose employment as a result of the operation of the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Driscoll</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give me any idea of the date when these creameries will be taken over? Can he say how many of them will be closed?  I should like to point out that there are farmers at present going to certain creameries that are expected to close, or that are suspected of being about to be closed, and they are not sure to what creamery they will have to go in a month or so.  Will the Minister give some indication of what the position is likely to be?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A sales order is being served, I think to-day, on the proprietors concerned and, under the Act passed here in 1943, six weeks must elapse before the creameries can be taken over.  They may be taken over by the Dairy Disposals Board at the <Col N="998" /> end of six weeks, if agreement is not reached in the meantime.  With regard to the closing, I cannot say what the Dairy Disposals Board may propose with regard to any individual creamery.  That is a matter that will have to get full consideration.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures if he will adopt in the Dáil a similar procedure to the one he has agreed to adopt in the Seanad for the censoring of Press reports, namely, to consult with the Ceann Comhairle or the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or with representatives of the principal Parties before censoring the Press publication of matters raised in the Dáil; and, if so, if he will state what method of consultation he will adopt.</P>

      <P>I would respectfully point out that it has arisen on many occasions.  The proceedings of this Dáil have been censored from the public Press&mdash;proceedings which were reported in the Parliamentary Debates. I will give the Minister one example which I take because it is the most recent, not because it is in any way necessarily the most important.  On February 1st, 1945, in this House, a Deputy mentioned a matter and it was reported in the Parliamentary Debates in column 2018, vol. 95.  That matter, which had to do with the censorship in connection with the St. John Ambulance, was not mentioned in the following day's papers.  It was censored out of them.  That was on February 1st. The matter was raised again the following day by the same Deputy and it was reported.</P>

      <P>That intimates that the necessity has not arisen during the last five years.  The censorship has been carried on in connection with the proceedings of this House apparently without consultation with anybody.  I am asking that the Minister will do for this House what he said he would for the Seanad, namely, consult with the Ceann Comhairle, or with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, or with the representatives of the leading Parties, before such a serious step is taken.

    <P>It is the general practice to broadcast important Gaelic Athletic Association matches played in Dublin.  The Director of Broadcasting is in close touch with the Gaelic Athletic Association regarding the question of matches to be broadcast, and the association is quite satisfied with the present position. It would be impossible for me to give any undertaking with regard to the alteration of radio programmes, because programmes must be planned a long time in advance, and alterations <Col N="1003" /> would give rise to serious difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Tánaiste say whether there is any difficulty in referring the Mental Treatment Bill to a special committee of the House, provided agreement can be secured amongst all Parties?  It is, in the <Col N="1004" /> main, a machinery Bill.  It contains 272 sections, to which there are 310 amendments.  The amendments alone are very much bigger than an ordinary Bill and it is not unusual to deal with a Bill of this kind as I suggest.  I think it would make for closer consideration and more detailed examination of the Bill and the rights of all Parties in the matter could be safeguarded on the Committee Stage. It would take the Bill out of the House and enable the House to deal with other matters, while in no way neglecting a detailed consideration of the measure.  It might be that certain clauses are contentious, but even that difficulty could be surmounted by recommitting the Bill and allowing a Committee Stage discussion on the limited number of sections which might be contentious.  I do not know whether that proposal commends itself to the other Parties, but it is not an unusual course to adopt in relation to a Bill of this character.  Is there any real difficulty, from the Government point of view, in sending the Bill to a special committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="An Tánaiste Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Deputy did not give me notice of his intention to raise this matter, because this Bill is ordered as first business to-day, and I am afraid we could not now alter the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="An Tánaiste Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear of it, but I think there is something to be said for the Deputy's point of view.  I do not know what the views of other Parties on the matter are, and perhaps if the Deputy and the Parliamentary Secretary, who is mainly concerned in the matter, agreed, the matter could be discussed in the usual way by the Whips with a view to seeing whether the House in general would agree to his proposal.  If they agree, I do not see any insuperable objection to adopting the Deputy's suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no rooted objection to the adoption of the suggestion, but I do not believe it will result <Col N="1005" /> in a saving of time, because when we come back to the House, after losing a lot of time in Committee, we shall have to go through the same process. We will make as much headway here to-day as we would make with a special committee, provided Deputies do not make too many or too long speeches.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be all right where there was full agreement, but in relation to every matter on which we are unable to get agreement, the suggestion is that we should have a Committee Stage in the House.  We will not have any difficulty with regard to matters on which we are in agreement. It is the matters on which we are not in agreement which will entail discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary has had experience of special committees of this kind, but it is generally accepted that a special committee is an expeditious way of dealing with a Bill. There are 310 amendments, but there are not half a dozen Deputies interested in the Bill.  I am prepared to bet that there will not be a quorum while the Bill is being discussed.  The only folk who will remain in the House will be the people who are keenly interested.  If that is the position, and I suspect it is, unless there is some mobilisation order served on Deputies, the best thing to do is to have the Bill dealt with by a special committee.  We would get a much closer discussion of it in that way.</P>

      <P>I can see the difficulty of the Government deciding to adopt the suggestion straight away, but after seeing what progress is made up to whatever point the discussion reaches to-day, if the Government decided that it would suit them to send the Bill to a special committee, I appreciate that it would be a saving of time in the House.  We would be completely in agreement with the setting up of a special committee if that would suit the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 10, to insert before the definition of the appropriate assistance officer the following definition:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the word `addict' means a person who&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  by reason of his addiction to drugs or intoxicants is either dangerous to himself or others or incapable of managing himself or his affairs or of ordinary proper conduct, or</P>
      <P>(b)  by reason of his addiction to drugs, intoxicants or perverted conduct is in serious danger of mental disorder;</P>
      <P>This amendment might, perhaps, be related to amendments Nos. 13 and 241, the three of which together provide the necessary machinery for bringing addicts within the terms of the Bill. The word &ldquo;addict&rdquo; is defined in this amendment.  Deputies who are interested in this matter are, I am sure, satisfied that addiction to drugs, particularly to alcohol, is one of the most widespread and most potent causes of mental disorder.  Indeed, it may be said&mdash;it is held by some authorities&mdash;that the addiction itself is evidence of mental ailment. Similarly, moral pervertion is a potent contributing cause, and is often due, in fact, to a disordered mental state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most medical men have from time to time been confronted with a very difficult problem in relation to these matters.  I myself, in my years of practice, have on many occasions been <Col N="1009" /> confronted with great difficulty in connection with the classes of people that this amendment is intended to deal with.  Some of these unfortunate people get well, sometimes the case ends in death and sometimes it ends in tragedy.  As the law stands at the present time, we have no adequate machinery for dealing with that particular social problem.</P>
    <P>Some four or five years ago&mdash;five years ago to be correct&mdash;when I first devoted my attention to the construction of a new mental code&mdash;it seems a long time ago but, in fact, it is five years since I began the structure that is now before the House&mdash;I raised this matter of drug addicts with the advisers in the Department.  To my surprise, I found that a Departmental Committee had been set up by the Right Honourable J. H. Gladstone as far back as 1908.  It reported in great detail and made certain recommendations.  Nothing, however, was done in the matter of giving effect to these recommendations. As the machinery of our new mental code began to take shape, it became evident to me that in our new approach to the whole matter of mental disorder, and the machinery that we proposed providing, we could very properly fit into that machinery provision for dealing with drug addicts and persons of perverted conduct.  I have since consulted the Medico Psychological Society and the Medical Association of Eire, as well as various people, both medical and lay, and everybody seems to approve of the proposals that are now before the House.  I should tell the House that, at this stage, we can only provide the necessary machinery, and that until such time as suitable institutions are available we cannot deal adequately with the problem that this amendment is intended to deal with.  It will only be in case of urgency, or particular emergency, that addicts will be received in the ordinary mental institutions. In the course of time it is hoped that we may be able to provide special institutions, and that, as soon as we are able to make the necessary institutional provision available, we shall have the administrative machinery which will be necessary effectively to deal with the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the introduction of this amendment adds to the value of the Bill.  It is, in a way, I think, peculiar that it was not in the original draft.  The Parliamentary Secretary has explained that, as the new attitude towards the treatment of mental diseases came to be appreciated, it was realised that there were certain other additions to the Bill that were required.  I intervene for the purpose of raising a question with regard to the actual wording of the amendment.  One phrase in it seems to me to be too general.  The amendment says that the word &ldquo;addict&rdquo; means &ldquo;a person who by reason of his addiction to drugs or intoxicants is either dangerous to himself or others, or incapable of managing himself or his affairs or of ordinary proper conduct.&rdquo;  It seems to me that the final three words &ldquo;ordinary proper conduct&rdquo;, when taken in conjunction with the machinery provided later in the Bill for the examination and certification of persons requiring treatment could, in certain circumstances, be open, I will not say to abuses, but to a certain degree of loose application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When dealing with a Bill of this character one thing that is absolutely essential is to provide that there should not be the slightest loophole for any class of treatment being meted out to persons which is not fully warranted by their mental state and the requirements of the law.  I feel that in relation to these last three words &ldquo;ordinary proper conduct&rdquo; it is possible to envisage a situation where they could be open to abuse. Take, for example, a person addicted to intoxicating liquor.  We are all familiar with a person who, by reason of continuous abuse of that kind, has to a large extent become almost an addict in every sense of the word, but yet, in many ways, is not incapable of managing his affairs.  He is not in any way dangerous to himself or others though he may be an annoyance to persons charged with carrying out other provisions of the law.  On a far-fetched, or even on a personal interpretation of these three words in the amendment, I can quite readily see individuals being regarded as coming within the definition&mdash;as being classed as addicts&mdash;and, <Col N="1011" /> therefore, subjected to treatment under this measure, regardless of their own wishes in the matter.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that, while the wording of the first part of the amendment is quite acceptable, these three words might be further considered, so that there will be no danger of this provision being applied in a manner in which, I think, we all feel it should not be applied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that, when the Deputy relates the proposal to the machinery of reception in an institution, he will have any anxiety as to the probability of abuse.  There are very few laws passed through this House under which abuses cannot take place. If we were only to pass such laws as could not, under any conceivable circumstances be abused, I am afraid we would have to neglect the passing of a lot of very useful legislation.  This definition is, in fact, based upon the recommendation of a commission that reported about 36 years ago on this social problem.  The definition is, &ldquo;amongst other things, incapable of managing himself and his affairs or of ordinary proper conduct by reason of his addiction to drugs&rdquo;.  It is easy, I suppose, accurately enough to predict the possibility of a person not conducting himself properly while under the influence of a drug, but I think it is foolish to assume that immediately a man does such a thing he is going to be dealt with under the terms of this Bill and is going to be run into an institution.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will allow me.  In the first instance, the appropriate medical officer will have to examine him and will have to certify that he is satisfied that he is a person suitable for reception.  The resident medical superintendent of the institution, who is a trained psychiatrist and a specialist in such matters, will examine the patient <Col N="1012" /> before the patient is received and the patient will not be received unless the resident medical superintendent is satisfied that he is a person suitable for reception.  There is the further safeguard of the frequent visits and inspections of the inspector of mental hospitals and of the machinery for appeal to the Minister if any person considers that he is being wrongfully detained.  I think that the safeguards that are afforded to the community in that way, and to the classes of persons who may find themselves within the scope of this Bill, are adequate.  While I quite appreciate that the point Deputy Larkin makes is a good enough debating point, I think if we try to meet it, we may defeat the purpose of the amendment.</P>

      <P>We have to keep at the back of our minds that this matter has been under consideration by the Department for over five years, that it was not put into the Bill as presented to the House, that it is now put in and the wording is taken, we are told, from the report of a commission which reported 36 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1013" /> Therefore, it would seem to be a complete afterthought, although there was five years' consideration.  It is very necessary to see that any person who should be confined will be confined but it is equally important, perhaps more important, to see that a person whom this House never intended should come under the Act will not be brought under it.  Again we come to the old thing that happens here&mdash;what the Minister intends should happen and the interpretation of the Bill when it becomes law, will be two completely different things.  The Minister may have in mind that such a thing should happen; inspectors may do this and superintendents may do that, but they are, of course, bound by the terms of the Act as it leaves the Oireachtas and not by what the Minister's wishes may be, unless the Minister's wishes are carried correctly into the Bill.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should, if possible, clarify this further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice in the Parliamentary Secretary's reply that the definition is confined to drug addicts.  In the case of a drug addict, there is, in my opinion, a <i>prima facie</i> case for treatment, but, although I am a teetotaller, I do not admit that the same ground exists in regard to a person who takes intoxicating liquor.  I can envisage a situation arising where a person who is addicted to taking too much liquor may leave himself open to being brought under the machinery of the Bill.  The Parliamentary Secretary says there are many safeguards in the Bill to prevent persons being regarded as coming within the Bill who should not be so regarded.  He overlooks the fact that we are dealing here with a disease that is peculiar in the sense that there is a very fine balance between the mentally sane and the mentally ill.  I have in mind one particular case of a boy who recently in Dublin was a member of a crowd watching an ordinary incident in the street.  The boy was subject to fits, and when the Gárdaí came to move the crowd along, the boy became excited and took a fit.  The Guard thought he was being obstreperous and had him removed to the station. Subsequently the boy went into <Col N="1014" /> Grangegorman.  He had become a person who needed treatment.  I would submit that there are many border-line cases where all that is required to make them persons of unsound mind is the knowledge that they have been brought under this machinery, even for a short period.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to reduce the number of persons of unsound mind, not to add to it, and I think that if it is only a question of getting some formula or some tighter drafting, it is worthy of consideration.  I think it would be a difficult task to get a definition of &ldquo;ordinary proper conduct&rdquo; which would satisfy the ordinary person that it does not leave many loopholes.  It is quite true for the Parliamentary Secretary to say that we cannot make perfect Acts, but at least we can try.  The expression &ldquo;ordinary proper conduct&rdquo; is so wide that I think many of us on many occasions would be liable to the same fault with which we are going to charge other people.  Even the ordinary normal person, under certain stresses, perhaps through drink, drugs, emotion or economic pressure, very often is guilty of improper conduct.  I do think a further attempt should be made to get a more clear definition, at least of these final three words in the sub-section.</P>

It includes a lineal ancestor or a lineal descendant or a lineal descendant of an ancestor not more remote than the great-grand-father or great-grandmother.  Any of these could make an application perhaps to a pliable dispensary doctor. An obnoxious relative, shall we say an individual who had some nuisance value in the family, may be conveniently got rid of in this fashion.

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is shifting his ground.  It is a big advantage to the House in dealing with this Bill that we have in charge of the Bill a medical doctor. That can be very helpful.  But, if we are to approach the consideration of this measure purely and solely from the point of view of a medical doctor, it may not be so helpful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said that the machinery under the Bill for the medical examination is suitable.  The point, I submit, <Col N="1020" /> is that it is possible, under the section under which these persons may be brought up for examination, for any person to make an application to have an individual examined.  That individual may leave himself open to that by reason of certain conduct.  That person may be one of the border-line cases who, if no undue stress is placed on his mind, may never require treatment. But the fact of his being examined as a person of unsound mind, his examination and certification, may be the actual thing which would cause his mind to become temporarily diseased.</P>
      <P>The person who is to be examined already knows that he is under suspicion of either being a person of unsound mind or, to use the more common phrase, a lunatic. I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary, as a medical man, will realise that that in itself may be sufficient to sway the balance.  If we leave the definition as wide as it is here, I submit that it is possible that many people guilty of what we would call unusual conduct, but still quite capable of carrying out &ldquo;ordinary proper conduct&rdquo; in the major portion of their lives, will find themselves drawn within this net.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have mentioned the case of this boy who was not going to be a patient in Grangegorman, but who is a patient there because of an unfortunate set of circumstances.  I am quite sure that the doctor who examined him was quite satisfied that, at the moment when he examined him, he was a fit and proper person for treatment, but if he had examined him before this incident arose he would say that all he required was ordinary medical treatment for his body and not treatment for his mind.  I have already said that our task is to reduce the number and not make it possible to add to it. I think it is an ordinary fair submission of the definition of what is right conduct and, quite clearly, the ordinary words having an ordinary application may give rise to possible abuse and it should get further consideration.  I do not think it is unreasonable to ask that one should spend time trying to find a better definition.  It is quite clear that any person sitting on the problem in <Col N="1021" /> seclusion, and not having submitted it to the test of debate, cannot see all the implications.  I am convinced that enough has been said in this matter to make a case for further consideration of these final words.</P>

      <P>But the Bill sets down that paying patients, in the original definition, should be able to pay for their maintenance.  It says: &ldquo;...able to pay the whole of the cost of his <Col N="1023" /> treatment, maintenance, or advice in a mental institution;&rdquo;.  It is on the word &ldquo;advice&rdquo; that amendment No. 7 was put down.  We are commencing under this Bill a new procedure, namely to set up clinics to give advice to persons who may require it in regard to their mental state.  It is a new and modern departure from the old practice, and the feeling that we had in these benches was that we should regard this as a general public health measure in so far as giving advice was concerned.  We should not, in relation to this principle of giving advice, confine it in any way by the stipulation that payment must be made for it.  It is agreed that, in so far as treatment and maintenance are concerned, those in a position to contribute towards the cost should be required to do so.  As an ordinary public health measure, however, we feel that it is good public health policy to provide all the advice possible free of charge to any person who feels he is in need of it.  It was in order to enable us to raise that matter later in the Bill on the appropriate sections that amendment No. 7 was put down at this stage.</P>

      <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary make this matter a little clearer?  As far as I can see, the main qualifying clause is &ldquo;for profit&rdquo;.  Has the Parliamentary Secretary in mind any machinery to determine actually when that particular phrase would apply&mdash;whether the institution is being run for profit or otherwise?  In the earlier definition it was easy to arrive at a conclusion, because it was a question of treating patients gratuitously or at less than cost.  But profit does open a wide field. Whether there is any machinery, I cannot see, except that there may be through the visits of the inspectors of mental hospitals.  Whether that would be the form of machinery to arrive at a decision on this matter, I do not know.</P>

Private institutions will be under a statutory obligation to submit an abstract of accounts, and the Minister would determine whether the institution was being run for profit or not. There was a difficulty about the original definition&mdash;&ldquo;carried on wholly or mainly for the care of persons of unsound mind gratuitously or at less than cost.&rdquo;  The draftsman's difficulty, when it came to a close examination of the definition, was that some patients might be maintained at more than cost, and others at less than cost or perhaps free; but, on balance, that the institution as a whole would not be run at a profit.  It was for that reason that the re-draft was submitted.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is largely in reference to a condition that arises in the City of Dublin, where we have a large number of persons coming in to reside in the city and, in the ordinary course, they require the benefits of the various social services or, as in this case, treatment in a mental hospital. It is suggested that in relation to this section, which states that a person of no fixed residence shall be regarded as ordinarily resident at the place where he is for the time being, it should be qualified to the extent that &ldquo;unless it can be shown that he was ordinarily residing elsewhere in the State during the previous two years&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I submit that if we have a person coming to Dublin from one of the outlying counties and subsequently requiring treatment, it is imposing a burden on the local mental hospital authorities to have that person regarded as being a resident of Dublin because he happens to reside here at that particular moment.

      <P>In sub-section (2), line 37, to delete the words &ldquo;if the Minister so directs&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to <Col N="1032" /> try to retain for mental hospital authorities at least sufficient power to enable them to carry out their duties with a reasonable sense of responsibility. The sub-section states that an auxiliary mental hospital shall be either a separate hospital, or, if the Minister so directs, a part of the relevant district mental hospital, and we feel that, inasmuch as the local mental hospital authority has responsibility for dealing with the whole of the mental hospital district, it should be sufficient to leave it to its discretion to decide whether the auxiliary hospital can be adequately provided as part of the relevant district hospital or whether it requires a separate institution. If the words which we propose to delete are allowed to stand, we feel from experience that the matter will be regarded more from the point of view of economy than any other, and that the view the Minister would take would be somewhat contrary to that of the committee.  We suggest that inasmuch as the committee is charged with responsibility, it should not be confined in any niggardly fashion, but should be allowed to decide whether an auxiliary mental hospital should be provided within the confines of the existing hospital or as a separate institution.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Deputy need press his amendment very strongly, because it is unlikely that the Minister will have to direct a mental hospital authority in such a matter, but, at the same time, such an occasion might arise, and if the Minister had not power to give such a direction, the best possible facilities might not be provided.  I have never heard of any complaint on the score that the Minister abused the power. The Deputy may not be aware that it is not a new power.  The Minister has had this power under Section 76 of the Local Government Act of 1898, and there has never been any complaint as to the manner in which the power was exercised.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), lines 1 and 2, to delete the words &ldquo;may, with the consent of the Minister and shall, if the Minister so directs&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing here with one new phase of mental treatment, namely, the establishment of consulting rooms and clinics.  The section provides that the mental hospital authorities &ldquo;may&rdquo;, with the consent of the Minister, and &ldquo;shall&rdquo; if the Minister so directs, provide clinics and consulting rooms and so on.  We feel that, instead of leaving the matter optional with the mental hospital authority, it should be made mandatory.  There should be a primary responsibility placed on the mental hospital authority to give effect to what is now recognised as probably one of the most valuable features of the Bill, namely, that before persons are brought within the atmosphere of a mental hospital they can go there voluntarily of their own free will to receive advice and treatment which, in many cases, may be all that is required to keep them normal people. This is such a valuable public health measure that there should be no <Col N="1034" /> ambiguity about the wording of the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that the section, as it stands, provides better machinery &mdash;machinery that is more likely not to break down&mdash;than that which is proposed in the amendment.  It is all right to assume that the mental hospital authority will provide these clinics, but we have to envisage the possibility that, in certain instances, they might perhaps be reluctant to do so.  Apart from that, there is a more important issue at stake in the section as drafted. It is necessary that the Minister should be in a position to co-ordinate the provision of such clinics.  The type of cases that may be catered for in different clinics will not always be the same, and if the mental hospital authority, in their enthusiasm, were to establish clinics without any co-ordinating control or direction, the results might not be as satisfactory as they otherwise might be.  I would draw Deputy Larkin's attention to the fact that the section gives the mental hospital authority power, with the consent of the Minister or at the direction of the Minister, to provide mental treatment either in their own district mental hospital or elsewhere.  Co-ordination within their own district is all right, but, once they go outside their own district to provide clinics, we might find two or three mental hospital committees providing the same type of clinics in the same area.  I think, therefore, that the case for retaining full Ministerial control is complete.</P>

      <P>There is not much point in putting a statutory obligation on the Minister to consult the mental hospital authorities.  It would be a very cumbersome machinery if he had to consult with each mental hospital authority before he could make general regulations. If two or three mental hospital authorities raised pernickety questions it might take him a long time to make <Col N="1041" /> his regulations effective.

      <P>In sub-section (1), page 27, line 18, to delete the word &ldquo;overtime&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to secure that in the calculation of the value of emoluments overtime should be included.  I know that in a number of Acts there has been a tendency to exclude overtime.  But, as overtime does constitute payment for work done and emoluments are based in part on the salaries set down for the normal work performed by persons coming within the section of the Act, I think it is invidious that the value of the portion of the work they perform under that heading of overtime should not be taken into consideration in regard to emoluments.  It is quite possible in relation to certain servants of mental institutions that they would normally be engaged on very consistent overtime.  I have in mind such persons as those engaged on maintenance duties in connection with the building itself and the equipment; persons engaged in attending to boilers, electricians, plumbers, etc.  Subject to correction, I believe that in one of the earlier Acts governing superannuation for this class of employment overtime is included.  I submit that it is not equitable to exclude it in arriving at the value of the emoluments for superannuation purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I must oppose the principle in this amendment, because I do not think it is a sound social principle, apart from any other aspect of it. Persons who are in a privileged position now, having ordinary normal employment, plus overtime employment, are considerably better off anyhow not only than people who have no employment but than people who have normal employment.  I think that the principle of overtime is a bad one, and that, if it is made attractive, it must <Col N="1046" /> inevitably have the result of producing less employment and creating more and more overtime employment and that our aim ought to be to discourage overtime rather than to encourage it. A man who gets periods of overtime has the extra cash income during the period he is so employed, and if he can also look forward to higher superannuation when he retires, the inevitable result of that must be to endeavour to get as much overtime as he possibly can.  On the ground that the principle of overtime is unsound, I am opposed to this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am even more opposed than the Minister is to the principle of overtime, but it is one thing being opposed to the principle of overtime and it is another thing, when the overtime is actually worked, not giving the individual proper credit for the actual work he has performed. After all, persons who are going to work overtime have not the final say as to whether they will work the overtime or not.  If there is proper conduct of the institution and proper supervision, it is quite clear that only necessary overtime will be worked, and overtime cannot be artificially created.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is quite aware that in many of these institutions overtime arises, say, in the case of an electrician or a plumber where there is a breakdown, or in the case of attendants in a boiler-house or engine-house, or where the work of a carpenter cannot be performed during normal hours.  All these are cases of overtime over which the individual worker has no control, and in many cases he may have a personal objection to performing the work because of the inconvenience.  To suggest that to include overtime in the definition of emoluments is to make a superannuation so attractive as to encourage the working of overtime is to strain the argument to a very considerable extent. It means that the individual is going to look some 25 or 30 years ahead and calculate to the nearest penny how much his superannuation is going to be increased if he works so many hours overtime each week at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1047" /> I am with the Parliamentary Secretary in opposition to overtime, but I think a great deal more could be done, possibly, by the Government than by those who speak on the Opposition Benches.  So long as overtime is worked, it is not contrary to principle that equity shall be given to the individual who has to perform that overtime. In so far as that overtime does constitute portion of his wages or salary for work performed and in so far as his superannuation is calculated on his salary or wage, in all equity he is entitled to have the whole of his remuneration for work performed&mdash;I am leaving out altogether such items as travelling expenses and additional allowances&mdash;included in the calculation of superannuation.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to comment upon what I mentioned before&mdash;that, <Col N="1048" /> in earlier Acts, overtime was included and that this is a departure.  I think I am right in that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 62:&mdash;</P>

      <P>(4) For the purpose of this Part of</P>

      <Col N="1051" /> this Act, service rendered before the coming into force of this Part of this Act to a committee of management of a mental hospital provided under Section 9 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, shall be deemed to be service under a mental hospital authority and in case the service or any part thereof was service with a committee to which a joint board are a successor, the service or the said part of the service shall be deemed to be service with the joint board.</P>
    <P>This amendment is proposed because it is felt that there is a certain ambiguity in the drafting of sub-section (4).  It arises because we have the new definition coming into existence under the Act and also varying dates for the coming into force of the different parts of the Act.  The sub-section relates to the service of an officer or servant of a mental hospital authority which was given before the commencement of this Part of the Act.  There may be a gap between the coming into force of the main Act and this particular part referring to superannuation, and yet, once the earlier parts come into force, we have the new definition of a mental hospital authority which is set out in the measure.  The point has been raised that when the Act comes into force the earlier parts up to Part VII. with this new definition also come into force. Does that give rise to any difficulty in so far as service given to a mental hospital authority would technically commence only from the commencement of the earlier parts of the Act?</P>

I do not like the idea of amending the 1909 Act, seeing that we are providing another code.  The position I should like to see is that the officers and servants affected will either remain under the 1909 Act, or accept the terms of the new Act.  While I say that, a very strong case can be made, and has been made, in very brief terms in favour of the aggregation of the three years instead of the ten provided in the 1909 Act.

It is proposed to substitute the word &ldquo;usual&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;normal&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;usual&rdquo; appeared in the old Act, and there was no particular purpose in changing from &ldquo;usual&rdquo; to &ldquo;normal&rdquo; except that &ldquo;normal&rdquo; appeared to be the better term.  Representatives of workers in the mental hospitals have been a bit disturbed as to the possibility of a new interpretation being put on the new word.

    <P>Sub-section (3) of the section provides that &ldquo;no name shall be entered in or removed from a register maintained under this section save with the consent of the Minister&rdquo;.  On further examination, it appeared to us that this machinery provided for cumbersome administration: that the consent of the Minister would have to be secured for the entry of every name on the register.  It appeared desirable that the mental hospital authority would maintain their register in the ordinary way by entering the names of people who were normally employed in the care and charge of patients, and that only when a name was to be removed would the Minister come into it, or <Col N="1057" /> that where a person felt aggrieved because his name was not included, he would be given the opportunity of appealing to the Minister.</P>

It might not be held that, in the normal course of his duty, he was mainly engaged in charge of patients. You cannot have any hard-and-fast rules about these matters.  Each case has to be examined on its merits.  The idea is that the mental hospital authority will compile its register and that the names of those normally engaged in the care of patients will be entered in it.  In the border line cases, that is, of those who are occasionally so engaged, they will be determined by the Minister.  At least, their names will not be entered without the consent of the Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the section a nurse, male or female, entering the service of a mental hospital at the age of 20 years would have to serve 35 years before he or she qualified for a pension.  The Parliamentary Secretary will realise the heavy strain and boredom attached to mental nursing.  Many of the <Col N="1058" /> nurses, male or female, may like to carry on until they reach the age stipulated in the section, but there may be others who, due to nervous strain or other cause, may not be able to do so.  They should have the opportunity of retiring on a pension at the age of 50.  I do not want the age of 50 to be a permanent thing, or that nurses should be compelled to retire at that age.  What I am anxious about is that if they desire to retire at 50 they should be able to do so and be entitled to receive a pension.</P>

      <P>It is surprising to find this amendment supported&mdash;in fact, fathered&mdash;by the Farmers' Party.  I am not finding any fault with them for that.  I welcome their enlightened outlook. It would be well that Deputies should realise what the amendment means.  The representatives of the Farmers' Party are asking the House to concede the principle that an able-bodied man should be permitted to retire when he reaches the age of 50 years if he is in the mental hospital service.  I suggest that is a rather early age to retire&mdash;that it is too early. I think that the age set out in the Bill is not an unreasonable age, taking into full consideration the onerous nature of the duties that mental hospital nurses and attendants are called upon to discharge.  A number of us would feel quite disturbed if we were told that at the age of 50 we had ceased to be of much further use, and that we should become a charge on the community. It is well, <i>apropos</i> of something that I read in to-day's newspapers, to remind the House that a principal plank in the platform of the Farmers' Party in particular is that the rates must be kept down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well that we should advert to the fact that acceptance of this amendment is going to bring an increased charge on the rates.  On other sections of the Bill I hope to demonstrate to <Col N="1059" /> the House, and I hope to have the full support of the Farmers' Party, that the effect of this Bill as it stands is going to be a very substantial increase in the demand that will be made on the rating authorities. People may say that this is a contributory scheme.  It is nominally contributory. Do not forget that 84 per cent. of the cost of superannuation, notwithstanding the fact that it is deemed to be contributory, is borne by the rates.  Consequently, we have to bear in mind that as we add to the burden, in a welcome spirit of generosity, we are passing on 84 per cent. of it to the ratepaying community.</P>
    <P>That issue will arise perhaps in a more acute form on other sections of the Bill, but I do suggest to the House that whatever may be said&mdash;and a lot can be said&mdash;for particularly generous treatment of the officers we are dealing with in this Bill, much cannot be said in favour of allowing them to retire at the age of 50, after 20 years' service, if they are in good health. Bear in mind that if they are not in good health, they can retire, and there are provisions in the Bill for the addition of years to their service if their health has broken down in the service. In fact, I think nearly every possible contingency has been covered in the Bill.  I do not know if the Deputies who have moved this amendment intend to press it to its logical conclusion, but I may indicate right at the outset that I would have to oppose it.</P>

      <P>There are two men over there who have not as long experience of the Parliamentary Secretary as some of us.  We have been going along so nicely and I may say, so rapidly, that I would not like to see <Col N="1060" /> anything introduced that might endanger the harmony we have had this evening.  The Parliamentary Secretary is sufficiently long in this House to know that it is not so much what is said on one side as what it causes to be said on another side that creates the trouble here.  One would imagine from what the Parliamentary Secretary said that if this amendment were accepted every officer concerned would immediately on reaching the age of 50 years take advantage of this new section and retire.  He said that provision had been made whereby they could retire on the grounds of illness, broken health, and so on.  It is easy to understand certain circumstances that are not covered by anything in the Bill and which probably could not be covered by anything that could be put into the Bill.  It might not only be in the interest of the particular servant or officer that he should be permitted to retire at the age of 50 years, but it might also be in the interest of the institution and the inmates of the institution.  A person in one of these very onerous positions might have his nervous system in such a state that it might not be either to his own advantage or to the advantage of the inmates that he should be continued beyond 50 years of age if he had a right to retire and yet his condition might not be sufficiently obvious to permit him to retire under the section dealing with broken health.</P>
      <P>I think the principle in the amendment is a good one and should be welcomed particularly by the Parliamentary Secretary, with the greater knowledge that he must have of the exceptional strain that is put on persons employed in institutions and dealing with patients of the type with which they have to deal.</P>

      <P>I agree with much of what the Parliamentary Secretary said. Nevertheless, there exists a case for these people.  The man or woman who takes up this very heavy responsibility, does so as a vocation of a very high order.  They enter, we will assume, at the age of 21.  We all appreciate the difficulties connected with the environment in such institutions.  We can appreciate that after, say, 20 years, such persons may begin to lose health. They may not be exactly ill, but they may be in such a condition that they are no longer of benefit to their patients.  Their condition may be due to nerves and may not be covered by the section to which the Parliamentary Secretary has referred.</P>
      <P>It may mean, as the Parliamentary Secretary has said, an increase in the rates if these people are allowed to retire at the age of 50 years.  There are circumstances in which the ratepayers have to face an increase in rates.  They generally accept that if the reason for it is genuine and good.  The only time when people are opposed to an increase in the rates is when there is, perhaps, no sound reason for the increase or when they feel that there could be economy or that administration could be from a different angle.  I do not think there would be any objection to the increase which would result from providing for voluntary retirement at 50.  From information I have received from nurses in Castlebar County Hospital and from the local secretary of the union there, I understand that most of them are quite willing to continue until 60.  The officers who would desire to retire at 50 would be few and far between.  Therefore, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider this amendment.  I think it is reasonable and should be accepted.</P>

      <P>This amendment is a <Col N="1062" /> most important one.  These young men and young girls enter into the service of these institutions at an early age and, owing to the nature of the duties, nurses are exposed to injury and to disease and to a continual strain on mind and body.  For that reason I think 30 years' service is long enough and, when they go in at 19 or 20 years of age, they should be able to retire at 50.  I think that the amendment should be accepted in the interest of all those engaged in nursing in mental hospitals.</P>

      <P>In this Bill there is one thing which stands very much to the credit of the Parliamentary Secretary, and that is, as he stated in his introductory remarks, that he is applying a completely new modern outlook to the treatment of mental disease.  As he indicated that he was to a certain degree in sympathy with the amendment, I think he should also try to apply a modern outlook to the men and women who have to take care of these unfortunate persons and who have to carry out our ideas of treatment.  When we recollect that the age which it is suggested should remain in the Bill is the same retiral age as under the 1909 Act passed over 35 years ago, I think there is a point to be made that we should change our attitude and try to accept a more modern outlook.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing which has struck me about the work of nurses and attendants in mental hospitals is that I never met a layman yet who, when he came in contact with the conditions under which these people have to perform their duties, did not express amazement that any normal person would undertake such work, and that was without any detailed knowledge of the conditions of stress and strain that the attendants and nurses have to undergo.  I held the belief for some time, although I am told I am wrong, that the conditions do have a certain effect upon these men and women even in a mental way.  I am told that the figures do not bear that out.  From my own experience, however, I think it is undeniable that the long-service men and women in these institutions, while they may be quite as normal as I am&mdash;and I <Col N="1063" /> hope I am normal&mdash;do get into certain grooves of thought and, particularly, grooves of worry and strain.  It is amazing to find the petty questions which seem to agitate their minds and give rise to worries and perplexities.</P>
    <P>In this part of the Bill we have provision for retiral for different causes such as injury, illness contracted in the course of duties, etc. We have also provision for retiral by voluntary resignation under certain conditions, where they have got less than 20 years' service.  But, in the case of those going out with less than 20 years' service, we provide a much lower basis of superannuation than in the case of those going out on full pension.  Therefore, we automatically place a disability on any persons who feel that conditions have become such that they can no longer wait on to comply with the full requirements in regard to superannuation.</P>
    <P>The point has been made that this would mean an addition to the rates. Possibly we on these benches are not open to the same challenge as was levelled at those behind us.  But I think it is a good point to make that a complaint is never made by responsible citizens against an increase in rates where it brings benefits.  The ordinary layman, who has any knowledge of the conditions under which men and women work in mental hospitals&mdash;even the best conditions; and there is a great diversity of conditions in the different hospitals&mdash;feels that these people are performing a duty which is peculiar in itself and open to special consideration.  So far as female nurses are concerned, I understand that they are particularly anxious to have the amendment accepted so as to afford them the opportunity of retiring at an earlier age.  They feel that, in the case of women, special conditions and circumstances arise which make it more necessary in their case than in the case of men that this provision should be available to them.</P>
    <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary has indicated a certain sympathy in principle with the amendment, I believe <Col N="1064" /> that he should give further consideration to the possibility of accepting it. I am aware that he has also expressed a fear that it is not our task to provide such conditions as would be conducive to retiral at an early age; that we should give these persons fair and adequate superannuation and, so long as they are physically and mentally capable of performing their duties, we should expect them to carry on even beyond the minimum age set down in the Bill.  That is perhaps a proper feeling, because many of us realise that an early retiral age can be abused.  But, from my own experience, seeing the age at which men and women have gone out on retiral from the institutions around Dublin&mdash;one man I know is completing 44 years' service&mdash;the argument in the main is not against too early retiral, but rather a continuation in the service of men and women who, because they have got into a habit of life, are reluctant to break their association and to go out of the service.  They have become fixed in their habits, and to take upon themselves the initiative of making a break, even when they reach 40 years' service, is an act that they are not capable of.  They hang on until finally an official decision has to be made that they must go out.  While I think that that is the general tendency, there are other men and women who feel that they cannot, for certain personal reasons, continue to the full age limit of 55, which in the ordinary way would bring them into the definition clause of the Bill, and that they should be entitled to retire on equitable conditions in or about the age of 50.  I submit that as we are trying to adopt a more modern and enlightened outlook with regard to mental diseases we should not confine it to the unfortunate persons whose care we are dealing with, but also should have regard for the men and women who are giving a special type of service to the community in looking after these unfortunate men and women.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFrancisODonne" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite in agreement with the various sympathetic suggestions made by Deputies.  In County <Col N="1065" /> Tipperary we have a visiting committee which goes through the institution occasionally. I feel sometimes it is not a very pleasant task, but it is a matter of duty, and we go.  When I finish the visit, I feel very glad I am able to remain outside.  Sometimes there is very little difference between the people inside and those outside&mdash;perhaps only the walls.</P>
      <P>Those engaged in the medical profession have the duty of trying to prolong life and ease pain.  Doctors have that duty in a very high degree, and the nursing profession carries out the doctors' instructions.  Those engaged in the care of the mentally afflicted have a difficult task, and I do not know how the young men or women take it on at all.  There must be some great religious motives behind those people, and they must be imbued with the highest ideals.  I would recommend that to the consideration of the Parliamentary Secretary.  He should let them retire at 50 if they wish.  Deputy Larkin suggested that many of those attending on the mentally weak become slightly so themselves.  I would not be surprised at that.  They are the finest type of men and women I know, and I have met them.  It is a hard life, and nothing could be more beneficent than for us to place on our Statute Book a provision to give them the chance of retiring at 50 if they wish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary has no greater objection than he has stated, that it is likely to cause an increase in expenditure, though not of an alarming or serious nature, he should accept the amendment.  He says that 50 is a very young age to retire at, but he should also bear in mind that there is no other job in the country where the officers undertake such strenuous work.  The spirit of this amendment is more or less to give a loophole or a chance to those under the strain to retire.  In spite of Deputy Larkin's statement that the figures do not bear out this point of strain, I do not think I am wrong.  From what I have heard in my county, I would say they do certainly bear a strain, and indeed a nervous strain, much greater <Col N="1066" /> than those in any other type of work. The majority of those who retain their health right through will not take advantage of this provision, but will continue in enjoyment of their salary to the full term, that is, up to 60, if allowed.  The amendment is designed to give them a chance and not above out in the cold those who, through sheer bad health, acquired as a result of their service, seek superannuation.</P>

      <P>The only point to be dealt with, if it is necessary to reply at all, is the point made by Deputy Blowick.  He appears to be under the impression that people who have broken down in the service mentally or physically cannot retire on pension until 55.  That is wrong.  It is only the able-bodied who are in full enjoyment of physical and mental capacity who are asked to remain in the service until 55.  If they are physically or mentally unfit to remain in the service, not only can they retire but they get added years for pension purposes.</P>

      <P>I support most of what has been said on this amendment.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should examine the matter from the angle of the fundamental object of this measure, namely, better and more efficient treatment in mental hospitals.  We can all understand that members of staffs may desire the option of retiring at 50, and if that is denied to them it will not be a helpful element in the plan we are making for a better future for these afflicted people, and it is from that angle that the matter should be examined. I can see the Parliamentary Secretary's point of view, the fear of inciting a rush for early retirement.  I will say there is a desire in the service &mdash;not a wholesale desire&mdash;for a provision of this kind.  One Deputy mentioned the case of somebody who had 44 years' service.  From the point of view of the future welfare of the patients and the better running of the hospitals, there ought to be some optional provision to meet this request.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 73:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2) (a) (i), line 40, and in paragraph (a) (ii), line 43, to delete the words &ldquo;twenty-eightieths&rdquo; and &ldquo;two-eightieths&rdquo; respectively and substitute therefore the words &ldquo;twenty-sixtieths&rdquo; and &ldquo;two-sixtieths&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment was put down because <Col N="1069" /> we believe that under this Bill the mental hospital attendant or nurse would be worse off than under the 1909 Act, in so far as remuneration is concerned. If you take the pension that this measure will give on retiring from service, plus the lump sum that the officer will get after a little less than five years, the lump sum will be neutralised in so far as under the 1909 Act the mental hospital nurse was entitled to a pension of £40 per annum. According to this Bill a mental hospital attendant will get an allowance for life, the annual amount of which shall consist of twenty-eightieths of his yearly salary or wages.  On the basis of a salary of £100, that would represent a pension of £25.  Under the 1909 Act, the mental hospital attendant had a pension of £40, or twenty-fiftieths, so that he suffers an annual loss of £15.  If he dies within the first two or three years, he is, of course, better off, but if he lives to the age of 65, which I would not consider very old, having retired at 55 he suffers a loss of £15 per annum after the first five years and in the last five years, a loss of something like £8.  Five years after retirement, his pension is roughly £125, plus a lump sum of £66 13s. 4d. on the basis of a salary of £100, or £191 13s. 4d.  He has £125 pension from the local authority and £66 13s. 4d. lump sum under this measure, whereas, in the other case he would have benefited to the extent of £200, so that there is a net loss to the mental hospital attendant of £8 6s. 8d. for five years, followed by a continued loss of £15 per annum.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, in presenting the Bill to the House, told us that it would, when passed, be the most progressive piece of legislation in Europe, so far as mental hospitals and their patients are concerned.  I understood that when making that statement he had taken into consideration the attendants who would have to shoulder these responsibilities, but we now find that these attendants are to suffer a loss, if this amendment is not accepted. If the attendant dies&mdash;and that is a poor look-out&mdash;within five years, he will be better off, so that I think the mental attendant would far prefer the <Col N="1070" /> old to the new.  He has no lease of life, and no guarantee that he will die in two, three, or four years time, but he has a guarantee of being better off if he continues to live under the 1909 Act than under the 1945 Act, and the 1909 Act was a measure introduced by a foreign Administration.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Bill in general, I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider this amendment in the light of the arguments I have put forward, and to ask himself if it is fair, by introducing this measure, to deprive these people of a considerable sum so far as pensions are concerned.  A sum of £5 to a mental attendant on retirement is something to be concerned about.  It means something to him, and over a period of five years, it means a lot more.  The amendment is reasonable, and I think should be accepted, and I should like to hear what arguments the Parliamentary Secretary can put up against it.</P>

      <P>There are too many implications in it  It is not as simple as all that.  Deputy Cafferky has told the House that the officers and servants of mental hospital authorities were substantially better off in the matter of superannuation under the 1909 Act. The Deputy may not be aware of the fact but I have been in the closest consultation with the representatives of mental hospital attendants and nurses, both directly and through the Transport Workers' Union and to a lesser extent, through Deputy Larkin's union.  In those consultations, there was no division of opinion that I could find as to the merits of the superannuation proposals enshrined in the Bill and the merits of the 1909 Act</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>In principal and interest. Now, it is true that when we consider the new provisions, including a lump sum plus a lesser annual allowance, if you live to be 100 after you get that lump sum and annual allowance, unless you invest it to great advantage, you will probably lose.  It has already been stated in the House that it is unusual for attendants to retire until they reach the age of 60 years, notwithstanding the fact that the House was asked to reduce the retiring age to 50, so that if you happen to die within a reasonably short time after drawing your lump sum and superannuation allowance, well you have the lump sum.  At any rate, your dependents will have that consolation.  All these things have been weighed up very carefully by the attendants and their representatives.  They examined them very closely, and there was no doubt in their minds as to the desirability of substituting the code set out in this Bill for the superannuation conditions in the 1909 Act.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of this whole question which the House will have to direct itself to in order that it can see it in its proper setting.  If Deputy Cafferky can speak for the Farmers' Party: if, in fact, he is speaking for the Farmers' Party I welcome it, because I have certain proposals in mind in relation to mental hospital employees that will inflict a very heavy burden on the ratepayers.  I am looking forward to the support of Deputy Cafferky's Party on the local bodies when these proposals come before them.  I hope I will get it, though I have certain reasons to doubt whether I will or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies who are interested in this question know that, for upwards of 12 months, I have been in negotiation with Labour organisations representing the employees in mental hospitals throughout the State, and with the representatives of the employees themselves, on the matter of salary, emoluments and conditions of employment. Their real grievance has not been adverted to in this debate so far, that is that there is no uniformity in their terms and conditions of employment, <Col N="1072" /> and that men who are giving corresponding service in such places as Letterkenny, Monaghan, Enniscorthy and Ennis are not paid a corresponding rate of wage.  I am trying to remedy that, and to such extent as I succeed in remedying it, to such extent will it be reflected ultimately in the superannuation available to those people. I would like the House to realise, and particularly Deputy Cafferky and the members of his Party, that if and when the new proposals become fully operative, an additional charge on the rates of £80,000 per year will come into operation.  I am glad to have the support of the Farmers' Party here to-day, because I feel almost certain that, when these proposals go down to the mental hospital authorities throughout the provinces, the members of the Farmers' Party will get up and say: &ldquo;Oh, look at the increase in the rates; these men are well off; they are better off than we are, and we cannot afford it&rdquo;.  I may be wrong, but, as I said at the outset, I have reason to anticipate this type of difficulty.  In a local paper circulating in my own county, the Farmers' Party have already thrown the hat into the ring.</P>

      <P>Your Party.  I am not going to weary the House by reading the whole report, though I must say it is fairly entertaining.  But it would take too long to read.  I will read the part which concerns us here.  According to the report, the chairman proposed a resolution protesting against any attempt to increase the rates this year: &ldquo;Mr. P. Duffy seconded the motion, which was passed, requesting all farmers on the county council to support it.&rdquo;  In face of that, what <Col N="1073" /> am I going to do when I go to the County Council of Monaghan to ask them to give effect to this much more generous scale of salaries than that which is operating at the present time?  I am quite sincere in this, that I would like to see better conditions of service and uniformity of emoluments and salary, but we cannot bring that about if the representatives of the Farmers' Party, or of any other Party who advocate an increase in rates and taxes in this House for this or any other purpose, do not assist us down the country by bringing the same enlightened outlook to bear in the debates which take place on the local bodies.</P>
      <P>Take the example of the four mental hospitals which I mentioned&mdash; Letterkenny, Monaghan, Enniscorthy and Ennis.  What will be the actual effect of the new scale of salaries in their cases as compared with the present scale of salaries?  In the case of Letterkenny, a male attendant after 35 years' service will, under the new scheme, have drawn £721 more than he would draw under the existing scale. In Monaghan he will have drawn £640 more.  The attendants do not fare so well there.  In Enniscorthy, he will have drawn £1,088 under the new scale, after 35 years' service, more than he would draw under the present scale. That is the sum the attendant will have drawn in cash, leaving out altogether any question of emoluments.  In Ennis, he will have drawn £954 more.  These increases will be reflected not only in the rates of pay but in the superannuation when those attendants retire.</P>

      <P>Let us consider how it will affect their actual pension.  Let Deputy Larkin listen to me and let Deputy Cafferky listen to me because it is of the greatest importance that the facts I am reciting to the House should sink in, because I do believe that I will get co-operation and assistance from the Farmers' Party in this matter, and I am particularly anxious about it.  Taking the same mental hospitals again&mdash;Letterkenny, Monaghan, Enniscorthy and Ennis&mdash; we find that under the superannuation code set out in this Bill, and when the new uniform scale comes to operate, a male attendant will get an annual allowance of £97 10s., after 35 years' service, and a lump sum of £292, in Letterkenny.  The same male attendant to-day, under the 1909 superannuation code, and under the scheme of salaries and emoluments that is already operating, will get £80 per year and no lump sum.  Is that a generous improvement or is it not?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>If I get this new uniform scale adopted, with the assistance of the Farmers' Party, the annual allowance to a male attendant after 35 years' service would be £97 10s.  The lump sum would be £292 10s.  Let us forget about that and let us come to superannuation based on two-thirds of the annual value of his salary and emoluments under the 1909 Act, that Deputy Cafferky seems to think so much about.  How would these men fare to-day?  In Letterkenny they would get £80 a year and no lump sum.  In Monaghan, they would get £82 13s. 4d.; in Enniscorthy, £83 6s. 8d., and in Ennis, £100.  The figures are more striking in the case of the female attendants.  In Letterkenny, a female attendant would get £92 10s. pension per year, plus a lump sum of £277 10s. under the provisions of the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to explain to the House the effect that the new salary scale will have on superannuation, when the new superannuation code comes to operate and when the uniform scales of salary come to operate.  I can provide the uniform scales of salaries with Deputy Cafferky's and Deputy Blowick's assistance, when they rally their men throughout the country behind me. That is the trouble.  I would not emphasise this point at all were it not for the fact that I scent danger when I read that resolution of the Farmers' Party in County Monaghan.  A female attendant under the new scale within the new superannuation code would get £92 10s. and a lump sum of £277 10s.  To-day, under the 1909 Act, the same female attendant would get £69 4s. and no lump sum; the Monaghan lady would get £69 6s. 8d.; the Enniscorthy lady would get £75 6s. 8d., and the Ennis lady £83 6s. 8d.</P>
      <P>Deputies who are genuinely interested in this matter ought to direct their attention towards helping me to secure that uniformity of remuneration, that increase in the standard conditions of service, that will ultimately reflect itself in the superannuation code that we are providing here to-day, and they should drop all the nonsense here that cannot secure equitable treatment for all the people employed in the mental hospital service.</P>

One hopes that the Parliamentary Secretary will get that support for which he so eloquently pleaded from Deputy Cafferky and his colleagues.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would clear my rather befuddled mind a bit further.  He quoted a whole lot of figures and was very eloquent about this potential increase but, so far as I could follow the Parliamentary Secretary, <Col N="1076" /> he was relating the 1909 Act to the existing rates of pay and emoluments.</P>

      <P>It is rather amusing to listen to the Parliamentary Secretary. His reply to my point was based upon an assumption, assuming that he is going to get co-operation and that he is going to raise the yearly income or salary of the attendants upto a certain standard.  On that assumption, he began to give us figures.  He told us that in Letterkenny, if an attendant had 35 years' service, after the first 20 years and on to 35 years he or she benefits to the extent of £721.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>That on retirement, in addition to the £721, he or she received a pension of £97 10s., plus a lump sum of £292 10s.  I am not arguing as to what the Minister will do with regard to an increase in salary. My point is the relation between the <Col N="1078" /> 1909 Act and this Bill so far as superannuation is concerned.  The Minister cannot quote to me what will be the uniform scale of income for mental attendants.  He has not given that I have read the Bill and I cannot find what will be the annual salary of mental attendants after it becomes law.</P>

In five years, under the British Act, an attendant would get £400 and under the Irish Act £390.  There is a loss of £10.

      <P>I did not put down this amendment for the sake of talking. We have been approached, and I suppose other Deputies have been approached, by mental hospital attendants and by the local secretary of the union.  They went to a lot of trouble to point out their dissatisfaction and they have asked us as representatives to fight their case here.  That is what we are doing.  We are not trying to prevent this Bill passing or placing obstacles in the way of the Parliamentary Secretary.  We are trying to help him.  My contention is that, under the new Bill as it stands and comparing it with the 1909 Act, mental hospital <Col N="1079" /> attendants will be worse off so far as superannuation is concerned.  The Parliamentary Secretary has not proved anything to the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that we should try and discuss this whole series of amendments in broad outline, and approach them from the point of view put up by the Parliamentary Secretary in introducing the Bill; that we should try to appreciate what he has given us in the Bill as being, as he said, a new code of superannuation. I believe he is right when he says that that code as a code is appreciated by mental hospital attendants, and that they value it as against the code in the 1909 Act.  That code provides for an annual allowance and a lump sum.  When he was speaking on the Second Reading of the Bill, and explaining the new provisions, he dwelt at some length on the reasons why he thought it advisable that there should be a lump sum, and why there was, and had been for some years, a growing opinion in favour of granting to persons going out on superannuation a lump sum which would enable them to tide over the initial break after leaving the service until they had set themselves up in their new conditions. Everybody appreciated that approach to the question.  I do not think it would be fair to deny what the Parliamentary Secretary says: that, in respect of these principles, the code has got the support of the attendants.  But there are one or two questions which he has left unanswered.  He tells us that he is going to bring about an upward improvement and uniformity in regard to salaries and the general conditions governing the remuneration of those men and women in mental hospitals where conditions have been below what should be recognised as a fair standard. No one will quarrel with him in regard to that.  I hope also that he will get the support of the Farmers' Party. Possibly some of the outcry may come from the local members of his own Party.</P>

      <P>Surely the <Col N="1080" /> Parliamentary Secretary does not suggest that, if it is shown that on the basis of the details of the code of the present Bill there is a financial loss to the men and women going out under this Bill, that is justified by the fact that we are going to improve the conditions of other men and women which should have been improved many years ago.  He tells us that if a man goes out on pension at 60 or 65 and lives to 100, he will be a loser under the existing code.  I agree with him that a man will also have gained by the fact that he has received a lump sum.  But why quote such lengthy periods to sustain his argument?  Why not let us keep to a reasonable period?  The Parliamentary Secretary, I am sure, is in a position to tell us what is the average age at which mental nurses and attendants retire.</P>

      <P>This Bill is being introduced by the Minister to deal with the horse-breeding industry and the improvement of racing.  Does the Minister realise that the Bloodstock Association at the moment is composed of the wealthiest people in the country?  They are practically semi-millionaires.</P>
      <P>I would like to remind the Minister that the first intimation the general public got that a Bill was to be introduced to deal with racing was from a statement made at a dinner of the Bloodstock Association, by the Minister for Agriculture.  I would bring the Minister's memory back to a statement that was made by another Minister&mdash; whom I told I was going to mention the matter&mdash;Mr. P.J. Ruttledge, when he stated at that dinner that the Government had no intention of interfering with the racing or bloodstock industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Minister made that statement at this dinner, and it was followed up by the Minister for Agriculture at the last dinner, when we had the information that a Bill was to be introduced.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the whole matter.  Has he satisfied himself, in collaboration with the Minister for Agriculture, that there is any necessity for this Bill?  Has he put up arguments in this House to show that racing is on the decline, or that the horse-breeding industry is on the decline? Definitely he has not.  He should be well aware that the principal patrons of thoroughbred horse racing in this country are well-to-do people. Even if they control racing and have not improved the amenities of racecourses, I do not see why the Minister should introduce a Bill to extract from the racing public and the bookmaker money to improve racing and improve the amenities of racecourses.  There are members of the Irish Turf Club and of the Irish Steeplechase Committee who, as I and others connected with racing know, are suffering probably from senile decay.  If their methods are being taken, why should the Minister try to bolster up the members of the Irish Turf Club and Irish Steeplechase Committee in order to exterminate good Irish nationals? The Minister has produced no arguments here to show that the racing public want this Bill.  He has produced no argument that the racing executives want it.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to the Minister's statement on the Second Reading.  He mentioned the Racing Commission and the board but, in trying to steer this Bill through the Dáil, he very wisely refrained from telling the Dáil of the control that is to be given to the Turf Club and the Racing Board.  The Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Racing Board will have a measure of control over bookmakers carrying on business on racecourses, particularly having regard to the <Col N="1083" /> provisions in the Bill for the colleclection of a levy on course bets.  The statutory recognition thus given to the business of course-betting by the Bill can be regarded by the bookmakers as a welcome release from the danger that steps might be taken, as recommended by the Irish Racing Commission, to extinguish the business and to concentrate all course-betting on the totalisator.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, the Minister is putting it forward here that the Racing Commission recommended the extermination of bookmakers and that all betting should be on the Tote.</P>
    <P>Since I spoke on this Bill yesterday I had some phone calls from people. I think I referred to this Bill as poleaxing all bookmakers.  I have been kindly informed to-day that it is not, that it does not conform with the regulations of the State at the moment, that so far as the bookmakers are concerned it is not a pole-axe&mdash;it is a humane killer.  This humane killer will be used on bookmakers.  The Minister cannot satisfy me or the general public that this Bill is in the interests either of the betting public, the owners, or the executives of racecourses.</P>
    <P>I wonder has the Minister considered the various sections of the Bill from every aspect?  I suppose he believes that this Bill, as the title indicates, is for the improvement of horse breeding in this country.  As I said yesterday, he has produced no evidence that horse breeding is on the decline here. He has produced no evidence that horse racing is on the decline.  The Minister knows that the only way he can find out what public opinion may be is through representatives in the Dáil, let them be for the Government or against the Government. Another way in which you can sense public opinion is through the Press.  I read a statement in a newspaper recently on the subject of this Bill.  It referred to racing in Ireland being at its peak.  A paper was brought to my notice this morning in which the heading was: &ldquo;What will the backers get for £100,000 levy?&rdquo;  For the information of the Minister, I think it would be no harm if I read the article.</P>

      <P>I will not say that it is on a par with &ldquo;Truth in the News&rdquo;.  However, this is what the article says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The racing community is beginning to wake up to what may happen if the Racing Board Bill should go through in its original form.  Contemplation is far from pleasant.  To suggest that racecourses will be provided with amenities at present denied them is all very well, but the point is whether they are to be given value for the £100,000 which they are to be called upon to pay every year as a result of a 5 per cent. levy on all racecourse bets.  Such racecourse amenities as are visualised ought to have been provided long ago, and it has to be admitted that in this and other matters indicative of progress the governing bodies, meaning the Turf Club and the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee, have been sadly lacking.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These are the people who have given information to the Department that introduced this Bill.  A lot of gentlemen who, in my opinion, had no initiative, no interest in it, now want to fall back on the bookmakers to get the money to improve racing and to improve the amenities of racecourses.  It goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It may be that their persistent policy of refusing to move with the times has caused action to be taken in other quarters, and it would appear that it is intended that they shall be further relieved of the many responsibilities customarily associated with the government of racing and racing affairs.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be a very sad day for this country if the Government were to hand over control of racing to the gang <Col N="1085" /> of the Irish Turf Club and the Irish Steeplechase Committee.</P>
    <P>The Minister congratulated the Turf management on their contribution towards Irish racing, but he never mentioned the contribution by bookmakers over a big number of years towards Irish racing.  Under the restricted method of racing which permitted only 90 meetings last year, the bookmakers contributed £16,000 to the Irish Racing Executive.  I have had no indication from the Minister that the Racing Executive want this Bill.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Everybody interested in the welfare of the Irish Turf will agree that it is high time that something was done to conform with modern requirements. The question is whether the methods which it is proposed to employ to get that something done are the best that can be devised.  It will scarcely be denied that the measure is pro-tote in its conception and design.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that it is pro-tote.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This view is supported by the expressed intention of reducing the number of bookmakers who shall operate in opposition to the machine in future.  This enforced reduction of competition suggests that, under present arrangements, the tote is not preferred by the majority of backers. Since its inception, racegoers have had their free choice as between tote and bookmaker, and the amount of patronage accorded the tote is a mere fraction compared with that received by members of the ring. The tote, from their takings during 1944, were able to contribute more than £21,000 to racing.  What sum the bookmakers paid to executives in the form of badge money during the corresponding period has not been officially disclosed, but it is understood to be in the region of £15,000.  That makes quite a tidy total from betting, directly and indirectly. Apparently it is not regarded as being nearly enough, and, Oliver Twist-like, the powers are asking for more.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest that the bookmakers give a very tidy sum every year to Irish racing.  This Bill has been introduced, <Col N="1086" /> but I cannot understand why, because there is no necessity for it.  The Minister apparently has been in consultation with the Racing Commission and the Irish Turf Club and the Steeplechase Committee.  But the punters were never consulted, and the bookmakers' interests were never consulted.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Minister should withdraw this Bill, or, if he does not do so, he should at least modify certain sections in it.  I will deal with the sections which I think he should modify, if he will not agree to withdraw them. Why should this Irish Government try to penalise good Irishmen, good Irish nationals, who have given their best to this country?  There were more powerful weapons than .45.s during the fighting in this country.  There was the powerful weapon of finance, and bookmakers, apart from what some of them whom I know in the City of Dublin did, apart from the prominent part which they took as commandants and brigade officers, always contributed financially.</P>
    <P>Why should they be penalised for the sake of a body calling itself the Racing Commission, a body composed of a number of West Britons whose names are sufficient to stink in the nostrils of the Irish people?  Who are they?  They are a body of men suffering from senile decay&mdash;Mr. Justice Wylie, whose object is not to exterminate bookmakers directly but by means of the humane killer; Lord Adare, Captain de Burgh, Major Watt, the Due de Stacpoole, and Captain Gargan.  These are the people who have advised the Government in connection with this Bill, and who are to penalise Irish bookmakers and their assistants.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his opening statement said that one of the objects of the Bill was to reduce admission charges to race meetings.  There is a section in the Bill, Section 25, which sets out that the board may make regulations fixing the charges to be made by executives of authorised racecourses to any licensed bookmaker and his assistants, and that different charges may be made to authorised racecourses and in respect of different parts of the same authorised racecourse.  Then sub-section (3) says that sub-section <Col N="1087" /> (6) of Section 3 of the Totalisator Act, 1929, is hereby amended.  What is the meaning of that?  According to the Totalisator Act, bookmakers were required to pay only five times the admission charge to the public, and according to the great intentions of this Bill admission charges to the public are to be reduced.  The bookmaker at present pays five times the charge to the public&mdash;10s. or 15s., according to the meeting&mdash;but although admission charges are to be reduced, the Bill will see to it that they will not be reduced for the bookmaker.  If the Minister will give a guarantee that he will settle the admission charges for bookmakers, that section can be got over, but why is that section of the Totalisator Act being repealed? You do not want the bookmaker to get the advantage of the reduction to the public, and you want him to pay according to whatever position he occupies on the racecourse.  This is Mr. Justice Wylie's dream of goodwill. There is no goodwill in this.</P>
    <P>Another section, Section 6, says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In this section the word `Governor' means a person who is a member of one or other of the Governing Bodies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Who are the governing bodies?  They are the Irish Turf Club and the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee&mdash;a lot of people who have no interest in this country, the wealthiest people in this country.  I defy the Minister to prove to me that these gentlemen&mdash;Major Watt, Captain de Burgh and Lord Adare&mdash;are interested in the horse-breeding industry.  The majority of them are semi-millionaires like Captain Gargan, backed up by Mr. Justice Wylie.  The Bill makes provision for the setting up of a board which is to consist of 11 members. It also provides that six, a majority, shall be governors, who shall appoint their own chairman.  They can then put on whom they like and for these people it will be merely a matter of raising their hands.  They elect their own chairman and then can do what they like.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt as to who will be on it and I have no hesitation in saying to <Col N="1088" /> the Minister, even though he may resent my remarks about this gang, that they will take control of Irish racing and of the horse-breeding industry with the approval of the Government. They will have power over racing executives, over bookmakers and over punters.  In a word, they will have complete control and no reason has been given as to why they should get this power.  Nobody has said that the horse-breeding industry is on the decline, that racing has declined or that attendances at race meetings have declined.  Even under restricted transport conditions, every race meeting in Ireland during the past four years has shown an increased attendance and an increased volume of betting, even with the tote.  Neither the Minister nor his advisers can deny that during these four years, with restricted transport facilities, there have been increased attendances and an increased volume of betting, and then the Minister tells us that this Bill is introduced in the interests of horse breeding.</P>
    <P>The first speaker on the Opposition side, Deputy Hughes, welcomed the Bill and said that we all knew that the horse-breeding industry and Irish horses are in the top flight.  We all know that.  He then went on to speak about our getting sires over to this country and I reminded him, as I remind him again now, that the best chasers in this country to-day are those by My Prince, that three of the first four horses in the English Grand National at Aintree in one year were by My Prince, and that the stud fee for My Prince was £25.</P>
    <P>I will get away from steeplechasing and tell the House something about flat racing.  Blandford was the best sire that we had in this country.  The person who owned him was bitter against this country and the horse was removed from Cloghran, which is about 1½ miles from where I live. Blandford sired three or four Derby winners as well as the winners of the Eclipse Stakes, the St. Leger and The Guineas.  The sire of Blandford was Swinford, whose stud fee was 20 guineas.  I do not see why we should not have good sires here even though the fees are high, and why they should not be available for good brood mares <Col N="1089" /> at reasonable fees.  The Deputy was all wrong in talking about low-priced sires.  I understood the Minister to say that it was his intention to delete sub-section (6) of the Totalisator Act. He also said that this Bill would even reduce the price to bookmakers.  The Minister, in the course of his statement on the Bill, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Racing Board will have a measure of control over bookmakers carrying on business on racecourses, particularly having regard to the provisions in the Bill for the collection of a levy on course bets.  The statutory recognition thus given to the business of course betting by the Bill can be regarded by the bookmakers as a welcome release from the danger that steps might be taken, as recommended by the Irish Racing Commission, to extinguish the business and to concentrate all the course betting on the totalisator.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that if this Bill goes through Mr. Wylie's humane killer will come into operation.  The Minister also said, in the course of his statement when moving the Second Reading of the Bill:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It will also be recollected that in the Budget of 1941 it was proposed to reimpose the 2½ per cent. duty on course bets for Revenue purposes. Deputy Cosgrave opposed the proposal on the grounds that a relatively small number of people placed the bulk of the aggregate of course bets and that the tax was a serious imposition on these few, who are mainly breeders, trainers and owners.  Deputy Fogarty opposed the proposal, which, he said, was a burden that racing could ill afford.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister agreed then, and his predecessor, Mr. Blythe, agreed, that the bookmakers could not pay 2½ per cent. But now the Minister wants them to pay 5 per cent.  The Minister will tell us that this tax must be passed on to the racing public.  Can the Minister suggest how that is going to be done? Supposing the Minister gets £100,000, will the Racing Board stop at that? Did the Minister look at the sums that were derived from the 2½ per cent., and will he tell us what he is going to get from the Racing Board?  In regard <Col N="1090" /> to the Racing Board, the Minister is giving it power that, I think, is not in accordance with the Constitution.  It will have the power to appoint a number of officials.  These officials will have the power of excise officers. They can investigate bookmakers' books, call to their houses and carry out investigations there, and if the bookmakers do not submit to that they will be subject to certain penalties. The Minister knows that some bookmakers were sent to Mountjoy Jail in connection with the 2½ per cent. tax. I hope that the Minister will take a better interest in racing when he goes to the Phoenix Park.  He will then be able to see the racing from his residence. Suppose a bookmaker takes £1,000 on the day.  He has to pay a tax of £50, and he may have to pay £10 or £15 to his clerks.  That man loses on the day.  I am afraid you will have thievery of different kinds resorted to in order to evade payment of the tax.  The board is to appoint officials to enforce the payment of the 5 per cent. tax.  Will the Minister give an assurance that he will not agree to any tax being imposed on bookmakers?</P>

      <P>I suggest to the Minister that, between this and the Committee Stage, he should consult the bookmakers and the breeders as well as this body of senile decayed individuals. Why should the Racing Board be allowed to walk the Government into this&mdash;to introduce a Bill to exterminate bookmakers?  The bookmakers have contributed liberally to the racing executives.  In my opinion owners will back horses outside of this country in order to evade payment of the tax if some alteration is not made in the Bill.  Further, the Minister is giving the Racing Board power to issue course betting licences or permits. Why should they do that?  The Government issue licences to bookmakers. The bookmakers pay for the licences, and I understand that before a licence is issued there is a Gárda investigation and a report as to whether the person is a fit and suitable person to hold a licence.  Now, the Government is giving the Racing Board authority to allow them to bet or not.  In other words, if some bookmaker is not <i>persona grata</i> with the Racing Board, the Racing Board can say: &ldquo;We will not allow this fellow in to bet any more.&rdquo;  Because he is a stormy character, or, as the Deputy behind me says, because he may be a nationalist, they will not let him in.  They are being given power in this Bill to charge the bookmaker a different price for every racecourse and a different price for every place he stands up.  The Minister is giving Mr. Justice Wylie, and his henchmen, Major Watt, Captain de Burgh, the Duc de Stacpoole, power to do what they like.  He is giving them control of Irish racing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bloodstock breeders have an annual dinner.  I remember, on one occasion, the representative of the Government, Mr. Ruttledge, said that the Government did not want to interfere with Irish racing and had no intention of interfering with it.  Time marches on and the Minister for Agriculture attends the bloodstock breeders' dinner as Government representative and announces that they are going to improve the horse-breeding industry in this country and they are <Col N="1092" /> going to improve the racing industry in this country by imposing a tax on the bookmakers and that they are going to ask the bookmakers to pass that tax on to the general public.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Press reporters to the fact that I think they reported me wrongly when I replied to an interjection by Deputy Corish.  I said that the Minister was anxious to hear criticism of the Bill from both sides of the House.  I said that, as a member of the Party, my obligation was to vote for the Bill but that I was contributing to the debate in the hope that what I said might alter the views of the Minister and might help in dealing with some of the sections.  I was reported in the Press as saying that I would vote for the Bill.  I certainly will.  I must vote for the Bill, as a Party member, but I am giving my views to the Minister in the hope that he will consider them, before the next stage.  I should like him to meet the bookmakers and discuss the matter fully with them.  The bookmakers are good Irish nationalists and will give every help to this country.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether it is Wylie's goodwill or not, but I think the Minister should meet the bookmakers.  I should like to remind the Minister that he has not introduced one clause in the Bill to deal with persons employed in racing stables.  That matter was mentioned by Deputy Norton.  I know workers employed in racing stables, apprentices and stable-boys.  They are badly paid.  Why does not the Minister say that this board will investigate the conditions under which they exist? Why does not he see that trainers and owners controlling racing stables pay these people properly?  Why does not <Col N="1093" /> he give the board power to investigate the conditions of employment of these people?  Why does he not give the board power to investigate the charges that horse-owners have to pay for having their horses in these stables?  They have to pay ridiculous prices.  I am letting the Minister into a secret when I tell him that the unfortunate owner is always in the hands of the trainer.  If the Minister is going to control racing, he should look after the small fellow; he should look after the unfortunate man who is working in the stables from six in the morning and who is paid 3/- or 5/- a week, and who is sacked if he is seen talking to a bookmaker.  Will the Minister put a clause in the Bill governing the conditions of employees?</P>
      <P>I am interested in bookmakers.  I know them and I know that the bookmakers in this country have been generous to all charities.</P>

As far as the national movement was concerned, they have always contributed. I know a number of them in the city who are members of the Old I.R.A.; brigade officers and so forth. Even those who were not in the fighting line contributed financially.  I hope the Minister is not going to allow himself to be led away by Lord Adare, Major Watt, Captain de Burgh, the Duc de Stacpoole, Judge Wylie, and all those who would attempt to exterminate the good Irish nationalists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BridgetMRedmond" hpid="Mrs. Redmond Mrs. Redmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say at the outset that I am absolutely opposed to this Bill.  As one who is interested in the breeding and racing industry in this country, it may seem very strange for me to say that I am opposed to the Bill.  The title of the Bill sets out that its purpose is the improvement of the breeding and racing industry in Ireland. I believe that if this Bill goes through as it stands it will finish Irish racing and that will be a big loss to this country.  We all know from the <Col N="1094" /> Bill and from the Minister's statement that we are to have a 5 per cent. tax on bets.  We may call it a levy if we like, but the public who attend racing meetings will be called upon to pay, and they will regard it as a tax.  It means that they have to pay.  I should like to give the Minister full credit for believing what he says, namely, that he is out to improve the industry.  I believe he has been misinformed, and I do not mean that in any impertinent sense.  I further believe that this Bill has been drafted by people who really know very little about the true facts of the case, that they are not conversant with racing and that they have no knowledge of the small owner, the small trainer and the small breeder down the country.  It is for these people I speak.</P>
      <P>To come back to racing, we want to see these largely-attended meetings continued.  How are we to have them supported as they have been for the past few years by enormous crowds if we saddle the race-going public with this tax?  I believe that if this tax is really enforced, as the Minister says it must be, it will drive the public from the race meetings.  It will force them to another form of amusement or amusements, and there are many.  For instance, at present there is a very serious rival to Irish racing, namely, dog racing, an excellent support in itself. It is a cheap form of amusement and it is a direct rival to horse racing. You will find many of the racing public supporting dog racing and giving up horse racing when they feel that they cannot afford it.  It is nonsense to say that this tax will not have any bad effect on the public and that the public will still go to race meetings.  If a man goes to a racecourse and has, say, six bets and loses three and wins three, on the following Tuesday morning, if he is a credit better, or, if not, before he leaves the racecourse, he is presented with a bill for tax.  It is all the same to him whether it is a tax or a levy or whether he loses it at the races.  It simply means that he has to fork out a sum of money which he did not think he had lost.  It will have the effect of lessening the attendance at race meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1095" /> I should like to ask the Minister, although he says that he has not frequented race meetings very much, is there anything more depressing for one than to go to a race meeting and find that there are only a few people present? We have had that experience in days gone by.  I would much prefer at any time to go to a graveyard.  There is nothing more depressing than that, and it has the effect of keeping more people at home on the following day. Therefore, I really feel that this is a very serious matter for this country and that is why I have got up to speak, because I speak for the small owner and the small breeder and the public.  People say that the public will not be affected and that the Minister, in turn, is very concerned about the public.  That being so, would it not be possible for a representative of the public to be placed on this new board which the Minister proposes to set up? You can have breeders, you can have bookmakers, you can have owners, and you can have trainers, but if you have not the public, who are the backbone of racing, you have not the attendance at the race meetings; in other words, you have no race meeting.  Therefore, one would have imagined that there would have been a representative of the public on the board.</P>
    <P>Then we are forced to ask ourselves, who would be competent to speak for the racing public on any board?  The people who attend the southern meetings, for instance, are quite a different section of the community from those who attend race meetings in the Metropolitan area, as one can well understand.  In the southern area a person perhaps just goes to the races because his father owns a horse or because such-and-such a horse was bred in his particular district.  These people take such a pleasure in that and such pride out of it that they go to the races and pay the admission fee. We have, of course, a different section in the Metropolitan area.  Nevertheless, these people in the south like to try to win off the bookmaker if they can, but they have not the same outlook as the people in the Metropolitan area. Therefore, I say it would be impossible, <Col N="1096" /> even if there happened to be a representative of the public on the board, to have one competent to speak for the people in the southern area, because it would not be possible to find one with the local knowledge which is necessary.  For that reason I feel that there is more in this Bill than just meets the eye of the ordinary man in the street.</P>
    <P>We must remember that in addition to the horses we have had in this generation, there were horses such as Woodbrook and Jerry M.  No doubt, Deputies at one time or another have read or heard of the Wild Man from Borneo.  All these facts go to show that this is an industry which should be preserved, and that we should hesitate to do anything which might interfere with it in the slightest.  We have had these great pillars of the Turf&mdash; Birdcatcher, Barcaldine, bred in Co. Kildare, Ard Patrick, and others. Ard Patrick was a Derby winner, and was one of the old pillars of the Turf. For that reason, we have much to be proud of so far as our bloodstock is concerned, and in my opinion it is not necessary for us to be perturbed as to how we are to put the Irish horse on the market&mdash;whether he is a chaser or a flat-race champion.  We know very well that we have had them in the days gone by, that we have them now, and that we will always find an export market for Irish bloodstock.</P>
    <P>We want to remember these few facts before we come to the conclusion that the be-all and end-all of everything is in this Bill so far as horse racing or the breeding industry is concerned. We have, of course, heard much about what the Bill will do and what it proposes to do.  At the same time, people in the south&mdash;I have the honour to represent a sporting county, and it is for these people that I speak &mdash;are very concerned about this Bill and its implications, so far as they are concerned.  They want to know how they are going to benefit and who is to speak for them on the new board. They feel that their interests, perhaps, will be filched from them by this Bill, and that sooner or later they will be forced out of the industry in one way or another.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1097" /> It has been pointed out to me time and again by people who are supporters of the Bill that it will subsidise the breeder.  That may be an excellent thing.  But who is to determine who is a breeder?  Does it mean that a tax is being taken from the pockets of racegoers to subsidise everyone who breeds a thoroughbred horse?  Does it mean that the public are to be forced to contribute to people who, perhaps, never run a horse and rarely attend a meeting, and other people, perhaps, who have gained very considerably from the profits of a horse which they have been lucky enough to sell without having had to incur the expense of racing?</P>
    <P>Surely it is not the idea of the Government and of the advisers behind the Government to subsidise such people at the expense of racing?  I want to see every penny that comes in in this way, if this tax goes through, go back to racing and let the breeders stand on their own feet, just as other industries have to stand.  Let me not be misinterpreted as being against the principle.  I am not.  At the same time, I think it is quite unfair to subsidise the man who never races a horse here and who rarely attends a meeting and who does not contribute one penny; and then ask the people keeping up the racing to contribute towards his further profits.</P>
    <P>I now come to the question of private racecourses and the results which may occur to racing executives down South. It seems to me that in this Bill the board is getting too much power. First of all, there is no necessity for the Bill, because racing was never more prosperous in this country than it is now and it does not need the Bill in order to put the breeders on the market.  Secondly, the public are going to races without fear or interference from anybody.  We want to be left alone, so far as the small breeders and the racing community in the South are concerned.  We feel we do not know where it will end if this Bill goes through.  We have been quite satisfied with racing as it was carried out.</P>
    <P>I am against the setting up of the <Col N="1098" /> board as the Minister proposes to do it.  I can only see that the powers which will be given to this board are such as would be given to a dictator. It will be a monopoly all through for this new board, the members of which may know nothing whatever about racing; and in its efforts to help racing it may have the effect of killing it.  I am against monopolies or Government interference in private enterprise at all times and I can see nothing but monopoly in this Bill.  We give the Government credit for meaning to do the right thing, but meaning is not always sufficient.  We have had a very dreadful example of that, and of boards such as this, in the case of the Pigs Board.  We spoke against that board here&mdash;I did so myself&mdash;and we see how the board had the effect of killing that trade and industry, exterminating decent men who were earning their living from it.  I think there is a comparison between the two boards and, for that reason, I feel the Minister is taking on too much in giving these powers to this board.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the Turf Club.  So far as I can see, its powers are being taken away by this Bill.  If it is to have equal powers with this new board, why not let it select its own members?  Is it not the intention of the Minister to appoint them?  If there is to be equal status between the two boards, they should have the power to select their own members, but that is not so, according to the Bill.  As we are dealing with the Turf Club, I would like to pay tribute to those men who have acted as the stewards and the custodians of racing for many years.  I hold no brief for them, but I would like to give justice where it is due.  Charges have been levied against these men when they are not in a position to answer them.  As one who has some little connection with racing, I would say I have never heard it stated by anybody, in any section of the community, whether he was a southern racegoer or one from the metropolitan area, that these men made any difference whether you were from the North or the South, or whether of their opinion or not.  It is a very bad precedent to set up, now that we are starting out on a new campaign to <Col N="1099" /> make this sport popular, and to make it go well, to have this sort of business dragged into it.  I think these men stood high in the minds of the people; they were honourable men, and they acted as far as they could in the interests of racing and in so far as they know best how to do it.</P>
    <P>I mention that particular matter, because all of us here know that, in the racing world in the south of Ireland, we depend on the good-will of our neighbours for our export market.  It may do some harm if this sort of thing is to be talked about, and, in fact, discussed in our own Parliament.  I think it sounds badly and that it does not lead to good-will.  We want all the people, whether they come from the north, south, east or west of the globe &mdash;much less from a neighbouring country&mdash;we want them to take an interest in Irish racing.  Without that interest we would be finished.</P>
    <P>Another speaker last night made reference here to the various owners who may be considered lucky enough to have racing in this country.  I would invite the Minister, any day he cares to come down to the Curragh in Kildare, to see for himself the huge employment given by these people.  They spend their money freely, though many of them never or rarely win a race. I have in mind several establishments, where there are at least 70 stable-boys employed and paid at the top rate of wages, according to the union. These men and their families would not be at all grateful if they heard the criticism here of their employers.  They would find it difficult to get jobs to the number that would be thrown out of employment, if these people withdrew their support.</P>
    <P>People may smile and may think that is foolish, but where would we be if, after the war, we wanted to send over a horse to win a good race in England and if a bar happened to be put up there against us?  We would not just think we had done the right thing.  For that reason, we should welcome those who support Irish races <Col N="1100" /> with their entrance fees and pay wages to stable lads and, in turn, to the trainers.</P>
    <P>Then it was stated here that it was not the right thing, perhaps, for these people to be allowed to come down to the small country meetings.  I say those people have been misinformed.  I know the people in the southern areas and I can speak, particularly, for Tramore without fear of contradiction.  They are only dying for the day when the regional meeting ban will be taken off and when their races will be open to all horses.  At the moment, they are confined to the southern horses and that was so at the last August meeting.  As a result, the entries were very poor and the same horses had to come out for three or four races, just to keep the thing going.  If they could do as was done in previous years, if the horses from the Curragh and other places were there, they would have had much better racing and much better entries. We want to make it clear that, so far as these people are concerned, they welcome all who will attract one penny to racing.</P>
    <P>In regard to privately-owned racecourses, it could happen under this Bill that the board could take over any racecourse it pleased.  I do not think that is quite fair.  I have heard it stated that the executives just took the money and did not do very much. Well, let it be granted that that is the case.  Nevertheless, these people have given good service and I know, speaking for Tramore, that they would in no way like to be submerged in a Dublin board, which would know nothing of their wants and which would just give them any fixtures it thought fit.  The Dublin board would not be capable of pleasing the local opinion.  I think it is a great mistake to have this section here, and I would ask the Minister to do something to protect the private racecourse.  I know how much the races mean to Tramore, in particular. Racing week there is the week on which the residents depend.  The people who are in business there depend upon racing week to get their rates and rent and yearly expenses, and it is very necessary that we should take their interests into consideration.  The <Col N="1101" /> same thing applies to Listowel and to other small race meetings in the country.</P>
    <P>We were told quite a lot about the amenities that we will get under this Bill and how much asleep were the stewards of the Turf Club in not already providing them.  Several speakers have asked what exactly do we want.  So far as I know, the public have no desire for this Bill; all they want is good sport, good racing and the hope of securing a couple of winners.  I think that all those charges that have been hurled against the stewards are not quite justified and I would ask the Minister if he does not think that some of the comments made have been somewhat drastic&mdash;comments over their lack of initiative, if you like, and in relation to their sins of omission.  I and many others believe that they have given good service. I think that the board is being given powers of too wide a character over the old custodians of racing.</P>
    <P>There is one very serious aspect which I quite forgot to mention when I referred to this new board taking over from the stewards.  As we all know, the Turf Club in Ireland is affiliated with the Jockey Club in England and, through that organisation, with all other Turf Clubs throughout the world.  I take it that the Minister, before he introduced the Bill, ascertained whether this new body will be acceptable to the Turf Clubs throughout the world.  If not, then we can just, to put it in common language, throw our hats at it so far as improving the industry, here is concerned, because if we are not recognised we shall have no export market and we would not be allowed to export or run horses in any other country.  That is a very serious consideration and we would need to know exactly where we are stepping.</P>
    <P>It was pointed out to me that it was a rather extraordinary thing to have all these rosy promises held out to the people and that very often people may be inclined to believe them.  We would like to know that we are doing everything according to plan and that we are really not taking any false step in the dark.  We have heard a lot about <Col N="1102" /> the increases in stake moneys.  Already they have been increased somewhat. Then we heard that this will help to reduce the carriage on horses.  No doubt that would be splendid for the small owner and the small trainer, and these are the people that I want to help out if I can.  These people have been helped through the Turf Board.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us certain figures yesterday.  He said there was something like £500,000 collected and, after a deduction of something like £50,000, there was a sum of £21,000 given to racing.  We would need to be quite sure what will happen to the taxes that are to be collected.  We have had milk and honey promises with regard to what the tax will do.  We want to ensure that the people mainly concerned will be benefited in the way we are told they will be.  We were promised many things before, when the Tote was established, but things did not work out just as we expected.</P>
    <P>I will give the House some figures that may be of interest.  Before the setting up of the Tote, racecourse executives paid up to the extent of £5 for the carriage of a horse to or from a race-meeting.  You simply got your cheque to the extent of £5.  The Tote undertook to do this and it was stated that they would reduce the carriage on horses.  I have figures here which I can stand over, covering the charges to and from the Curragh races for two horses, and for the carriage of a horse to the Phoenix Park and Naas.  Formerly you were allowed £10, but now, according to the Tote cheque which has been sent to various trainers within the last few months, instead of £10 for two horses the sum of £3 6s. 1d. came back. In the case of the Phoenix Park, where formerly £5 was paid for the carriage of a horse, the cheque came back for £1 4s., and in the case of Naas, where the charge would formerly be £1 10s. 3d., the owner got a remittance for 8/3.</P>
    <P>We would need to be very sure that we are not being led away by false promises and that the racing community will not be just done brown by collecting their money and giving little in return.  Let us make sure that the money will be used for the purpose <Col N="1103" /> indicated rather than for the purpose of paying hordes of officials or equipping offices which are not, perhaps, quite necessary for racing. We want to be certain where the money is going.</P>
    <P>We have heard about the setting up of a national stud.  Surely it is not the intention of the Government to set up a national stud at the expense of racing?  No doubt it is a very laudable thing, but at the same time I do not think it would be quite fair to do it at the expense of racing.  I should like to hear some assurance from the Minister in that connection.</P>
    <P>We have also heard about the reduction in the admission fee for the general public.  The public will not be so foolish as to think that a reduction of 2/6 for entrance into the ring, or even a reduction of 5/-, will be of any use to them when, at the end of the day, they will be forced to meet an unknown quantity in the form of a 5 per cent. tax on any bets they may have made.  The public will not stand for that and they are not so asleep as to believe all they are told in that respect.</P>
    <P>According to Section 18, the accounts will be audited.  I should like to know from the Minister whether these accounts will be made public to Deputies and to the community generally.  The people should be quite at liberty to know how the money is being spent.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies spent quite a lot of time talking about a very important section of the community, namely, the bookmaker.  Many people have said to me that they have no time for bookmakers; they thought they were useless people and that, in fact, racing would go on far better without them. I disagree absolutely with that.  To my mind, the bookmakers are a very decent section of the community and a man is quite entitled to choose bookmaking just as he might choose any other career.  It ill behoves anybody to brand anyone a thief until he is proved a thief.  These are decent, honourable men, many of whom I have the honour to represent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1104" /> Under Section 22, a person has to be passed fit by the Government, has to pay a licence fee and then must come before the board where he may be rejected if he is not regarded as a fit person.  Who on the board or otherwise can count himself a fit person to decide whether a bookmaker is a proper person to be allowed to enter a racecourse or strike a bet?  I regard that as an interference with the rights of the ordinary citizen.  There are very few people to judge a bookmaker here or a bookmaker who attends the small southern meetings, and I regard the section as too wide, on the one hand, and too narrow, on the other.  The Minister will have to do something to ensure that these men are accorded the rights of the ordinary citizen to which they are quite entitled.</P>
    <P>They have contributed enough to racing and, in the last year, when only 90 meetings were held, they contributed £16,000.  Many people seem to think they are good enough for any number of thousands of pounds and that this is the first time they have been asked to contribute anything. That is all wrong when we know that they contributed £16,000, and I am quite sure that rather than have this tax imposed they would be quite prepared to make a further contribution in order to save racing and their way of making an honest living.  I feel it can be done if the matter is approached in the proper way.  I have no doubt the Minister can do it, and that he will be doing good for the industry if he consults them and tries to make a decent settlement on the lines of increasing the present admission fees and leaving the tax out of it.</P>
    <P>We know that the bookmaker is a decent man but we do not treat him as such.  We provide here that his private house may be searched if he has not got an S.P. office.  Many of them have not got S.P. offices and I regard a provision by which a man's private house, which may not contain anything pertaining to betting transactions, may be searched at any time by an official of the board as not being in line with the liberty about which we talk so glibly.  There is a flaw there, and I ask the Minister again to consider <Col N="1105" /> the viewpoints of the bookmaker and of the general public in regard to this matter.  They have as much right to their private documents as anybody else and they ought not to be penalised.  We know that they have contributed generously to racing and to charities, and for that reason we do not want to lose their support.</P>
    <P>There is at present a starting price tax on the non-supporters of racing, on the people who never contribute anything to racing and who never go to races, and if the Minister is genuinely anxious, as I believe he is, to help the industry, why not take that tax which has been collected and hand it over to the racing executives and let them use the money in the provision of amenities as the board thinks fit?  If the Government is genuinely anxious to help racing, that would be a way out of the difficulty and would save the imposition of this new tax on the racing public.</P>
    <P>We have been told that the bookmaker is not necessary to the life of Irish racing.  I have had some little experience of racing, and everyone of us who has ever been to a race meeting will understand how necessary the bookmaker is, so far as the small owner is concerned.  We do not want to see the bookmaker exterminated as he will be exterminated by this Bill. There is, first, a provision for grading bookmakers, and, of 50 who apply, only 25 may get licences, which, in time, can be taken from them and the number reduced to one.  If the Minister allows the number to remain even at 25, or whatever it may be, what about the other 25?  What about their wives and families?  What about the clerks, the runners and all the others attached to a bookmaker's establishment? They will be out of jobs and it is really up to us to see that that does not happen.  For that reason, I am opposed to the system of grading, which I think is all wrong.</P>
    <P>There is another way of exterminating the bookmaker, in addition to this 5 per cent. tax which will stop him from collecting money because the public will not be there.  It is that any sum of money can be charged to a <Col N="1106" /> bookmaker for an entrance fee and he can be put on the rails or at the lower end, according to the amount he pays. That operates against the less wealthy bookmaker and forces him out of the ring, because he cannot meet the charges imposed upon him.  It would be well if the Minister would give a figure so that bookmakers would have an idea how they stand and would know whether they would be in a position to carry on their business at all.  I believe the tax will kill it and I do not think that we need any better proof than the fact that the tax was imposed before and had to be withdrawn, not because it was a success but because it was a failure.  The racing public stopped going and no interest was taken in it and eventually the Minister&mdash;it was not this Minister who introduced it&mdash;I regret to say it came from this side&mdash;realised that it meant killing the goose that laid the golden egg, and the tax was withdrawn.  So far as collecting this tax is concerned, it simply means turning honest men into thieves.  The Minister ought to consider it very carefully, even with a committee of the House, to find out whether there is not something in the theory of those people who have spoken against it, that they are not merely opposing it for the purpose of being against the Government.</P>
    <P>With regard to the necessity for the bookmaker, so far as the small owner and trainer are concerned, take the man down in the South of Ireland who has a horse which he keeps for a year or two, and eventually produces on a racecourse.  He wants to have £10 or £20 on that horse, and naturally he is entitled to get the best price he can.  If the bookmaker is not there, he must go to the Tote with the general public, perhaps with a man who is going to have £10 on the horse who rarely, if ever, attends a meeting, and who has been at no expense and has no worry or trouble in getting the horse up to the mark.  The man who was never at a meeting before gets the same return for his money when the horse wins as the man who owns the horse, and who has to pay the piper if the horse does not win.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there must be bookmakers <Col N="1107" /> so that the small owner can get the best price, so that, in other words, he can reimburse himself for his large expenses of the year.  The bookmaker is necessary for the life of racing, for the life of the trainer, and incidentally for the life of the breeder, because we must remember when we talk about racing, that racing is only the shop window of the breeder.  If we remember that, we shall be doing a good day's work for racing and breeding.</P>
    <P>As a last appeal to the Minister in my effort to get him to withdraw the Bill, I would say that if he does not do this, he should consider taking a ballot of the racing public.  Why leave the fate of racing, the fate of the small breeder in the south, and the fate of the racecourse executives in the hands of a few people in Dublin, who perhaps, know very little about them, and who have not the same interest in them as the man who wants to make racing and the breeding industry pay?</P>
    <P>Why not take a ballot of steeple-chasing followers at Punchestown and of the flat racing followers at, say, the June meeting at the Curragh?  At both places you will get a crowd of people who, at least, have the knowledge that is required.  Even if my suggestion should turn out to be a failure, the Minister, if he tries it, can at least say that he consulted the people who keep racing going and from whom the proposed tax is to be collected.  If that is not done, then, I am afraid, racing will continue on the downward grade. In my opinion there is no necessity for this interference with racing.  As one who has had associations with racing for some years, and my family before me for over 50 years, I would ask the Minister to consider this matter very carefully.  I am sure he knows what a big industry racing in Ireland is, and what a big trade there is in the export of horses.  I think it would be a great injustice to hand over the industry to people who are not conversant with its various interests.  To do so may have the effect of exterminating the small breeder and the small owner in the South of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene merely to correct what, I think, seems to be a <Col N="1108" /> general misunderstanding in the House as to why this Bill came to be brought before it.  Deputy Fogarty referred to a statement that I made some years ago that there was no desire on the part of the Government then to interfere with horse racing.  My attitude is the same now as it was then So far as the present Government is concerned, there is no suggestion or intention of interfering with the control of horse racing.  Let us see what led to the introduction of this Bill. First of all, the governing bodies of racing got together and held a joint meeting.  They were concerned as to what the position, in regard to racing, would be when the war was over.  They decided to set up the committee which has been referred to in this debate in various ways.  It was referred to in a rather personal way and, in bad taste, I think, by Deputy Fogarty, but that is a matter for himself.  The committee was composed of men who had experience of racing and of the horse-breeding industry.  I think that one of the witnesses examined before the committee&mdash;there were several examined&mdash;was a constituent of Deputy Mrs. Redmond's.  The statement has been made from various sides of the House, and particularly by Deputy Fogarty, that the bookmakers were not consulted.  As a matter of fact, the bookmakers were called before the committee and gave evidence.  One member of the bookmaking fraternity advocated as his solution of the difficulty that no more bookmakers' licences should be issued in this country: in other words, that the bookmakers then in existence should be the only people allowed to hold licences, so that in the course of time the bookmakers would go.  One might call that a sort of slow death.  I think that is what Deputy Fogarty suggested might happen under the Bill.  That was the evidence the bookmakers gave before the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a meeting of the joint bodies called to hear the committee's report subsequent to that.  To some extent at any rate they were not satisfied with the report.  A large number of us were not satisfied with regard to the provisions relating to bookmakers.  As a <Col N="1109" /> result, a sub-committee was set up by the governing bodies under the chairmanship of Mr. B.T. O'Reilly.  I happened to be a member of the committee myself.  We had various interviews with representatives of the Tote and others.  At one stage it did not seem possible that during the emergency we would be able to get legislation through this House.  The Minister had, perhaps, more urgent matters on hands at the time, and the bringing forward of legislation did not seem possible then.  However, the possibility of doing so showed itself afterwards. The recommendations made by that committee&mdash;I think the Minister will bear me out in this&mdash;were the real foundations of this Bill, and I want to assure Deputies that no member of that committee wants to abolish the bookmakers.</P>

      <P>I am quite certain that if the Deputy were asked &ldquo;Will the 5 per cent. abolish them?&rdquo;  he would have to admit that it will not do anything of the kind.  The recommendations made by that committee are embodied in this Bill.  When the Government are accused of trying to get control of racing, we should remember that it is the governing bodies that have been urging all along to get legislation enacted on the lines of this Bill. They are the people who have the interests of racing at heart, and have responsibility for it here.  For a long time they have been urging that steps should be taken on the lines indicated in this Bill.  Deputies may say that there is no necessity for legislation.  It is true to say that at the present time we have a larger number of really high class horses in the country than we have had, I suppose, for generations, and certainly during any period that I can recollect.</P>

      <P>What the people who are concerned with the horse-breeding industry and racing generally are concerned about is that when the <Col N="1110" /> war is over, and our horses are free to run again at meetings in England, you may have those good class horses being sent out of the country to training establishments in England, because the stakes offered at English meetings are more attractive than they are here.  I am not going to mention the names of private individuals who are prominently identified with racing in this country, but if any member of the House doubts my statement on that, he can consult those people.  He will be told that when they are free to do so, they are going to remove their horses to England because the stakes here are not attractive enough.  Deputies should bear in mind that the object of the Bill is to try to maintain the industry in the prosperous condition in which it is at the present time.</P>

      <P>We were able to send our horses across to England before the war, but that is not the position now.  The Deputy knows that at the present time we have a number of people racing here who never raced their horses in Ireland before.  One of the main things, as I have said, is to try to make the stakes here more attractive, so that we may be able to keep our best horses until we are in a position to export them for sale.  This legislation in an effort to try to improve the horse-breeding industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to racecourses and racecourse amenities, none of us is living in the moon, and we know that in many instances those amenities are not by any means creditable, suitable or sufficient.  While the governing bodies of racing have certain powers they have not sufficient powers to compel racecourse executives to carry out the alterations and improvements that are necessary.  In any event, it may be that those executives are not in the financial position that would enable them to do so.  It is necessary that funds should be got together to try to do something in that direction. This is one of the few measures introduced by the Minister for Finance under which he is not collecting any <Col N="1111" /> money for Government services.  A pooling organisation will be set up under the Bill.  All the money collected will go into that pool, and ultimately will go back to the benefit of horse breeding and the improvement of the industry generally.</P>
    <P>It would be useful if a pool could be built up in this country to enable stakes to be increased.  The stakes are not sufficient at present to enable the ordinary man to carry on racing. People are being driven to back horses who cannot afford to back and that has resulted in many people losing heavily who cannot afford to lose.  For instance, in an ordinary race, where the stake is £200, the owner is lucky if he gets £144 out of it.  After that he has to pay the jockey and to tip the jockey; perhaps he has to give the trainer a tip, and so on.  There is not very much in it for the owner.  It is almost impossible for the ordinary man to carry on.  No ordinary man can make a living out of it.  He must rely on the possibility of getting an attractive price for his horse afterwards.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said about bookmakers.  I endorse what Deputy Fogarty has said, that the bookmakers contributed a good deal in the past towards the national movement, certainly financially.  I think we all know that a great number of them did. The position, however, is that the Tote contributes 10 per cent., and yet we find the Tote receipts increasing every other day.  It may be that there are more people racing; it may be that more people are betting on the Tote, but, at any rate, the receipts are increasing every week and the figures given in the newspapers are sometimes double the figures for the corresponding days in the previous year. The bookmakers in their betting shops pay 7½ per cent.  I do not think that that has had any bad effect on betting, so far as I know anything about it. One still sees around betting shops as many people as ever.  I know that in Dublin City the bookmakers have not been able to organise themselves in such a way that each bookmaker will charge the tax.  I know that one firm <Col N="1112" /> of bookmakers advertise that they pay the tax.  In regard to the section in the Bill dealing with the levy, the suggestion is made that the bookmakers will pay it.  That may be done in certain instances and I think it might have been possible for the Minister to include in that section a clause to the effect that it would be an offence for a bookmaker not to collect the levy from the punter.</P>
    <P>There is an alternative to that.  The bookmakers, that some Deputies have suggested are being thrown to the wolves, will have a representative on this board and the board will have power to issue or refuse licences.  I would strongly suggest to that board that if cases are reported of bookmakers who are not prepared to collect the tax and charge it to the punter, and to carry out the regulation legally and loyally, such bookmakers should not get a licence.  The board will have the power to enforce that regulation.  There is no use in saying that this is going to kill betting. Betting will not be killed in this country as long as horse racing goes on, as long as bookmakers are there.  I agreed that they add glamour to the meetings.</P>
    <P>Another matter mentioned during the debate is the conditions and wages of stable lads and apprentices.  I know more about apprentices than stable lads.  I understand that some stable lads are pretty well paid. We know that apprentices get only pocket money.  They go to these stables to learn their trade and perhaps they are not treated as well as they should be, but I am afraid it is not relevant to this Bill.  I do not see what can be done with regard to it under this Bill.</P>
    <P>All this talk about bookmakers being pole-axed is nonsense.  We know that nothing of the kind is going to happen. The bookmakers have the remedy in their own hands, to see that they collect this levy from the punter.  It is only a small amount.  The ceiling is 5 per cent. but the amount may be much less.  It is in their hands to see that it is collected and in that they will have the assistance, I am sure, of their representative on the board and of the board itself.</P>

      <P>I should like to support this Bill.  I think the success of the Bill depends a good deal on effective propaganda in its favour.  There has been a good deal of criticism and a good deal of misinformed objection to certain proposals in the Bill and, with one or two exceptions, the speeches have been destructive rather than constructive.  Deputy Ruttledge has put the whole position in a nutshell. He has given the reasons why the Bill has been introduced, and he has given the reasons which governed the members of the Turf Club and of the I.N.H.S.C., when they recommended certain proposals in their report. He said that a sub-committee of the Turf Club which was set up to consider the report disagreed with certain proposals, including the recommendation that no further licences should be issued to bookmakers.</P>
      <P>Racing at the moment is at a peak period in this country.  That is due to two reasons.  The first is that a number of people, particularly people who race, have more money to spend than they had previously.  The war has brought increased emoluments and more loose money to a number who hitherto were in comparatively poor circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Deputy admitting that there is prosperity in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>These people have benefited from the general increase in monetary circulation.  There is no guarantee whatever that that money will be available here when hostilities end.  The second reason is that a number of owners who formerly raced outside this country&mdash;most of them are not Irish people, although they maintain studs here&mdash;cannot race in England now because racing is on a very reduced scale there.  Therefore, they have to race here.  Whether people like it or not, these two factors have contributed almost entirely to the increased success and to the peak which racing is experiencing at the moment. That money has brought about an increase in the attendances and in betting both on the Tote and with bookmakers; there are better fields, a <Col N="1114" /> better class of horses and more competition and, as a result, a number of the stakes have been increased considerably.</P>
      <P>What will be the position when the war ends?  It is quite likely that a number of owners will race their horses elsewhere because the stakes will be bigger.  That is only natural as these people are not in the game as philanthropists.  Some are in it because it is their livelihood.  Others are in it as a hobby and because they are able to afford it and are willing to spend money on horse racing as other people would spend it on something else.  These people will race horses where the stakes are big and where they have a chance of some fairly large financial gain.  But this money which is floating around now will dry up and racing will revert to what it was pre-war.  People argue that racing was never better than it is at the moment and unjustifiably attack the report which was voluntarily undertaken by a number of members of the Turf Club who, whatever their faults may be, are in racing in order to help it and not to extinguish it.  They are in racing not because they are getting something out of it, but because they enjoy racing and believe that it is of assistance to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I deprecate strongly, as did Deputy Ruttledge the rather nasty personal references made to certain members of the Turf Club and I.N.H.S.C. A list of members of the Turf Club was read out yesterday by a Deputy which included a number of people whom he probably would have liked to exclude. Racing is not politics.  Whatever people's opinions or actions in politics may be, sport is another matter.  Whether the sport be racing, football, hurling, cricket or any other sport, people are interested in it in the same way as other people may be interested in art or anything else.  They enter into it for enjoyment or because it is their means of livelihood.  This committee made certain proposals, some of which are embodied in this Bill.  They produced their report in 1942 and they almost entirely repeated the recommendations of the horse-breeding commission set up by the <Col N="1115" /> Government in 1934, which reported in 1935, the chairman of which was Mr. Wylie, K.C.  That commission was appointed by the Government.  If a commission is set up by the Government, presided over by a distinguished legal person like Mr. Wylie and including a member of the Oireachtas, and it brings in a report almost identical with the report brought in voluntarily by the Turf Club and the I.N.H.S.C., its recommendations should be favourably considered.  The Minister in this Bill has adopted some of the recommendations made by that commission and, in doing that, we can assume that the Minister is endeavouring to do justice in this Bill to all the sections concerned. First of all, he has either the advantage or the disadvantage of not being connected with racing, and whatever money will be collected will not be for the benefit of the Exchequer but for the benefit of racing.  While it may be a disadvantage that the Minister has not some experience of racing, he at any rate has not the prejudices in the matter which some Deputies have shown signs of.</P>
    <P>In order to make racing a success certain things are essential.  One is that race meetings must be run properly and efficiently.  While the stewards of the Turf Club and the I.N.H.S.C. may not have been as go-ahead as one might like them to have been, they have, at any rate, conducted the sport cleanly and maintained a high standard of efficiency so far as the actual running of the races and the management of trainers and jockeys are concerned.  I quite agree that more initiative might have been shown in the way of providing better amenities and making small adjustments which would have been of considerable benefit, such as making the racecourses more easily accessible.  The entrances to some of the racecourses are very narrow, and when a large crowd attends, there is a great deal of congestion.</P>
    <P>These are very minor matters which should have been attended to by the racecourse executives.  In some cases they have shown a lamentable lack of foresight in not improving these things.  Having made that criticism, I <Col N="1116" /> should like to say that, until recently, a number of these racecourse executives made very little profit, and any profit they did make had to be put back into stakes or other essential outgoings.</P>
    <P>This Bill marks a departure in the control of racing in this country but it does not altogether abolish either the Turf Club or the I.N.H.S.C. as some people, who either did not read the Bill or were misinformed by their advisers, seem to think.  The Bill provides for the retention of six members of the existing governing bodies.  These six members may be all drawn from one governing body or from both but, at any rate, they will be people who are experienced in racing, so that the assertion that people will be placed on the board who have no interest in racing or no knowledge of it is wholly without foundation.  Then the Minister can add five other people who have functions connected with the management of racecourses, the ownership or breeding of bloodstock, bookmaking, or other like pursuits.  In adding these five members I assume the Minister will consider certain aspects of the situation.  He is bound to consider areas in the country which are not as close to Dublin as the Curragh and Naas and other places where large meetings are held.  He will also have to consider the small owners, many of whom are breeders and some of whom live in counties adjoining Dublin. They do not all live in the south or the west; they are scattered all over the country.  He will also have to consider the bookmakers.  I hope that in nominating a representative he will be able to get one who will speak for the bookmakers.  I am not so sure that he will; I imagine he will have some difficulty. I certainly hope that he will not select the bookmaker who has had a good deal to say on this Bill.</P>

      <P>I never expected anything else from the Deputy.  The funds which the board will receive may be used for a number of purposes which will be helpful and conducive to the improvement of racing and everything <Col N="1117" /> concerned with racing.  I think it is worthy of note that every newspaper and every sports editor who commented on this Bill has been favourably disposed to it.  They all consider that, with certain necessary adjustments, the Bill is timely.  In fact, if one can imagine post-war racing reverting to what racing was seven or eight or ten years ago, it is essential that it should be enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are seven sub-sections in Section 15, setting out the different purposes to which the money derived <Col N="1118" /> from the fund should be devoted. These include increasing stake money, promoting breeding, assisting small owners, assisting the carrying of horses to and from race meetings, and any other purposes approved by the Minister which will assist the export trade in horses.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
