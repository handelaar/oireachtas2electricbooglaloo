      <P>Córas Iompair Éireann found it necessary early this year to lift some of the track on the Woodenbridge-Shillelagh branch railway line, as they were unable to procure new rails for essential maintenance. This branch cannot be reopened until such time as new rails are available in sufficient supply to meet arrears of essential maintenance and to permit of the relaying of rails in the portion of this line from which they had to be removed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that three major schemes for relief of unemployment, representing an expenditure of £40,000, sponsored by the Dublin Corporation, are being held up for the reasons stated below: (a) Castlewood Avenue-Charleston Road; improvements are awaiting his recommendation on the findings of <Col N="1672" /> the public inquiry; (b) Orwell (Dodder) Bridge improvements; delay in acquisition, either compulsorily or by agreement of the lands required; (c) widening of Botanic Avenue and extension of Griffith Park; scheme awaits his certificate; and if he will state when replies to the corporation regarding the schemes outstanding will be forthcoming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>Proposals received from local authorities for the provision of employment are dealt with in my Department as expeditiously as possible.  As regards the works referred to the position is as follows: The Charleston Road&mdash;Castlewood Avenue scheme has presented some difficulty quite apart from the applications of interested parties to have the preliminary orders of the corporation annulled.  The scheme as outlined needs to be reviewed.  The general alignment of the road as proposed is open to objection from a traffic point of view.  The proposals have recently been referred back to the corporation for further consideration before a decision is given.  The adoption of a new alignment may involve fresh proceedings on the part of the corporation. Some of the plots proposed to be acquired under the original application may not be required, while it may be necessary to schedule other plots for acquisition.</P>
      <P>The Dodder Bridge scheme of the corporation has been approved and a grant of £6,175 allocated therefore.  The delay in proceeding with the scheme has been due entirely to the failure of the corporation to secure agreement with the owner of the lands to be acquired.  I understand, however, that an agreement has recently been reached between the parties and it is expected that the work on the scheme will shortly be put in hands.</P>
      <P>As regards the proposed widening of Botanic Avenue the last day for appeals by owners or occupiers for annulment of the preliminary order was the 26th ultimo.  There have been seven appeals.  These are under consideration and a decision will be announced without delay.</P>

      <P>On the 31st August, 1945, each public assistance authority was informed that a further release of vouchers would be made in the month of December which would probably be equal in extent to that made available in September last.  The number of vouchers authorised for release in the Dublin area in September was 22,100.

      <P>It is not proposed to make any change in the law governing the provision of allotments at nominal rents by local authorities.  The Allotments Act of 1934 was passed to enable allotments to be provided for unemployed persons at nominal rents and to be supplied with free seeds and manures.  Persons in receipt of old age pensions are in <Col N="1675" /> receipt of such allowances by reason of their age and cannot be regarded as being unemployed persons within the meaning of the Act of 1934.</P>

      <P>County committees of agriculture are authorised to allocate funds for the purchase of optical lanterns and other necessary equipment for use at winter agricultural classes and lectures conducted by their instructors in agriculture.  My Department for years has stressed the desirability of such lanterns being available for instructors as part of their equipment and many of the county committees of agriculture have procured such outfits for the purpose.  It must, however, be remembered that equipment of this nature has been almost unprocurable since 1939, and I understand that the supply position in this respect is still difficult.</P>

      <P>The reply to the first part of the Deputy's question is in the form of a tabular statement which will be circulated with the Official Report.  As regards the second part of the question, as indicated by my predecessor on the 28th June, 1944, in the debate on the Estimate for the Office of the Minister for Finance, it is not possible to consider the establishment of any particular class of civil servants in advance of the review of the question of the treatment of unestablished staff generally, which must await the completion of the actuarial investigation into Civil Service superannuation.  In the normal course, however, messengers are eligible for promotion to the established grades of paperkeeper, head messenger and attendant in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>Provision is made in the Defence Forces (Pensions) Scheme, as follows, for the widow and children of a deceased officer of the Forces who dies while serving:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  Where the service of the deceased officer is 12 years or more, pensions are payable to the widow and children at the rates laid down in the Table to Article 20, sub-article (1), of the scheme.</P>
      <P>2.  Where the service of the deceased officer is less than 12 years, a gratuity is payable to the widow or child or children, based on 30 days' pay for each year of service.</P>
      <P>The married officer's gratuity payable under Article 11 of the scheme to a married officer on his retirement from the Forces is not payable, however, to his widow or child or children, in the event of his death while serving.</P>
      <P>The question of amending the scheme so as to make this gratuity available for an officer's dependents in the event of his death while serving, is under consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he is aware of the insanitary and dilapidated condition of many small farmers' houses in the country and of the inability of the occupants to provide any of the money necessary to meet the cost of erection of new houses; and if, in view of this situation, he will sponsor a scheme whereby the Land Commission will erect new houses on such farms, the cost of erection to be recouped on the annuity basis, such annuity to be additional to the ordinary Land Commission rent in respect of the holding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take together the Deputy's two questions relative to housing operations by the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the Bomford Estate, the holdings were vested in the tenants on 22nd February, 1929, and it is not the practice of the Land Commission to make free grants for the erection of houses on vested holdings. Housing assistance is provided by the State under the provisions of the <Col N="1688" /> various Housing Acts administered by the Department of Local Government and Public Health and grants made under those Acts may be supplemented in suitable cases by advances sanctioned by the Land Commission and repayable with the borrowers' annuities.</P>
    <P>As regards the general question of housing, I am not prepared to sponsor such a scheme as the Deputy suggests. The proper function of the Land Commission is the carrying out of the process of land purchase and land settlement, not of general agricultural housing. Such building operations as the Land Commission undertake are incidental to land settlement and confined thereto.</P>

      <P>The holding referred to by the Deputy, containing 59 acres 2 roods 2 perches, now the subject of Folio No. 4048, County Dublin, formed part of the estate of Richard A. Warren, Record No. S. 7593, containing 313 acres in the townlands of Colmanstown, Athgoe and Bustyhill, which estate was acquired by the Land Commission on 2nd December, 1935, at a price of £5,450, from which a sum of £2,539 in 4 per cent.  Land Bonds, representing the redemption price (£2,506 2s. 9d. cash) of the land purchase annuity charged on the estate, was deducted.</P>
      <P>The holding was not purchased separately.  It was allotted to a migrant on 31st July, 1937.  In connection with its allotment, the Land Commission expended approximately £675 on the provision of buildings and other improvements.  Of this sum, £225 is repayable by the migrant.</P>
      <P>The lands on the estate were divided among 12 allottees on varying dates:&mdash; nine parcels were allotted on 19th December, 1935; one on 23rd January, 1936; three on 31st July, 1937; and one on 4th August, 1937.  One of the parcels allotted on 19th December, 1935, was surrendered by the allottee on 25th April, 1938, and was re-allotted to another allottee on the estate on 25th July, 1938.</P>
      <P>Three of the parcels have been vested in the allottees.  One of these (allotted to a migrant on 31st July, 1937) was vested on 13th June, 1941, at the request of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, to enable the corporation to enter as burden on the folio a charge in their favour transferred from the migrant's old holding.  Early vesting in this case was also necessary to enable the Land Commission to deal with matters arising out of the allotment of the old holding.  The second parcel (part of the purchase price of which was paid in cash) was vested in the allottee on 13/4/45, and the third (also allotted to a migrant on 31/7/37) was vested on 7/12/45.</P>

The Minister has given information and reasons why the first allottee was vested, which was on account of the interest of the Agricultural Credit Corporation; but in regard to the last allottee to which the Minister referred, will he say whether special facilities were given to this particular allottee so that he could cash in on an allotment of land given to him by the State, realising the sum of something like £3,000?

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1941 powers were given to local authorities to cut turf, to take over turbary from which turf could be cut, or purchase turf from private persons.  Through 1941, 1942, 1943 and 1944 a considerable amount of turf was cut in various counties. There were at least 14 county councils which, in 1944, had overdrafts running into tens of thousands of pounds.  In one district alone, in the North Riding of County Tipperary, the situation has now arisen where a number of persons have had their valuations increased as a result of the fact that they produced turf from their turbary in order to help the county councils and the people during the emergency.  Their valuations were increased without any notice being given to them, beyond the ordinary notice published by a local authority to the effect that new valuation lists were on view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1695" /> After the time had passed in which they could put in an appeal they found themselves &mdash; two or three years afterwards&mdash;charged with substantial increases in their rates and with their valuations very much raised.  That was because they had sold turf from their lands during the emergency. Some of these people now find themselves with increased valuations. Where the valuation was £20 before the emergency it has now been increased by another £20.  In other cases, where the valuation was £15, it has been increased by £25.  People find themselves brought before the District Court to answer a charge of non-payment of the increased rates.  They are asked to meet this charge at a time when the local authorities not only have ceased cutting turf&mdash;and no income is coming to those people in that way&mdash;but when in many cases the land from which the turf has been cut has been evacuated by the local authorities and left in such a way that the grazing that would normally take place cannot take place by reason of the large number of cuttings and dykes left there.</P>
    <P>These people were able, in other years, to put a substantial number of cattle on such land and get a fair income at £2 a head.  They are no longer able to put these cattle on the land because of the difficulties that have been created.  The whole position arose out of the emergency, under an Order issued by the Minister for Industry and Commerce or some other Minister, enabling turf to be provided for the people.  When these parties entered into an arrangement with the local authorities to sell them turf at a particular rate they never dreamt that in an Act of 1852 there was a clause which some county managers would rely on to recoup themselves for losses on the turf cutting, or that losses of that kind would be turned back on the small number of people who gave their lands and their services in order to provide fuel for the people.</P>
    <P>I asked to have this matter debated on the Adjournment the other night so that we might inform ourselves as to what is the Government's attitude. <Col N="1696" /> That attitude is that every Minister, from the Taoiseach to the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance, washed his hands of responsibility and, through the normal Standing Orders, I was not able to get the matter raised by way of question or on the Adjournment.  I submitted a motion in order to have a three-hour discussion on the subject, but the Government refused time for that.</P>
    <P>In North Tipperary there are cases coming into the District Court.  People are surprised and shocked that they have been caught in this way and, now that the fuel emergency is to some extent over, they feel the Government are treating them in a very shabby way.  They feel that they are being dealt with in a discriminating way, that action is being taken in certain counties which is not being taken in others.  If this action were being taken in all the counties in which turf had been cut, there would be a very serious agitation problem to be dealt with by the Government.  It has begun in North Tipperary, four years after turf was cut, and men are being asked to pay additional rates to-day because the local authority, in 1941 and 1942, paid them for turf which they agreed to allow the county council to cut on their lands.  These lands are worth less to-day than they were before turf was cut on them and it is the general approach of the Government to the matter which is shocking, which is appalling and which is disturbing the public mind.</P>
    <P>I ask that a Bill be passed which will secure that, during the period when turf was cut through local bodies or special agencies set up to deal with emergency circumstances, no man who gave his turbary will have his valuation raised by reason of his having done so.  The Act which I should like to see on the Statute Book is an Act amending the 1852 Act to this extent:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Nothing in Section 12 of the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1852, shall be deemed to authorise or ever to have authorised the Commissioner to increase the valuation of any land or turf bog or turf bank by reason of the fact that a rent or <Col N="1697" /> other valuable consideration was paid for turf cut, saved or withdrawn therefrom by or on behalf of a local authority or other authorised agency intended to provide full during the period of emergency contemplated by the Emergency Powers Act, 1939.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is all that is asked, and I would have expected that such a proposition could have been dealt with in a normal, orderly way in the House and that various people concerned with their constituents could either express their knowledge of what the facts were, or their opinions of what should be done; but here we have a situation in which the Government are attempting to cloak discussion, and I have these few minutes to indicate to the House the kind of matter that would have been discussed here if the Government had allowed this Bill to be printed and circulated.  They are refusing to do so and I think it is a disruptive and generally an appalling way to carry on the business of the House, and particularly business arising out of the emergency and out of people having given of their substance, having given the bogs which were there for themselves and their families for the relieving of the general fuel position of the country during the emergency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy has implied that this matter was not being dealt with in an orderly fashion.  The Standing Orders outline what is to be done on the introduction of a private Deputy's Bill, or even of a Government Bill.  Members have the right to object to it.  I object to the introduction of the Bill because there is no rhyme or reason in it.  Under the law as it stands, the ratepayers of County Tipperary or of any other county have the right to move, through their representatives and their officials, to get a bog, which had not been worked, revalued when it becomes a valuable property.  The people of Tipperary and other counties have paid very dearly during the emergency for these bogs. As Deputies are aware, turf bank prices had to be controlled, and Deputy Mulcahy's proposition is that <Col N="1698" /> the people, having paid dearly for the right to cut turf on land which up to then had been of no value to the owner, should again compensate him by shouldering the burden of rates which these individuals who own the bogs are liable under the law to shoulder.</P>
      <P>The law as it stands compels the Commissioner of Valuation, when requested to do so by the local authorities, to revalue rateable hereditaments.  His revaluation may show that the value has gone up or down.  In certain cases quite recently the commissioner was requested, according to law, by local authorities, who were not satisfied to see that those to whom the community had given, in some cases, very high bog rents, escaping their liability for rates, to go down and revalue these properties, and in the group of cases about which Deputy Mulcahy is becoming very violent, the owners concerned were drawing a couple of thousand pounds annually in rents, while the additional rates they would have to pay were a little over £100. We are entitled to see that these people who have been drawing such sums should bear their equitable portion of the rates, and if Deputy Mulcahy complains of the overdrafts of the county councils surely the county councils are entitled to see that these people help the ratepayers of the county to meet their overdrafts and their annual charges.</P>
      <P>There is no rhyme or reason in this Bill.  If there were, it would be a matter which could be debated at length, but I do not know why Deputy Mulcahy has taken up the case at all. I do not think any Deputy could object to the reasonable provisions in the Valuation Act which allow turf to be used in the normal way by a man for his own benefit without any rateable valuation being put on it; but when he starts to charge his neighbours for turf banks, he should pay according to the rents he charges&mdash;and a very small proportion of the rents he charges, as indicated by the fact that this group, which gets over a couple of thousand pounds in rents, have to pay only a very small amount.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time. The main purpose of this Bill is to make further and better provision in relation to the health of the people.  It is now evident that a need exists to advance public health at a rate in keeping with the general advance in the social and economic life of the people of this country, and by adequate safeguards to forestall or prevent dangers to health which would certainly arise if proper protection were not afforded.  Good health means much more than mere freedom from disease; therefore, it is necessary to approach the question of health in a positive manner, and to take measures not only to improve the general wellbeing of the people but also their power of resistance to disease.  The means are at hand, being principally the application of the scientific knowledge of nutrition, and of the inculcation of habits and practices which make for satisfactory hygienic conditions, improved physical development, and an equable balance between the spiritual and material aspects of life.</P>
      <P>The existing public health legislation contains little provision for positive effort towards health as distinct from preventive measures.  The only laws bearing on the subject are those relating to maternity and child welfare, school meals, and medical inspection of school children.  The supply of free milk and footwear for necessitous children also represents a considerable advance in the same direction.  A definite effort towards improving the general health of the nation is now due, and this Bill contains provisions framed for that purpose. The advance in medical knowledge, especially as regards the modes of transmission of infectious diseases, has brought with it a fuller realisation of the importance to the community of a healthy and cleanly condition in each of its members.  It is, therefore, in the best interests of public health that we should insist on the provision of the sanitary facilities which are likely to improve health or prevent infection, and make it as easy as possible for individuals to use these facilities. Even when this has been done, there will still be recalcitrant persons who will refuse to avail of the facilities provided, and in the interests of the general community some measure of compulsion must be made available for dealing with such cases.  There is nothing new in giving compulsory powers for such control of infectious diseases as may be necessary to safeguard human life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most interesting features of Irish history during the past hundred years has been the organisation of local government administration. If we trace its development back to the grand jury days, when in each county local government was administered <Col N="1703" /> by the gentlemen of the grand jury, we find that public health measures in their day were very primitive.  In 1838 owing to the appalling social conditions of that period the poor law system was introduced, and its administration was entrusted to boards of guardians, partly elective and partly ex-officio, under the supervision of the central authority.  In the succeeding 40 years, that is, up to 1878, very little was done for the improvement of the public health.  Such laws as were passed affecting local government were entrusted to either the grand jury or the boards of guardians.  Except in the larger cities and towns which were governed by corporations or town commissioners, the boards of guardians were the health authority.  They were entrusted with the making of sewers, the provision of burial grounds, the construction of waterworks, the provision of dwellings for labourers, and the administration of the laws relating to the sanitation of dwellings, and abatement of nuisances.  The Public Health Act of 1878 gave very extended powers for the control of infectious diseases, the improvement of public health and the installation of more modern systems of sanitation.  The larger towns became urban sanitary districts and public health functions in those areas were exercised by the urban authority, but otherwise the boards of guardians remained the sanitary authority until 1898 when their functions as such became vested in rural district councils.</P>
    <P>The county councils which were established in 1898 were given all the fiscal powers of the Grand Jury in relation to matters affecting local government, but these did not include any control of public health.  It was not until 1908, when the Tuberculosis (Prevention) Ireland Act was passed, that county councils became vested with public health functions.  They were then made responsible for the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis. These powers were extended in 1917 in connection with the arrangements for the treatment of venereal disease, and in <Col N="1704" /> 1919 they were made responsible for the establishment in their areas of schemes for the medical treatment of school children.</P>
    <P>At the date of the foundation of this State we had rural district councils and county councils influencing and controlling different aspects of public health or preventive medicine in rural areas, and urban sanitary authorities in urban areas.</P>
    <P>The system of administration was unwieldy, uncoordinated and largely inefficient.  In 1925 public health administration in the rural areas was placed under boards of health and public assistance, and on the introduction of county management in 1940 their functions as rural sanitary authorities vested in the county councils. Their public assistance functions outside the City and County of Dublin also vested in the county councils, except in joint public assistance districts where the administration of public assistance has been entrusted to joint boards of public assistance. Sanitary functions relating to certain infectious diseases in urban areas other than county boroughs were exercisable by the urban authorities. The position in that respect would be improved by entrusting the responsibility for the control of infectious diseases in the entire county to a single authority, and hence the Bill provides that the full powers shall be exercisable by the county council.</P>
    <P>Our present system of county health administration came into being in the year 1925.  The Local Government Act of that year empowered county councils to appoint county medical officers of health.  It took considerable time to get the new organisation working, but for several years past we have had in every county an organised public health unit directed by a whole-time medical officer.  We may congratulate ourselves on possessing this organisation, as few countries are so well equipped to deal with dangers to public health.  It is the duty of the county medical officer of health to advise the local authority on all matters affecting the health of the district.  He is responsible for the control of infectious diseases and for <Col N="1705" /> keeping the local authority informed as to conditions injurious to health in their area, or to any influences affecting or threatening to affect public health in their area.  He must exercise general supervision of the veterinary and sanitary staffs of the local authority as regards inspections of slaughterhouses, dairies, cowsheds and other premises in his area where food is prepared, stored or otherwise dealt with.  He has also various duties, mostly of a supervisory nature, in relation to the special health services administered by the local authority. We have, therefore, in being a great health machine, and it only remains for us to perfect it still further to ensure that the best results possible can be obtained.</P>
    <P>A contrast of the public health position which existed half a century ago with the organisation of trained, skilled, well-equipped personnel which is now available, shows how great is the advance that has been achieved.  A few examples illustrative of the improvements brought about by the public health services may be of interest at this stage.  In the year 1881, 1,406 cases of typhus occurred in the City of Cork.  This number was only an indication of the situation throughout the country.  Within recent years, apart from a few endemic areas in one or two counties, the disease has become almost non-existent in this country, and with the further steps which are about to be taken, I can assure the House that before long it will have completely vanished.  How great were the epidemics of typhus in by-gone years can be seen when I say that in the epidemic of 1815-1817, in Dublin alone over 70,000 cases occurred, and the total number of deaths for the entire country was estimated at 44,000. For a great number of years we have not had a case of smallpox in this country, so that it is now possible to abandon compulsory vaccination, the measure mainly responsible for banishing this disease from our midst. Amongst the recent triumphs of preventive medicine must also be included the progressive and gradual decline of typhoid or enteric fever.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1706" /> As I have explained to the House, public health has now reached a point when something more than the mere eradication of infectious disease is necessary.  A point has been reached when it has become essential to pursue disease, and I am confident that the public health authorities and their staffs will welcome the additional powers for that purpose which the Bill contains.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the various matters of detail I would like to direct special attention to what is probably the most important feature of the Bill, and that is the advance which will follow the implementation of the powers asked for in Sections 85, 86 and 87.  I have noted with some amusement the efforts of various Press commentators on this Bill.  While they considered at length what were relatively minor provisions, the major purpose and intention, in fact, what might be described as the real basis of the measure, was completely overlooked. The three sections mentioned contain the necessary legal provision for the new maternity and child health services which it is proposed to establish in this country.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, we already have facilities for maternity and child welfare, and a school medical service. The maternity and child welfare schemes, which are administered by sanitary authorities, have been shown by experience to have many defects. The assistance given is limited almost completely to medical advice and where necessary, the supply of free food supplements.  There is not sufficient continuity between the examination of the mother before the birth of her child, attendance at the birth and the care of the mother and child after the birth.  Again, a serious defect is that the service is not sufficiently backed up by facilities for treatment; nor is there provision for follow up to ensure that, in fact, every mother and child receives the necessary treatment, and finally there is the defect that the scheme only applies to children up to five years of age.</P>
    <P>The school medical service also cannot be regarded as satisfactory. Recent developments in the organisation <Col N="1707" /> of school medical work show clearly that two main types of service are necessary, one a simple inspection and treatment service, the other a more specialised inspection related to such aspects as nutrition, child-guidance, and other specialities.  We have not been able to provide fully for either the one or the other.  The facilities for treatment in most of our school medical services are inadequate. Again, examinations are not carried out often enough, and there is lack of continuity between the maternity and child welfare service and the school medical service.</P>
    <P>A further important consideration in relation to the school medical service is the inability of officers to carry out what may be described as a complete examination of the children of school-going age.  By complete I do not mean clinically complete, but rather complete in the sense that each child receives an examination regularly as part of a regular and complete schedule.  This is not altogether due to an insufficient staff, but can be attributed in part to the fact that careless parents warned in advance of the day of examination, not only refuse to allow their children to be examined, but wilfully withhold them from attending school on the day on which the officers attend. If I felt assured that this refusal to allow children to be medically examined was due to any conscientious motive, or a desire to protect the individual liberty of the subject against what was looked upon as an unwarrantable encroachment, I would insist that all deference should be paid to such an ideal and direct the officers of the service to respect such a wish. Or, if I felt that, in fact, the examinations carried out by the medical officers of the local authorities were unnecessary because the parents of those children who did not attend, or who refused examination, had provided alternative medical attention, again I would respect their motives. But when I realise that from one end of Ireland to the other, always and everywhere, when an opportunity for an examination of children is refused, it is precisely the class or group or <Col N="1708" /> individual, whose children most need it, who refuse it.  Theoretical arguments against compulsory examination do not carry much weight when considered in the light of realities.  If there are verminous children in the school, it is those children whose parents will not permit them to be examined lest the condition should become known.  If there are malnourished children in the school, or children with skin infections, it is again precisely those children who will not be submitted for examination, and I ask, are we to subject the clean, healthy child to the constant risk and danger of disease because of the carelessness and prejudices of the inconsiderate few?</P>
    <P>The responsibility for the health, care and welfare, of the children of this country is a big responsibility&mdash;a much greater charge than most Deputies realise.  It is a responsibility which concerns not only the life, health and happiness of the present generation of children, but it concerns the future of our race.</P>
    <P>I am not submitting these proposals in the spirit of an impetuous reformer, striving by laws, regulations, or orders, to dragoon people into some foolish scheme conceived as a passing whim.  I am simply appealing to the ordinary common sense of the members of this House, appealing on what are sound principles of public health and sociology, for the opportunity to promote the better lives and happiness of expectant and nursing mothers and children up to the age of 16 years.</P>
    <P>The problem of child and maternal health has been studied in this country. Not only has it been studied in relation to what has been done elsewhere, but it has been studied specifically in relation to our own conditions.  It has been studied, not as a text book exercise, but through research, inquiry and the experience of those in closest touch with the problem. Having given close attention and earnest thought to the matter, I have now decided to co-ordinate the maternity and child welfare schemes into a unified free service, which will give continuous care to the mother and <Col N="1709" /> child during the ante-natal period, during birth, and until the child reaches the age of 16 years.  The powers to establish this service are contained in Sections 85, 86 and 87 of the Bill, and of the 113 sections in the Bill I regard these three as being by far the most important.</P>
    <P>The service will be based upon the family doctor.  Its background will be one of prevention.  Briefly, it is proposed to develop a free ante-natal and maternity service for every woman who desires to avail of it.  The service throughout the provinces will be provided through the district medical officer, and will be organised on a county basis.  It will have no relation to or any connection with the public assistance organisation.  The doctor will be assisted by a midwife who will receive a salary and will give her services free.  Ultimately, an obstetrical consultant service will be made available, not only to advise ante-natally in those cases liable to give trouble, but to assist in a specialised manner in the care of cases which require a consultant.</P>
    <P>A free service, on the same basis as that given to the mother, will be provided for each child from birth until it reaches the age of 16 years.  During infancy a special system of visitation will be carried out by the district midwives under the supervision of the doctor, and regular help will be given to mothers by advice, weighing of infants, and encouragement to breast feed.  Experience has shown that the majority of deformities, defects, and disabilities occurring in childhood are in existence before the child reaches the age of 5 years.  Unfortunately, it has been during this age that children receive least attention, and it is precisely to this age group that I intend this service to devote special attention. Therefore, for children of this age arrangements will be made for regular domiciliary inspection and treatment of defects by the district medical officers, and, not only will treatment of defects by the district medical officers, and, not only will specialised care they will have the assistance of both the public health officers, and of ophthalmologists, <Col N="1710" /> orthopaedists, and other medical specialists.  Children will also be subject to regular examination, as school children, by the district medical officer, who will treat free of charge any defects or illness he may find.  Again the district medical officer will have the backing of consultants of various kinds for those conditions for which specialised treatment is required.</P>
    <P>Recent development in school medical work has seen the institution of care of a different type.  This is based upon the newer knowledge of nutrition, of psychiatry, and of developments in physical culture.  This aspect of school work will be the charge of the whole-time officers of the local authority who at present carry out school medical inspection work.</P>
    <P>For the fuller operation of the service it is also proposed to have a fully trained whole-time nurse appointed in each district throughout the State.  The value of such assistance will be at once appreciated when it is realised that, in addition to general nursing duties in relation to school children, she will also carry out follow-up work in those cases who will be discovered to have disease, or who are receiving treatment as a result of school inspection.  She will also play a large part in the education of children in the school in a healthy way of life, good habits, and cleanliness, and she will impart an elementary knowledge of nutrition and food values.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the subject of the mother and her child, let me say a few words on the subject of infant mortality.  We in Ireland have rather an indifferent reputation as compared with other countries in this respect, yet it is not fully deserved, and is due to circumstances which have been hitherto beyond our control but which are rapidly ameliorating.  Our infant mortality rate for 1944 was 79.  This is too high.  It could be brought down to a much lower figure.  By infant mortality I mean the number of deaths occurring each year per thousand live births.  When it is realised that each year hundreds of children all over the country die from what are clearly preventable causes, it should be at once apparent to the House that every <Col N="1711" /> assistance must be granted to enable us to remedy the position.  I have said that our infant mortality figures, which have averaged 72 for the ten years 1935 to 1944, do not truly reflect the position, and would indicate that throughout Ireland infants die at an excessive rate.  I wish to make it very clear that that is not the position. While we have black spots which are largely responsible for maintaining a high average rate of infant mortality, the fact is worth nothing that for the last ten years the average infant mortality rate for County Mayo has been 43; for County Monaghan 47; and for County Leitrim 47; figures which, under the circumstances, are comparable with those in any other country, and no one will say that these are the richest counties in Ireland.  On the other hand, Dublin County Borough has had a ten years' average of 104, Waterford 95, Cork 89 and Limerick 83.  This matter is being given considerable study and in Dublin at present, efforts to reorganise the care of infants are being made, but no amount of theorising, of discussing the why and wherefore will fill the empty cots and cradles in the hundreds of homes where babies have died.  We must regroup our forces, take additional powers, spend more money, and by hard work and attention to every minute detail, and by aiming at the highest standards, continue the fight until success is achieved.</P>
    <P>I will now review the several parts of the Bill.  Part II defines the general duty of the Minister in regard to public health and provides for the establishment of consultative councils to give to the Minister advice and assistance in connection with matters affecting or incidental to the health of the people.</P>
    <P>Part III deals with the provision of institutions by health authorities. Since the passing of the Act of 1878, every sanitary authority had power to provide for the use of the inhabitants of their district, hospitals or temporary places for the reception of the sick or convalescent, and to charge for the maintenance of patients admitted to these hospitals or places. The power so granted was not used except to a very limited extent, and <Col N="1712" /> the general hospital system of the country became dependent on the development of poor law and voluntary institutions.  Even when county boards of health replaced rural district councils in pursuance of the Local Government Act of 1925, these larger bodies with increased financial resources did not undertake the work of supplementing the existing hospital accommodation.  The provisions of Part III of the Bill are designed to coordinate the powers of local authorities in regard to the provision of institutions under the Public Health Acts. It must be our aim to bring the public hospitals, and the fever hospitals maintained by the public assistance authority, more into line with public health administration, and the time has come when the principal sanitary authorities should be prepared to meet their obligations in this respect.  The term &ldquo;institution&rdquo;, for the purpose of the Bill means a hospital, sanatorium, maternity home, convalescent home, preventorium, clinic, health centre, first-aid station, dispensary or any similar institution, while the term &ldquo;health authority&rdquo; includes county authorities and sanitary authorities.</P>
    <P>Part IV deals with infectious disease.  Under the existing law, sanitary authorities are charged with the administration of provisions for the prevention and control of all infectious diseases except tuberculosis and venereal disease, which are dealt with by the county authorities.  It is now proposed that all infectious diseases are to be dealt with by county authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister is empowered to declare by Order that a disease is infectious. It is intended to utilise this power so as to bring tuberculosis and venereal disease into the category of infectious diseases and by that means bring to bear on these diseases the full force of the statutory powers relating to infectious diseases.  Attention is drawn to the position which obtained when the Tuberculosis Prevention (Ireland) Act, 1908, was being promoted.  The feeling in this country was then so adverse to the disease being made generally notifiable that the Government of the time restricted notification to (a) the stage of pulmonary tuberculosis <Col N="1713" /> where the sputum discharged was liable to communicate the disease to other persons, and (b) circumstances in which the patient slept or worked in the same room as non-tuberculous persons or was employed or engaged in handling, preparing or distributing meat, milk, or any other article of human food intended for sale to the public. In 1919, a revised Order was made, extending the compulsory notification to any form of tuberculosis at any stage at which the sputum or other infective discharge from the patient was considered liable to communicate the disease to other persons.</P>
    <P>The result of this limited notification was that cases of tuberculosis were not notified until they had reached an advanced stage and the patient did not accordingly come under the notice of the tuberculosis medical officer until there was little chance of recovery or effective treatment.  Moreover the infection had often been spread by that time to the patient's household or fellow workers.  The position which has resulted could have been largely prevented if full notification had been enforced and the people educated to appreciate the real requirements of the situation.  It is not yet too late to provide the necessary safeguards for the protection of the present generation both in their early years and up to the prime of life.  For that purpose it is proposed in the Second Schedule of the Bill to empower compulsory notification of all forms of tuberculosis and compulsory removal to hospital of infective cases where necessary.  I would like to stress the fact that the making of an Order declaring tuberculosis an infectious disease will apply the provisions of Section 34 of the Bill to persons suffering from that disease. Under that section the health authority of the area in which such a person resides shall make reasonable and proper provision for his maintenance or that of his dependents.</P>
    <P>This provision is likely to have far-reaching effects in aiding the campaign against tuberculosis.  As we know, the cure of that disease is most easily effected if the person attacked seeks medical advice and treatment in its first onset or in its earliest stage. Breadwinners are too often deterred <Col N="1714" /> from seeking early treatment by fear of loss of employment and the consequent suffering to the family or other dependents.  If the patient is assured of reasonable financial assistance to meet his needs, he can seek medical advice without delay and concentrate on obtaining the best results from the treatment afforded to him, thereby increasing considerably the likelihood of a complete cure. Medical officers of sanatoria are familiar with the case of mothers who leave an institution before they can receive any adequate treatment because they are worried as to the lack of care of their children at home. Where the circumstances so require, the health authority may make such provision by defraying the cost of the employment of a person to act as a substitute for the patient during absence or incapacity.  The latter course would be useful for instance in the case of a mother of young children who had tuberculosis, as it would be possible for the county authority, if the circumstances so required, to arrange for a suitable person to carry on the care of the children, and perform here other duties while the mother is undergoing institutional treatment.  Similarly, it is conceivable that the supply of an agricultural worker might be the best and most economic means of securing the reasonable maintenance of the dependents of a farmer patient who could not himself afford to pay a farm labourer to look after the farm during his absence in hospital, or his incapacity for work.</P>
    <P>In view of the service rendered to the community by the hospitalisation of persons who are probable or actual sources of infection, it seems fitting that where hardships are incurred by such persons or their dependents on account of giving up employment or occupation, reasonable and proper financial assistance should where necessary be made available to meet such hardships.  If any dispute arises as to the nature or amount of the provision (if any) to be made for the maintenance of any such persons or his dependents the matters is to be decided by the Minister.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1715" /> In regard to cases of venereal disease, it is necessary to have available compulsory power to deal with patients who refuse to avail of treatment and who, if allowed to remain in an infective condition, are liable to spread infection to innocent persons. Under the existing law, if a person can prove that he has contracted an infectious disease by reason of the failure of another person to comply with the provision of the Public Health Acts, he can recover from the other person compensation for the damage he has suffered.  Difficulty, however, usually arises in proving that the disease was contracted on account of the defendant's failure, seeing that any other cause of infection must be eliminated with reasonable certainty by the complainant.  The clause inserted in Part IV of the Bill should remove this difficulty.</P>
    <P>I would now draw attention to the proposed repeal of the Vaccination Acts.  It is no longer proposed to enforce vaccination against smallpox except at times or in districts where the risk of that disease is regarded as serious.  Smallpox has for a long period been absent from this country, the last case on record being an imported case discovered at Cobh in 1923, whilst the last death occurred in 1907.</P>
    <P>Other notable matters to be included in regulations are compulsory cleansing or disinfestation of persons and the examination of persons suspected of being probable sources of infection. Power is also taken to extend to aircraft coming into or leaving the State, and to their passengers and crews, the precautions against the introduction into this country of infectious diseases which are at present applicable to vessels arriving from abroad.</P>
    <P>A person who is infective, or in charge of an infective person, must take reasonable precautions to prevent others from being infected either by himself or by a person under his care. It is disturbing to observe how lightly people violate the elementary rules for preventing the spread of infection by permitting children suffering from whooping cough, measles, scarlet fever, chicken-pox, mumps, ringworm, <Col N="1716" /> scabies, etc., to attend schools or mingle with other children.  Again, persons suffering from tuberculosis, often fail to take the simplest precautions to prevent the disease being conveyed to other members of their families or households.</P>
    <P>A person who lets apartments as lodgings must not do so in respect of a room or other place which he knows to have been occupied by a person who was a probable source of infection, until the necessary disinfection and disinfestation of such room or place has been carried out.  The same prohibition applies to the selling or letting of dwellings which have been exposed to infection.  Restrictions are also placed on the use of public conveyances by any persons who are a probable source of infection with diseases to be specified.</P>
    <P>Experience of the operation of the powers conferred by the Public Health Acts for the compulsory removal to hospital of persons suffering from dangerous infectious diseases and for the isolation of contacts has shown that the procedure prescribed for that purpose is cumbersome and unsatisfactory. The power of compulsory removal cannot be enforced if the patient or the contact refuses to go to the hospital or place of isolation, and is willing to pay the penalty provided for the offence which in the case of a patient is a fine not exceeding £10, and in the case of a contact a fine, not exceeding £5.  This remedy is of very little use against the classes of the population who are likely to resist the adoption of reasonable precautions against the spread of infectious disease. This was clearly demonstrated a few years ago in connection with an outbreak of typhus fever in a northwestern county which was traced to a party of itinerants travelling through that area.  Unsuccessful efforts were made to induce members of this party who were contacts with cases of the disease to allow themselves to be disinfested, and to be isolated for a period so as to preclude the infection being carried to other localities. Before the necessary procedure could be carried out the itinerants had disappeared.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1717" /> In view of the grave danger arising from a contingency of this kind, it was decided to provide the necessary machinery for dealing with such cases. For this purpose the Emergency Powers (No. 46) Order, 1940, was made by the Government on the 27th August, 1940.  This Order empowers the Minister to issue a warrant for the detention and isolation of any person who is considered to be a probable source of infection with any disease until a specified medical officer shall certify that such person is no longer a probable source of infection.  The Order has been used in a considerable number of cases and has proved of immense value to county medical officers of health in dealing with outbreaks of serious infectious disease, especially of typhus fever.  It is proposed to incorporate the same principle in this part of the Bill with the amendment that the chief medical officer of the county, county borough, or port sanitary district concerned, shall be substituted for the Minister in regard to the issue of an Order directing the detention of a person who is deemed to be a probable source of infection.  This alteration will enable the Order to be made more quickly and will ensure that it can be acted on more promptly.  Moreover, provision is being made in the Bill for giving to the patient, or, in the case of a child, to his parents, a right of appeal to the Minister against detention.  This new provision should therefore be a distinct improvement on the Emergency Powers Order which will be revoked when the alternative arrangements become available.</P>
    <P>The new provisions in Part IV render unnecessary various clauses of the Public Health and associated Acts under which sanitary authorities are authorised to provide facilities for cleansing and disinfection in connection with the prevention or control of infectious disease, and these are being repealed.</P>
    <P>Parts V and VI of the Bill deal respectively with drainage and water supply.  As regards Part V, there has been considerable difficulty in inducing owners of premises in an area where a new drainage system has been installed <Col N="1718" /> by a sanitary authority, to connect their premises to that system.  It is considered that when a sanitary authority provides a systeme of public drainage on modern lines in their district, the standard of drainage required for premises in that district should be raised, and, where practicable, drainage by means of cess pools or similar arrangements should no longer be permitted.  No provision is made in the existing law for such improvement and the powers of the sanitary authority are therefore confined to cases in which even the absolute minimum of drainage does not exist.  The Bill introduces a new procedure in accordance with modern requirements under which owners of premises can be required to provide drainage systems which are satisfactory having regard to the standard of the area in which these premises are situated.  This procedure is set out in Sections 40 to 45 of the Bill.  Section 40 empowers the sanitary authority to require within a specified period after the coming into force of a drainage Order the due execution of specified drainage works for the drainage in a satisfactory manner of any separate premises, or of two or more separate premises.</P>
    <P>The sanitary authority is empowered to make such portion of the drainage system which passes through land of which the owner is not an owner of premises required to be drained, or to make portion of the system where the total length of the drain exceeds 100 feet in case of any separate premises, or in case of two or more premises, any excess length as may be determined under Section 43 (4) of the Bill.  In case of default the sanitary authority may execute the necessary work and recover the appropriate expenses.  Where any doubt, dispute or question arises, an appeal lies to the Minister, who may either confirm the Order of the sanitary authority, with or without amendment, or subject to such amendments as he thinks proper, or he may annul the Order if the circumstance of the case would warrant the adoption of that course.</P>
    <P>The institution of a proper sewerage system is largely dependent upon the connection of premises to a public <Col N="1719" /> water supply.  The explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill indicated the defects in the existing law.  The Bill introduces a modern procedure for the provision of a water supply applicable to all buildings and empowers the sanitary authority to make a provisional water supply order requiring the connection of a building, in a specified manner and within a specified period, with a public water supply.  The owner or occupier of a building and the owner or occupier of land through which the water pipes are intended to pass, may lodge an objection with the Minister in regard to the order, and he may confirm the order without amendment or with such amendments as he thinks proper, or annul the order.  Where the order is confirmed, the sanitary authority may make that portion of the water supply system which is more than 100 feet from the building, or, in the case of several buildings, which is more than the total length of pipes in the water supply system represented by 100 feet multiplied by the number of such buildings, while the owner or owners of the buildings will be responsible for making the balance of the system which lies nearest to the buildings.  If that portion of the system is not made by the owner or owners, the sanitary authority may do that work and apportion the cost as between the owners.  A right of appeal to the Minister is provided for in the case of any dispute as to the portion of the system and the apportionment of the cost, to be made by the sanitary authority.</P>
    <P>Recently we had a discussion in the House as to the feasibility of providing a piped water supply to rural dwellings.  In pointing out the impracticability of such a proposal, I directed the attention of the House to the availability through our spring wells of a pure and wholesome water supply in many rural areas.  I expressed the hope that local authorities would direct their attention to the proper construction of these wells so as to protect this source of domestic water supply from contamination.  In the hope that local authorities may do <Col N="1720" /> something practical in the matter, provision is being made in Section 54 of the Bill to enable local authorities to spend money, or make a grant of money, to any person for the provision, improvement or maintenance of any water supply other than a public water supply.</P>
    <P>Difficulty is at times experienced in arranging for repairs to water pipes which pass through lands owned by a person not the owner of the building to which the water pipes are connected; and power is taken in the Bill to enable a sanitary authority at the request and at the cost of the owner of the building, to enter on the land and carry out the necessary repairs to the pipes.</P>
    <P>Part VII of the Bill contains provisions for the control of temporary dwellings and camping.  Power exists at present under Section 20 of the Local Government Act, 1925, to make by-laws for the prevention of nuisances in tents, vans, sheds, or similar structures, or on barges, lighters, boats, or other vessels on any inland water used for human habitation. This section has not proved effective, and, in any event, is not sufficient to deal with the problems which are expected to arise in the near future from holiday camping.  The framers of that section had mainly in mind itinerant tinkers and people of that kind whose squatting on the road margins and lands often gives rise to a nuisance owing to their nomadic way of life.  The danger to health and morals, and to life and limb, by these squatters on the roadside and in other public places, has so often been referred to by public representatives that I need not delay the House by further reference to it.  Suffice to say that the powers sought in the Bill are calculated to deal satisfactorily with the matter.</P>
    <P>We may now also expect a great increase in motor caravans, camping in tents for pleasure, and semi-permanent holiday rest camps.  Further, there is reason to believe that vessels of the house-boat type may be stationed on coastal and inland waters to cater for tourists.  While no objection to this development is being made <Col N="1721" /> there is nevertheless serious danger of injury to the health, and to the amenities of our countryside, unless steps are taken to regulate camping and to prevent abuses.  Part VII is designed to enable the sanitary authorities to do this in an effective way without unduly interfering with the enjoyment of healthy pleasure.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;temporary dwelling&rdquo; includes tents, vans, sheds, huts and similar structures and vessels on inland waters used for human habitation or constructed or adopted for such use.  The power of a sanitary authority to make bye-laws in respect of the use of temporary dwellings in their sanitary district is re-enacted and such bye-laws may relate to habitable condition and cleanliness, the control of infectious diseases, prevention of injury to the amenities of the locality by reason of filth, refuse, and noise, the securing of orderly and decent behaviour by occupants of temporary dwellings, and the prevention of nuisances.  Power is taken for a sanitary authority to prohibit temporary dwellings in any part of their sanitary district where they consider that such dwellings would be prejudicial to public health or the amenities of the locality, or would interfere unreasonably with traffic on any road.</P>
    <P>This power would be mainly used for the prevention of danger of road accidents by encampments or parked vehicles on road margins, and for the preservation of the amenities of pleasure resorts or beautiful landscapes. There is a right of appeal to the Minister for any person aggrieved by the prohibitions.  If a temporary dwelling is in such a condition as to be injurious to health whether by reason of the absence of proper sanitary conveniences, overcrowding or other cause, it may be dealt with as a nuisance within the meaning of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, and a court before which proceedings are brought by the sanitary authority against the occupier of the site of that dwelling may make an order prohibiting the retention of the temporary dwelling at that place or within such area as may be specified in the order. Provision is included in Section 60 of <Col N="1722" /> the Bill for dealing with permanent or semi-permanent holiday camps or camping grounds.  Under that section the Minister may by Order provide that the section shall come into force in a specified sanitary district or part of a sanitary district on a specified day.  The arrangements provide for the grant by a sanitary authority of a licence to an occupier of land in their district authorising the use of such land for camping during a specified period of 12 months.  This licence may be granted subject to specified conditions dealing with the maximum number of dwellings to be kept on the land at the same time, their nature and size, the distances between any two dwellings, their distance from the public road, their sanitation, the orderly and decent behaviour of their inhabitants, the maintenance of healthy conditions and preservation of amenities and the employment of a warden to supervise the dwellings.  It will be illegal for a person without such a licence to use land for camping on more than 14 consecutive days or more than 30 days within 12 consecutive months.  Exceptions are made for persons engaged in seasonal farming operations and in respect of camping on land occupied in connection with a dwelling in the vicinity by the occupier or members of his household. In connection with the conditions for the obtaining of a licence it seems to be quite proper to require, from persons who are making their land available for campers as a profit-making enterprise, a reasonable standard of amenity and convenience.</P>
    <P>At present a sanitary authority can only provide baths and wash-houses within their district, but the Bill extends that power to the establishment of these facilities outside their district, subject to the consent of the local sanitary authority.  If that consent is refused or withheld for a period of three months there is right of appeal to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Bill also authorises the provision of life guards at bathing places and the provision of instruction in swimming and saving persons from drowning.  This provision should reduce the considerable loss of life <Col N="1723" /> from drowning which annually occurs in a country like this where rivers and lakes are so numerous.  Moreover, these facilities will enable a higher standard of personal cleanliness to be generally observed.</P>
    <P>The objects of Part IX have been summarised in the explanatory memorandum which accompanied the Bill, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  The protection of the public from food which is actually dangerous or injurious;</P>
    <P>(b)  The prevention of the exploitation of the public by manufacturers of inferior articles of food for which nutritive qualities are falsely claimed and also of malnutrition caused by the use of such foods;</P>
    <P>(c)  A general improvement in the nutritive qualities of the food available.</P>
    <P>The second section in this part of the Bill is an extension of a similar provision contained in the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907, which is being repealed as a consolidatory measure and re-enacted in an extended form in the Bill.  Authorisation is given therein for the making of regulations providing for the prevention of danger to the public from the manufacture, preparation, importation, storage, distribution, or exposure for sale, of food intended for sale for human consumption. The word &ldquo;food&rdquo; also includes drink.  These regulations would deal with the wholesomeness and cleanliness of materials used in the preparation or manufacture of these commodities. They would also control the manner in which such articles are stored, exposed for sale and distributed. Too often one witnesses the danger of contamination to which food is exposed, especially food which is intended to be eaten without being cooked.  Bread, a food in general use, is carried on uncovered trays on top of vans exposed to the dust of the road and is distributed in a very unhygienic manner.  Confectionery and sweets, favoured by children, are exhibited in shop windows subject to defilement by flies and other <Col N="1724" /> insects; fruit and lettuce are deposited outside shops open to contamination from various sources; and ice-cream is carried unprotected on vehicles through the streets.  Meat may also be seen arranged on slabs outside victuallers' stalls handled by every intending purchaser. The regulations will prescribe that suitable protection against contamination shall be afforded to such commodities.</P>
    <P>The remainder of Part IX deals with the standardisation and control of articles of human food and drink.  The necessity for these provisions is easily demonstrated.  Standardisation will protect the manufacturer of an honest and genuine product from the competition of unscrupulous rivals who may profit by imitating the appearance, but not the quality, of his products.  It will enhance the prestige and appreciation of Irish products by guaranteeing to purchasers that they will obtain a product of standard quality, and it will be clear to businessmen that quality will be the factor finally determining the sale.  In this respect Irish goods will be in competition with those from other countries where such a practice is already in operation.</P>
    <P>It is well known that statements published in modern advertising of a product are not always related to the actual value of the product.  In the case of food this may have serious consequences. The presence on the label, or wrapper, of an accurate description of the article, will ensure that purchasers are not misled by advertisement. Since the bulk of the people who buy food in this country have small incomes and cannot afford to make mistakes in spending their weekly wages, anything which assists them to make a wise choice must be regarded as being of tremendous economic and social value.</P>
    <P>The advertisements for baby foods, many of which make exaggerated claims, have been the cause of numbers of Irish children being fed on poor quality, low-grade cereals, with resulting ill-effects, and there is no means of informing the public of the real quality of such foods.  Moreover, there has been lately a tendency to claim that certain health foods contain <Col N="1725" /> vitamins or some other particular constituents.  Without a responsible authority to determine a standard in regard to these constituents the public have no protection.  Genuine fruit extracts, syrups, and cordials, are widely and properly recommended to supplements the vitamin content of children's diet.  Substitutes, however, have been sold with claims, expressed or implied, by pictures of fruit on the wrappers, or other devices, that they contain extracts from fresh fruits when, in reality, they contain little more than chemical flavourings.  This is a fraud on the public which cannot but have and adverse effect on the health of the young children to whom such drinks are supplied.</P>
    <P>The ever-increasing variety of modern foodstuffs, however, makes it difficult to prescribe legal fixed standards in every case.  Moreover, such a fixed standard must naturally be the lowest that can be permitted, and there might be a tendency for manufacturers to work down to that standard rather than seek an improvement in the absence of commercial advantage.  In order, therefore, to encourage an improvement in these foodstuffs it is proposed, either in addition to or in substitution for such fixed minimum standards, to allow producers of particular foods to fix their own standards of quality, and to announce them publicly on the wrapper or container of their products.  Each such producer will fix his standard by submitting samples of his product to the Department, which will have them examined and will certify the result. The certificate must be printed on the container in which the product is sold, and the producer must not sell any of that product inferior in quality to the sample certified.  This procedure, while ensuring the benefits of publicity to the producer of a superior product, will serve to protect the public and encourage an improvement in the nutritive value of the food concerned.</P>
    <P>The regulations to be made under Part IX will prescribe a standard for the composition of foods which require a degree of control, and will set out the procedure in connection with the certification by the Minister of the <Col N="1726" /> results of the examination of samples of food submitted to him by the manufacturer or importer.</P>
    <P>The only existing power at present for a health authority to expend money on educational publicity is contained in Section 14 of the Tuberculosis Prevention (Ireland) Act, 1903, and relates only to tuberculosis.  The dissemination to the public of information and advice on health matters is of great importance in modern public health administration, and Section 83 of the Bill accordingly, authorises expenditure from the rates for educating the public in regard to matters relating to health, by means of advertisements, notices, pamphlets, lectures, etc., subject to direction by the Minister, where deemed necessary, as to the manner in which that power is to be exercised.</P>
    <P>It may be deemed desirable from time to time for two or more health authorities to take joint action in the performance of any of their functions under the Public Health Acts as for instance in the provision of institutions, and the necessary authority for that purpose is conferred in Section 84 of the Bill, which also contains a saving in respect of the continuance of joint maintenance by health authorities of any institution which has been so maintained before the commencement of the section.  Under the existing law such co-operation can only be achieved by the establishment of a united district under Section 12 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, and that requires a provisional Order confirmed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 89 provides for the placing of restrictions on the importation, manufacture, or sale of certain articles, and greater control is necessary in respect of certain appliances and substances which are frequently advertised and the use of which may involve the risk of serious injury to health or body.  There is also need for greater protection of the public in regard to certain medical preparations which are extensively advertised as possessing curative, restorative, protective, or tonic properties.  The public have no guide <Col N="1727" /> as to the extent to which these claims are justified, and accordingly there is considerable exploitation of persons suffering from ailments, infirmities, or defects for which the preparations claim to be a remedy.  There are few members of the House who have not at some time felt the power of modern propaganda.  There are few amongst us who would not resent it if we were told that the actions of our daily lives were not really the result of our free will, but were largely affected by whatever advertising inducements caught our eye.  While there is no doubt that modern advertising can be regarded as a reasonable part of legitimate trade, and as it is frequently said that an advertised and patented article must live up to its claims, still there is a form of trade which often deviates ethically in that it tends to exercise far too great an influence through advertising.  I refer to the matter of patent and proprietary medicines.  I freely admit that there are preparations which as a result of years of advertising have come to be well known, and when kept in the family medicine cupboard are useful home helps for the slight domestic mishaps which occasionally occur.  I do not deny that some patent or proprietary products, on psychological or even on clinical grounds, have justified their existence.  But I am equally certain that there are many drug products sold to the public as a result of high pressure advertising which are fraudulent.</P>
    <P>In most civilised states throughout the world steps have been taken to control this trade, whether by special taxation or otherwise, and it will not be denied that the time has come to control it here.  After all, the enormous sums spent on advertising these articles can only come from the pockets of those who purchase them and it should not be necessary for the purchaser to pay an excessive price solely for the pleasure of reading an excessive amount of advertising matter lauding these patent preparations.  Accordingly it is proposed, by regulations, to license these preparations, to prohibit the sale of those products which are <Col N="1728" /> not of the nature and constitution claimed, and to control the advertisement of medical preparations.</P>
    <P>It will probably come as a surprise to Deputies that under the existing law human remains may be buried in a place which is not a recognised burial-ground. There can be no records kept of such a burial, and it is not subject to the conditions which public health and public decency require.  Section 92 of the Bill is intended to provide the necessary control in regard to the burial of bodies of deceased persons, and prescribes that such burials shall only be permitted in places recognised as burial grounds.</P>
    <P>Whilst in certain burial grounds not controlled by sanitary authorities the proprietors undertake, for a consideration, to keep graves in order, either in perpetuity or for a specified time, the sanitary authorities have no such power as regards burial grounds under their control.  As this practice is desirable from many points of view, the necessary power for that purpose is conferred on sanitary authorities by Section 93 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Under the existing law there is no definite power save under Section 15 of the Coroners (Amendment) Act, 1927, or for police purposes, to permit the exhumation of bodies except from burial grounds under the control of sanitary authorities.  It is necessary to control such exhumation where required from other burial grounds so as to secure that it may be carried out with due care and decency and in such a manner as not to endanger public health.  Section 94 of the Bill provides, accordingly, that licences may be granted by the Minister for that purpose, and prohibits unauthorised exhumations.</P>
    <P>Under the existing law the determination of the area of charge for some of the expenditure incurred by a rural sanitary authority (known as special expenses) requires in each case an Order of the Minister.  In recent years many county councils have shown a preference for all special expenses being charged to the whole of the county health district as in the case of their general expenses.  The present system involves the making of separate <Col N="1729" /> Orders in every case.  Under Section 99 of the Bill, it is proposed that all such expenses, shall be general expenses unless the county council apply to the Minister for an Order fixing a special area of charge.</P>
    <P>The review I have made of the provisions of the Bill will, I trust, help Deputies to a full understanding of our problems.  I may add that as a result of this measure 14 existing Acts are being repealed, together with portions of 11 other Acts.  The Bill, therefore, effects a very substantial advance in regard to the co-ordination of the public health code, and many additional measures have been included so as to bring its provisions up to date. It is hoped in due course to proceed with further consolidatory and progressive legislation and thus provide a comprehensive, unified and efficient public health code.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has complained about the type of fraudulent advertisement that one sees in papers in regard to food and medicines, making fraudulent claims for these things.  He has described these advertisements as a fraud upon the public.  Big as, perhaps, has been the fraud upon the public in that way, this Bill is a bigger fraud upon this House.  It is a fraud upon the Dáil.  When the Parliamentary Secretary puts this Bill before the House and before the people, and recommends it as something which would bring about an equitable balance between the spiritual and material aspects of life for our people, then, I think, &ldquo;fraud&rdquo; has to be spelt with a capital &ldquo;F&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the early parts of his statement, the Parliamentary Secretary referred to the administrative machinery for the control of public health that exists in this country and he said, with reference to the general scheme and the system of county medical officers of health, that we may congratulate ourselves on possessing this organisation. I should like to remind the House and the Parliamentary Secretary that the fact that we are in possession of the machinery for safeguarding <Col N="1730" /> the public health, that has been described by the Parliamentary Secretary, is due to the fact that in the past we relied upon the classical way of dealing with the improvement of public health: we relied upon conference and consultation with authorities; we relied upon the education of the people; we relied upon the cooperation of everybody, and we relied upon a situation in which people could have confidence in authority.  The Parliamentary Secretary says that the provision of the county medical officers of health scheme was a slow process. It was, because it was brought about in a way that ensured that the people would become gradually educated to the necessity for it, and only persons in whom the people could have full confidence were appointed.</P>
    <P>One must look back at the general way in which the public were educated in those days.  We had voluntary bodies assisting the Government and the Government even taking assistance from voluntary bodies in setting up the scheme.  In the beginning of the development of this public health scheme that the Parliamentary Secretary congratulates us on having, we got the assistance of the Rockefeller Foundation. In the earlier cases when county medical officers of health were appointed, we received grants, for the first three years, towards the local and State expenses of establishing the county medical officer of health and starting him out on the exercise of his function.  In the end, the Rockefeller Institute offered £30,000 for the setting up of an institute of public health here to be built and equipped for putting, as it were, the keystone to the county medical officer of health scheme.  It was refused by the present Government and we have been left without a very valuable addition to our health services here.  At any rate, progress has been made, as I say, by the classical scheme of consultation and cooperation and the establishing of confidence on the part of our citizens in the people who were directing their public health matters.</P>
    <P>Now we are radically changing the approach to these matters and we are <Col N="1731" /> introducing a kind of medical constabulary. We are putting a constabulary spirit at the back of it.  The Parliamentary Secretary pointed out that the principal thing in this Bill is dealt with in Sections 85, 86 and 87. He said that this is a new scheme for providing free medical attendance for mothers and for children up to the age of 16.  If we are to believe him, this is the establishment of a new medical service by which the mothers and all the children up to 16 years of age can avail of free medical attendance of every kind.  If that is so, why could not the Parliamentary Secretary put it into a Bill and let us have a proposal from the Government on these lines in a clear and concentrated way?  If the Parliamentary Secretary is developing a scheme like that, I think that we ought to have the proposal put into a separate Bill and we ought to see that it has been fully considered by the various bodies likely to be concerned in a scheme like that.  If the people require a medical service like that and are to get it, they ought to get it without imposing the other onerous laws enshrined in this measure on the people; because this is such a mixture of onerous laws and it will come as such a shocking surprise to the people that nobody with any conscience in the matter of public liberty or with regard to the position of local authorities and their functions or with any appreciation of the varying functions of the different professions and different organisations could vote for this measure.</P>
    <P>We propose to oppose this measure because it introduces an unprecedented series of attacks on public liberty, on local authorities and on the general scheme of things in which our public health and our local institutions have been organised in the past.  If there is any profession which has a clearly defined function, it is the medical profession, and we have not heard from the Parliamentary Secretary that there has been the slightest consultation with any organised body with regard to the proposals on the medical side in this measure.</P>
    <P>Some years ago a commission was set up on vocational organisation and <Col N="1732" /> one of the recommendations of that commission&mdash;a recommendation unanimously subscribed to&mdash;was in paragraph 543, which stated: &ldquo;We recommend therefore that a council of health should be established and constituted more or less as follows&rdquo;.  Then it indicates the four definite groups from which representation should be drawn for the council of health: from the central and local authorities, from the medical profession, from the other professions, including veterinary, engineers and chemists, and from voluntary or other organisations, such as the National Health Insurance Society, the Red Cross Society, or the National Conference on Agriculture. The report declares in the same section that the council should examine and report to the Oireachtas on any proposed public health legislation.</P>
    <P>It may be that there is a case for suggesting that perhaps we have not yet so far advanced in our general review of these matters as to require that a council of health should be established now to make recommendations to us on these matters.  But if we take the second group, the medical, profession, we ought to have some kind of understanding, some kind of knowledge that the medical profession has been fully consulted before we give the Minister power to declare what shall be and what shall not be infectious diseases and to make various Orders and regulations dealing in various ways with them.  As I say, there is no profession that has a more clearly defined function and that has a sphere inside of which lay people would hesitate to intrude, as the medical profession.  We ought to have in a clear way some sort of a report such as it is contemplated the Oireachtas would receive from a council of health; we ought to have some kind of report analogous to that, which could be regarded as representing medical opinion on many of the proposals here.</P>
    <P>We are asked to turn our backs on quite a number of things; we are asked to pass a Bill that wipes out certain things which are fundamental. One of the things that the Bill does is that it completely supersedes any <Col N="1733" /> remnant of local government in respect of public health and the maintenance and servicing of institutions dealing with public health.  Section 13 provides that a health authourity shall provide and maintain any institution which the Minister, by Order, directs them to provide and maintain.  Under Section 14, the Minister can cause a local inquiry to be held without any published report or even without the terms of reference of the inquiry being published.  He can order a local authority to discontinue from a specified date a health institution or to discontinue the carrying on of certain classes of work in any particular type of health institution. That is, he takes complete power into his own hands and out of the hands of local authorities to deal with the kind of health institutions they usually maintain and the kind of work they shall do in them.  I completely oppose that.  He takes power, therefore, over the judgment of the local authorities as to how things should be carried on in their institutions.  He takes complete power over the purse of the local authorities and the relationship between central and local finances, which have got into a very nice mess since the Minister took power to dictate over the heads of local authorities how the rates should be used, so as to cover up the disastrous financial consequences to this country of many aspects of Fianna Fáil policy.  This is going further and I think the House should resist it on these grounds.</P>
    <P>There was a system under which, in order to encourage local authorities to go ahead with the putting into operation of certain measures for safeguarding public health, certain grants were given to them by the State, just as, in order to encourage local authorities and the State here to set up an institution&mdash;the county medical officers of health&mdash;the Rockefeller Institute was prepared to give grants over a certain number of years.  These grants given by the State to local authorities for many of these purposes are continuing as lump grants, without any relation to the work being done as a result of the grants or to the impulse which they <Col N="1734" /> are intended to stimulate in local authorities.  I defy anybody, including any Deputy, with the information published at present, to make head or tail of the local taxation accounts. Under cover of providing a free medical service for mothers and children, all remaining vestige of power in the hands of local authorities as regards public health is being taken from them and the Minister is taking absolute and complete control.</P>
    <P>Under the same power, the right of a parent to look after the health of his child according to his own conscience and in his own way, and the right of a parent to use his own family doctor for that purpose, is being taken away. The Minister is amending the 1919 Act, under which school inspections were first introduced.  In that particular Act, it was expressly stated that there would be no compulsion on a parent to have his child inspected by the medical officer.  Section 3 of the Public Health (Medical Treatment of Children) Act, 1919, says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Nothing in this Act shall be construed as imposing any obligation on a parent to submit his child to medical inspection or treatment, or as authorising a local authority to establish a general domiciliary service of treatment of children by medical practitioners.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is being departed from completely and then the Parliamentary Secretary says, in a very superior way, that if he thought it was for conscientious motives that parents kept their children at home when the school, medical officer was visiting the school, he would respect their consciences; but he is too wise, too grown up and too experienced to think that this is a matter of conscience at all.  Therefore, he takes absolute power in the Bill to impose penalties on any parent who refuses to have his child examined by the school medical officer.  Then he goes on to say that if he thought the refusal arose out of the fact that the parents are already having their children looked after by the family doctor, he would respect their motives, but he does not allow himself to think that people could have these natural or progressive feelings and he declares he <Col N="1735" /> is not going to accept the position that people may have either a conscientious objection to allowing their children to be examined by part of the new State medical constabulary or the objection that they are having them properly examined at home.  He says there is an inconsiderate few in the country who care little about public health and it is only those who are likely to create difficulties for the Parliamentary Secretary or the Department in this particular matter.  These inconsiderate few are to get very short shrift and the penalty clauses so copiously scattered through the Bill will operate.</P>
    <P>The section of the 1919 Act which I quoted says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Nothing in this Act shall be construed as ... authorising a local authority to establish a general domiciliary service of treatment of children by medical practitioners.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So far as I can see, the Minister is taking power to do that now.  He is taking power to establish that particular type of constabulary and let the local people pay for it.  Under sub-section (4) of Section 21, where a parent is prevented from sending his child to school or to a place of public worship or to a theatre or concert hall, when he is reported under that section to the district medical officer, the child shall not be allowed to attend any of those places until the officer gives a certificate that he is fit to attend.  I read it that the domiciliary service is being handed over to the new constabulary and that there is no house which cannot be entered into by a district medical officer for the purpose of following up a child who is suffering from mumps or croup or is verminous or has any of these infections diseases.</P>
    <P>We cannot get the new free service for mothers or children unless we give the Minister power that any person in the State, under the Second Schedule, paragraph 11, can be challenged by a medical officer of health and brought aside for inspection to discover whether he is suffering from T.B. or V.D. or whether he is verminous or suffering from some infectious disease.  That person can be taken <Col N="1736" /> under Section 29 and brought to one of the new medical pounds.  We had a Pounds Bill before, when the Government was running the economic war.  Now that they are out on this health crusade, we are going to have child pounds and a person so challenged and suspected of suffering from any of these diseases or being verminous can be brought to one of these pounds to be disinfected or decontaminated. Under paragraph (h) of Section 29 (2) the medical practitioner may &ldquo;cause anything to be done in ralation to the patient which in his opinion is necessary or expedient to prevent the spread of infection from the patient&rdquo;.  The Minister would appear to be taking power whereby the medical constabulary could carry out any operation they desire or that they thought necessary in order to prevent the sperad of disease.</P>
    <P>An examination of the measure even in a cursory way will show that it proposes an unprecedented attack on personal liberty.  I do not know in what way it may be challengeable under the Constitution, but I note that the Minister takes power under Section 21 to deny education to a child who can be regarded as verminous.  I wonder has he consulted the Minister for Education in order to see what the provision is in many of the schools throughout the country for children keeping their coats and hats separate from others when they hang them up in the school cloakroom.  I think we could very well allow the verminous state of our school children to be dealt with by educational processes rather than by police methods if a little more attention were paid in schools to the cloakroom accommodation provided for putting up hats and coats and other articles of apparel.</P>
    <P>But the Minister also takes power to prevent, by police methods and court fines, children attending places of public worship because they are verminous. Children can be prevented from going to certain places, that is, they can be denied the right to practise their religion and public worship; they can be denied the getting of education if it can be shown they are suffering from vermin in any way.  I think &ldquo;vermin&rdquo; ought to be defined <Col N="1737" /> and I advise the Parliamentary Secretary, in attempting to define vermin for the purposes of this Act, not to go to the Oxford Dictionary, because there are many humans who, under the Oxford Dictionary definition, would be regarded as vermin by him, and there are quite a number of people under the same definition who might regard him and the Minister as somewhat verminous, or belonging to the vermin class. So he ought to be careful in looking up his authorities.</P>

      <P>That is all I want to say about that.  These are the things I find in this Bill and I challenge the House on this point, that we get this measure introduced here by a Parliamentary Secretary, who is at loggerheads with the medical fraternity.  I challenge him on this point, that the medical fraternity were not consulted with regard to this Bill. I do not think we could conscientiously agree to some of the sections here at the dictates of the Parliamentary Secretary without a full understanding of the approach of the general medical fraternity to matters that are being dealt with in the measure.  I pointed out before that the Vocational Organisation Commission thought that, on proposed public health legislation, the Oireachtas should be assisted by a report from a council of health which would examine and report on proposals that might be made, and that <Col N="1738" /> one of the four sections that would go to make up that council of health was the medical profession, which was supposed to provide six representatives. These individuals would represent the Medical Research Council, the teaching bodies, the voluntary hospitals, the county medical officers of health, the dispensary doctors and general medical practitioners in private practice.</P>
      <P>There is an association, the Irish Medical Association, which is the ruling body from the point of view of educational matters, scientific matters and matters generally affecting the economic interests of the medical profession.  At any rate, they are people who, in matters of medical education and scientific approach to medical work and public health work, could be regarded as a body ready to be approached in relation to this subject. As regards the county medical officers of health, to whom the Parliamentary Secretary has referred, there was a time before the present Government came into office when these officers were brought together for the purposes of consultation, either with or without representatives of local bodies.  I challenge the Minister that the county medical officers of health have not been consulted in these matters, nor have the dispensary doctors or the general medical practitioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is introduced by a Parliamentary Secretary who, instead of being able to tell the House that he has consulted those people, is at loggerheads with the medical profession, at loggerheads with all the voluntary associations that are in the country running medical institutions. Where he is not abolishing them he is changing their whole plans by pressure of one kind or another and he is dictating to them what they should do and how their institutions should be organised.  He is at loggerheads with local authorities.  I believe he must be at loggerheads with the Church, and I do not know how he brings himself to ask this House to pass a law that a child should not be allowed to go to Mass because it has nits in its hair. <Col N="1739" /> There is not a group connected with public health or public administration that the Parliamentary Secretary is not at loggerheads with.  There is one matter that is becoming more and more a matter of public notoriety, and that is that he is at loggerheads with the principal medical adviser in his own Department.  It was generally rumoured a short time ago that the newly-appointed chief medical officer of the Department of Local Government was resigning and it is now publicly rumoured that there is a distinct clash between the Parliamentary Secretary and the chief medical adviser of his Department.  These are things that cannot be left unsaid.</P>

      <P>I am describing to the House the person who puts this measure before it.  When the Minister gets up and talks about the one mind, could we ask him a question?  Could we ask him if it is his mind or the mind of the Parliamentary Secretary we are dealing with here?  Could we have an answer to that?</P>
      <P>To revert again to the report made at the express request of the Government by a very large number of most distinguished, capable and qualified people on vocational organisation, we find, in paragraph 514, page 319 of that report, this sentence with regard to professional organisation:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Organisation has contributed greatly towards raising the level of professional knowledge and has led to the development of the science and technique of the profession.  It is also an advantage to the client and community that there should exist a high standard of professional conduct and that the profession should be regulated or governed by an internal, free and representative authority rather than by a Government official.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We are here asked to take an action which is nonsensical, unless that action is advised by the technically qualified people of the medical profession, and it is because of that that I warn the House in dealing with this measure that there is no free technical advice that we know of or have been told about behind its proposals in relation to infectious diseases or in relation to the policing of the individual citizen for public health purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said before, when the Minister introduces this measure as a measure to bring about an equitable balance between the spiritual and material aspects of life, we have as little information on what the spiritual authorities, those authorities which concern themselves with the spiritual aspects of life, think of some of its provisions as we have of what the authorities which deal with the <Col N="1742" /> material aspects of life, the medical aspects, think.  The presentation of this measure by the Parliamentary Secretary is a fraud upon this House and we shall be utter frauds if we take either the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister at his word, that this measure will improve either the material or the spiritual aspects of life in the country.  We want no policing of our spiritual or material life in health matters in the way in which this Bill would attempt to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I must compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on the very comprehensive statement he made, I feel that Deputies must regard this measure with very grave misgiving.  The Bill is a comprehensive one.  It covers the span of human life from before birth to long after death. It even chases the human being to the grave and provides for exhumation. The most critical and contentious chapter of the Bill, in my opinion, is Chapter 4, which deals in a far-reaching way with the internment and isolation of people accused of suffering from infectious diseases.  I am one of those who have always felt that, in dealing with infectious diseases, and particularly with tuberculosis, it is necessary that the medical profession should have considerable power, but it is even more necessary that the private citizen, the common man, the plain man in the street, should have adequate protection in regard to his liberty, his freedom of action and the rights which the ordinary citizen enjoys under the Constitution.  There is a song which has become very popular and which, I think, has made Bing Crosby very popular, entitled &ldquo;Don't Fence Me In&rdquo;.  There is nothing the human being resents and revolts against more than being fenced in, deprived completely of his liberty and placed under the control of some other person or persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of dealing with this matter in the abstract, I want the Minister to take a concrete or specific case. Take the case of a young man or woman who is taken from his or her home and from his or her ordinary avocation and placed in an institution. <Col N="1743" /> The institution may be first class, may be ideal but this could happen: The person interned&mdash;internment is the proper word to use&mdash;may incur the enmity or the hostility of some official in charge.  It is very easy to understand circumstances in which this could arise.  For example, an official may be accused by a patient of some serious offence.  The matter is investigated and the patient may be unable to prove the charge.  Then there follows enmity and hostility between that patient and the official in charge.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary may reply that the officers in charge of the various institutions, doctors, matrons and so on, might be so noble-minded and so unselfish that they might never allow personal feelings to enter into the exercise of their duties.  But Deputies who are members of local authorities and who have experience in these matters know that personal feelings do enter into all matters connected with both institutions and general health administration.  Here you have a case in which a citizen, who has committed no offence whatever, is condemned perhaps to a lifetime of oppression at the hands of some superior officer in an institution, and the Bill provides no adequate safeguard for the citizen's rights.</P>
    <P>We may be told that this Bill simply extends the powers taken in regard to people who are mentally affected, to persons who are suffering from infectious diseases.  But, even in regard to the insane, there have been cases of grave injustice in institutions, cases which I, personally, could quote. I could quote one particular instance which shows how necessary it is to have the most adequate and the most far reaching safeguards for the rights of the citizens when you take power to intern them as you do under this Bill. In a certain mental hospital this incident happened.  A few years ago a doctor was passing along a corridor and he heard what he described as a slapping sound.  He entered the ward and found that a woman patient was being slapped on the bare body by the nurse in charge.  He made inquiries and <Col N="1744" /> reported the matter to the R.M.S.  The R.M.S. investigated the matter and took stern and drastic action in the case of the nurse.  He dismissed her from the service of the institution. Immediately other machinery was set in operation.  The nurse appealed to her trade union and appealed to the dominant political organisation in the county, which was the Fianna Fáil organisation.  I should mention that the committee of management, the small committee, a bare quorum which usually meets to discharge the duties of the mental hospital committee, endorsed the action of the R.M.S., but when the machinery of political action and of personal canvass was set in motion, there was a full meeting of the committee of management.  All the members of the committee were not present when the matter was first discussed, but at this meeting they all tramped in to oppose the action of the R.M.S.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to show how the rights of the citizen can be trampled upon.  The R.M.S. in this case was a sturdy fighter.  He took action and he had the matter reported to the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  The Department of Local Government immediately ordered that legal proceedings be <Col N="1745" /> instituted against the nurse.  As a result, when the committee met to condemn the action of the R.M.S. and to reinstate this nurse, they found that they could not take action because the matter was <i>sub judice.</i>  Proceedings were taken and the nurse was found guilty and punished in the District Court.  But here was the final result of the matter.  A few weeks later the Secretary to the Department of Local Government who supported the R.M.S. was dismissed, and a few weeks after that the R.M.S. resigned.  The unhappy patient, if she had sufficient mental faculties to understand what had happened, found that instead of obtaining redress she was back in a worse position than ever because the attempt which had been made to support her when she was unjustly treated only resulted in the R.M.S. having to go and the Secretary to the Department of Local Government, who supported the R.M.S., also having to go.</P>
      <P>Now, when you see and realise that a position of this kind can occur, even where the officer in charge of an institution is wholeheartedly on the side of the patient, what might not occur if the officer in charge of an institution was careless or disregarded the interests of the patient and sided with the staff as against the patient? What adequate provision have we made to safeguard the rights of patients? We have had various cases brought to notice in the Press where there have been carelessness an neglect on the part of prominent people in hospitals and institutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary, but I have pointed out that in this Bill we are putting people suffering from infectious diseases in almost the same position as patients in a mental hospital inasmuch as they can be taken by force, if necessary, and interned for such time as <Col N="1746" /> the authorities may think fit.  Now, the Parliamentary Secretary will contend that it is necessary, absolutely necessary, in the interests of public health that drastic action should be taken to intern, if necessary, people who suffer from infectious diseases. But if we are to decide on that course of action we must also decide on providing adequate safeguards for the citizens in case they may be unjustly treated.  I have yet to find in the Bill any adequate safeguard for the citizen who has a grievance.  At least one would imagine that there should be some impartial and absolutely independent body to which a patient or a person who feels aggrieved might appeal.  The Parliamentary Secretary might ask what would be the nature of such a body.</P>

      <P>Now, if the attitude which the Parliamentary Secretary is taking up in regard to the discussion of this Bill is typical of the attitude which he has taken up in the drafting of it, it is no wonder that the Bill has come before the House with so many obvious faults and so many obvious assaults on the rights of the people of this country.  He has apparently introduced this Bill in a slipshod, careless and reckless manner.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary, before proceeding further with the Bill, to allow some time to elapse so that not only Dáil Éireann but the country will have a chance of considering all its implications. I would ask him not to press for the completion of the Second Stage of this Bill before the recess.  If he does that I am quite certain that, having consulted with those who are in a position to advise him, and having heard the views of the ordinary people of the country in regard to the interference which this Bill proposes with the rights of the people, he will come back again and ask permission to withdraw the Bill and introduce a more prudent one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), line 25, after the word &ldquo;authority&rdquo; to add the following words:&mdash;&ldquo;or such other stocks or securities for the time being approved of in that behalf by the Oireachtas as the Minister for Finance thinks proper&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with the amendment, I want to refer to the context in which I gave notice that I proposed to move this amendment on the last day, that was, that I desired first of all to have one thing established as a fact and, secondly, that being established, by way of a security, that I would move then to enlarge the scope of the investments in which these particular Post Office Savings Banks moneys may be lodged.  The Minister's reply to me on the first point purported to give the assurance which I looked for.  I am quoting the Official Debates of the 6th December, Vol. 98, column 1619.  I am there told by the Minister for Finance that what I proposed to do is already the law.  The Minister then went on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The State&mdash;that is, the community as a whole&mdash;is the final guarantor to the depositors in the Savings Bank... that they will get 2½ per cent. interest on that money so long as they leave it in the Post Office Savings Bank.  That guarantee has always been there, to supplement the guarantee that the depositors always have, that the moneys deposited by them have been invested in certain securities.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister is to be taken as particular about a phrase but I notice he says, &ldquo;the depositors will get 2½ <Col N="1748" /> per cent. as long as they leave it in the Post Office Savings Bank&rdquo;. Of course, that is not what we proposed to do.  The proposal I was making was that this money should be invested and I was asking that there should be a wider range of investments considered, not merely trustee securities, for the use of this money.  The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every year the Post Office Savings Bank publishes a list of the securities in which these moneys have been invested.  The final guarantee to the ordinary depositor that his money is safe is the guarantee of the State that, even in the event of these securities which have been published going by the board or depreciating in value, the State guarantees the depositor his money.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he says he felt&mdash;as a matter of fact, he thought&mdash;that on one or two occasions before 1920, the State chipped in and paid the interest on the deposits.</P>
    <P>To get that matter absolutely secure, I want to know what Act or part of an Act puts the State behind the Post Office Savings Bank as the final guarantor of these securities?  I do know that in reports made by the National Debt Commissioners a statement of that type appears but it may be nothing more than what the Minister was saying the other day, and that was: &ldquo;Oh, of course, if anything happened, the State would have to be there to guarantee.&rdquo;  What I am asking about is, is it laid down by a piece of statute law anywhere that, if these moneys are invested in certain securities which do not yield the amount required to pay 2½ per cent interest, the State then comes in with a special guarantee?  Originally, of course, these moneys used always be handed over to a group known as the National Debt Commissioners, and I have seen a quotation in a book that the National Debt Commissioners, in a report which they made in a particular year, do assert that the State is there as the final guarantor.  That is not the exact point.  I want to know, is there any statute law anywhere which says that this guarantee must be given by the State?  I would be very glad to get the assurance that that is so, because <Col N="1749" /> it would relieve me of any particular difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  That, therefore, makes the whole situation very easy to deal with, because if the guarantee of the State is there, there seems to me much less reason than <Col N="1750" /> there would have been if the State was not there as the final guarantor, for confining these investments, to the narrow range of trustee securities.  I was looking for a precedent for this and went back to a very recent Act&mdash; the Transport Act, 1944, whereby Córas Iompair Éireann was set up as a railway company.  It was laid down in that statute how the funds which Córas Iompair Éireann may have at its disposal could be used.  It was a bit of happy optimism that they thought they would have funds at their disposal, but the contingency, remote as it was, was provided for.  It was there laid down in a section with two subsections that that particular company might invest these moneys in the ordinary approved list of trustee securities and thereafter it stated that these funds might be invested&mdash;the way that particular Act runs&mdash;&ldquo;in such other securities for the time being approved by the Minister for Finance as the company thinks proper&rdquo;.  I adapt that phrase to this measure.  I have asked that these funds should be permitted to be invested, not merely in trustee securities, that is to say, trustee securities of local authorities, or other trustee securities, but also in such other stocks or securities for the time being approved of in that behalf by the Oireachtas as the Minister for Finance thinks proper.</P>
      <P>The scheme I should like established under this would be that by motion moved by the Minister for Finance, or possibly in some measure he may introduce, this Oireachtas would get notice that there were certain securities not technically of a trustee type which the Minister regarded as a proper fund for investment of moneys, say, of the Post Office Savings Bank type and that once the Dáil had approved of that general list of securities&mdash;I want publicity in this matter&mdash;thereafter on a particular occasion it would be for the Minister, inside that list of approved securities, to discriminate and say in which one or other of these he would permit Post Office Savings Bank deposits to be invested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do urge that this should be done. I would regard it as the start of a completely new movement if we could <Col N="1751" /> successfully get this amendment through the Dáil.  Up to date we have been very definitely hampered in this country by lack of capital for development. We have the situation that is very well known and has been talked of so much in the Dáil, that we have the combination in this country of two apparently opposite things&mdash;a superabundance of capital and at the same time a dearth for productive works of the capital which is required in this almost entirely undeveloped country. When these matters are talked about in Dáil Eireann we generally get the answer that there are trustee securities and that these are the particular funds in which the particular type of investment must be located, but when it comes to ordinary development matters, then, no matter what be the security, as long as it is not technically inside the trust security terminology, the only resource a person who wants to develop has is either to go to the commercial banks and submit to their rates or else the Government raises a loan giving a very definitely higher rate of interest than what would be provided if the various funds that we have from various sources could be applied to production. I regard this as merely a beginning. If we do take the step of putting Post Office Savings Bank funds into securities other than trustee securities, all the time giving the depositor the guarantee of the State so that he cannot lose, then a very good case could be made for such other cheap interest funds as Savings Certificates or trustee bank funds.  I ask the Minister to accept this as an indication that the depositor will have the security of the State behind him, and that it is considered desirable to use this particular type of cheap money, not because this is so cheap, but because it will lead on to the use of other very cheap interest types of money for the productive purposes of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite easy to see what Deputy McGilligan desires to do, but I am afraid that the amendment he proposes would not bring us much further, because it simply asks that to the powers in the Bill to invest in the trustee stocks of local authorities <Col N="1752" /> should be added the words &ldquo;or such other stocks or securities for the time being approved of in that behalf by the Oireachtas as the Minister for Finance thinks proper&rdquo;.  There is no machinery suggested in the amendment by which the approval of the Oireachtas could be sought, and, in the absence of such machinery, the only means by which the approval of the Oireachtas could be sought is by an Act of Parliament. I am quite ready to admit that this amendment could be amended so as to secure that the approval of the Dáil could be obtained to the tabling and passing of a motion.  But I think that, in regard to these Post Office deposits, what I propose in the Bill is reasonable, and, secondly, that it goes far enough, at least at the present time. I am not binding any of my successors not to do what is done in other countries.  I realise that in other countries.  Post Office Savings Certificates are pretty well available for general investment.  But I think that, even though that is so, the Deputy will find, if he examines their accounts, that Post Office funds and trustee savings bank and other funds are largely invested in Government securities and that very little of them are invested in the securities of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section, as it stands, definitely limits the powers of the Minister for Finance, without further legislation, to go further than to invest in the trustee stocks of local authorities.  At the present time, at any rate, I think that extends the Minister's power sufficiently to enable us to meet the difficulties that present themselves at the moment.  In the next section we can debate still further the powers with reference to the Local Loans Fund. That matter was questioned by the Deputy on the last day, and he will probably raise the matter again when the question of the power with regard to the utilisation of the Local Loans Fund comes up.  As the law stands, the Post Office Savings Bank funds can be invested in the Local Loans Fund, and money out of the Local Loans Fund can be lent to local authorities for the general productive work that local authorities are undertaking at present.  There is only a sum of <Col N="1753" /> £32,000,000 altogether in the Post Office Savings Bank.  Even if we took it all, or if it were all invested in the Local Loans Fund, we could not possibly meet the capital requirements for even a portion of our rehousing programme. There are other means by which the Local Loans Fund can be fed&mdash;by loans issued to the public, and so on.  It is to these means, rather than by the investment of the total holdings of the Post Office Savings Bank in the Local Loans Fund, that we must look to provide the money. I think that the Deputy's amendment adds nothing to the powers already in the Bill, because, even if it were accepted, it would require further legislation to give power to the Minister for Finance to invest in stocks other than the trustee stocks and the stocks in which he is already empowered to invest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not able to say, viewing the regular growth year by year of these funds up to 1939 and taking an average up to 1939, what would be the amount which should be held to meet the most abnormal excess of withdrawals over deposits?  I suggest that £250,000 would meet them at any time.  In any event, surely when the Minister brought in a Bill allowing power to pay some part of that £32,000,000 into the Local Loans Fund, he must have had some figures in his mind as to the furthest limit he would give himself in that connection.  What is that sum? If it is not the whole £32,000,000, is it even half of it?  All we are told is that £3,000,000 is so far invested and invested at such a rate that there is 2 per cent. profit being made on it. That is not helping very much the Local Loans Fund or the purpose to which the Local Loans Fund is applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister further says he does not want to be&mdash;I think I got the phrase correctly&mdash;&ldquo;binding a successor&rdquo;. There is nothing binding in this amendment.  It simply empowers the Post Office deposit moneys to be invested in certain stocks and securities other than trustee stocks.  It puts two further impediments in the way of a free investment in other stocks.  First of all, the Oireachtas must approve of a general list of such approved stocks and, after that is done, the Minister on any occasion may say he will not take any of them.  All I want is to put the Minister in a position that he can come before the Dáil and on a financial motion present a list of the securities which he would like to have ready for his consideration if a suitable opportunity occurred for the investing of this fairly cheap money.  All he gets <Col N="1755" /> then from the Dáil is the approval of X, Y and Z stocks being marked out for the possible investment of these moneys.  When it comes to the actual investment that is still under the control of the Minister, as if my amendment were accepted, the section would enable the moneys to be invested in &ldquo;such other stocks or securities for the time being approved of in that behalf by the Oireachtas as the Minister for Finance thinks proper&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The, list may be changed from time to time.  The Minister may withdraw some stock if he feels that it is not one in which he ever will put money, and if he does not think he should leave any other Minister for Finance in the position of considering that stock without coming to the Dáil for further approval.  He may diminish the list or add to it.  I do not know that we are advancing very far by doing that.  It merely means that we give an indication to the public that we are ready to do that in connection with the use of this cheapish money in something other than the ordinary type of security.  We are not giving a wide and free run to the Minister, nor are we taking away any discretion of his. We are asking him to go to the Dáil from time to time to have a list approved and on each occasion he can close down on the list.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that, if the list is there and if it is found that he is not investing in the stocks on the list, Deputies may question him about it. If he has a case for not investing, he can make that case on a Parliamentary reply.  That is one of the uses of the Parliamentary Question, to see that if an investment is available as a proper investment one may put a question as to why it is not being used.  However, there is nothing binding in this.  We are simply throwing open to him something in the way of better scope for the investment of these moneys.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the Local Loans Fund could be used and we found out from Deputy Mulcahy's interjection that it was a question of a £32,000,000 loan at 4¼ or 4½ per cent.  I pointed out the New Zealand example in housing, <Col N="1756" /> where this fund and also the Saving Certificates Fund lent money at 1¼ per cent. in order to carry on the housing programme.  I am not so sure about it, not having seen it in serious literature, but I have read in a newspaper article that in New Zealand they also used this type of money for one particular thing which was considered a useful type of investment, that is, carrying farmers over the lag between their incurring expenditure in getting crops into the ground and their obtaining a return from the purchasers of the crops.  In other words, the financing of farmers was done over that lag period between the purchase by them of the seeds and their getting of a return for something which they sold. That means that the Government was merely backing something, the history of which in New Zealand has shown was irregular.  The moneys went out and came in with the greatest irregularity, but the Government carried them over the difficult periods by the use of this particular cheapish fund at a very low rate indeed.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister may tell me that housing can be done by his particular proposal completely apart from the amendment here.  He may say that certain types of housing can be carried out.  Possibly that is so, but the type of housing campaign we hear on public platforms as contemplated could scarcely get through on £32,000,000, or even £16,000,000, if it were thought desirable to have another £16,000,000 in reserve.  I think another project should be taken in hand and speeded up, that is, the question of rural electrification, and, if there is money to be got for that, would it not be possible to plough this 2½ per cent. money into it rather than obtain money at 4½ or 5 per cent.?  I hope that very soon power will be taken to allow the Saving Certificate money&mdash;which is borrowed very cheaply now and is something which the State stands behind and guarantees&mdash;to be used to assist the farmers by the provision of cheap electricity. We will see how cheaply it works out. How far can the electricity be cheapened by obtaining the money at 2½ per cent. interest instead of at 4½ or 5 per cent.?  I do not know if the <Col N="1757" /> Minister will agree with my proposal that rural electrification might be financed out of these Post Office deposits. I suggest that all this type of saving could be used.</P>
    <P>About 12 months ago we set up a transport company, Córas Iompair Éireann, and gave it power to invest any moneys it had, not merely in trustee securities but also in such other securities approved of by the Minister as the company thought proper.  All we insist on in relation to Córas Iompair Éireann is that the Minister would approve of a selected list of securities other than trustee securities, and then we hand over to this outside company the discretion to invest the money in them.  I would not go so far in this amendment.  I say that the Oireachtas should approve of a select list of securities and the Minister could decide on each occasion the security which he would use.  I think that is very reasonable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened very attentively to the argument produced by Deputy McGilligan in support of his amendment and while I am quite in favour of what is behind the amendment I would point out to the House and to him that I cannot quite follow his reasoning.  There is an authority which decides which securities shall be trustee securities and that authority decides occasionally also which trustee securities shall no longer be trustee securities.  Would it not be far better to leave the making of trustee securities by description to the particular authority rather than have this House put in the position of being the final arbiter as to what security shall be a trustee security?  If Deputy McGilligan's amendment were accepted, this House would have to determine which was a proper security for the investment of Post Office money and if it were dealt with in the manner suggested it would be tantamount to being put as a trustee security.  Deputy McGilligan forgets that this has more relation to the Government outside of mere Post Office money.  The local authorities who build houses are subsidised in their interest charges from something like 40 per cent. up to 50 per cent. depending <Col N="1758" /> on the particular type of house built. So this House is going to say that the corporation is not going to be allowed to borrow money at a high rate of interest when this House in fact has to subsidise those rates up to as much as 60 per cent.</P>
      <P>I feel that 2½ per cent. is not the best borrowing point for the purpose of having it taken from the collecting institution, in this case the Post Office, and then farmed out to the different local authorities, because you must add charges which will make that interest high.  That was why, on the Second Reading, I pressed the Minister as far as I could to consider going a step further by removing the ceiling appertaining at the moment to Post Office deposits, so that you could try to attract into the Post Office not money on deposit at 2½ per cent., but money on deposit at a slightly higher degree than that accorded to depositors by joint stock banks.</P>
      <P>I have every sympathy with the point of view expressed by Deputy McGilligan. There might be a way found whereby the savers of money in this country would place it so that the money would find its way into use in the State rather than follow the course that has been followed up to the present when it was, by an old Act of Parliament, invested outside and it was of no benefit to the community except in so far as there was a slight profit, if you like, on the investments of the Post Office.</P>
      <P>I feel that it comes down to what Deputy Norton has in mind&mdash;how much money is, in fact, available and how much money can the local authorities get?  At the moment there is a sum of £3,000,000 on loan, by way of local loans to local authorities.  There is a difficulty in getting back the bulk of that immediately.  What we should concern ourselves with is, that while the process of getting it back again may be long, we should endeavour to attract into this Government institution larger sums of money which would become available in substantial amounts for local authorities, in the first instance, for what may be immediately essential.</P>

I cannot see anything happening other than a continuation of the existing position. I think we should let this Bill go through, because it breaks with the past.  I congratulated the Minister on making a departure, and I believe it is probably the first of such steps that he will take.  It would be wise to go slowly in this matter.  We will need very substantial sums, not only for the Dublin Corporation, but for authorities whose loans can be met in the manner adopted by the corporation.</P>

      <P>The Bill says it can <Col N="1760" /> only be invested in trustee securities, One trustee security would be where a local authority, such as the Dublin Corporation, issues stock and the Post Office can buy that stock.  To that extent the Bill would become operative. What Deputy McGilligan wants to do is to enable the authorities operating these funds to give loans other than in that way.  In that connection the local loans have been brought in.  These are given to local authorities directly from the Department through the Local Loans Fund and it is not as if the local authority is handing back to the Government trustee stock.  I do not know whether I have made it clear how I relate the amendment to the Bill or the Bill to the amendment, but I think I have a perfect understanding of the difference between what the Bill proposes to do and what the amendment seeks.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, as approved.  One of the stocks or securities, as the Deputy said, would be some issue by the Electricity Supply Board.  They have no security in the nature of a trustee stock that we know of.  Now that we have a new departure with regard to the savings of the people in the Post Office, let us examine it carefully. We observed in the papers yesterday where the Dublin Corporation has received sanction to issue stock at 2¾ per cent. Deputy McGilligan laboured the point that we can get money at 2½ per cent. and I would like to point out that we will not, because, if we pay 2½ per cent., we have to take into consideration the cost of administering it, and I suggest the money cannot be loaned at 2½ per cent.</P>
      <P>There has to be an extra charge related to the cost of management, as is instanced in the difference between the local loans charges and the interest given to depositors in the Post Office.  There is 2½ per cent. given to the depositor and 4½ per cent. is charged to a borrower, and that represents a difference of almost 100 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1761" /> I am in favour of moving to the point where the State will be able to get the money from the people by way of loan at a cheap rate in sufficient quantities to enable it to develop schemes all over the country.  I am quite satisfied that this Bill is making a step in that direction and in view of the arguments adduced by Deputy McGilligan, I cannot see my way to agree with the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is some merit in Deputy McGilligan's amendment, but I think he must realise that it possesses certain evidences of feebleness. While it does direct the Minister's attention to the possibility of creating certain funds and designating them for investment for the purpose of municipal activities at low rates of interest, I am sure he will recognise at the same time that that is just an effort on his part to get money made available at a still cheaper rate.  If the Deputy had his way, he would probably move an amendment which would make money available for certain purposes without any of these tributes which capital exacts as the price of investing itself in nationally worth-while activities.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why, when we decide that a family living in a slum must be re-housed under decent, Christian circumstances, one of the first things we have to consider is the price we will pay for the money with which to build a decent house.  The whole mentality seems to be wrapped up in the belief that, before you can take a person out of a disease-ridden tenement, you have to clear your mind on where you will get the money, the paper credits, to build a decent house for that person.</P>

      <P>As against Deputy McGilligan's point of designating certain savings directed into a particular channel as the type of savings which might be utilised to finance certain types of municipal activity, I want to put it to him that we will get to reasonable perfection in the matter only when we take our stand on the principle that if we want to do a nationally worth-while thing, we ought to do it by the issue of State credits&mdash;that the State should make money available for the purpose of building new houses, for the purpose of rural electrification, for the purpose of water and sewerage schemes, and for the purpose of national afforestation, because these are activities which, in the course of time, will yield a national dividend.  The State credits originally issued to finance them can in time be put against the original credits, and the credits wiped out, with the result that the national credit will be good again, and the national estate enriched by the activities of credits which have since been wiped out, having merely been used&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Deputy McGilligan's amendment, which says: &ldquo;Take this cheap money at 2 per cent. or 2½ per cent.&rdquo;  I say that that is cod, that Deputy McGilligan is aiming at that only as something better than the present position, and that the real solution is to let the State issue the credits to finance these activities. What I am rather surprised at is the <Col N="1764" /> reluctance of the Minister, in view of the past of Fianna Fáil, to do something of this kind.  In the salad days of the Party, about 1931-32, they travelled the country and told the people that if they went into office they would produce an absolute revolution from the point of view of preventing the banks from almost giving away Irish money for the purpose of investment in British securities at extremely low rates of interest.</P>

We are told that this is a Bill to make money cheap, and when we seek to find out in what way the cheap money is to be made available, we are told: &ldquo;Switch the Post Office Savings Bank deposits to the Local Loans Fund and then out to the local authorities.&rdquo;  When we ask how much of the Savings Bank money is at present invested in the Local Loans Fund, we are told: &ldquo;About £3,000,000 out of £32,000,000.&rdquo;  We ask what rate of interest it is bearing and we are told 4 per cent. or 4½ per cent. That is the kind of scheme we may well be perpetuating in this Bill and I therefore do not see any cheap money in it at all.  I do not even see cheap money in Deputy McGilligan's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see cheaper money, but I see no cheap money in this Bill.  We have to consider in this connection that we have invested about £28,000,000 in British securities in the last six years at a rate of 1¼ per cent. interest.  If the banks here can pour out money for investment in Britain at a rate of 1¼ per cent., what is the difficulty in our making money available for useful Irish activities at a rate of 1½ per cent., which, I suggest, is a lower rate than we will get from the Bill, constructed as it is, or than we will get from Deputy McGilligan's amendment?</P>
      <P>It might be no harm to recall a statement by a former Minister for Finance. Speaking for the Fianna Fáil Party, he said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Even before that Party went into <Col N="1766" /> the Dáil its members had directed public attention to the dangers to which our people were exposed by reason not only of our attachment to sterling, but of the short-sighted policy of the Anglo-Irish banks in investing their depositors' funds in British securities.  The Free State Government under Mr. Cosgrave have been on the side of Britain; the Anglo-Irish bankers have been on the side of Britain; and the Currency Commission have been on the side of Britain.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I want to get back to that early phase, the phase when it was believed that the bankers were the villains of the piece and when the policy of shovelling out money at low rates of interest for investment in Britain was politically, economically and physically a mischievous policy. The other day I came across a cutting from the <i>Irish Press</i> in which they realised, some years ago at all events, the value of creating State credits for the purpose of financing housing, of making houses available for the people at low rates of interest.  In the course of what I regard as a very informative article in 1931 they said that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Low rates of interest are essential to the success of any scheme for the rehousing of the slum population, and low rents (without putting an unnecessary heavy burden on the community as a whole) are possible only on the basis of long-term <Col N="1767" /> loans.  Not until the Free State Government is prepared to place its credit at the disposal of the corporation (that is, the Dublin Corporation) is serious progress likely to be made in the abolition of the slums.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that is an endorsement of Deputy McGilligan and of the case that I have been endeavouring to make, that the Government should place its credit at the disposal of the local authorities so that out of the State-created credits the local authorities can attack the problem of the slums, the provision of water supply and sewerage schemes, and various other projects without having to pay the ransom which the investors of capital demand as the price of national progress.</P>

He should make up his mind that in our approach to the solution of the problems related to the necessity for housing our people, for providing water and sewerage schemes, for the development of an afforestation policy and for rural electrification these problems can only be effectively tackled when we decide that the investors of money are not going to be allowed to make these schemes particularly costly for the rest of the community, or to impede them by demanding financial ransom which cannot be justified, having regard to the ability of the State to create credits.</P>

    <P>I have often stressed the fact that we have two opposites in this country. We have the vast amount of money which the people who have saved money are willing to put into certain securities and to take a very small return out of it.  The Banking Commission talked about the £36,000,000 which the farmers&mdash;there may have been some shopkeepers as well&mdash;had on deposit at a small percentage.  Then there is the vast amount of money going into Savings Certificates.  That sum could have been greater if propaganda in connection with it had not been called off.  I have suggested that the actual rate paid on it is about 1½ per cent.  There is also the trustee bank money.  Those who have their money deposited in the Post Office Savings Bank are entitled to get 2½ per cent. on it.  The depositor is bound to get that unless the State collapses.  We have all this flow of cheap money, <Col N="1769" /> which has not been forced out of the people but which they have been able to save, and which they are disposed freely to lend at 1 per cent. on deposit or at an actual 1½ per cent. on Savings Certificates, or at some figure between that and the 2½ per cent. paid by the Post Office Savings Bank.  Why cannot we get the use of that money instead of doing what we are doing? The ordinary procedure for the State when it wants money is to go into the money market and borrow.  The old rate on such borrowing was 5 per cent., but the impact of the times has brought the rate down to an average of about 4½ per cent.  You have there, as I have said, the two opposites: the State requiring money and willing to pay anything between 4¼ and 5 per cent. for it, while there is an abundance of money which people are willing to lend at from 1 to 1½ per cent.</P>

      <P>Let us not be fooled by the Deputy's phrases in approaching this in a progressive way.  With regard to funds lodged in court and which the court has established as trustee securities, it is not liberal with regard to advancing money from these.  A security might still be on the trustee list and might for a period of years fail to retain its trustee position because it was not paying a dividend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The court list is certainly narrowing down almost to National Loan.  Take what happened during the emergency.  With a view to winning turf, the Government heavily subsidised a return on turf when it was quite clear that those who were engaged in producing turf and getting it sold could not possibly lose on it.  We had the amazing situation in the early stages of the war that local authorities had to run into huge overdrafts in order to pay men to get out the turf. The State could pay 5 per cent. commission to the people who lent money in order to finance the gap between <Col N="1770" /> getting the turf to Dublin and a return on it.  Not a single per cent. ought to have been paid for that except perhaps some small thing to remunerate the banks, for dealing with this completely new type of business. I do not think that sort of thing should be allowed if there is going to be turf development.  Unless we cheapen the production of national fuel by the application of cheap money, then it is going to be very dear.  If there is going to be little else in the way of fuel, people, of course, will have to buy it and therefore there must be a return on its production.  If the matter has to be dealt with under the auspices of the local authority, I do not see why those who have to incur a certain overdraft from time to time should not be helped to bear that overdraft.  They should not be thrown to the mercy of the commercial bank.  That is one thing.</P>
      <P>Why should this Dáil not take over the control of credit?  I am with Deputy Norton in that I hope, in the end, that is what will happen.  This is the first and a very faltering step.  I simply say in regard to this, here we have a certain situation; a certain number of depositors are willing to lend their money and willing to take 2½ per cent. for it.  I do not call that cheap money, as Deputy Norton says, but it is cheaper than money will be if people have to go to the money market and bargain and get it at 4½, 4¼, 5 per cent. or whatever it may be.  Why should not we say, &ldquo;In these favourable circumstances, we will think of a list of securities, on discussion here, after they are brought forward by the Minister for Finance,&rdquo; and tell him, there is a list that he can invest in, but we will not impose upon him the necessity at any time of putting the money in them?  We will let his judgement, with that of his responsible officials, operate behind that.  I think that is putting a very severe impediment upon the enlargement that I seek to get by this amendment.  But, of course, that is only the first step I should like to get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe then brings up the question of housing.  I find myself bewildered by what he says.  As far as I <Col N="1771" /> understand his viewpoint, it is this&mdash; the State subsidises house building and the State is very heavily subsidising the interest rates.  What are the interest rates?  Those that are got commercially, 5 per cent. and the Government subsidises that.  Whatever it is, call it 5 per cent. or anything, as long as it is above 2½ per cent., there will be less interest to subsidise if the Government can get it at 2½ per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we can get this step taken, I know very well we are on the verge of getting a decent situation with regard to the application of the abundant money in this country to the abundant amount of development that the country requires.  But the Deputy tells me that the Government is subsidising housing and subsidising the interest rates paid for moneys put into housing.  They will not require to subsidise to the same extent if they can get money at 2½ per cent. instead of 5 per cent.  Surely, that is the clearest thing possible.  I say, &ldquo;very good, let us then plough this into housing&rdquo;.  I also suggest it should be put into rural electrification.  The Deputy at that point says that the Electricity Supply Board have no securities.  Have they not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  I said they do not issue any securities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not issue securities.  I tried to get them that power, which would be a good thing for them to have, on the occasion of the last measure that was brought forward. I thought it would be a very valuable thing for them.  What is their security?  The State is behind them and, at the request of the State, the Electricity Supply Board are embarking <Col N="1772" /> on what is, on the ordinary interest rates, an uneconomic proposition.  They are going to develop electricity for sale in the rural areas.  It is agreed by anybody who has considered the problem that you cannot produce electricity, to be sold economically, at such a rate as will attract the farmers to go in for electricity.  The State is going to subsidise the rate at which the produced electricity will have to be sold.</P>
      <P>Very good.  Let us approach it from the other end again.  How are the State going to get the money for rural electrification?  Either through this sort of fund or the trustee banks money, or the Savings Certificates money or the moneys lying at deposit rate.  Or else they will go to the people who own money, the people who have made money fast and fat in all sorts of irregular ways during the war and we are going to establish these people as the new reigning money families and if we want money for development we are going to say to them: &ldquo;We have a lot of money offering at 1½ per cent. and 2½ per cent., but we would rather give you gentlemen 5 per cent. for the loan of your illgotten gains that you made during the war.&rdquo;  Those people who have reached this high pinnacle of financial stability are going to be made the masters of this country, undeveloped as it is.  I think we can impede those people by using this cheap money.  I suggest that we should at least get it down to the rate of 2½ per cent., or if administrative costs have to be added, at 2¾ per cent. It is better than what has been done &mdash;the 4¼ at which money is lent at the moment.</P>
      <P>I do not see how there can be any objection to this matter.  Deputy Norton puts a general point to me, which I think impinges on my amendment, but goes much wider.  I agree thoroughly with what Deputy Norton says but the Deputy must understand my position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>And the House must understand it.  I am proposing one particular amendment.  If I say the Minister should put this money into <Col N="1773" /> stocks and securities of an approved type&mdash;or into stocks and securities which he would create himself, I am quite certain the amendment would be ruled out of order because it would be imposing a charge on the State.  I cannot do that because of the way the financial machinery works, but I can use this as a stimulus to the Minister to try to get him to take this very small step, after which we may get something better and wider and more liberal done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Norton.  It is not merely the question of the moneys in the Post Office Savings Bank.  We have the trustee banks.  We have the Savings Certificates.  We have the vast amount of money lent to the banks, to be carried there.  I should say it would be very soon, after what has happened in England, that no percentage of interest will be paid on deposits&mdash;no percentage at all. Whether that will make a change in our farming community or not, I do not know, but they have been content for years to lend big sums of money, getting 1 per cent.  It is not that we are forcing people to take 1 per cent. They are very content to take 1 per cent.  I was told, when I asked before, of other people who sat in the Minister's place: &ldquo;You must remember it was short-term money, and the money is to be there at call.&rdquo;  My answer to that all the time has been that if there were a very simple clause in the Central Bank Bill, or some other financial Bill, saying that in respect of any of these moneys there is a State guarantee all the time, at that point, I think, without any question of conscience arising, any question of using money for a different purpose from that for which it was lent, you can use the money as long as the State is there to give the man his money if and when he calls for it.  We know well he is not going to call for it.  There is, as has been observed by all economists, a statistical regularity about all these amounts of money and the rate at which they are taken out.  In this country, while the country has been getting poorer and poorer, while people are flying from it, while disease is growing, and, apparently, according to <Col N="1774" /> the measure we were discussing to-night, dirt is growing&mdash;dirt and verminous and unhealthy conditions&mdash; while all that is there, the other thing that is occurring is an accumulation of idle money through all these forms. When we set out to try to do something to relieve all these things in the nature of poverty, disease and degradation of all types we adopt the well-known old course of going to the money market to see if we can get money at 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>I want to get away from that altogether. I go one step further with Deputy Norton.  We have the example given to us during the war, and people are not going to forget what happened during the war; they are going to ask, and inquire into the answer, why a particular thing that is possible during a war situation is not possible for the aggregate conditions of peace. We found the State creating credit and the State saying to the banks: &ldquo;That is the money that we have made and we are going to let you circulate it, but we are not going to pay you the 1, 2 and 3 per cent. that people were supposed to get because the old theory was that you only got money by saving; that is to say you tightened your belt with regard to something you might spend money on.  If you did not spend it for amusement or consumption, you got something for it.  We know very well that for years back there has been far more money created than the entire wealth of England and America. That money was simply manufactured and handed out to the banks to be circulated, but they did not get 5 per cent., or even 2 per cent.  They got administrative costs.  One of these days we will rouse ourselves to the situation that these peace problems will have to be dealt with and, as long as you can avoid any question of inflation by very seriously increasing your amount of money over and above the amount of commodities that can be purchased for that money, then it is easy enough to manage the credit situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to follow Deputy Norton and Deputy McGilligan into the discussion of credit and so on. All I can say to Deputy McGilligan is this, that there is no intention to pay <Col N="1775" /> 5 per cent. for money.  I think this country is entitled to get money at the same rate of interest as other countries which are no more credit-worthy, let us say, than this.  There are a couple of points on which I want to correct both Deputy Norton and Deputy McGilligan in relation to the Post Office Savings Bank funds which you, Sir, remember we started to discuss some time ago.  The rate of interest that we pay to Post Office depositors is 2½ per cent.  There is no means by which we can invest that money at 1¼ per cent. and keep that particular fund afloat.  We have to get the 2½ per cent., plus, if we want the fund to be self-supporting, whatever administrative charges are necessary. The administrative charges at the moment are fairly high because there is a very big daily turn-over in the Post Office funds and they are at call.</P>
      <P>It is true to say that the money is guaranteed by the State and that, under no circumstances, will anybody lose the money put in, as long as the State is sound.  But it is also true that the first and immediate guarantee for the fund is the securities in which it is invested.  They have to be invested to give 2½ per cent., plus administration expenses.  The reason why a very much greater proportion of them is not invested at the moment in home securities is that, during the fantastically rapid growth of these deposits in the last five years, the output of home securities offering was very small indeed.</P>
      <P>This State has increased its debt since the beginning of the war by £16,000,000.  Had we been going into debt at the rate of neighbouring countries during the last five or six years, we would have been going into debt at the rate of £194,000,000 a year.  We increased the debt by only £16,000,000 altogether; so that these Post Office Savings Bank funds could not have been invested in an increasing State debt as those of other countries were, and, as there were no home securities offering, they were invested outside. That is the sum total of the reason why there is such a large percentage invested outside rather than inside the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1776" /> Deputy McGilligan wants to add to the list of securities in which these funds may be directly invested.  There is already a respectable list of securities in which they can be invested, all guaranteed as to principal and interest, or issued directly in the form of State loans.  You have the various Irish loans that were issued: The Second National Loan, the Third National Loan, the Conversion Loan, the Financial Agreement Loan and so on, in all of which portion of the Post Office Savings Bank funds is invested.  Then you have a series of Land Bonds; you have Ways and Means advances to the Exchequer; advances to the Local Loans Fund; and the Agricultural Credit Corporation Guaranteed Mortgage stock.  Of course, that stock is guaranteed, as Deputies know, as to principal and interest by the State, but it is re-lent to the farmers of the country for improving their farms.  Then you have the 4 per cent.  Irish Sugar Company Guaranteed Debenture Stock, guaranteed by the State.  A block of that stock is held on behalf of the Post Office Savings Bank funds.  Then you have the Telephone Capital Advances, also, of course, guaranteed by the State.</P>
    <P>This list of funds, plus the funds that I am adding in this Bill, that is, the trustee stock of local authorities, in my opinion gives us sufficient elbow room to invest the Post Office Savings Bank funds.  Deputy McGilligan said that it is only putting the toe into the water.  If you do not put your toe into the water you sometimes get an awful shock, and I believe that this step goes sufficiently far to enable us to use the small savings of the people that are invested in the Post Office Savings Bank for the building up of the State, as far as they will go.  We are already able, through the Local Loans Fund, apart altogether from this amendment, to lend money for the building of houses, for sewerage works and so on, directly through the Local Loans Fund to the local authorities. We have the powers, as I have said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hardly the nail of my toe.  On the question of what the Post Office Savings Bank funds can do here as against that done in other countries, I want, first of all, to say to Deputy McGilligan that, if the New Zealand Government are lending money out of their Post Office Savings Bank funds at 1¼ per cent., they are subsidising the Post Office Savings Bank funds in order to do it or adding to the total.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>New Zealand had Savings Certificates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get this right. I have here from the latest New Zealand Year Book the information that the deposit rates in New Zealand on Post Office Savings Bank funds or deposits are 2½ per cent. up to £500, 2 per cent. from £501 to £2,000, and no interest for amounts in excess of £2,000.  These rates of interest have been altered downwards: they are lower than they were in 1942 when they stood at 3 per cent. up to £500 and 2½ per cent. and nil in the other cases. New Zealand cannot invest the money out of those funds at 1¼ per cent.  They have other funds&mdash;the Central Bank and so on&mdash;and they must have a sort of composite fund into which perhaps the Post Office Savings Bank funds are fed at 2 per cent. or over it, and the fund draws on other sources at rates of interest so much below 1¼ per cent. that it enables the two funds to average out at 1¼ per cent.  However, we could not directly from this fund do <Col N="1778" /> anything like that, as 2½ per cent. is what we pay.</P>
      <P>In certain countries the Post Office Savings Banks pay no interest. Deputy Norton adverted the other day to the Post Office postal cheque, which rendered possible the payment by cheque from one Post Office account to another.  In those countries in regard to that particular fund there is no rate of interest, that is, the depositor gets nothing.  A service is offered, of course, in that the money is safeguarded when it is deposited, instead of being kept at home and subject to loss by fire or other accident.  The depositor puts it in the Post Office Savings Bank fund and it is kept safely and he can get it and draw it by cheque, but the depositor gets no rate of interest on it. Here we pay 2½ per cent. and the money is payable on demand.</P>
      <P>It is the desire for liquidity before the war in regard to these Post Office Savings Banks which brought about the situation in which there was roughly half invested at home and half abroad in easily marketable securities. The situation to-day is that there is 75 per cent. of these funds invested abroad, not for the purpose of securing liquidity but because there were no home securities offering in which they could be invested.  If the securities are offering, we might get down to the 50 per cent. or maybe we could have a system, which I think they have elsewhere, by which you would have only a certain portion of the funds payable on demand and the others put into some type of bond which would be cashable like Savings Certificates and would only earn the full rate of interest over 12 years and be cashable prior to that date only with some of the interest deducted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, at the moment we have this £32,000,000 payable on demand and earning 2½ per cent. and we have to take cognisance of that situation.  By doing what we propose in this Bill, I think we are providing ample opportunity for investing the small savings of the people, which are in the Post Office Savings Bank, in development works of various kinds.  I think this step is sufficient to enable us to meet <Col N="1779" /> the need of finding home investments for these funds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is wrong about that and about the Commissioners. The funds of the Post Office Savings Bank since its inception in 1923 <Col N="1780" /> are invested by the Department of Finance here directly in any security issued either by our own Government or by the British Government or guaranteed by our own Government.  The practice before that date, before the Post Office Bank was taken over in 1923, was that those funds were invested by the British National Debt Commissioners and that practice obtained in relation to the Trustee Savings Bank funds, which is a different, a rather private organisation and not a Post Office organisation.  The Trustee Savings Bank funds were sent on to the British National Debt Commissioners until 1940, when an end was put to it in the Finance Act.  Since that date the Trustee Savings Bank funds are paid over to the Post Office Bank and they get an extra ? per cent.; they get two seven-eights per cent. from the Post Office Savings Bank Fund.  In 1923 an end was put in regard to the Post Office Bank funds, and in 1940 in regard to the Trustee Savings Bank funds, to sending the money to the National Debt Commissioners.  The Deputy was quoting, on the last occasion, certain statements that our Post Office Bank funds were invested in 1938 in Turkey and elsewhere.  That might have been true in regard to Trustee Savings Bank funds, but it was not in regard to the Post Office Savings Bank funds, and it is not true in relation to any of the £32,000,000 about which we are talking.</P>
      <P>There was one matter about which the Deputy questioned me the last day and I want to refer to it to-night. He said as regards our Savings Certificates, that the interest we have to pay on those Savings Certificates averages 1¼ per cent.  In fact up to 1938-39 it averaged 4 per cent. and this year it would average around 3 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand why the Minister is not in a position to give the House some indication as to what he is going to lend money for&mdash;at what rate he is going to lend money on which he has already guaranteed 2½ per cent. interest.  This is a vital matter so far as the Bill is concerned. I worked out some statistics as to what the effect of interest charges on house rents will be.  The Minister and Deputy Briscoe might be interested in the results.  Take a house under the present subsidy scheme which costs £600, repayable over 35 years and with a State subsidy of two-thirds on the first £350 expended.  You will find that that house can be let at a weekly rent of 10/-.  If you have a loan over a period of 60 years instead of 35 years, the house can be let at 8/6 a week&mdash; that is, assuming the money is borrowed at 2 per cent. interest. Suppose the house costs £600 and the money is borrowed at 4 per cent. and is repayable over a period of 35 years, the rent which you will have to charge, with a subsidy of two-thirds on the first £350, will be 12/- a week.  If the money <Col N="1782" /> is repayable at 4 per cent. over a period of 60 years, the rent will be 10/8.</P>
      <P>Let me make some comparisons.  If you borrow £600 at 2 per cent. over 60 years and the State gives a two-thirds subsidy on the first £350, the rent of the house will be 8/6 a week.  If the same sum is borrowed at 4 per cent., the rent will be 10/8 a week, so that in fact by borrowing at 4 per cent. instead of at 2 per cent. you make the tenant pay an additional 2/2 a week over a period of 60 years.  That represents an increased rent chargeable to the tenant because of the fact that the money was borrowed at 4 per cent. instead of at 2 per cent.  If anybody suggested that a Bill should be passed in this House increasing rents by 25 per cent., there would be an outcry in the country, but if we borrow money at 4 per cent. to build a house when money can be got at 2 per cent. or credits created carrying no per cent. we are doing the very same as if we were to pass a Bill increasing rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let Deputy Briscoe and the Minister put themselves in the position of a tenant.  The local authority borrows money at 4 per cent.  It is then compelled to charge the tenant 10/8 a week rent.  If the State would give money at 2 per cent., or credits at nothing per cent.&mdash;but let us take 2 per cent. for the purposes of the argument&mdash;the tenant could have the house at 8/6 a week over a period of 60 years. If the difference is approximately 2/- a week or £5 a year, then for 60 years the tenant pays an additional £5 a year because money had to be borrowed at 4 per cent. instead of 2 per cent.  Why should a tenant be compelled to pay £300 in interest charges in the form of increased rent over 60 years because the local authority must pay 4 per cent. instead of 2 per cent. for the money?  If the Minister lends money through the Local Loans Fund, and assuming the money is utilised in the manner I have indicated, and that is, under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, the effect will be that tenants will be compelled to pay, on a £600 house, subsidised on the present <Col N="1783" /> basis, a rent of 2/2 a week more for 60 years if the money is loaned at 4 per cent. than they would have to pay if the money were loaned at 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is because interest charges play such a vital part in the building and renting of houses that it is important the local authority should get the money from the State at no interest charge beyond the normal cost of keeping the credit accounts.  It seems to me that when you face the problem of housing people decently the first consideration ought to be to build the house, the second to let the house at a reasonable rent well within the tenant's capacity to pay, and the third that it should be the least possible rent consistent with making provision for ultimately wiping out the credit created by the State.  It is an intolerable position that when you try to take people out of slums, out of the mud-walled cabins throughout the country, you first have to see at what rate people will loan you money to do vital social work of that character.</P>
    <P>I do not think this Bill will make any great contribution towards making money available for house building or other worth-while national activities. It is because I do not believe that, that I think the Minister ought to be tempted, if not on this Bill, at least on some other Bill which ought to see legislative light at an early stage, to embark on a policy of creating State credits for the creation of sound national assets like housing, rural electrification and water and sewerage schemes, so that we can elevate these activities to a plane on which we can say: &ldquo;These are so essential to national life that invested capital is not going to get a ransom off them and the public weal demands that the State's credit-creating capacity should be made available to provide these with expedition and at the lowest possible price, and that their provision will not be thwarted by having to pay capital's levy for lending the money.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy McGilligan's amendment. The Minister has, I think, perhaps been made afraid of it by all the gigantic schemes which have been <Col N="1784" /> talked of in connection with it.  Let us get back to the original idea, to the purpose for which this Bill was intended, that is, to provide temporary flanking for the Dublin Corporation while it is getting over a month or two of financial difficulty.  The immediate intention of this Bill is to enable the Minister to make a loan, at a suitable and suggested rate of interest, to the Dublin Corporation over a short period to enable it to carry out a conversion at the end of the year and to avoid the necessity of having to borrow £1,250,000 from the Bank of Ireland at 3¼ per cent. for housing.  It is merely designed to provide protective flanking for the Dublin Corporation for a couple of months.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicates that the Bill as it stands will enable him to assist directly out of Post Office Savings Bank funds only Dublin and Cork Corporations. There are other small things which require to be done, and, as the Minister is facing up to the question at all, I think that, without looking at the gigantic things which might be done with £32,000,000 in the Post Office Savings Bank, if he looks around, he will see that there are a number of small things which could be done, and could be done without any strain on any of the Post Office Savings Bank funds and which would be a very definite relief to people who, under their stresses, are doing rather bad things at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of overdrafts for turf work by the county councils has been mentioned and, at the same time, the Minister suggests that, while 2½ per cent. is being paid on deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank, the overhead charges and cost of management of this fund are rather high.  A Deputy of his Party, when we last discussed this measure, said that the cost of running the Post Office Savings Bank was £76,000, and if we add that amount to the 2½ per cent. on £32,000,000, the Minister will find that the cost of handling the Savings Bank and of paying interest on deposits is only 2.7 per cent.  If he looks, then, at the condition of local authorities struggling under the weight of substantial overdrafts for the carrying out of turf operations, he will find that, on 31st <Col N="1785" /> March, 1945, the total amount of county council overdrafts was £595,000, on which they were paying 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Corporation is being assisted by this flanking Bill so that it can see whether it cannot get from the public £1,250,000&mdash;a fairly reasonable amount of money&mdash;at 3¾ per cent. at 97, which works out at about 2.83 per cent.  If we are working here to assist the Dublin Corporation to get a loan for housing and conversion purposes at 2.83 per cent., and, if by adopting this amendment of Deputy McGilligan's, we can step in and help the country councils, struggling under the burden of more than £500,000 overdraft for turf cutting&mdash;on 31st March this year it was £595,000 and, on 31st March, 1944, £647,000&mdash;and paying 4 per cent. on that amount, it is almost criminal on our part not to do so.</P>
    <P>I have instanced already to-day the steps by which some of the county councils, with the vigorous support of the Government, propose to try to recoup themselves and their finances for some of these costs.  The North Tipperary County Council has an overdraft of £14,360, on which it pays, approximately, £572 per year.  It is dragging people 20 miles to the court at Nenagh and putting heavy law costs on them in order to squeeze £100 out of them.  If the Minister, on the basis of his cost of 2.83 per cent. interest and administration costs, could take up that sum of £595,000, he would save a payment to the banks of one-third of the total amount.  The total amount at present paid by the county councils is £24,000, and £8,000 could be saved by a stroke of the pen if the Minister, leaving all the bigger possibilities out of his mind, would accept Deputy McGilligan's amendment and put himself in a position to assist the county councils as he proposes to assist Dublin Corporation and as he could assist Cork Corporation.  He could save the county councils £8,000 a year on the moneys they are paying for their turf overdrafts by accepting the amendment.</P>

      <P>May I call the Minister's attention to the general discussion we had on the Second Reading of the Bill?  Reference was made to the sum of £800,000.  The actual figure is £780,502, in so far as it relates to the holders of the 5 per cent. stock, which falls due for redemption on the 1st January.  But that is not the full story so far as the Dublin Corporation is concerned, because there are mortgage loans also due for redemption, and in some cases the actual dates have expired.  These amount to £300,000, so that the actual accommodation which the corporation needs is £1,122,000, and not £782,000 as was mentioned during the debate.  I want to know from the Minister will the accommodation which he proposes to give the corporation under Section 3 apply to the mortgage loans.</P>

      <P>May I repeat the question I raised earlier?  Am I to understand that the Minister was waiting for the corporation to make the necessary inquiries with regard to the differences that might lie as between stock and mortgages?  If the Bill is now finally passed, that stage will have ceased.  Due to the fact that a good deal of ambiguity has surrounded this Bill in its relations to the Dublin Corporation, I want to make it perfectly clear that the corporation did not seek this assistance, and that they had their own arrangements whereby more favourable terms would have been open to them to liquidate their liabilities. Since, however, the Bill was introduced, we naturally wanted to be assured that, because of circumstances over which we had no control, similar arrangements might be available to meet the situation with which the corporation was faced.  I may appear to the Minister to be unduly persistent on this question, but as I said, this is not something of our making.  I want to safeguard the corporation to the extent that while provision is now being made it will be open to them to apply for facilities in regard to the £780,000.  Speaking on behalf of the corporation, I would ask that at least similar facilities should be granted in regard to the £300,000 covered by the mortgage loans which actually have been paid.  I am asking that the corporation will not be placed in a position less favourable than that which would have accrued to them under their own arrangements.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan has spoken in the way he has done because I take it all through the discussion the Minister was playing to help the Dublin Corporation to get <Col N="1789" /> more favourable terms than otherwise they thought they would get.  I admit that we are left in a state of ambiguity as to what the Minister is actually going to do.  Nevertheless, rightly or wrongly, I give him credit for that particular type of intention.  Perhaps, there may be something to be said for Deputy O'Sullivan's restraint in discussing Dublin Corporation matters here.  I think we have reached the point when we should not hesitate to discuss every single detail of financial matters because I think the more we bring them into the open and discuss them, the more we are likely to get an understanding on them, as well as of the approach of each one of us to them.  It is essential that there should be a common understanding as to what our various approaches are to the question of getting capital for public business and paying for it, as well as in regard to the capital for investment in ordinary industrial and commercial business outside.</P>
      <P>If we here are not prepared to go into the details of these things, then decisions are going to be taken by people in a secret way, without our knowing of them until we are presented with a <i>fait accompli.</i>  We are told now that, as a result of the passing of this Bill, the capacity of the Dublin Corporation to get financial assistance is being worsened rather than assisted.  I hope the Minister will be able to assure us that there is nothing in the fears expressed by Deputy O'Sullivan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any Deputy who can say, with any degree of certainty, what interest charges the money advanced under this measure will carry.  I think that on all stages of the Bill the Minister has emphasised the fact that the first charge which will have to be met is the 2½ per cent. on the moneys in the Post Office Savings Bank.  If you add administrative charges plus other charges I can only arrive at the conclusion that any money advanced for the building of houses in future will be at 4 per cent. I should like the Minister at this stage, or in the Seanad, to give some <Col N="1790" /> clear indication as to what the interest charges will be.  There is no use in going into all the details that have already been discussed in regard to the effects of interest charges on the financing of housing, especially its effect on the rents that would have to be charged.  It is too big a question and one which I would prefer to discuss around the table.  Deputy Norton referred to the difference in rents where interest charges would be 4 per cent. as against 2 per cent.  On that point I would put a question to Deputy Norton.  What would be the benefit to the tenant of having an interest rate of 2 per cent. if the cost of the house increased by £400?  The house would then cost £1,000, and if £650 of that had to be financed by the council, even at 2 per cent. rate, that would make the rent very high.  However, we cannot discuss that point.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear, in justice to all the parties concerned, including the Government, that in addition to interest charges, we have to consider other factors and until we do consider them and endeavour to reduce the cost of building&mdash;it can be reduced in many respects&mdash;we will make no real contribution to the housing problem.  Again I would respectfully ask the Minister to let us know the rate of interest, whether it be 3½, 4 or 4¼ per cent., because at the moment no Deputy can say what the interest charges will be in regard to housing.</P>

      <P>The Dublin Corporation last September paid off their mortgage loan of £300,000 or thereabouts.  It was falling in for redemption and they paid it off.  Out of the Local Loans Fund, at the moment, the Minister for Finance has power to issue local loans for almost any purpose but he had not the power to issue it purely for the redemption of stock and it was in order to put the Minister for Finance in such a position that this Bill was introduced.  I want to say that it is ridiculous for Deputy Martin O'Sullivan to say that anything that has been done is putting the Dublin Corporation in a worse position to borrow. That is simply not true.  If the Deputy makes that allegation, as he has done <Col N="1791" /> for the second time, I want to say that the Dublin Corporation, through the Finance Committee, proposed to borrow money in such a way and at such a rate of interest that I thought neither the interest of the ratepayers of Dublin nor of the general community was being served by them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1792" /> I referred to this matter on Second Reading.  I believe the valuation limit of £25 is altogether too low.  It may have been desirable in the first stages to put down a limit of £25 but, as the Principal Act has been in operation for a number of years and as it has proved very beneficial to small holders and farmers generally in the country districts, I believe the time has come to extend its operation so as to bring in additional holders.  As I pointed out, there is still a considerable number of holders whose valuation is over £25, who are living in houses urgently requiring reconstruction and who have not the necessary financial resources to carry out reconstruction without State assistance of some kind.  This amendment, if accepted, will go a long way, though not the full distance, to meet the grievance of a large number of people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment to the extent that there should be some alteration in regard to the sum of £25.  Deputy Cogan has said that his amendment, if accepted, will go some distance to meet the necessary requirements.  But surely the Minister is now satisfied from the reports that he has had from his own staff on the whole question of this valuation figure that it is time that the figure should be eliminated altogether, so that any farmer getting his livelihood from the pursuit of agriculture should have the same facilities as everybody else.  This means test, because that is what it really is, provides that a person of under £25 valuation can get a grant to reconstruct his house, while a person with a valuation of £25 1s. cannot get it.  Of course, even if the Deputy's amendment were accepted by the Minister, a person with a valuation of £35 1s. could not get a grant.  There are a number of farmers who have big old houses on their farms which they cannot knock down, because they cannot afford to build new ones, and there is a valuation out of all proportion on these houses, which puts them beyond the limit laid down.  It is very hard to decide at what figure the grant should stop.  As I have said on previous occasions on this question, I think there should be no limit, and that the Minister <Col N="1793" /> should be able to certify for a grant to a farmer who is engaged in husbandry.  This is one of the best pieces of legislation that this Government carried through, but they have spoiled it, so to say, by cutting the buttons off it.  In their own interest, and in the interests of the people concerned, they should not only accept the amendment, but they should take out the valuation figure altogether and leave it that anybody engaged in husbandry can get a grant.</P>

      <P>I should like to make a small point in connection with that, because a considerable number of cases have come under my notice.  This qualification, of course, deals with the reconstruction of houses.  May I suggest that houses on farms valued over £25 are, generally speaking, much more likely to lend themselves to reconstruction than the houses on the smaller or lower valued farms?  That is one point. The other point is this.  Surely the aim behind all these Bills to assist housing is to see that houses generally in the country districts are improved. Whether a man has a £25 valuation or a £35 valuation, if you can get a house that is not now habitable reconstructed and made decently habitable by removing this restriction, I think it is only right that it should be removed.  May I say to my colleague, Deputy MacEoin, that I think that this is even worse than a means test, because it does not follow that a man with a valuation of £26 has more money than a man with a valuation of £24?</P>

      <P>Whatever merit there may have been in this amendment, I am afraid that the case which has been made for it by Deputy MacEoin and Deputy Morrissey has not helped Deputy Cogan. Deputy MacEoin supported the amendment on the grounds that, in his opinion, any farmer engaged in husbandry should have the same facilities as anybody else in regard to the reconstruction of the house which he owns.  If I were to apply that principle on the basis that the conditions enjoyed by the greater number of the people should apply also to the minority, then it seems to me the logical thing to do would be to wipe out this grant for <Col N="1794" /> reconstruction altogether.  If Deputy Cogan's amendment were carried, this provision would embrace more than 335,000 holdings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No&mdash;on every one of which there might be a house in respect of which the occupier is becoming the owner under the Land Acts with the help of very generous assistance from the State.  Now, if we were to say that every person who owns a house is entitled to get a grant of £40 or £45, if he wants to improve or reconstruct it, who will pay the grant?  Where is the burden of that great social measure which Deputy Morrissey spoke of, to fall?  It will fall on the backs of those who do not own a house.  The amendment proposes to extend beyond the limits of reason this excellent social measure in its original conception, of helping people who are in comparatively poor circumstances to reconstruct their houses.  It is now proposed that we should get to the anomalous situation in which, as I have said, people who do not own the house in which they live, who have to pay rent for the house in which they live, would be providing the finance to allow other people, who are fortunate enough to be property owners, to improve their living accommodation. In these circumstances I cannot see my way to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not spoken against the amendment. He has spoken against his own Bill.  If the Minister is to be logical, he should take this out of the Bill altogether, because everything he has said could be applied to the section almost with as great force as it can be applied to the amendment.  In that way which is peculiar to himself, the Minister has twitted us on the case made for the amendment.  May I say that it could not possibly be as weak as the case made against the amendment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the statement that these people who would benefit by this amendment have already got houses, I wonder would the Minister be prepared to consider <Col N="1795" /> the case of people who have houses which are unfit for human habitation? There is a large number of people with a valuation of over £25 who are living in houses which would be condemned by any medical officer of the Department. These people have not the money to improve their houses.  A £35 valuation is only a comparatively small holding: it is not a holding that a farmer could sell portion of to improve his house.  Very often, that type of farmer has not sufficient credit to obtain a loan and for that reason, having regard to the limited income of such people, I think the Minister should accept this amendment, unless he is prepared to consider an alternative, that is, that he would make this amendment applicable only to people who are really in houses unfit for human habitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would appeal again to the Minister to accept this amendment. On the Second Reading, I referred to the fact that under the Farm Improvements Scheme there was a certain valuation limit, farms over which would get no grant under that scheme.  I think I am right in stating that, after the first year's experience, the Minister for Agriculture came to the conclusion that he was defeating the object he had in view in introducing the scheme by having that valuation limit.  He extended it the following year, when the matter was brought up in the Seanad.  The result was that farmers with fairly large farms became entitled to grants through the medium of that scheme, thereby improving their lands and giving much-needed employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a mistaken idea in this country that no one should get anything but the little man.  There are big farmers giving employment to ten or 12 people, and if there is anything to spare they should get a little. There are certain people who are always paying out and who get nothing. They are not going to get anything, if we follow the Minister's statement that the people who do not own houses and thereby cannot get any grant so far as reconstruction is concerned <Col N="1796" /> are going to pay for the people getting these grants.  The Minister might as well say that the people who are continuously employed should not pay anything extra, if the Government were going to increase the unemployment grant, as that would mean subscribing moneys to other people, although they get no grant themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said it would not be fair that people who do not own houses and thereby could not come within this Bill in the matter of grants, should be asked to bear the cost of extending the valuation in order to enable the people to get this £40 grant to repair their houses.  I think that would be a rather selfish view, and that we should not get down to that narrow sphere.  My experience is that there are thousands of farmers whose valuation is over the limits stipulated in the Bill and laid down in the previous Acts and there is no gainsaying the fact&mdash;which every Deputy knows&mdash;that they are much poorer than some farmers who live on farms with a valuation of less than £25.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of luck and a question of families and so on. I could give many reasons for it.  You get the man with a £30 valuation who may have a family of seven or eight, while another with a £24 or £25 valuation may have only a family of two.  It is very easy to explain the difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can appreciate the Minister's difficulty, in that you cannot have money for everything, but I am supporting this amendment because of the experience gained as a result of the Farm Improvements Scheme and the change of mind by the Minister for Agriculture in the second year of that scheme's operation.  He saw that the scheme would not be the success he would like it to be unless he raised the valuation, so he brought in farmers over the limit and they were able to carry out very extensive drainage work.  I know one <Col N="1797" /> farmer in County Louth who got a fairly large grant and who put in special machinery&mdash;almost a real railroad through his land&mdash;and did the job in a very competent manner, giving employment to 15 or 20 men at a good wage.  I respectfully suggest that the Minister should agree to the amendment, if at all possible, and should make any changes he thinks necessary between now and the Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider this matter.  From our experience, the valuation of land is completely out of date, as the basis on which it was valued has now gone. In some portions of my constitutency you will find a farm that would carry seven cows has a valuation of £35 or £40, whilst in another portion you will find a farm carrying 14 cows with only a £20 valuation.  The basis is all wrong and is no longer a basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The valuation is completely wrong in all cases.  There is a lot to be said for the case made by Deputy Coburn and others for giving the man with a higher valuation a fair show.  I can see the reason very well, as I am meeting farmers every day of the week, in one side of the constituency, who have been working it out, and their position is that they are worse off.  They are mulcted in their rates, in the first instance, on the valuation basis, and now they are mulcted in any grants that the Department of Local Government has to give. I think it is an unfair position and one which the Minister certainly should reconsider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter has been urged before from these benches and this is not the time for cavilling at giving all farmers a fair show.  We are faced with this every day of the week in cases we put up to the Minister, for housing in particular. A man who applies and who has a valuation of £25 5s. is knocked out immediately, even though his circumstances may be bad and the amount of land he holds may be far less than the other farmer with under £25 valuation who gets the grant.  The <Col N="1798" /> Minister should either have revaluation or cut out the section altogether.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of my few remarks, I asked the Minister if he had any report from the inspectors upon this question.  If he says that he has not, I will accept his view.  If he has not, I would urge him to ask for an independent report from them. The inspectors have got ten or 12 years' experience, since the 1932 Act was passed, of the administration, and could give him very positive information which would be unprejudiced and unbiased and not partisan.  If he says that they have not reported, I appeal to him to ask for a report.  My information is that reports have been made from time to time that there have been houses reconstructed under the £25 valuation, in cases in which there was a considerable amount of wealth available, but because they were under that valuation they could go ahead; and that there were people at £35 and, I regret to say, at £45 valuation who could not reconstruct their houses, as they had very large families and were in a very poor condition.  They remain now as they were then and, from what I see around the country, I think it would be in the interest of the health of the country generally if this step were taken.  The farmer engaged in husbandry who has not the means to reconstruct his house and where, say, the county medical officer of health has certified it is in the interest of public health that his house be reconstructed, should be able to obtain a grant, no matter what his valuation is, so that he may be encouraged to go ahead with the reconstruction of his farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this amendment.  The class of agriculturists covered by the amendment happen to be nobody's children, under nobody's care, and, whatever benefits they may get from State schemes, they get nothing special to enable them to fall into the same category as the bigger farmers in the community, certainly so far as farm improvement schemes are concerned.  In the special schemes, the people who are living on the smaller holdings are excluded because the £25 limit applies.  So far as the people in this particular category are concerned, <Col N="1799" /> they are barely subsisting on farming and they are not able to put anything aside in the way of reserves to meet capital expenditure of the nature contemplated here.  If a man living on a holding with £25 or £30 valuation is a married man with a family, he is doing well if he is able to carry on, and I believe he could not do more than just carry on.</P>
      <P>These people form a class in the community that is entirely neglected so far as State assistance is concerned.  If there is a question of reconstruction which may involve a considerable amount of money, then that type of farmer simply has to put up with a bad dwellinghouse and his young family may have to be reared under very adverse conditions.  We all have experience of people in those circumstances. I do not think this proposal would involve a very big sum and I think the Minister would be well advised to consider the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">

I should also like to pay a tribute to the spirit in which the scheme has been carried out.  The spirit associated with the administration of those grants has been a very happy and helpful one right through and I think it is proper that that should be mentioned.</P>
      <P>I agree entirely with the speakers from various sides of the House who advocated some change in the direction outlined in the amendment.  Frankly, and without being in any way controversial, I do not think the Minister has made any strong case against the amendment.  My experience tells me quite definitely that there is a case for raising the valuation in connection with these reconstruction grants.  I warmly support the proposal and I think the Minister ought to give way on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I know them well; I know them in a county where a man who owns a farm of £35 valuation would be considered a big farmer and where people with that valuation do not think themselves poor.  The general argument seems to be very confused.  I have heard some of the most extraordinary statements made in support of the amendment.  We were told that we ought to abolish this means test.  I think it was Deputy MacEoin who first advanced that argument&mdash;I hope my recollection is not doing the Deputy any injustice.  He said that this was a means test and it ought to be abolished.  He said then that his general attitude would be this, that he thought that any man who owned a farm, and of course a farmhouse, and who was too poor to reconstruct it, should get a grant. How are we to ascertain whether a man is too poor to reconstruct or not unless we apply a means test?  The Deputy who, at the beginning of his speech, wanted us to abolish the means test, came round at the end to a position in which he wants us to give the grants entirely on the basis of a means test.</P>
      <P>Then we had Deputy Coburn.  He being a townsman is apparently more generous than anyone else.  He was arguing and drawing a false analogy between the circumstances with which the proposals in the Housing Act, 1932, are intended to deal, and the position under the Farm Improvements Scheme.  He said he did not see why the big man ought not to be helped as well as the small man, and he instanced the case of a large farmer in his constituency who employed 11 or 12 men.  If this farmer, employing 11 or 12 men, wanted to reconstruct or to improve his house, he was to get a grant of £45.  It seems to me that if a farmer who is in such a position that he can with profit to himself&mdash;and I am perfectly certain that he would not employ them otherwise&mdash;employ 11 or 12 men wants to make his house more comfortable, he ought to make it more comfortable at his own expense and not at the expense of the rest of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy then went on to say, in <Col N="1802" /> trying to justify the proposal that the limit of valuation should be increased from £25 to £35, that a man who owned a farm with a valuation of £35 might be worse off than a man who owned a farm with a valuation of £25, because the man with the larger farm might have a larger family.  If we are to give the grants on that basis, well and good.  I do not think that you, Sir, would allow me or any other Deputy to put down an amendment to this Bill which would change the whole basis of the grant, and instead of having entitlement to the grant based on the valuation of the house, it would be based on the size of the farmer's family in proportion to the valuation of the holding.  That might be a very logical way of dealing with it, but I do not think it would deal with the other man.  I do not think it could be applied fairly to the other man about whom Deputy Cogan was concerned, or to the man who owns a farm so large and of such a high valuation that he is in a position to employ ten or 12 men about whom, as I have said, Deputy Coburn was equally concerned.</P>
    <P>Then we have Deputy Corry's argument.  Deputy Corry said that in one district in his constituency or in his county he knew farms with a valuation of £35 which would carry only about seven cows, while, at the other end of his county or constituency, he knew farms with valuations of only £20 which were at least twice as good.  His method of curing that anomaly is to raise the limit to £35 to bring in the farm with a valuation of £35 in the overvalued end of his constituency, and, if his figures still hold good, to bring in, at the other end of his constituency, the farm which, if it had been valued on the basis of the first farm, would carry a valuation of at least £70.  It seems to me that that is not a reasonable or logical position, bearing in mind that all these grants have to be paid out of taxation and that you are taking, in the main, the moneys required to do this work from the pockets of people who do not own farms or houses at all.</P>

The maintenance of this nation is the common responsibility of us all and the townspeople have to help the farmers as the farmers have to help the townspeople. It is a joint concern in which we all cooperate and the main credit cannot be allotted to one type of citizen any more than to another.  We are all here in the one community bearing a common share of the community's burdens. What those who support the amendment ask us to do is to require the people who own nothing to provide the money to enable those who do own property, whether good, bad or indifferent, to improve their living conditions at the expense of the community as a whole.  As I said at the beginning, we had a social purpose to serve when these provisions were first included in the Housing Act.  The scope of these provisions must be kept within reasonable bounds; otherwise, as I have shown, the position becomes quite illogical and quite irrational and one which could not be justified by any sound argument.  For that reason, I am opposing it.</P>

He has told us that this nation is a co-operative concern, that the farmer should help the people in the towns and the people in the towns should help the people on the land. <Col N="1804" /> I accept that, but we have at present housing schemes for the workers in the towns under which the State contributes two-thirds of the entire cost of building, which may represent a grant of £200 or £300. Some of the people who benefit by these substantial subsidies are considerably better off than the farmers on whose behalf I am pleading here.  The Minister talks about these people having no property. The question of income in the modern world does not depend on ownership of property.  There are people who will derive benefit from the various housing schemes who have incomes of over £4, £5, £6 and £7 a week.</P>

      <P>If the Minister is acquainted with actual facts as apart from statistics, he will know that people have derived benefit from the various housing schemes who have incomes far in excess of £5 and £6 a week, which is an income far greater than what the farmer with £35 valuation can obtain from his holding. Therefore, on the basis of equity, as between one section of the community and another, farmers with valuations up to at least £35 are entitled to this modest reconstruction grant.</P>

      <P>I would again ask the Minister to take his mind back to the period of 1931, when he sat on the opposite side of the House, and appealed to Deputy Mulcahy, who was Minister for Local Government at the time, to do something for the agricultural community in the way of giving grants for the building or reconstruction of houses.  The Minister was then appealing to a man of stone or a man of iron.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Since then the tables have been turned and things have improved so far as the giving of decent grants for housing is concerned.  My argument in this case is that the <Col N="1805" /> valuation basis is all wrong.  It has been abandoned by every other Department in the State except the Minister's Department. It did apply to rural improvement grants for a short time, but the farmers succeeded in seeing that it disappeared.  It is about time, I think, that some of the old timers in the Minister's Department were brought up to date in this respect.  The Minister said that I was trying to open the door for large farmers.  That may be, but I am certainly trying to open a door for the unfortunate farmers whose valuations are on a basis of 35/- an acre and are living 17 or 18 miles from the nearest city&mdash;Cork.  I am trying to open the door for those farmers who are paying rates which are three times higher than the rates that their comrades on the other side are paying, and whose land will not carry any more cattle than theirs.  I am trying to open the door for them and to give them fair play.  The proposal here is simply piling an injustice on them.  It is bad enough for those unfortunate men to have to pay rates on this valuation without having the door closed against them with no hope of getting anything to enable them to repair the hovels in which they live.  They have no hope of getting any grant.  I say that is unfair and unjust, and I put it to the Minister that he ought to abandon that line when every other Department has given up this valuation test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that there were only about 380,000 farmers in the country. I admit that in the bad periods there were a lot of old bachelors and old maids knocking around the farmers' houses.  But the times have changed, and farmers are getting married and rearing families, so that you have not so many bachelors or farmeresses at the present time.  The population basis on the line that the Minister took is all wrong.  The farmers are now getting married as well as city people even though they may not be able to keep their families as well as the city men, to whom grants are given, men with incomes of £7 and £8 a week.  They are being well kept out of the farmers' pockets.  The Minister should reconsider the present <Col N="1806" /> state of affairs.  I appeal to him to be fair and Christian and give those unfortunate men some chance of having a decent house to live in.  In the rates they pay they have to provide their share to meet the cost of every new labourer's cottage that is built and of every non-municipal house provided in a village.  They have to bear the burden for everybody else, and surely the time has come when they should be given some little grant towards helping them to provide houses for themselves, especially when they have to provide houses for every other person in the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite evident from the line taken by the Minister in his opposition to this amendment that it is not the Minister for Local Government who is opposed to it but rather the hidden hand of the Minister for Finance.  I imagine that if it were only the Minister for Local Government who was opposed to the amendment and to the principle it contains, his approach to it would be completely different from what it has been.  The Minister, in his first or second speech, did not utter one word against the amendment that could not with equal force be used against the section. Everything that he said against the £35 could be said against the £25. There is no question but that this money was granted to improve housing in the agricultural areas.  The only reason why it is limited to £25 instead of £26, £36 or £46 is that that figure represents the amount of money available for these reconstruction grants. If that is the objection to the amendment, then it ought to be said that the state of the finances of the country will not permit of reconstruction grants to anyone with a valuation higher than £25.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think Deputy Corry has helped this amendment or the case that he sought to make in his appeal to the Minister by talking about what the farmers are doing for the people in the towns, about the people in the towns living on the backs of the farmers.  Unfortunately, it is true that we have people in this country who do not own a house or even a room.  We <Col N="1807" /> saw a case reported in the newspapers some short time ago where the children in a family had to be sent to an industrial school, not because the parents were not able to support them or to pay rent for a house or a room, but because they could not get either a house or a room.  Deputy Corry talked a lot about all that the Government had done in the way of providing, as he said, decent grants for housing, and that all that had been done by Fianna Fáil.  I would like to take the Deputy's mind back to the period of the foundation of this State, when one of the first things done by <Col N="1808" /> the Government of the day was to provide loans and grants for the building of houses by local authorities. There was £2 of a free grant given at that time for every £1 spent by the local authority up to £1,000,000.</P>

      <P>On the Adjournment, Deputy Cafferky has given notice to raise the subject-matter of Question No. 20 on to-day's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>This afternoon I addressed a question to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs as follows:-</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will state whether the vacancy which existed in Charlestown Post Office for a postmaster has yet been filled; and if an appointment has been made, if he will say who has been appointed and what qualifications the appointee has for the position.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I received the following answer from the Minister:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The vacant sub-postmastership of Charlestown has been filled by the appointment of Mr. Valentine Harrison, who was the most suitable candidate forthcoming.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not answer the question I put to him, and for that reason I am forced to bring him here and to detain this House over the ordinary time.  Therefore, the onus is on the Minister and not on me.  I understand that this sub-postmastership became vacant some time in 1944, and that there were a number of applicants for the position.  I also understand that an applicant must comply with certain regulations laid down by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs: (1) that he or she must not use political influence &mdash; by that is meant that he or she must not approach a public representative in Dáil Éireann to request the Minister to have him or her appointed to the particular post&mdash;(2) that the office must not be in a licensed premises or that the applicant must not be the owner of a licensed premises for the sale of liquor or that the wife of the applicant must not hold a liquor licence in her name; (3) that the applicant must not be an agent of the National Health Insurance Society.  All of these things, I understand, apply to the person appointed in this case.  I know for a fact that he used political influence <Col N="1810" /> through ex-Deputy Micheal O Cléirigh and three other Fianna Fáil Deputies, two from South Mayo and one from Sligo; that he was an agent for the National Health Insurance Society; that the premises in which the post office is now located is a public-house where beer, whiskey, etc., are served over the counter, and that his wife holds the licence for that premises.</P>
    <P>Some 11 persons made application for this post, only two of whom, to my knowledge, had the necessary qualifications. One of these was a lady clerk who administered the affairs of that post office and had given valuable service to this State for well over 20 years.  She possessed real qualifications for the post so far as administering the affairs of a post office is concerned.  The other was a lady who had retired some considerable time ago.  These two were the only persons out of the 11 applicants who possessed the necessary qualifications for carrying out such important business so far as the State is concerned.  Notwithstanding that fact, we find that a gentleman was appoined whose application should not have been entertained, and who, I understand, was certainly not approved of by the postal authorities but was appointed by the Minister himself because pressure was brought to bear upon him by political influence.  Three months before the appointment was made that gentleman started to remodel these premises and to prepare the necessary room for a post office.</P>
    <P>I addressed a question to the Minister on Wednesday, 28th November, asking him what it cost to have the post office removed from the former premises to the new one, and he told me that it cost £102 11s. 7d. to have the telephone wires and cable brought into these new premises.  The premises where the post office was formerly were more suitable, because they were far larger.  They were situated in a better position in relation to Bellaghy and Charlestown, which are divided by the railway.  They were in a central position for the business people and the general public.  So far as convenience is concerned, they were situated in the proper centre.  The <Col N="1811" /> premises also allow of enlargement being made if necessary.</P>
    <P>The person who had administered the affairs of this post office under the sub-postmaster was a Miss Brett and she owned the premises.  As I say she had made application for this position, and for 25 years had given to this Government and the former Government and a foreign Government faithful service in administering the affairs of this post office.  On several occasions the postmaster of Claremorris had congratulated her on her efficiency as a clerk in that post office.  Notwithstanding that, we find that this gentleman was appointed who was a political tout of the Fianna Fáil Party, who had appeared on their platforms on every possible occasion and acted as chairman on occasions.  From a financial point of view he is not a person to my mind who should be appointed to this position.  I am sure the Minister is well aware of that, and that I need not go any deeper into that question, as I do not desire to do so.  I know it and he knows it as well as I do.  I want to point out here and now that it is this type of jobbery, this type of naked corruption, that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, sitting in that corner there, is prepared to stand over, even against his own staff working under him and against their advice.  He is prepared to take the advice of Deputies from outside constituencies such as Sligo and from Deputies representing the Government in South Mayo, against the advice of his own civil servants and Departmental advisers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out that the Minister accepted the advice of Deputies representing my constituency and the constituency of Sligo, against the advice of his advisers in the Department, who I believe to be far more competent to offer him advice than a political representative, no matter what bench he may come from and no matter to which Party he may belong. I want to make it very clear that I <Col N="1812" /> pointed that out to the Minister, when I spoke on the Estimate for Posts and Telegraphs some months ago, and I asked him to have the courage&mdash;knowing his past history in relation to appointments in relation to post offices &mdash; to turn down the influence and turn those people away from him whenever he was faced with influence or wire-pulling from any representative, whether it was Deputy Cafferky, ex-Deputy Micheal O Cléirigh, Deputy Moran, Deputy Richard Walsh or Deputy Dr. Brennan.  Notwithstanding that, he was prepared to accept the advice of those gentlemen and forgot to take into consideration the fact that the appointee to-day knows no more about sending out a telegram, knows no more about sending out a code message, knows no more about the business of the post office, than a simple child he would take out of the national school at the age of 10.  The very fact that I could go in there to-morrow morning and ask him to send a telegram and that he is not capable of doing so shows he does not possess the qualifications.  I now challenge the Minister to say that he does, as I want to tell the Minister here and now that he does not.  I challenge the Minister to say that he has the qualifications in relation to the administration of a sub-post office.  I want to point out, through you, to the Minister that it is this type of jobbery, this type of naked corruption and graft, plus many other similar actions, that has brought about the defeat of his candidate in South Mayo.  The Minister had no excuse to offer.</P>

      <P>I know that the Minister had no explanation to offer me this afternoon, because when I asked him for the qualifications, he could not state the qualifications that the <Col N="1813" /> gentleman possessed.  The Minister forgot, or did not take into consideration, that, in order to satisfy this miniature politician in the town of Charlestown, in County Mayo, it was necessary to impose an extra tax of £102 11s. 7d., notwithstanding, as the Minister knows, that he had sent two gentlemen down to Charlestown to measure, moryah, the houses so as to find out which would be the suitable premises, so that there would be no favouritism, so that it would be over and above board, moryah.  This gentlemen, now appointed sub-postmaster, had partitioned this little room away from the publichouse counter, across which the bottle of beer and the half of whiskey were served, and where people could come in from the early hours of the morning until late at night.  He had erected a private partition and broke out a door months in advance, and was going around Charlestown boasting that he had political power, that he had gentlemen working for him, that he had men prepared to stoop to graft and corruption and that the Minister would be prepared to accept their advice and have him appointed.</P>
      <P>I want to point out to you and to this House that, thank God, the writing is on the wall for him and his colleagues to read.  Not only will the people of South Mayo refuse to accept that type of corruptible administration, that type of jobbery, that type of graft, which is part and parcel of his administration in relation to the appointments of sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses in this country since he took over administration, but when he and his Government appear before this country in 1948, the answer given to them in South Mayo recently will be the answer they will receive in every other constituency where this type of graft and corruption has taken place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Little)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seldom listened to a speech which contained so many thoroughly improper remarks as that just delivered by Deputy Cafferky.  To begin with, I do not know according to what rules of order one can be charged in this House with graft and corruption.  I think that is entirely contrary to the rules of an assembly of this sort. Several of the statements the Deputy made are entirely untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>Deny them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>They are entirely untrue. This man who was appointed is a man of extreme ability, a man of very great ability, and more able than anybody else there.  Owing to his ability, which is well known to many people, he received that appointment, and any other matters were subordinated to that fact.  It is also true that the lady &mdash;I am sorry the Deputy mentioned her name, because it is most unfair to her&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>She is a very elderly person and she was not suitable for that reason, no matter how good she may have been otherwise.  I chose the person who was by far the best and who had proved his ability.  I think it is a most scandalous abuse of the privileges of this House that the Deputy should hint as to the financial condition of a man of his ability, or indeed of anybody of that sort.  I repeat that it is a scandalous abuse. The premises were entirely cut off from the public-house some time before the appointment arose.</P>
