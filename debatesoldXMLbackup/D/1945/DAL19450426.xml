    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will amend the Emergency Powers (No. 354) Order, 1945, so as to include civil servants who retired prior to the 1st July, 1940.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order referred to applies to persons who before retirement were subject to the Civil Service (Stabilisation of Bonus) Regulations, 1940, and whose pensions were accordingly assessed in relation to the stabilised cost-of-living figure of 85 even though the actual cost-of-living figure was higher.  The scope of the Order precludes its application to persons who retired before the 1st July, 1940.  In any event, no corresponding adjustment of pension is called for in their cases inasmuch as their pensions were related to the cost-of-living figure applying at the date of their retirement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware that a large number of unemployed workers from Portarlington area were refused work at turf production by Clondalkin Paper Mills, Ltd., and large numbers of workers from the West of Ireland were employed and local men rejected by an Order made by his Department; and, if so, and in view of the fact that Clondalkin Paper Mills, Ltd., are willing to employ them, if he will state <Col N="2510" /> if he is prepared to allow local men to work on this scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a condition of the grant of a turf-movement licence to a firm in the non-turf area that the turf in question should be produced by labour directly employed by the firm and recruited either outside the scheduled turf areas or through employment exchanges from specified areas in the congested districts.  These regulations were published in the Press on the 1st February, 1945.  Similar regulations have been in operation since 1942 and are designed in the interests of turf production generally.  It is not proposed to change them.  I am aware that the services of a number of local men employed by Clondalkin Paper Mills, Ltd., on preliminary work during the winter months were dispensed with by reason of these regulations.  There is, I understand, a shortage of labour for turf production in the Portarlington district and the men concerned had little difficulty in obtaining alternative employment of this character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the wages paid to turf workers who come from the West of Ireland are at least £2 more than is paid by the Leix County Council or any other county council?  In view of the special circumstances that exist in the Portarlington area, will the Minister consider the case of some 12 or 15 men who were employed by the Clondalkin Paper Mills and allow the Clondalkin Paper Mills to employ them again?  The Clondalkin Paper Mills will employ them if the Minister will give permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>All the labour in the turf areas is required for the production of turf for the national pool. Private firms or individuals producing turf in these areas must bring their labour with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister take steps to see that the county council and others concerned pay the same rate of wages as private firms like the Clondalkin Paper Mills?  The county council, for instance, pay their standard wages, whereas the Clondalkin <Col N="2511" /> Paper Mills pay at least £2 more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that the wages paid by the Kildare County Council to its employees who are engaged on turf work are substantially less than the wages paid by the Turf Development Board for similar work in the same areas; and, if so, if he will sanction an increase in wages for the county council employees engaged on turf work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the position is as stated by the Deputy.  The wages paid by the Kildare County Council to persons employed on county council turf schemes are not less than those paid by the Turf Development Board. If the Deputy is referring to the value of the board and lodging provided by the board to their workers in turf camps, I would point out that these concessions are regarded as a recompense to such persons for having to leave their homes and family surroundings to take up employment on the Kildare bogs.  The council workers are recruited locally and reside in their own homes, and their position is more comparable to that of other workers employed by the county council.</P>
      <P>I can see no justification for a proposal to increase the existing differential between the wages paid to turf workers and those paid to workers in agricultural employment.</P>

      <P>The debate went over such a length <Col N="2517" /> last night that I was precluded from completing my remarks in reply.  If I could have continued, it is possible I could have replied in a reasonably adequate manner to the points raised in the debate.  Starting off from scratch again is very difficult for a nervous and timid individual such as I am.  I was saying that I foretold in relation to the debate that this year's criticisms would be exactly the same as the criticisms that were directed at the Land Commission activities last year.  I have had before this to make a prophecy of the same nature and once again my prophetic soul was on sound ground.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies ranged over the world looking for examples wherewith to demolish the Land Commission, and they spoke of America.  There is a system in the American Senate and House of Representatives whereby a Senator or Representative may insert in the record a speech he wishes his constituents to believe he had made. Judging by the type of speeches that were made here last night, it is nearly time we would save the time of the Dáil by adopting the principle of inserting, without discussion, matters that have been already adequately dealt with.  Whatever may be said for the age of chivalry&mdash;and when I hear Deputy Dillon talk I must assume it is dead&mdash;the age of miracles is still with us.  In the Land Commission, according to its critics in the Dáil, we are confronted with a miracle of human perversity&mdash;a Department that is completely obsolete, ineffective, with a vested interest contempt for public opinion.  We have the further miracle of the possibility of the continuance in being of a Department which is completely unwanted by Deputies in the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Long ago such a Department should have succumbed to the accumulated consequences of its, more or less, catastrophic errors. However, it is still in existence and, in spite of all the criticisms, it is, in my belief, doing its job as well as any <Col N="2518" /> human organisation could do it in very adverse circumstances.</P>
      <P>Last night a matter was raised here to which, before I take up the various criticisms made by Deputies, I should like to refer.  That is my refusal to see a deputation.  Deputy Flanagan, Deputy Davin and Deputy O'Higgins were very wroth about it. Now, the position of a Deputy, as I see it, is an honourable and responsible one.</P>
      <P>A Deputy has certain rights and privileges which Ministers and Departments should recognise and which Deputies should very jealously preserve. Among those rights is the right, within reason, to get an opportunity of discussing with a particular Minister a matter of concern for the Deputy's constituency or of the public interest.  In relation to this deputation, I met Deputy O'Higgins here in Leinster House and he told me he had certain criticisms to make in regard to Land Commission activities in his constituency. He said he was anxious to meet me.  I informed Deputy O'Higgins that he could meet me at any time and that arrangement still stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A year ago, however, Deputy Flanagan came along to me and asked me to see a deputation from his constituency in regard to the sale of an estate with which he disagreed.  I pointed out to him that there was really nothing I could do in the matter of which he spoke.  I pointed out to him that, even if it were a matter for the Land Commission, it was not a matter for the Minister; but in the existing circumstances it was neither a matter for the Minister nor for the Land Commission.  After discussion, Deputy Flanagan agreed that that was so and agreed that it would be merely a waste of time if I had met that deputation. He went on another tack then and he said: &ldquo;There is a house in that estate that I would be most anxious to have preserved; it might be constructed into a hospital or a sanatorium; I would like you to discuss that matter with me.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;  The deputation came, but there was no mention of a house.  The whole discussion took place in regard <Col N="2519" /> to the sale of the lands, which Deputy Flanagan and I agreed beforehand was not a matter in which the Land Commission or the Minister should intervene. This deputation was a costly one.  It brought a number of men up from Laoighis and Offaly, at a waste of time and money, yet as a result of that deputation nothing effective of any kind could be done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan was not satisfied. He raised this matter by way of question in the Dáil afterwards.  He further raised it on the Adjournment the same evening and did his best, in the Adjournment Debate, to impress on the Dáil that I was not doing my duty in regard to the work of the Land Commission in his constituency.  A Deputy's position in this House is a responsible one, an honourable one. We should jealously preserve a Deputy's rights, so that we might bring respect on this House.  If a Deputy has rights, he also has duties, and when a Deputy wilfully misrepresents me, very definitely I will refuse to meet him in a deputation.</P>
    <P>The facts are not as Deputy Davin put them.  I did not say that no useful purpose would be served by the deputation.  I refused point blank to see Deputy Flanagan.  Deputies will find that, as far as I can be helpful in the office I hold, I am more than willing to be of help to each of them.  They will find me more than approachable and in every way obliging, irrespective of what point of view they represent; but I think that I am entitled to the respect which my office demands.  It always has been the rule in the Land Commission that there shall not be political interference with its work.  In the 1933 Act, with the insertion of Section 6, the present Government made that rule still more specific and still more binding.  Deputies should be familiar with Section 6 of the Land Act of 1933; they should familiarise themselves with its terms and there would be less pretence then about the question of the division of lands and the suggestion that their division and allotment everywhere throughout the country are in the hands of the Fianna Fáil clubs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2520" /> Deputy O'Higgins, very wroth, referred to a speech I made at a Fianna Fáil convention some years ago. Now, members of every Party here&mdash; National Labour, Labour, Farmers, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil&mdash;are all familiar with the nature of political conventions.  They know they cannot hand-pick the delegates, they cannot choke them off; they know that statements are made at every type of convention which responsible officers of a Party have to meet.  In defending the correctness of the Land Commission attitude, in defending the inspectors of the Land Commission, in defending the existence of Section 6 of the Land Act of 1933, I used certain words.  I have been criticised in my own constituency by supporters of my own for using those words.</P>
    <P>Naturally every word a Minister uses is liable to be misinterpreted and misrepresented. A very famous French statesman, when he became a Minister of State, pointed out that Ministers were fair game for abuse, misrepresentation, slander and libel, that it was part of the perquisites of his office.  I do not mind abuse or misrepresentation when it comes meaninglessly from Deputy Dillon or wilfully and bitterly from a member of the Labour Party.  However, I said on that occasion in the Mansion House that the business of the Land Commission, as far as land division was concerned, was to create farms and to put farmers in possession of them.</P>
    <P>When an attack was made on inspectors of the Land Commission and when they were accused of political bias, I guaranteed that the political affiliations of any suitable applicant for land would not debar him from consideration by the Land Commission. That is what I said.  I am quite satisfied that that represents my viewpoint; I do not care how it is misrepresented. Charges are often made against inspectors of the Land Commission that they are politically biased. They are not confined to the Fine Gael Party or to the Labour Party.  I hear them from my own Party time and again.  Land Commission inspectors are like every other body.  They cannot all be perfect.  Some of them <Col N="2521" /> may not be as wise in their generation as others.  Deputy Flanagan mentioned a Land Commission inspector who was sent down to Laoighis-Offaly to him as secretary of a Fianna Fáil club, to get instructions as to how estates should be divided in Laoighis-Offaly.  If we have an inspector in the Land Commission that would go to Deputy Flanagan for advice on any subject, I would like to know him, because I would like to sack him.  The Ceann Comhairle has made a ruling here that we must not utilise certain words, botanical and ichthyological.  In America they have a saying: &ldquo;Barnum was right.&rdquo;  The reason the Americans say Barnum was right is because Barnum said: &ldquo;There is a sucker born every minute, and I keep my eyes skinned for him.&rdquo;  If Barnum was over here we would say Barnum was wrong: they are born oftener.  In American coastal waters there is an abundance of fish and there is one particular fish which small boys love to angle for.  He will take their bait, a piece of an old boot, a piece of a shirt tail or even the opinion of Deputy Dillon or Deputy Flanagan. I would not attempt, in view of your ruling, Sir, to refer to Deputy Flanagan by the name of any fish but certainly, he is so capable of accepting any official statement that his mental mouth must be as wide open as the mouth of that American fish to which I refer, and he comes along and expects that we belong to the same finny tribe, that every statement he makes here must willy-nilly be swallowed by every single member of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I will not leave America for the moment and I am drawn to refer to America because so many Deputies, like Deputy Hughes and Deputy Cogan, have been urging experts in American farming methods, and so and so, on us.  I do not understand the Laoighis-Offaly mentality.  It seems to me that Laoighis-Offaly must be the Irish Kentucky &mdash; a dark and bloody ground.  In my constituency we are a tough crowd; we are good fighters and in elections or elsewhere we can put up a very pretty scrap, but when an election is over, Deputy McAuliffe, Deputy Skinner, Deputy Halliden and I are quite very good <Col N="2522" /> friends.  We are not always suspicious of every word and action of those who are opposed to us politically but in Laoighis-Offaly it seems to me we have year after year a continued scrap here in the Dáil as to what a particular Deputy has done, how he has offended against the beliefs or morals of another and, incidentally, if they merely took their own scalps, mine would feel safe, but they start taking mine.  I refused to see the deputation for the reasons stated.  It has been said that then, having refused to meet the Deputies, I met a Fianna Fáil county councillor. Certainly I did not meet a Fianna Fáil county councillor.  I met nobody in relation to the matter or I met nobody in relation to any other matter in Laoighis-Offaly and the only deputation I ever received was the one sponsored by Deputy Flanagan last year, which is the cause of the trouble.</P>
    <P>I hope that Deputies will regard what I have said in the matter of the deputation as a full, frank and fair explanation and will accept my assurance of my desire to be helpful to Deputies of any Party, accessible to them and respectful to them.</P>
    <P>I will not make any botanical or other reference to Deputy Blowick but Deputy Blowick's statement sets the tenor of the whole debate.  He spoke like the man who knew Coolidge, and gave us quite a lot of stuff about the slackness of the Land Commission in regard to correspondence.  Deputy Flanagan, with his usual honesty, got up and completely exploded the statement made by Deputy Blowick.  In the period mentioned by Deputy Blowick, we received in the Land Commission 61 letters from him.  Thirty-nine were applications or recommendations of applications for land and turbary and all of these were acknowledged in the usual way.  Nothing further than an acknowledgment can be sent or will be sent in reply to such communications. Deputies will understand why.  All the applications for land and turbary made by Deputy Blowick are noted, considered and investigated and they cannot be made the subject of correspondence. In 18 instances, his letters of another kind were fully answered.</P>

      <P>We got 61 letters, of which 39 are admitted to have been answered.  In 18 instances, his letters were of another kind.  They were fully answered, and the Deputy called at the Land Commission's office on 31st July last regarding the terms of one of the replies he had received.  After a discussion, he agreed that the reply was reasonable and nothing was heard from him about the other 17 replies. The Deputy challenged one and left the other 17 go.  In another case, on a rather delicate matter, involving the private business of certain constituents of his, the Deputy did not get a reply, and we cannot give him a reply.  That accounts for 58 of the 61 communications which Deputy Blowick addressed to the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>Of the three remaining letters, in one case we cannot give him the information, and the other two are being investigated with a view to giving an early reply.  What becomes of Deputy Blowick's challenge that he has been writing to the Land Commission for 15 months and has been unable to get a reply?  Of course, he has got replies. We cannot stop people writing letters. Perhaps it would be inadvisable, but we have to keep a tremendous staff in the Land Commission solely for the purpose of replying to letters.  In my own office, I have three typists who are engaged full-time and all the time, and if we could get less correspondence, I think we would be able to devote more time to dealing effectively with the matters out of which the correspondence arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Blowick spoke about giving pieces of land at a distance from the parent holding.  He gave the distance as 2½ miles and Deputy Donnellan gave it as 4 miles.  The Land Commission <Col N="2525" /> does not now give, and has not for quite a long time given, land at more than 1½ miles distance.  I think it is wrong myself.  I would far rather try to provide an integrated holding for every farmer.  There is always some savour of rundale about divided farms, but we have one difficulty in the Land Commission: we differ very much from the Deputies who criticise our activities. They are perfectionists; we are not.  We take men and things as we find them and do the very best we can with them.</P>
    <P>I have already raised this question of the distance with the Land Commission and have pointed out that I would prefer an integrated holding.  The Land Commissioners, whose advice I must take because they have a lifetime experience of the matter, tell me that, while it is highly desirable that we should get this thing done, it is not always possible to do it.  Time and again, we have Deputies making representations that men two, three and four miles away from an estate about to be divided did not get a portion of a holding.  I think a portion of a holding given to a small farmer which is over a mile and a half from his farm is pretty useless to him.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick gave us a very doleful picture of conditions in the congested districts and I agree that everything he said in that regard is perfectly correct.  I have had the same tale from Deputy Beegan, Deputy Walsh and many other Deputies, and I hope, in speaking on the matter of general policy, to say a few words in that connection.  We have a saying in the South&mdash;I do not know if the Deputy has heard it in the West&mdash;&ldquo;You cannot have goats and cabbage.&rdquo; You cannot do two things at once: you cannot relieve this desperate condition of congestion and, at the same time, go in for hot and cold water laid on in all the houses, as Deputy Blowick advocates.  It is an ideal which we may hope at some time to reach, but we in the Land Commission should not concern ourselves with matters of that sort, while the conditions which really need to be investigated and put right remain unsettled.  The Deputy pointed out that, for £15, <Col N="2526" /> adequate sanitation could be provided in all these houses.  The Deputy is talking in the wrong place, because I was a building contractor.  I happen to know what it costs to put in plumbing and sewerage systems, and I can assure him that £15 would go a very short distance in providing such amenities as he believes in.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fogarty made the statement that no building contractor can be induced to take a contract for the Land Commission.  That is not unnatural.  It is very difficult to get a really efficient building contractor to take contracts for the generally small houses that we have to build in isolated areas in the country.  Many of the contractors that we do get are not, as far as I have investigated the results of their labours, by any means satisfactory.  I have been urging on the Land Commission the idea of having Land Commission houses built by direct labour.  It is generally more costly, but it is far better that the added cost should be expended at the beginning rather than double the amount should be spent in repairs over the years afterwards while the tenant in the holding lives in the house under conditions that are not reasonable.</P>
    <P>It was very hard to follow Deputy Hughes &mdash; he travelled so far &mdash; to America, England, Scotland and Denmark. The Deputy says that there is not sufficient co-operation between the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Lands.  I do not know that that is correct.  Each Department has its own particular job to do. I am not satisfied that the inspectors of both Departments live in entirely watertight compartments.  I have suggested that, for the sake of successful working by the Land Commission in the placing of allottees, we might at that point have more definite co-operation between the Land Commission inspectors and Department of Agriculture inspectors.  I think we ought to have, when we have an allottee on the land, farily frequent inspection, if possible by the Department of Agriculture inspectors, so as to advise and help him.  We ought to have an inspection of his efforts, and if he is a <Col N="2527" /> capable farmer we ought to put him properly on his feet.  If he is not tending to become a capable farmer, the sooner we get rid of him the better.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes also spoke about the size of an economic holding.  I cannot do better than repeat what I said last year.  There is room in this country for holdings of very diverse size.  We can use the big farmer, the small farmer and the farmer with a middle area of acreage.  The trouble that I see with big farmers is that we have more big farms in the country than we have farmers capable, or sufficiently capitalised, of working them.  I believe that.  Deputy Dillon's speech is like Browning's poetry. When you have read through a lot of turgidity, you come upon some brilliant piece of commonsense now and again.  If you wait for Deputy Dillon, he produces an idea now and again.  I will come back to him later.  Deputy Hughes mentioned the question of the selection of allottees.  No matter how carefully you select allottees, even if you were to get Deputy Oliver Flanagan to select them, or a really efficient sensible man to do it, there is always bound to be a percentage of error.  Human beings, being what they are, our judgments cannot always be correct.  The Land Commission inspectors are experienced men; they are honourable men; they are men who know their job thoroughly, and they are as good judges of character as other men.  It is the business of the Land Commission inspectors to select allottees.</P>

      <P>There are all sorts of checks on the selection of allottees. The Land Commission inspector makes the first list; the head inspector goes through the list and checks up on it; the divisional inspector is responsible for going through the list again, and then it comes before the Land Commission.  With all the facts and opinions before them, they finally decide.  With all these checks mistakes occur.  There are bound to be mistakes.  When Deputies last night <Col N="2528" /> spoke about the resumption of land division as about to be a fact one of these days, they were labouring under a slight error.  The question of land acquisition and land division was suspended, the main reason being the shortage of staff.  With the return of the staff to the Land Commission, they have got rid of certain orders that were in existence, and as far as it is possible with the accrued staff, the Land Commission are now dealing with matters which were suspended for several years.  Deputies, however, must not expect that there will be a resumption of land acquisition and land division in the immediate future. As far as I am concerned, Deputies must never again expect that land acquisition and land division will assume the volume it did before the war.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hughes mentioned the destruction of fertility by the holding over of land by the Land Commission.  The Land Commission had to participate in the production of food, just the same as any other land holder.  It is with no wilful desire to destroy the fertility of the land that the Land Commission has been holding on to land.  The Land Commission, like every other land holder, has done its best to preserve the fertility of the land and the value of the land.  Again it has not been always successful, but it has done the best it can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hughes and Deputy O'Reilly also mentioned the question of revesting. Deputy O'Reilly has some views on revesting with which I cannot <Col N="2529" /> agree.  If we are completely to rehabilitate farms, put the houses into perfect condition, paint and paper the houses, almost provide the furniture for the houses, and not expect that during the time before revesting the tenant will do something to get the land and the house into condition, I think that is altogether wrong.  The Land Commission will do what is reasonable to hand over the farm and the house to the tenant in the soundest condition possible.  While the Land Commission has its duties, so also has the tenant, and the tenant who has not done something to keep his farm in heart and his house in good condition is a very unworthy allottee of the Land Commission.  I think this question of revesting, raised by Deputy Hughes, is one of the most important with which the Land Commission has to deal.  I mentioned figures of 45,000 and 70,000 holdings without revesting. I think it is essential that the Land Commission should undertake with its fullest strength the question of revesting the holdings already given to the tenants in the tenants.  If the Dáil demands that we should embark on a policy of wholesale land division, we shall never get revesting done.  Something like 1,600 farms were revested last year and that was a record.  I think it was Deputy Coogan said that it would take about 50 years before revesting was done.  I think it is most essential that a large portion of the staff of the Land Commission must be concerned with the revesting of tenants from this forward and I propose to try to get it done so far as possible, irrespective of what effects it has on future land division.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes and Deputy Dillon also raised the question of giving permission to allottees to sell.  Land division is naturally slow and must be slow.  The selection of allottees must be most careful.  We must try to have what I may describe as the creation of farms and the putting of farmers into them.  That must be our aim.  Now and again we have failures.  I am altogether in favour of getting rid of those failures ruthlessly. <Col N="2530" /> Men who get land and houses from the Land Commission and who refuse to live in these houses, who let the land to former owners, who merely regard as a legacy and a windfall accruing to them the amount they can get out of the land by setting it and by letting the house, are a menace.  I think that we should have no pity for them.  We hope to bring a short Bill into the Dáil which will give us powers to deal adequately with these people, with no ill-will and no malice, but in the national interest, because we cannot afford to carry dead-ends. Land is too valuable, and if it is not worked, this country goes down.  I hope for the full support of Deputies of all Parties in getting that Bill through, because we know thoroughly well that we have cases of men who have been hopeless allottees.  We have taken them into court and the court often decides against the Land Commission. Now we must try to make the law so clear that the Land Commission will be enabled to get rid of these recalcitrants, who will not work and will not utilise their land.  I notice that all the Deputies who spoke here in relation to migrants were very much in favour of migrants as long as the migrants do not come into their own constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Davin, like the player queen who protests too much, protested too much.  He was altogether in favour of migrants. Deputy Flanagan wanted migrants. They went back to the Land League: &ldquo;The land of Ireland for the people of Ireland; the land of Offaly for the people of Offaly.&rdquo;  Because people in a badly-congested area in Galway were brought half-a-mile across the Shannon, Deputy Flanagan and Deputy Davin looked upon them as if they were sent over by the King of Liberia.  Surely that is a parochial outlook. We had this parochialism again from Deputy Spring of the National Labour Party&mdash;all in favour of migrants, but send them into some other body's constituency.  Now we had, in all decency and Christian charity and <Col N="2531" /> with a sense of duty, to take these Galway people out of a festering sore of congestion.  We had the land in Offaly.  We satisfied all the uneconomic holders in that place.  The argument was used that we merely gave 12 acres to the uneconomic holders in Offaly and 30 acres to the Galway men.  We gave 12 acres in addition to their holdings to the uneconomic holders in Offaly.  We gave 30 acres as an economic holding to the Galway men who surrendered their holdings in Galway. I will defend that action of the Land Commission everywhere and anywhere, irrespective of its effects on the Presidential election or the local government elections.</P>
      <P>Deputy McAuliffe spoke about the giving of land to cottage tenants and Deputy Spring also mentioned the giving of land to cottage tenants.  Our job is to make farmers.  I think it was Deputy Hughes or Deputy O'Higgins &mdash;somebody from the Fine Gael Party &mdash;and Deputy Beirne who spoke about the provision of credit for allottees who get land.  Deputy Beirne pointed out that there was in Roscommon a number of people who had land but had no money and no cattle.  If that is so, these people got land from the Land Commission under false pretences. They got the land because they proved to the Land Commission, before they got it, that they had cattle.  Now we discover that they have neither cattle nor capital.  The State does an awful lot.  It gives a piece of land to a farmer, a house and certain outhouses.  It is a going concern, if a man has cattle, capital and plant.  Surely it is altogether too much to expect the State to set him up completely in business.  I would be altogether opposed to it and, therefore, I do not think that the method of helping cottiers is by way of giving them little patches of land in addition to equipping them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donnellan did not mean to misrepresent me; I know he would not do it.  I did say, and I will say it again, that the man who can rely on himself is a much greater national asset than the man who has to wait for State help.  If a man, by his thrift <Col N="2532" /> and energy, is able to purchase a farm and to work it independent of any State aid, he is undoubtedly a better man for the nation than the man who has to be helped.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation.  I do not want to misrepresent the Minister in any way.  I shall ask him this question.  Is it his point that, as regards a piece of land in an area where there are congests and uneconomic holders, it is the policy of the Land Commission to allow that land to be sub-divided into holdings of 30 and 40 acres and sold by public auction, or is it their policy to take over that land and divide it amongst the congests in the area?  I do not know how far I would be from misrepresenting him, but I assure him that his statement was that the people who are able to buy land are a greater asset to the State than the people who have to be helped by any Department of State.  Surely the people who are able to buy land can get it where the land is plentiful, and it is the duty of the Land Commission, in congested districts, to see that the land there is given, together with State aid, to the uneconomic holders who are not able to help themselves.  I think that should be the duty of the Land Commission and I would like the Minister to be straight about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Donnellan and I appear to be correcting each other on different points.  I shall come to that later on.  The point that I made, and that I still hold, is that I think the man who is able to do things for himself is a greater asset to the nation than the man who has to be helped. Deputy Bartley spoke last night and suggested that the intentions of the Land Commission inspectors should be made known to Deputies.  I disagree altogether.  I do not think that it would add anything to the working of the Land Commission if the inspectors <Col N="2533" /> went around and discussed their decisions before they were made publicly.  It would be very wrong.</P>
      <P>Deputy Spring spoke about houses that are vacant in Kerry.  I take it those are the houses that have been vacated in the Maherees.  We took from the Maherees a number of congests so as to make the remaining holdings there reasonably economic. The people in that district were exceptionally good farmers; they are among the best farmers I have ever seen.  I do not know whether they went to Kildare or Meath, but there are a number of holdings in that district now which have to be rearranged and, until the rearrangement is made, there is nothing we can do about the houses. Our real business is with land.  Our purpose in migrating numbers of people out of the congested districts in the Maherees was to try to give the remaining people holdings of sufficient size to enable them to make a living. We may have to consider the greater need and do that rather than provide houses for somebody in Castlegregory.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon spoke about lay commissioners. I have met the lay commissioners over the past couple of years.  There are six of them.  I find them all to be honourable, decent men, men of integrity who want to do the work they have been appointed to do and who are trying to do it.  I have nothing but good words to say for every commissioner in the Land Commission. Every man there is a man of honour, energy and integrity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon also spoke about evicted tenants.  I have my own views about evicted tenants, and they might not coincide with the views of farmers. Since 1903 there were 3,515 evicted tenants reinstated and, so far as I can see, even in 1944 two evicted tenants were reinstated.  Wherever it has been possible to find a man with a reasonable claim, a man who claims that his forebears were the subjects of eviction, the Land Commission has always striven to make adequate provision for him, and will continue to do so.  While saying that, the Land Commission cannot do impossibilities, and I hope that is not expected.  You must remember the reason I am not a member <Col N="2534" /> of the Farmers' Party or of the Labour Party is because I think a Party that is to be effective in a Government must be a Party that considers the merits of every class.  One would think, by the way farmers speak nowadays, that it was they who won the land war.  Farmers get the benefit of it.</P>

      <P>The labourers and the craftsmen in the towns, particularly the shopkeepers, were as much to the fore in the land war as any farmer, and they had nothing to get out of it and they never looked for anything. The Land Commission will do its best to place any descendant of any evicted tenant, to honour the bond that was given.  Let us not forget, as sometimes the Farmers' Party are inclined to forget, the work of the labourers and the craftsmen in the towns in the land war.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins stated here last year that the Government was committed to the continuance of a land division policy.  No Government can be committed to the continuance of a policy when the need for that policy has become nonexistent and when the conditions are so changed that its continuance might be of doubtful value.  I have said here always that we must envisage a time when the major activities in regard to <Col N="2535" /> land acquisition and division must come to a close.  Government policy must be based on a consideration of its effect on human beings, their characters, their welfare, their reasonable security.  The hard economics of mechanisation, which Deputy Hughes preaches with such fervour, would hardly be in line with a policy that must be devoted to the consideration of human beings.  At the same time, no policy, no matter how well devised or how well directed to our social betterment, can ignore economic laws. When Deputy Dillon puts me that question, I would say in answer that Deputies must never again expect a wholesale acquisition or division of land and that, as the years go by, the activities of the Land Commission in regard to that matter must grow less and less.  The amount of land that we may reasonably expect to remain for division is now very limited.  I think the amount that would be saved by changing the present financial policy would not be worth the disturbances that would be created.  This is my view of it.</P>
      <P>I would like to say something in relation to security of tenure, which has been a matter of concern to Deputies and people generally throughout the country.  I was speaking to an old parish priest down near Deputy Halliden's parish a few months ago and he said to me:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am old enough to remember hearing Michael Davitt being called a Communist.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In relation to this question of fixity of tenure, I have browsed amongst various documents and have come across a letter addressed by Bishop Nulty of Meath to the priests and people of Meath Diocese in 1881.  If Bishops cannot quote Ministers with approval, at least a Minister might have the honour of quoting a Bishop with approval:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The land of every country is the common property of the people of that country because its real owner, the Creator Who made it, has transferred it as a voluntary gift to them, from which it follows that the great problem that Government has to <Col N="2536" /> solve is what is the most profitable and remunerative investment they can make out of the common property in the interests of and for the benefits of the people to whom it belongs.  It is because the principle of private property fulfils best this objective that it has become a necessary social institution under all forms of government.  The arguments which prove that, in strict justice as well as in the interest of the nation at large, a landholder who is constantly improving and increasing the productiveness of his farm has a right to the continued occupation of it, prove, too, that a non-improving landholder has no right to be left in possession of it at all.  The people of a nation have too deep an interest in the productiveness of the land of the nation and in the amount of human food it will yield to be able to allow any portion of it to remain in the hands of a man through whose criminal indolence and incapacity it either produces nothing at all or what will be much less than it is capable of yielding.  I infer, therefore, that no individual or class of individuals can hold a right of property in the land of a country when the people of that country in their public corporate capacity are, and always must be, the real owners of the land of their country&mdash;holding always an indisputable title to it, in the fact that they have received it as a free gift from the Creator and as a necessary means for preserving and enjoying the life He has bestowed upon them. The general interests of the community are hardly distinguishable from the private interests of the usufructuary...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In support of this thesis, the Bishop quoted a number of publicists whom we, in this age, choose to regard as rather hard-boiled, such as J. A. Froude and John Stewart Mill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot argue about theology with Deputy Dillon.  I made a note myself: The <i>obiter dicta</i> of a judge is always regarded as forming a basis for the rule of law.  Deputy <Col N="2537" /> Dillon is a barrister and he can deal with that.  It might therefore be accepted that the statement of a responsible Minister in the Dáil on a matter of such public concern as security of tenure could also be regarded as emphasising the procedure to be adopted by his Department in this matter and of laying down certain limits within which the activities of his Department are defined.  The Minister for Lands, on the 9th August, 1933, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have set out that so long as a man is providing adequate employment, taking the situation of the whole country into consideration, and is producing a sufficient amount of food supplies, again taking the situation of the country into consideration, that man shall not be disturbed in the use of his land.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister for Lands, on the 16th June, 1939, said in the Dáil:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On these amendments the point has been raised again that we were taking, have taken and will take, properly and well worked farms.  I have said all through and I repeat that no such farms have been taken. The undertaking that was given by the Minister in the debate on the 1933 Act has been kept both in the spirit and in the letter, as I said on the Second Reading of this Bill, and on that occasion I asked any Deputy who knew of any case to the contrary to let me know but no Deputy has mentioned a case.  I repeat that no farm that was even moderately well worked was taken or will be taken.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the 26th August, 1944, the present Minister for Lands said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is absolute fixity of tenure for any man who is working his land in the proper way.  If any man sets out to destroy land or to take it out of production, then that man is not entitled to any fixity of tenure.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does not everybody know that, apart from any legal fixity of tenure in this country, there is an ultra-legal fixity of tenure?  It may be a good thing and it may be a bad thing but one effect of the ultra-legal fixity of tenure that exists here as a product of the Land League operations is that land is not <Col N="2538" /> security for money in the bank, which just shows that there is an outstanding security of tenure in this country by the force of public opinion.  If any man, after what Ministers have said repeatedly in this House, after what we know of the situation throughout the country, argues that there is no fixity of tenure, I do not think he quite realises what exactly he is talking about.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt fairly reasonably and too long with the whole question of the Land Commission.  While Deputy Dillon was out I said that Ministers are fair game for abuse and for attack and misrepresentation.  I do not object.  Deputy Dillon knows that too but there may be some innocent people in the Dáil who really believe what they say when they talk about Fianna Fáil clubs dividing the land throughout the country.  Deputy Giles has repeatedly made that statement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan mentioned that in the happy days when he was secretary of a Fianna Fáil club in Laoighis the then Minister sent down directly to him an inspector to consult with him as to how the land in his district was to be divided.  That was six or seven years ago.  We know what Deputy Flanagan's form is today, when he is six years older and has two years' experience of the Dáil and if we have a Minister who sent down an inspector to Deputy Flanagan six years ago for advice as to how to divide land in Laoighis-Offaly, that Minister should be sacked also.  I was not secretary of a Fianna Fáil club.  I was the chairman of the organisation for many years in my constituency, never dreaming I would be here in the Dáil or speaking for the Land Commission, or having any desire for it, but I was a man of reasonably good standing and repute in the constituency, a man who was concerned with public affairs and the public welfare. I never saw a Land Commission inspector. I never saw a Land Commission inspector until I was about six or seven years in the Dáil.  The only Government inspectors I ever met <Col N="2539" /> were several school inspectors, who had a very poor opinion of me and one Revenue Commissioner inspector, who had too good an opinion of me.  But I never did see a Land Commission inspector until I went to the Dáil and I know very few of them.  There is Section 6 of the Land Act, 1933, which completely prevents the Minister from interfering in any way in regard to what land shall be taken, how it is to be divided and who are to be the allottees.  The commissioners are men of capacity, of strong will and integrity, and they would naturally resent any interference by the Minister.  As long as the law is there, it is not my intention or desire to interfere with the commissioners and I wholeheartedly approve of Section 6 of the Land Act, 1933.  So, whatever we think ourselves or say ourselves, let us give the public the assurance that the commissioners of the Land Commission are the final arbiters in the matter of land acquisition, division and selection of allottees, that they are advised solely by their inspectors and that the recommendation of every Deputy will have due weight, consideration and investigation.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £198,651 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1946, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Forestry (9 &amp; 10 Geo. 5, c. 58, and No. 34 of 1928), including certain Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In introducing this Estimate for the expenses of the forestry service for the present year, there is little of exceptional interest to report and but little definite hope of increased planting during the coming season.  The past year was marked by continued activity in the sales of timber and firewood and by strenuous efforts to maintain the planting programme at <Col N="2540" /> the figure of 4,000 acres achieved, in the face of many difficulties, in the three preceding seasons.  No fresh supplies of rabbit netting were procurable and the problem of protecting new plantations presented even greater obstacles than had been encountered before.  The total area of planting last winter falls slightly short of 4,000 acres, which, in all the circumstances, is a creditable figure.</P>
    <P>During the autumn, there were hopes of being able to procure large supplies of wire netting from Great Britain.  These hopes were not fulfilled, and the extent of the planting programme for next winter, to which reference will be made later, will depend to a large extent upon the progress of negotiations which are going on at present for the release of supplies.</P>
    <P>The difficulties experienced in previous years in procuring seed have tended to increase.  Some seed has been obtained from Switzerland and some is promised from Spain, but whether arrangements can be made to have them shipped in time for sowing this season is not certain.  Seed has been ordered from America and one small consignment has arrived.  The bulk, however, has not been shipped and seems unlikely to arrive in time. To supplement the stocks of imported seed, and to avoid, if possible, any shortage, the collection of home-grown seed has been increased as much as possible, and if conditions in regard to import do not materially improve, much greater efforts to collect seed from stands of timber in this country must be made next winter.</P>
    <P>The net estimate for the current year shows an increase of £93,061 as compared with the provision for the year just passed.  The increase is due mainly to greater provision for the acquisition of land and the maintenance and development of areas already acquired.  There are also smaller increases for the salaries and travelling expenses of the headquarters staff, due to proposed increases in the inspectorate.</P>
    <P>The acquisition of land has been unusually difficult during the war period <Col N="2541" /> and the areas purchased have not been large enough to add materially to the reserve of land available for planting. In order to co-ordinate nursery and planting programmes, it is desirable to have in hands a reserve of land equal to at least three years' planting and it is advantageous to have a five-year reserve in hands, if at all possible.  As it is hoped to expand the planting programme, as soon as conditions permit, to at least 10,000 acres per annum, an increase in the rate of acquisition is much to be desired.</P>
    <P>With the resumption of activities by the Land Commission and a probable change in the attitude of owners of mountain grazings who, of late years, have been reluctant to dispose of their interest except at exorbitant prices, it is hoped to accelerate the rate of acquisition.  The increased provision now asked for, together with the balance carried over in the Land Acquisition Fund from last year, should be sufficient to meet the cost of any payments that will fall to be made during the present financial year.</P>
    <P>The census of the stocks of standing timber in the country has been completed and a summary of the results furnished to the Departments of Supplies and Industry and Commerce.  A more detailed report has been prepared and should provide valuable data as to quantities, qualities and situation of stocks of timber remaining in the country, should circumstances render it impossible, at a future date, to resume imports of timber upon the pre-war scale.  The services of the technical officers employed upon the census are now available for ordinary forestry work, and it is hoped to reduce to a minimum the delays in the inspection of timber proposed to be felled on private estates which resulted in past years from the abnormal number of felling notices received and the reduced number of officers available to deal with them.</P>
    <P>The amounts required under the different sub-heads of the Vote are set out in the printed Estimates and it is proposed to deal in detail only with those items which show appreciable <Col N="2542" /> differences as compared with those in the Vote for 1944-45.</P>
    <P>The increase under sub-head A&mdash; Salaries, Wages and Allowances, £26,024&mdash;is due, apart from normal increments and the increase in the cost-of-living bonus, to the appointment of three additional officers on the clerical staff in view of the expansion in the area of State forestry.  There is an increase in the sub-head for travelling expenses and an increase in the sub-head&mdash;Acquisition of Land (Grant-in-Aid). The provision under the latter head has been increased from £10,000 to £25,000.  It was explained last year that the falling-off in the acquisition of land was not due to any changes in policy but to temporary factors hindering the purchase of land used for rough mountain grazing and to the reduction in the activities of the Land Commission in taking over and dividing estates.  An expected improvement in either or both these factors will enable the forestry division to proceed with acquisition at a rate better suited to the needs of an increased planting programme and to add to the reserve of lands in hands.</P>
    <P>With regard to sub-head C (2)&mdash; Maintenance and Cultural Operations, £255,348&mdash;the provision required under this sub-head represents a substantial increase upon the amount voted last year.  It is based upon a projected planting programme of 6,000 acres next winter, the completion of which depends upon the possibility of securing the necessary supplies.</P>
    <P>During the year a large amount of road-making was done in the State forests to facilitate the extraction of mature timber and of poles from thinnings. These activities are being continued. Many plantations are due for thinning, and, though the material available is on the small side, there is a certain proportion fit for conversion into boxboards, etc.</P>
    <P>The provision of £3,728 in sub-head C (3)&mdash;Timber Conversion&mdash;is in respect of the working of four fixed mills.  Two of these, those at Dundrum, County Tipperary, and Cong, County Mayo, are worked continuously and are engaged in the cutting of timber for local requirements and the <Col N="2543" /> manufacture of fencing posts, gates, notice boards, etc.  The two remaining mills are situated at Avondale, County Wicklow, and Ballyfarnon, County Roscommon, and are worked only intermittently.</P>
    <P>There is provision for £1,000 in sub-head D&mdash;Grant for Afforestation Purposes. Despite the present difficulties in procuring plants and fencing materials, the increased grant for planting is meeting with a fair response and, accordingly, the provision under this sub-head has had to be increased by £400.  In fact, the amount necessary to meet all the applications which had been received would exceed the sum of £1,000 in the Estimates, but a number of applications were received after the appointed date.</P>
    <P>With regard to sub-head H&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid, £63,140&mdash;a decrease of £16,590 is anticipated under this heading, mainly through a reduction in the quantity of timber available for sale in large lots.  In fact, such a decrease was anticipated last year but did not eventuate as, owing to urgent demands received for timber required for commercial purposes, the Department was forced to put up for sale more lots than had been intended. This has reduced the amounts of mature timber still in the hands of the forestry division.  On the other hand, a small increase is expected in the receipts from local sales of small lots of timber.</P>
    <P>During the past year, about 18 large lots of timber, comprising 15,800 trees, were advertised and sold.  Fifty-two smaller lots, comprising 10,323 trees, were advertised locally and sold, in addition to 27 lots, comprising 66,560 poles, which were sold by auction or private treaty.</P>
    <P>The number of felling notices received last year showed a definite fall compared with the previous year but, on the other hand, breaches of the provisions of the Forestry Act are increasing. Excuse is frequently made that the trees felled were of no commercial value, or were required by the owner for his own use, as if these facts entitled the persons concerned to <Col N="2544" /> exemption from the provisions of the Act.  This is not so.  The position is that, except in a few unusual cases, specified in the Act, which only rarely occur, no person is entitled to cut down any trees without lodging a felling notice at the local Gárda station and giving the prescribed notice of 21 days.</P>
    <P>The position as regards replanting operations to be carried out as a condition of the granting of felling licences is still difficult.  Suitable plants are scarce and dear and rabbit netting, and indeed fencing wire of any kind, is practically unprocurable. Nevertheless, some persons have managed to comply with the terms of their licences.  Many others are genuinely unable to do so, even with the assistance of the grant of £10 an acre which is now payable.  In such cases the Department is willing to grant a reasonable extension of time, but this must not be taken to mean that the replanting condition will be waived.  Every case is brought up regularly for review and, when conditions return to normal, those who fail to carry out replanting obligations will be prosecuted.  Furthermore, failure to replant is a continuing offence and is not purged by payment of a fine. Prosecution may be repeated time after time until the replanting is satisfactorily carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>If timber imports cannot be resumed immediately after the war, I believe that we will be faced with a very serious problem.  If we have to rely on native supplies of timber, that may have very serious reactions on our timber supply position. I imagine that the reconstruction that will have to be faced after this war will be a world problem, and that we can hardly anticipate a favourable position so far as our necessary requirements are concerned. Thinking over the matter shows one clearly the necessity of paying much more attention to forestry.  I think that forestry may be described as the Cinderella in the house of Agriculture. Notwithstanding what the Minister said, when replying on the Vote for the Department of Lands, I want to repeat that I think more co-ordination is needed between the Department of <Col N="2545" /> Agriculture and the Forestry Department. As a matter of fact, if we were to have an ideal synthesis of land usage I think this service should be controlled by the Department of Agriculture. The Minister himself mentioned the difficulty of acquiring hill land for afforestation purposes.  The Forestry Department is merely interested in acquiring land for forestry purposes.  We are all aware of the fact that there has been a complete change in the outlook on the various uses of land in other countries.</P>
      <P>A good deal has been written on hill land for farming.  I suppose the Minister has read something of what Sir George Stapledon has written on the hills of Wales where, on bare, barren hills, they now have good vegetation and that land is being used for the production of food.  There is a problem here of utilising and developing such land for that purpose, or of deciding whether it should be used for afforestation purposes.  Perhaps the Minister, when replying, will tell us what Department makes a decision on that matter in the national interest. We would like to know whether, if the forestry section is interested in the land, it makes the decision, or whether the decision is made by the Department of Agriculture.  Where you have two interests involved there is almost certain to be a conflict.  If the matter of giving a decision is not under the control of the Department of Agriculture, I am of opinion that there should be full co-operation and co-ordination between the two Departments concerned in order to ensure that land that might be more profitably used for the greater production of food should not be used for the production of timber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to minimise the necessity of making use of every acre of land that it is possible to use for forestry purposes.  In my opinion, there is room for using a good deal of our hill land&mdash;a problem which we have not tackled at all&mdash;by improving it for food production, such as mutton. There is a good deal of land that may be looked upon by the Forestry Department as not being suitable for forestry purposes.  In other countries <Col N="2546" /> certain progress has been made in that respect.</P>
    <P>A good deal of research has been carried out with regard to the utilisation of certain types of bogs.  I wonder could the Minister tell us what amount of research we are doing here as to the possibility of introducing new methods of getting timber started on land that, in the past, was looked upon as being absolutely unsuitable for the purpose.  I think that, in our varying circumstances, it is absolutely essential that we should spend a considerable sum of money on research.  There is no specific provision in the Estimate for research work, but I imagine it could be combined with the ordinary activities of the Department.  It is essential that research work should be carried out. It may be that it is, but that failures have occurred, and that there are some skeletons in the cupboard so far as the forestry section is concerned.  I do not think there is anything wrong in that because you will never get anywhere without some failures.  The Department should not be afraid of attempting research work because of the possibility of meeting with failures.  We cannot hope to solve our problems so far as the utilisation of certain types of land is concerned&mdash; land that, in the past, was looked upon as being unsuitable for forestry purposes&mdash;unless we engage in research work.  I read some time ago that the Scandinavian countries are now making use of land that, in the past, was looked upon as being unsuitable for forestry.  They are getting over some of their difficulties by starting the young trees on the roots of the timber and are not sinking them in holes at all.  Research work is absolutely essential if we are to get anywhere.</P>
    <P>Over and over again we have been told in this House that, in order to grow commercial timber with success, the land must be fertile.  I suppose that has to be appreciated.  There are, however, certain types of rough bog lands that are capable of producing some sort of vegetation.  If research work were carried out it is quite possible <Col N="2547" /> we might find that land, which was hitherto considered unsuitable for forestry purposes, could be used for the production of timber.</P>
    <P>So far as private interests are concerned, I think that the increase in the grant from £4 to £10 per acre is to be welcomed, as well as the minimum reduction in the acreage from five acres to one acre.  I think that the attention of the agricultural community generally has not been focussed sufficiently on that matter.  I think that in the post-war period the Minister will have to make up his mind as to whether, in regard to this whole question of forestry, there should not be more publicity.  Something should be done to get the county committees of agriculture interested in it.  The average farmer is so busy in his ordinary avocation that he seldom finds time to look around and see if it is possible for him to plant one, two, or three acres of timber.  By making use of the county committees of agriculture it might be possible to stimulate private interest in this matter.  If that cannot be done, some other method will have to be employed.  So far, the interest of the average farmer has not been stimulated in forestry in any way.  I think it is necessary to get individual farmers all over the country interested in planting trees.  The Minister has not given us a picture of that matter so far as our supplies at the moment are concerned. I wonder would he be able to tell us what percentage of our present native supplies is coming directly from State forests and how far our supplies at present are relying on private sources. Possibly if we had these figures they might give us a relative picture of the position between the State supplies and the individual supplies.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister told us that a census of woodlands was being taken at present.  I wonder has that census been completed and, if so, will the Minister be able to tell us the result of it.  It should be very interesting. So far as the report is concerned, I think an attempt should be made to bring in an annual report.  After all, <Col N="2548" /> a report covering a period of five years is very often out of date before you see the next report.  I feel that there should not be any great difficulty in making it an annual report and, in that way, possibly focussing public attention on the matter of afforestation. As I said, I am not one of those who believe you can make a wonderful thing out of forestry; that forestry is more important than anything else.  There is a good lot of land, even hill land, which could be converted for agricultural purposes and give greater production nationally than afforestation.  For that reason I want to stress the point that we must have an authority that will decide definitely whether land should be used for forestry or whether it is suitable for agricultural purposes.  If the Stapledon methods are applied to the land of this country, there is a lot of land which appears to be bare and barren and growing vegetation which has little or no nutritious value which could be converted into suitable grazing. For that reason, there is a certain conflict between the two interests and the Department of Agriculture ought to be the Department to determine the purpose for which land should be used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is in the power of the Department to effect a fairly radical change in a state of things which has long existed in this country and which all of us, no matter what our political views may be, would like to see coming to an end, and that is the emigration of youth from this country.  If this problem of afforestation were properly tackled it would have two wonderful effects.  It would give immediate employment to the youth who would leave the country in the morning if facilities were granted to them.  Secondly, it would leave us in a position to be fairly free and independent of many outside factors.  A thing that was brought home to us very forcibly during this war was the shortage of timber, wood pulp and many other timber products. There is, particularly round the west coast, a vast stretch of waste land that is definitely unsuitable for any kind of farming or husbandry and which <Col N="2549" /> could be used for planting.  It may be argued that such land is not suitable for timber, or will not produce a fair quantity of commercial timber.  I cannot subscribe to that for this reason.  I know definitely that on a lot of the mountain land I speak about, apart from the fact that it is useless for any purpose of farming, such as the last speaker suggested, there are to be seen the remains of stumps and roots of trees which must have grown to a pretty vast size when they were there.  I do not think it can be suggested that the climate or other conditions have changed, since that would make that land unsuitable for planting and producing good quality commercial timber on a very big scale. In a portion of Connemara which was planted about 100 years ago I have seen spruce and many other kinds of timber of a fine size, and I have been told by timber experts that they are of the very best quality.</P>
      <P>I heard a rumour, I should like the Minister to say whether it is true or not, that a Continental expert was over here some time ago and condemned planting there as being an absolute waste of time and money on the ground that the climate and the soil were not suitable for growing timber.  I should like the Minister to say whether there is any truth in that rumour, because it is impossible to reconcile that with the fact that a short time ago excellent timber was grown all along the west coast on a belt of mountain land which is not worth 1/- per acre for sheep farming or any other purpose.  Most of it would want very little drainage and there is sufficient soil on it.  It would definitely be very beneficial to our climate if we could get this thing going.  The employment that the planting would provide would mean a big thing for the youth of the country and for the rising generation, not to speak of the vast amount of work which would be created when the timber comes to maturity and can be dealt with at home here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider tackling this question of afforestation on a very big scale, principally for the purpose of absorbing the youth and <Col N="2550" /> putting them to work so as to stop the steady stream of emigration.  If they are so useful to other countries such as England and America, it is a terrible thing that we cannot keep them at home and try to give them employment so that they can do something useful for the country during the best years of their life.  Another effect would be that we would be independent of foreign supplies.  There will be other wars in the future.  This will not be the last war by any means, while human nature remains as it is, and we will be caught in other emergencies. This would stop one gap and provide one useful source of supply of many timber products.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Each year I have complained to the Minister of the low wages paid by the Department to men engaged on this work of national importance. While I congratulate the Minister upon making some effort in this Estimate, to increase forestry work throughout the country, I regret that the Department are not treating the men engaged on that work as a Government Department should treat men who are engaged in an important service.  The foremen on this work are men who have to undergo a course of education.  These men are unestablished and are paid small wages and, after six months, if they become ill after being out in all classes of weather, they are left to depend upon national insurance benefit of 15/- per week. I maintain that these men should be established because they will be a great asset to this country in post-war days.  We should try to repay them for taking an interest in forestry.  We should put them on the established list and give them the same status as civil servants.  Some of them, to my own knowledge, often work from 18 to 19 hours per day.  It is no exaggeration to say that.  These men have to work many hours.  They have to make out the forestry programme for the workers, possibly a year in advance. They have to take charge of all accounts and pay the wages of all the workers.  They are responsible for the selling of the firewood and for sending returns to the Department. <Col N="2551" /> There is no leaving off at 5 o'clock for these men.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding their heavy duties, they are unestablished and there is no hope of security for them in their employment. I have known a number of them to leave their work here and go across to England.  The English people were delighted to accept these experienced men and they are employed there to-day.  We have young men in this country trained in the forestry service and one would think that we would avail of the services of these qualified men, but the fact is that they are not given employment here.  They find employment in Scotland, Wales and England under the Forestry Department there.  We had to educate them here and we gave them their degrees, but yet we cannot find work for them.  I suggest we will require the services, in the post-war period, of every man with a knowledge of forestry.  It was a lucky thing that we had a Forestry Department in this country during the past 25 years.  If forestry had not been encouraged, what would have become of the country during the past three years?  Our forests have been supplying firewood to the people of the cities and towns, helping them over the period when only native fuel was available.</P>
      <P>As regards unskilled labour, whatever may be the motive in the Forestry Department, the workers are paid less than the rate given to agricultural labourers.  These men are out working under all sorts of weather conditions and they have not the same privileges as the farm workers.  I will give the House just one example, and I am sure the Minister will not approve of it.  An experienced sawyer has the magnificent wage of 35/- a week.  The Minister for Local Government has promised to bring in a Bill to give pensions to men who have given service to public authorities, such as county councils and urban councils. The Forestry Department has decided not to grant pensions even to men who have given 25 and 27 years' service in forestry work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put a question to the Minister some time ago and he said it was not <Col N="2552" /> the intention of his Department to do anything in that direction.  There is no co-operation between the various Departments with reference to pensions for workers.  The Local Government Department will grant pensions, but the workers in the Forestry Department who do not receive as high a wage as municipal workers will not be granted pensions. There are many men in the Forestry Department who were doing forestry work previous to the establishment of this State.  These men are put on the scrap heap.  There are some who could not get an old age pension on the ground that they had received £39 in the previous year.  Pending the receipt of a pension, the home assistance authorities had to come to the rescue.  That is poor encouragement for men who might be anxious to undertake forestry work.  In the near future there may not be restrictions on men leaving the country and you will not get the younger men to take an interest in forestry, such as, for instance, was taken by the young men of 20 years ago, unless you make their employment attractive.</P>
    <P>If, as we are told, we have only two years' supply of timber in the country, commercial and otherwise, should we not become active to increase our supplies? Should we not take more land and employ a larger number of men in the rural areas?  One excuse given by the Department is that they are unable to get wire for fences.  I suggest you can get over the difficulty of the fencing.  You can get your seeds from Lisbon or other directions, plant your forests and have all the preparatory work carried out, and by the time the young trees come up you will have plenty of material for fencing.  If you have not the wire for fencing at the moment you have many capable men prepared to erect sod fences, such as were good enough 20 or 30 years ago, and, in that way, I believe we could do without wire fencing for many years to come.</P>
    <P>I heard complaints here yesterday about migrants being brought from various parts of the country and given holdings.  If they were living, as I am, in an area surrounded by woods, <Col N="2553" /> where the local people are unable to obtain a cart-load of timber, while lorry loads go to Dublin and other centres, they would have other grounds for complaint.  Military lorries and vehicles belonging to manufacturers and businessmen in Dublin and elsewhere take away all the timber from County Wicklow, while the local people cannot get a cartload.</P>
    <P>In the forestry plantations there is plenty of brushwood that would be of great benefit to local people, and to business people also.  It is being burned instead of being sold.  No doubt the forester has a good excuse for doing that.  Often when permission is granted to people to purchase firewood, one or two may take the property of somebody else or do some damage.  Instead of penalising all the people in the area, why not penalise the particular individuals concerned and prosecute them if necessary?  It is unfair that the whole area should be penalised for the action of one or two. The brushwood that would be of great use to the people in the villages and small towns is being burned on the instructions of the Department.</P>
    <P>Down in Rathnew and Newtown-mountkennedy the people are living near the woods and possibly some children may be found taking a few brambles.  The Guards make themselves busy and they bring them up in court, where they are fined 5/- and in some cases 10/- for timber worth 6d. or 1/.  People are told they must not go in on the land of a man who has 1,000 acres and thousands of trees. There are foreign gentlemen who came here and took over estates.  They will not sell a tree to the local people and if the children take away a few brambles to light the fire they are prosecuted and threatened by the district justice that they will be sent to reformatory schools.  How long is that state of affairs to continue?  How long will the local people submit to it? They are unable to get any other fuel, yet they are prevented from purchasing timber there, while any amount of it can be sent to Dublin and other places.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2554" /> If I were living in these areas and if I were without a fire I would consider self-preservation first of all and I would get a fire in spite of all the district justices.  I would not see the people in the area without a fire.  I had to go with others to one Englishman who has a big estate in my area. We had to humiliate ourselves in order to get five trees for the people during the Christmas season.  The Department of Forestry refused local people, but facilitated the sending of timber to Dublin.  Of course, Dublin is entitled to it and we would like to see the people of Dublin supplied with all they require, but we insist that we should get some consideration. Why not sell the brushwood in Newtownmountkennedy and Rathnew to the people in those areas?  There are some persons there prepared to buy it and cut it up into small lots and supply it to those who require firing.  I appeal to the Minister to make some concession to the men engaged in the Forestry Department, apart from the foremen, who I say should be established. These men have rendered national service to the community as a whole, but while the Government is receiving the controlled price for the timber from the Dublin Corporation and others, they are paying a starvation wage to the forestry workers.</P>
    <P>The Minister may state that they only work so many hours.  However, they have to work in all classes of weather; they often have to cycle five miles from their homes and then work another two or three miles up to the plantation.  The whole time is counted against them and they must be in by 8 or 8.30 in the morning and work until dark.  In many of the plantations, there are no shelters for the men. There may be some shelter in nurseries but they are often out in the rain and with wet clothes.  If they are not able to put in over a half-day, they are paid only for a quarter-day.  These are things which the Minister should take in hands himself and appeal to the Government about, apart from the stand-still Order.  These men should be given exceptional treatment.  They have rendered service to the nation and the least they expect from the <Col N="2555" /> Government is to be granted the same rights as are granted to other men engaged in work of national importance. A wage of 37/-, 38/- or 39/- maximum weekly is not a wage on which a man could maintain a family at the present time.</P>
    <P>We have no criticism of the officials of the Department.  We have to do business with them in connection with plantations in our county and there are very good relations between the officials and the staff.  The workers realise that it is not the officials' fault, but that of the Government, in not paying a proper rate of wages.  If we want these relations to continue and to get our younger people taking a greater interest in forestry work, changes must be made.  That can only be done through the Minister pressing on the Minister for Finance or the Government to give him the same facilities as other Ministers are securing for men engaged in their work.</P>
    <P>One Deputy suggested that we should link up the Forestry Department with the Department of Agriculture. I would be against that.  I would keep the Forestry Department separate, as it is at present, as in that lies whatever hope we have of any greater work of reafforestation.  That will only happen through one Department and not through having the work duplicated in the Department of Agriculture. Probably, the Deputy is not aware that, before any land can be taken for forestry, the Minister for Agriculture must be satisfied that it is not arable land suitable for agriculture. If he has in mind that, in the working of the two Departments, the Minister for Lands cannot acquire land for forestry if the Minister for Agriculture says it is arable land, why does he advocate that forestry should be given over to agriculture?</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I again ask the Minister to remember that the forestry workers' wages are out of all proportion to the cost of the things that they must buy.  I ask him to make some concession to those men and I hope he may be prepared, as well, to grant pensions in the case of the permanent staff, even if a special Bill is necessary for the purpose.</P>

      <P>Tá cúpla rud le rá agam ar an Meastachán so.  Tá an fhorbairt so ar nós cuma liom leis an Rialtas agus bhí sé mar sin leis an Rialtas deireannach.  Níl siad i ndáiríribh i dtaobh na ceiste seo ar chor ar bith, agus ní raibh an Rialtas deireannach i ndáiríribh ar an gceist chéanna ach an oiread.  I am very much inclined to come round to the viewpoint of the late Mr. Mackey, who I thought at one time was a crank, and to the point of view of the late Deputy Dowdall, on the question of the neglect of forestry by this Government and the previous Government. This sub-Department is the Cinderella of every Government; any old thing at all is good enough and any old report at all will do.</P>
      <P>I remember when there was a very long debate here on this Department and when certain Deputies from the Opposition and from this side of the House pointed to the experiments in France in forestry.  The then Minister in charge of this Department said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is all right talking about France and comparing it with this country, but France depends for a lot of her fuel on her forests; consequently, it is very necessary to have big forestry undertakings in France.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This war has brought home forcibly to me and to everyone else how necessary were the forests and the want they filled in the lack of coal and, in certain areas, in the lack of turf, during the emergency.  It behoves us at this late hour to take cognisance of the fact that our timber supplies have been depleted.  I suggest that even the statistics at the Minister's command do not tell the full story and that, for every tree reported cut, there was another cut.  The longer this war continues the more depleted will our timber stocks become.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have all read again and again that, outside Iceland, we have less timber than any country in Europe. I was reading about Belgium in a little booklet issued to Deputies and other people.  There is an immense population there and they cannot have golf courses or racecourses, but they <Col N="2557" /> make sure to provide an area for forestry, even though there are 730 people to the square mile.  We are not doing anything like that; we are only tinkering with the problem.  My county is, after Wicklow, probably the best afforested county in the 26. I respectfully suggest to Deputy Hilliard that there is very little forestry in County Meath at all, but the Department take the inspectors and everyone connected with it and put them into an adjoining county, away from their work altogether.</P>
    <P>I have found that there is complete ignorance in the Department on this whole question.  If you brought all the State officials of the Department down to a plantation and asked them to point out hard wood and soft wood, I suppose not one of them could do it. They are just there for the purpose of passing through the Civil Service and serving their period of time before going on for promotion.  They are not a bit in earnest.  Some of them in the office may be, but those at work out in the country have not even the courtesy to reply to a letter in which representations are made.</P>
    <P>In our post-war planning, we should get down to facts and see that the Forestry Act of 1928 is enforced.  Sub-section (2) of Section 28 gives the Minister, where trees are felled or a forest is cut away, to order the owner of the land to grow one or more trees, within 12 months.  And yet someone told me there was no such period in that office, and that it might be five, ten or 20 years when the order would be given to the owner of the land &mdash;notwithstanding that sub-section. There is a wholesale evasion of that section of the Act, in Westmeath, at any rate.  Acres of oaks have been felled to provide fuel for the people in the cities and towns and the Order to plant as many trees as are cut has been met in a way that was not intended in the Act.  If 20 acres of trees were cut down in a particular place, the owner comes along and plants the same number in three acres. These trees will choke one another in five or six years, but the man has complied with the Act.  If the Minister <Col N="2558" /> or the Department thinks that I am talking rubbish, I will give them details of cases all over the County Westmeath where this is happening and where the land is being used for rough grazing.  The man in question may enclose a small area and buy a lot of trees from some nursery in Wicklow and plant them in that small area, any way at all.  That complies with the Act.  The sooner that is ended the better for the country.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Deputy Blowick speaking about the West of Ireland. Experts from other countries have told us that trees cannot be grown above a certain altitude or in certain areas. Yet roots of substantial trees have been found in these places that have been grown, as Deputy Blowick said, within the last 100 years.  The climate has not changed much in that time and it is time to call the game of these advisers.  I remember reading articles on forestry in relation to North Scotland, where the ground is very barren, where the climate is very severe.  Certain rough grasses were grown at first, followed by certain kinds of gorse, and so on, until they established a hold for certain spruces and larches.  That could be done in the West and it would not have to be done in such a meticulous and careful way as it was done in Scotland.  It would be well to send trained foresters to Scotland to see the practical work that has been done there.  I think Deputy Everett mentioned the fact that some of our men have been taken from the Forestry Department and have got good employment on the other side.  It would be no harm if they were to be taken back.  It would be well to end the make-believe that I believe is carried on in the Forestry Department.  I sincerely hope that in post-war planning Section 8 of the 1928 Forestry Act will be put into operation and, if necessary, that a more comprehensive Forestry Act will be introduced and that we will take a realistic view of the necessity of having good timber for our fuel requirements.</P>

      <P>Deputy Everett has already referred to points I have in mind in regard to this Vote, that is, <Col N="2559" /> the matter of the sale of brushwood and the sale of firewood in general. I am not quite sure whether or not I am in order in referring to the question of the sale of brushwood, inasmuch as the Order in regard to the sale of brushwood was not issued by the Forestry Department but by the Department of Supplies.  I should like, in view of the statement made by Deputy Everett, that he should be aware of the fact that this brushwood had to be burned in the plantations where timber was being cut by the Forestry Department, I presume, to get it out of the way, because the particular Emergency Powers Order made it impossible for the people who were making a living out of the purchase and sale of that brushwood and who were providing the poorer classes in certain villages and towns in County Wicklow with cheap fuel.  Because of that Order the people who purchased the firewood were deprived of a certain livelihood and the people to whom the firewood would be sold were prevented from receiving a cheap fuel.  I appeal to the Minister, in order that there will be no waste of firewood at the present time, even brushwood, to approach the Department of Supplies to secure some relaxation of that Order.</P>
      <P>As regards the sale of timber in general, which would include firewood of a certain diameter out into blocks &mdash;I think the maximum laid down is something in the nature of nine inches &mdash;I am not prepared to agree with my colleague, Deputy Everett, that that firewood is sent to Dublin by the Forestry Department.  I agree that it may be sent but if the merchants in the towns adjacent to these forests, who have taken upon themselves responsibilities when they asked for a permit as fuel merchants, apply to the Forestry Department, I am sure the Forestry Department will give them all they require.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not dispute the point with the Deputy but, on the face <Col N="2560" /> of it, I think if it is the case, it is an absurd position.  In connection with the sale of timber in general, including commercial timber, suggestions have been made to me that certain timber merchants&mdash;I will call them master timber merchants to indicate the type of people I refer to&mdash; men who know their jobs and can compute the number of cubic feet of timber in a particular plantation to practically 5 of a cubic foot, having got cute in their jobs, when forwarding estimates to the Forestry Department for timber advertised for sale, in order to secure the timber have sent in estimates far above the valuation of the cubic content of timber within the particular plantation.  Afterwards they go to the Forestry Department and say: &ldquo;There are my returns.  I made a mistake.  There were only so many cubic feet of timber in the whole plantation,&rdquo; and, I am informed, they are recouped.  I have tried to qualify that statement by saying that I was informed and I am certain, knowing the Minister as I do, that were he aware that that was happening, it would not happen again.  I simply take advantage of this discussion to bring it to the Minister's notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether it is true or not, but I assure the House that it has definitely been stated to me by at least two timber merchants that it has happened and that men could not secure a particular piece of plantation adjacent to them when they were entitled to their fair share of the allocation of timber being sold by the Department.  The men themselves believe that it has happened, and I know for a fact that they employed an expert, formerly employed by the Department, to compute the amount of timber in a particular plantation in order to get it.  They were prepared to offer, and did offer, a few pounds extra, but they did not get it.  It was secured by another individual.  I bring the matter to the Minister's notice because I am certain that he will take action, if action is to be taken in the matter.  I hope I am wrong.  It is hard to believe that such a thing is happening, but I simply bring to his notice that statement <Col N="2561" /> made to me by two responsible timber merchants, constituents of mine, and I think I am justified in doing so.</P>
    <P>With regard to the wages of Forestry Department employees, I should like to see every man, skilled and unskilled, and particularly unskilled, receiving a living wage, and I think that the very nature of the work done by a man employed in the Forestry Department for a certain period places him more or less in the category of a semi-skilled worker.  I maintain that such a man should receive at least the same wages as are paid to the average agricultural worker.  I should like also to support Deputy Everett in his references to the foresters employed by the Department. We probably have in County Wicklow more men engaged on that work than any other county and we have also in Avondale a college, which, I presume, the Department hopes will provide training for young men in this type of work, men who will carry on this young industry, if I may so describe it, and which we hope to see flourishing in the post-war period.</P>
    <P>Most of these young men have had a secondary education and, before securing their present positions, were compelled to pass a Civil Service examination, and taking into consideration the fact that we shall have to depend largely on both the practical and technical knowledge of these young men, their lot should be so secured as to make them satisfied.  I make a special appeal to the Minister, in conjunction with Deputy Everett, to take the necessary steps to see that these individuals will become established officers and so give them an incentive to take that keen interest in their work which will be so necessary in the post-war period and, at the same time, put them in the position of being assured that, having given good national service, the country will show its appreciation by providing pensions for them in their old age.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the debate on Lands, the debate on Forestry has followed the usual course.  We get a number of ideas promulgated which <Col N="2562" /> have been exploded year after year.  I am anxious for the development of forestry on as broad a scale and as quickly as possible, but when Deputies criticise the work done over the past 12 months by the Forestry Department, they apparently fail to grasp the fact that almost 4,000 acres have been planted, and properly planted, and that never until about 1934 was the amount of land planted reached by those concerned with forestry.</P>
      <P>There is only one major difficulty in preventing an expansion of forestry in this country.  There are temporary difficulties such as the securing of proper supplies of wire netting, etc., but the real difficulty in preventing any expansion of forestry is that we are unable to get sufficient land.  In many areas of the country, where the land is reasonably suitable for forestry purposes, it is impossible to secure it because, the owners of it, or those who have rights over it, believe that it is much more profitable to them in the way of sheep-grazing than it would be in the amount they would get from the Department of Lands by way of purchase. We are hopeful that, with the coming of the post-war years, there will be a change of viewpoint in regard to the holding of these lands.  If we could secure a good pool of land it would be possible for us to bring the annual planting from 4,000 acres up to 10,000 acres.  Some Deputies talked glibly about planting 20,000 acres per year, but it is not possible, feasible or wise at any time, in my opinion, to increase the average planting above the amount of 10,000 acres, a figure which we can easily reach if it is possible for us to secure the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hughes asked who makes a decision in regard to the land that is to be acquired for forestry, and if the Department of Agriculture were concerned in that.  The Department of Lands and the Department of Forestry are interlocked, and a decision is always made in regard to lands in the process of being acquired as to whether they are capable of utilisation for agricultural purposes or whether they would be more suitable for forestry. Deputy Hughes seems to be obsessed, like Mr. Dick, with a King <Col N="2563" /> Charles's head.  He is always quoting Sir George Stapledon as to what has been done in the hills and valleys of Wales.  Macaulay predicted at one time that there would be a population of 30,000,000 in England, and that Ben Nevis would be cultivated to the top. He was wrong in both prophecies.  I am sure that so far Sir George Stapledon has not quite succeeded in cultivating Ben Nevis to the top. Whether he has or not, it is amazing to me that with all this reclamation of land for agricultural purposes in England, there is also in England a tremendous programme indicated for post-war years in forestry development. You cannot have it both ways.  If you are going to have land for forestry it must be taken from some other activity.  Our idea is to try to secure every acre of land possible for the development of forestry.  The only thing that would prevent the development of forestry is the possibility of not being able to secure land.</P>
    <P>When Deputies, like Deputy Blowick and others, produce the ancient argument about the land they have seen with magnificent roots of trees on it, where forests must have flourished hundreds of years ago, they are taking no cognisance of climatic changes and soil changes, and when they criticise the opinions of various experts who, as a result of their knowledge and experience, express the opinion that timber will not grow in certain soils, under certain climatic conditions, one may ask to whom are we to go if we do not accept their viewpoint? Surely, if we do not accept the advice of the man who has made a life-long study of the soils requisite for forestry, we have no one else whose opinion is worth taking.  Deputy Blowick suggests that if we carry on forestry at a fast rate we are going completely to solve the problem of unemployment in certain areas of the country.  I wish we could find some swift and easy solution, like the development of forestry, for unemployment in the West.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy referred to the late Mr. John Mackey, and said that <Col N="2564" /> he is coming more and more to the point of view expressed by the late Mr. Mackey and the late Deputy Dowdall.  Some of us never grow up. When, many years ago, I first read Mr. Mackey's book, I introduced Deputy Dowdall to the book, and this had peculiar results.  I, too, knowing nothing of forestry, and being enthused for development of the country, took everything that Mr. Mackey said for granted.  Mr. Mackey's contribution to forestry was that he made a great number of people think about it, but if one half of what Mr. Mackey said in his various books on forestry were based on fact, the best long-time investment that any private individual could make would be in forestry.  Everybody knows that in this country you cannot do the things that Mr. Mackey advocated, and even if you did do them, you would be lucky to get 3 per cent. of the results that he foretold from them.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Everett who suggested that we might proceed at a faster rate if we ignored wire and put up the fences that we put up 30 years ago.  I do not know what the conditions were in forestry 30 years ago, but I assume that rabbits were as numerous then as they are now.  The position is that the ordinary fence is not a protection for young forests against rabbits.  You must have wire.  Otherwise, you cannot go on with forestry. Deputy Brennan has spoken of the manner in which the forestry section disposes of some of its woods.  We cannot sell timber to any merchant who has not got a licence from the Department of Supplies.  When we sell that timber to such a licensee, there is the obligation on us to sell it to him at the controlled price.  If the Department could freely put up timber for sale by auction, it is possible that, in many cases, much higher prices could be secured, but we are bound by the regulated price, and we are bound to sell only to the man who has got a licence from the Department of Supplies. That regulation is a very necessary one.  It is customary that the Forestry Department should try as <Col N="2565" /> far as possible, within these limitations, to give the timber to their customers, to men who have been engaged in the round timber trade and who were doing a good deal to help forestry in the country before the war situation came about.  But nowadays, because there are profits in timber, because timber supplies have been cut off from us in a great measure from overseas, many other people who are not at all capable of handling the round timber trade have come into the trade.  Therefore, so far as they can, the Forestry Department should deal with reputable dealers and firms who had been handling effectively the round timber trade in this country before the war.</P>
    <P>The question of forestry labourers was raised by Deputy Everett.  Here again the Forestry Department cannot take isolated action.  Forestry labourers are paid very slightly less than agricultural labourers in the districts where they work.  Whatever the agricultural rate is, the forestry rate is 1/- less per week.  Deputies must remember that the forestry workers have a 48-hour week as against the agricultural labourers' 54-hour week.</P>
    <P>With regard to the sales of timber to Dublin and Wicklow, I am rather shocked at Deputy Everett.  Deputy Flanagan has had a very bad influence in this House.  He makes idiotic threats about what he will do.  I heard a speech at one time by the Governor of New Jersey who, when he was doing a most outrageous thing, said: &ldquo;I am the law.&rdquo;  Deputy Flanagan in regard to land wants to be the law.  I do not like to see Deputy Flanagan leading decent Deputies like Deputy Everett by the nose.  Deputy Everett said: &ldquo;If I was without timber, whatever the district justice would say or the law would say, I would get it.&rdquo;  Why should a responsible Deputy be trying to promote illegalities in this country?  The only way we can help the people of this country is by the rule of law.</P>
    <P>Deputy Everett knows that the Department of Supplies have had to make certain regulations for the disposal <Col N="2566" /> of firewood.  He also knows that very few people in Wicklow were affected by them.  He also knows that very many people in Wicklow thought they saw something for nothing.  Are not these the facts?  The stuff is being given at a very cheap rate.  Wherever we have windfalls or brushwood or undergrowth, the local people always benefit by them.  They get the stuff at a very cheap rate and, in many cases, at no rate at all.  It is necessary now and again for the safety of the forests that brushwood and undergrowth shall be cleared immediately; that it shall be burned.  It is much more essential that the safety of the forests shall be taken into consideration rather than the fact that a very few people might be accommodated with a small quantity of valueless brushwood.  I am more satisfied with the Forestry section of the Department of Lands than I am with any other section.  I think that the people in the Forestry section are really forestry-minded and very much in earnest about promoting forestry.  I think that they know their job thoroughly and are doing their job thoroughly.  If we can get Deputies to persuade their people to think better of forestry in this country, if we can get the 10,000 acres, there will be no difficulty about the planting of it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy raised a point which is forgotten, that in many areas in this country that I know of, within the past five or six years people have had to travel 20 and 30 miles to cut their own turf; that the bogs will run out and possibly we may not be able to develop alternative sources of fuel. Deputy Kennedy pointed out that the French people depend almost entirely on the forests for fuel.  We will be reduced at some stage to the point where we will need for fuel purposes alone a tremendous amount of growing timber, apart from commercial timber. I would urge Deputies everywhere to try to encourage among their people a belief in the development of forestry.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation. The place I referred to has no State plantation.  The estate for the last five years has been owned by Englishmen who refuse to give a tree to the people in the area.  Unfortunately, <Col N="2567" /> we have no Government plantations in that area.  It was that estate I referred to when I said that I would not be without timber.  These poor people see the timber passing their doors every day and children were prosecuted for taking brambles out of the demesne.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately I was not present during the debate and I should like to ask a question.  There are two rivers in my area which are doing a great deal of injury as a result of the clay from the forestry station forming into silt.  There are five or six farms between the forestry station and the place where another river joins the Suir.  The owners of these lands are suffering a lot as a result of the silt which has been formed.  I should like to know whether it is the business of the Minister's Department or the Department of Agriculture to clean these up.  I will give the Minister details, and I am sure he will be very helpful, as he always is.  I have visited the Department on half a dozen occasions and I have always found them very helpful.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to people who were in the business before the war as the only people who got permits.  These people are not dealing in timber at all now, because the controlled price of 2/- per cwt. does not pay them to cut down the timber and sell it in small lots.  In Enniscorthy we can get no timber.  I saw timber wagons being loaded on a Sunday out of a certain wood and brought to Dublin, while the poor people in Enniscorthy cannot get any timber, although the town is surrounded by woods.  Owing to the bad turf they are getting, the poor people are cursing both of the Departments concerned owing to the hardships they are undergoing.</P>

      <P>A Chinn Chomhairle, is doiligh dom mo bheannacht a thabhairt don Mheastachán seo agus é laghdaithe mar tá sé.  Níl amhras nach dtig maitheas agus tairbhe as an méid airgid a chaitear ar Sheirbhísí na Gaeltachta.  Ach nuair a chímid na milliúin atáthar a chaitheamh gan suim, gan áird agus gan mórán tairbhe ar nitheanna eile níl iongantas go mbeinn ag éagaoin ar laghdú an mheastacháin seo.  Tá fhios againn go bhfuil an Fhó-Roinn seo ag riar do na ceanntair is boichte sa tír&mdash; Muintir na Gaeltachta&mdash;agus níor chóir go mbeadh Rialtas na tíre truaighlithe nó ceachardha leo. <Col N="2573" /> Níl aon locht agam ar na hoifigigh atá i mbun na hoibre.  Tá gach duine acu ar a dhícheall agus oibríonn siad go cneasta, dúthrachtach.  Ní beag an chuspóir a chuir siad rompu&mdash;bláth agus rath a chur ar an Ghaeltacht, cosg a chur leis an imirce, an teanga a dhaingniú ann, teas agus téagar a thabhairt isteach sna tithe bochta, saol ur-nuadh a thabhairt do na daoine seo a bhí fá chruatan agus fá leatrom ó rugadh iad, caoi a thabhairt do lánúnacha óga pósadh agus dul i gcionn tighe dóibh fhéin&mdash;sin an clár oibre atá ag an Fhó-Roinn. Tá tús maith déanta ag na hoifigigh cheana féin ach beidh sé blianta go fóil go bhfeictear toradh a gcuid saothair.</P>
      <P>Ni fheicimse dóigh ar bith eile leis an Ghaeltacht a shábháil ach tionnscail a chur ar bun a fhóirfeas do gach ceanntar a bhfuil an Ghaeilge beo mar ghnáth-chaint ag na daoine.  Is fearr seo go mór na an &ldquo;brúgh&rdquo; nó oibreacha fóirthine.  Ach mar duairt mé cheana féin tá níos mó airgid agus níos mó uirnís de dhíth má táthar le tarrtháil cheart a thabhairt ar iomlán na Gaeltachta.  Anois an t-am leis an obair seo a dhéanamh.  Tá an Ghaeltacht ag éirí níos lú gach bliain atá ag dul tharainn.  Níl níos mó ná deich bparáistí sa tír uilig a dtig linn a rá go bhfuil an Ghaeilge beo ar bhéal na ndaoine.  Dá mbeadh an méid sin féin faoi chúram Seirbhísí na Gaeltachta nár mhaith an chéim ar aghaidh é? Chuirfí stad leis an mheath, chuirfí na daoine óga le ceird, d'fhanfadh siad i mbun a muintire sa bhaile agus ní bheadh an giodar orthu ag imeacht go tíortha eile.  Molaim mar sin obair na Fó-Roinne.  Tá siad ar an chosán ceart ach go bhfuil an cosán sin cumhang fá láthair de dhíobháil airgid.  Leanadh siad den obair agus leathnaíodh siad amach é ar fud na Gaeltachta.  Is féidir, ar ndóigh, tionnscal éigin d'fháil a fhóireas do gach ceanntar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá fhios againn uilig anois gur coinníodh barraíocht de na tionnscail seo sna cathracha agus sna bailte móra. Nach bhfeiceamaid Baile Átha Cliath ag spréadh amach mar aillse mhór ar chorp na tíre&mdash;aillse atá ag diúl fuil agus feoil aosa óig na tuaithe. B'fhearr go mór d'ár muinntir dá mbeadh na tionscail seo scaptha thail <Col N="2574" /> as i bhfus ar fud na hEireann ach go háithrid sa Ghaektacht.  An sin thiocfadh a rá go raibh na Rialtas i ndáiríre fá leas muintire na tuaithe agus Gaeil na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Is maith liom a admháil go bhfuil obair mhór déanta ag an Roinn sa taobh ó dheas de Thír Chonaill.  Ansion tá suas le trí chéad fíodóir ag obair faoi stiúradh Seirbhísí na Gaeltachta Tá na fíodóirí seo ag obair sa bhaile agus ag déanamh obair a gcuid gabhál tas beag chomh maith.  Ar feadh blianta an chogaidh d'fhigh na fíodóirí seo níos mó ná milliún go leith slat de bháinín do mhuintir na tíre seo nuair nach rabh fáil air ó aon cheann eile. Ba cheart sin a choinneáil i gcuimhne do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Tá muintir Thír Chonaill ag leanstan den tionnscal seo na holla mar is é is fearr fhóireas dóibh agus táim ag iarraidh ar an Rialtas gach cuidiú agus treoir a thabhairt dóibh leis an tionnscal seo a choinneáil buan-tseasmhach.  Táim ag iarraidh ar an Rialtas réiteach a dhéanamh anois sa chruth go mbeidh margadh don bháinín nuair a bheas an cogadh thart agus éadach eile fairsing sa tír.</P>

Bhí leithscéal an chogaidh againn é a bheith chomh fada ar an bhealach ach d'fhéadfaí an muileann seo a bheith againn sul ar thosaigh an cogadh. Táimid ag caint air ó 1936.  Tá súil agam nach mbeidh sé i bfhad anois go mbeidh na hinnill agus an gléasra uilig in ordú agus an muileann faoi lánréim-seoil.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The remarks I have to make on this Estimate will be confined to the question of the homespun industry.  The Minister, in submitting the Estimate, gave us very little information as to the plans he has in mind for the future of this industry. The Emergency Powers Order under which homespun is produced and marketed has been in operation for some 18 months, and at the conference at which the question of putting that Order into operation was discussed the representatives of the homespun producers were led to believe that not only would the Department purchase the material, but that they would also assist the producers in various ways.  We were given to understand that the spinners and weavers would be classified, that instruction <Col N="2576" /> would be given in dyeing the materials, that finer wool would be introduced, and that expert advice would be available at every stage of manufacture.  I regret to say that very little, if any, effort has been made to do anything along these lines.  The Department seem to be quite content with attending at the various marketing centres, purchasing the materials, and allowing producers to carry on producing whatever type of cloth they think fit themselves.  It is generally recognised by everybody with any experience of it that there is no industry that has proved such a boon to the people in the congested districts in the Gaeltacht as this industry.  It was providential that we had in Donegal, and to a lesser extent elsewhere, people who carried on that tradition and who retained the craft of spinning and weaving, and were able through the difficult years that we have passed through to produce cloths that, to some extent at all events, met the deficiency in our supplies.  Consequently, it would not be too much to expect from the Department whose special function it is to cater for the people in these areas that they would give more practical assistance in the way of further development of the industry than is being done at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When speaking on this Vote last year I enumerated some of the disabilities under which the producers labour.  I am afraid that my suggestions on that occasion fell on deaf ears. At the risk of repeating myself, I will again draw the Minister's attention to some of the suggestions that were made.  They are suggestions that are made by people in the homespun industry; people who know it inside out and people who are anxious for the further development and maintenance of the industry in these areas. Complaint has been made that individual producers have to purchase dyes, for instance, at black market prices.  Dyes that, ordinarily, in prewar days cost 1d. or 2d. or some small figure per ounce cannot be purchased now for less than half-a-crown.  The oil used for processing the wool is being purchased in the Gaeltacht at 3/6 per pint, and the cards used for <Col N="2577" /> the hand processing of the wool cannot be got for less than 19/6 per pair.</P>
    <P>We complain about the price of the finished article, but, if the cost of production were brought down, it would be a great assistance to the people in the Gaeltacht, because the present prices of materials represent a considerable addition to their cost of production. They suggest that if it were possible for the Department to purchase dyes for resale to the producers, to get oil at market prices and to provide for the manufacture of cards and their sale to the producers at reasonable prices, the costs of production would be reduced considerably.  These articles could be distributed by the officials who have to go round to the different centres to purchase cloth, and there is no reason why we could not have distributing centres for such articles as these.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal of dissatisfaction, too, with the system of purchasing cloth.  The producers feel that they have no say whatever in the price, that they are at the mercy of an official who examines their web of cloth and fixes a price without giving any indication of how he arrives at it, and which they have to take or leave. I can quote one instance which will show why there is so much dissatisfaction. A producer brought his cloth to centre A.  The official examined the 40 or 50 yards in the web and offered 4/6 per yard for it.  The producer felt that it was a very low price, that the cloth was worth more, and decided not to sell but to bring it home.  He got somebody else in the district to bring the cloth a fortnight later to centre B, where the same official examined it.  It was entered in a different name from that of the original producer. He offered 6/- per yard on that occasion.  I think the Minister will agree that a system under which that can occur is one which should be inquired into.  I have heard of several such cases but in the case which I have mentioned I am prepared to give dates and the names of the parties concerned.  I am quite satisfied that I have been correctly informed with regard to that case and I <Col N="2578" /> feel that something should be done to remedy such a state of affairs.</P>
    <P>There does not seem to be very much attempt on the part of the officials dealing with these matters down the country to keep producers informed as to the designs, type and texture of cloth, and so on, required.  The producers are left to carry on on their own lines.  If the cloth they produce is not considered satisfactory by the officials, they get a low price, that being the only indication they get that the cloth they are manufacturing is not the right type.  Gaeltarra Eireann have a complete monopoly of the purchase of this material and they ought to endeavour to be scrupulously fair to the producers.  I can assure the Minister and the Department that the producers are only too anxious to meet the Department's wishes in every respect, so far as the improvement and the development of the industry are concerned, because they realise that practically their very existence depends on the success of the homespun industry; and it should be possible, with the expert staff at the disposal of the Department, to give greater help in the way of advice to the producer as to what the Department requires of them, of supplying them with designs, and so on, than has been given up to the present.</P>
    <P>The producers of the handspun material, as distinct from the material woven from machine spun yarn, are anxious to secure, and are organising a movement at present to secure, for their special article a special stamp. This matter has been raised with the Minister and his predecessors several times and there is nothing new that one can say about it.  The Department has the example of the Harris tweed manufacturers to guide them.  The special mark which they suggest should be adopted would have the effect of distinguishing their material, material made in their homes from native wool, from the material made from machine spun yarns.</P>
    <P>If the industry is to be kept going as a cottage industry, something along those lines will have to be adopted. The Minister will agree that any attempt at developing it on factory lines, <Col N="2579" /> taking it out of the people's homes, would be fatal for the industry.  There is none of the suggestions which I have offered which cannot be carried out with very little effort on the part of the Department.  They have their staffs in the districts concerned, and there is no reason why they should not help the people in the way I suggest.</P>
    <P>Having offered that criticism, I want to express my appreciation of the way in which the officials have met me.  I had occasion many times during the past year to approach the Minister and officials of the Department to make representations with regard to various matters connected with the industry, and I always found both the Minister and his officials very anxious to meet, so far as they could, anyone interested in the industry.  If the Minister is able to keep down the costs of production, this industry will continue. The Department's aim should be to continue it, and, if the Department is able to keep it alive, to enable it to continue after the emergency, and to establish a market for it in the post-war years, they will have to a very large extent solved the problem of the uneconomic holder in the Donegal Gaeltacht.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one observation with regard to the position of homespun hand-woven material. The Minister ought to have it taken off the coupons at once.  My experience, and I think the experience of most retail distributors in Ireland, is that, for the last four or five years people have largely been constrained to purchase tweeds owing to the scarcity of other woollen materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The natural trend of fashion is to change.  We may expect that supplies of alternative coatings will shortly be coming on the market.  It would be most desirable to give the homespun industry the added advantage of being coupon free, at least during the early stages of the acute competition which it will have to meet when alternative cloths become available.  Already, the Minister for Supplies has made the coupon charge for these cloths lower <Col N="2580" /> than the coupon charge for analogous cloths, but that advantage will not be sufficient during the next year or two.</P>
    <P>I am particularly anxious that this should be done for this reason.  I had always hoped that the hand-woven, handspun cloth should be developed on the same lines as the Harris tweed, and that, if so developed, it would capture for itself a foreign market, because it is on the foreign market that the ultimate destiny of this industry will depend.  We cannot hope to find for that cloth the luxury foreign market on which it will ultimately depend in the period immediately after the war.  We cannot hope to find that market for about 18 months or two years after the war, but we have got to keep the industry going in the meantime.  We may reasonably anticipate that, even though the emergency were over to-morrow, woollen cloths in general will remain rationed, and so we might very well carry the homespun industry over what might otherwise be a very lean period indeed.  In parts of the country there are surplus coupons, and the concession that I suggest is not going to be a very material one.  It will be of some help, and it will have the added advantage that shopkeepers will try to sell the homespun textiles because at present, unless you have coupons to surrender if you are a shopkeeper, you cannot get supplies of cloth.  There are some shopkeepers who have not got very large quantities of coupons at their disposal and rather than let their shelves go bare they would buy these hand-woven tweeds and enter eagerly into the task of selling them.  If they have not an inducement of that kind they are going to find themselves up against the natural inclination of people to turn to something new.  In that situation shopkeepers will naturally purchase the merchandise which is most readily sold.</P>
    <P>I have always regarded the hand-woven material made from machine yarn as a menace to the really valuable cottage industry in this country. The hand-woven textile made from machine yarns has no future what ever.  Modern technique can produce a much more attractive fabric on a machine loom from machine-made <Col N="2581" /> yarns than the hand weaver can ever hope to do.  The beauty of the hand-woven, hand-spun cloth is that once a piece of it is made by the people in West Donegal or in Connemara&mdash;once the web of cloth is made from that material&mdash;no one can ever reproduce it.  The individuality that is incorporated in the homespun yarn is such that no living creature can ever repeat it.  That gives it an exclusive character which always has a value in the luxury market.  If you are going to supply people with aniline dyed yarns, machine spun, then you can get 40 webs of the same cloth.  One web might be better woven than another. You might get these webs from Leeds or from Pennsylvania.  In West Donegal and Connemara the home dyes are manufactured from flowers which the people have traditionally used.  With these they dye the hand-spun yarns which are used in the manufacture of first-class hand-woven textiles.  I have seen a piece of cloth woven in Connemara by a Connemara woman, spun by herself from her own wool, and dyed by herself from dyes that she herself made.  These cloths were woven by herself in her own kitchen, and I declare to the House that I would be prepared to prove anywhere in the world that the garment manufactured from that yarn was equal to the product of any Paris fashion house.  It was superior to most of them, and had a distinctive colouring that no aniline dye could ever reproduce.  There was the additional advantage that a lady wearing a costume made from that web cloth could be quite certain that she would never meet a neighbour wearing one like it. Deputy Brady or myself might not be able to distinguish the difference between the two costumes, but no woman would fall into the error of imagining that any imitation was the same cloth.</P>
    <P>If we can cling fast to that, there is a future for that tweed in this country. But if we are seduced from it by any consideration, or if we are deterred from pursuing it by any passing difficulty, I solemnly assure the House that the hand-woven industry will disappear out of the country.  I know that in West Donegal and in Connemara, if we can keep up the pressure, we can <Col N="2582" /> produce a textile as good and better than any put on the Paris market.  With regard to Deputy Brady's speech, I know that it will look well in the columns of the <i>Derry Journal.</i>  The people have the ability to do the job right, but they want to have pressure put on them.  My advice to the inspectors of the Department is to put on the pressure.  Perhaps I would not be so frank if I were still a member for West Donegal, but in the long run the people of West Donegal will realise that I am their real friend when I say: &ldquo;Let the Department inspectors who are competent to handle this business be ruthless in driving out of the industry the fraudulent weaver that tries to get top price for second-rate material.&rdquo;  There is no room in this trade for defective material.  Remember that one piece of defective material, bearing the trade-mark of the homespun industry, will destroy the reputation of 100 pieces bearing that trade-mark. Deputy Brady has spoken here on behalf of the gentleman who was first offered 4/6 and then 6/- a yard for a web of cloth.  If I were the inspector I would not have bought it from him on the first or on the second occasion.</P>
    <P>The only hope for the industry is to insist that every piece of handspun, hand-woven cloth coming out of the Gaeltacht is of top quality.  I say that we can do it, and it is a most grievous fault that you should not lay too heavily on these people.  Unless you lean upon them they will destroy themselves and destroy the industry. Seventy per cent. of them will do the job scrupulously and well, but their best efforts will be destroyed by the unscrupulous remaining 30 per cent. The only way to prevent that is to lean on them.  All those who are competent and conscientious will not find the burden unduly heavy, while those who are otherwise will find it so heavy that they will be driven out of the industry altogether.</P>
    <P>The sooner they are, the better we will all be.  The Taoiseach himself has said that he finds he can do his work better if he has an occasional goad applied to him.  Everyone who is doing a routine job, day after day, <Col N="2583" /> week after week, year after year, finds he is slipping up unless he has somebody on his tail to ginger him up every now and again.  The weavers in West Donegal, Connemara and Kerry are no different from anybody else in requiring that occasional pressure, that occasional reminder that quality must be maintained, and the Department should not scruple to apply it.  They will get a good deal of abuse when they do it; but those who really desire to serve the interest of the weavers in the West will applaud their exertions and will do their best to assist them in supporting the burden of abuse which proper pressure will bring down upon their heads.</P>
    <P>The future of this industry lies in the American market.  I know that market fairly well, for I worked in it.  The future of this industry lies in the salons of dressmakers like Schiaparelli and Molyneux in Paris.  There is no place whatever for it in the department stores and the mass purchasing markets.  Our object must be to get it into the most fashionable and exclusive distributing centres in the world and, to do that, we must have quality of surpassing excellence.  If we can secure that, I do not doubt that we shall be able to get the other market in time.  There are two dangerous years ahead of us.  We can help the industry if we take the coupon off.  We cannot cause any considerable inconvenience and it will give a new impetus of popularity to these materials in the domestic market during these two difficult years.  Thereafter, in my judgment, if this industry is properly managed, it will not give two hoots about the domestic market for it will be firmly placed in a far larger market where better products are available and where a recurring demand will perennially appear.</P>

Tuigtear dhom go bhfuil níos mó breidín dá dhéanamh le tamall ná mar is féidir a dhíol in Eirinn.  Béidir gur chóir cuid dé a chur anonn go Sasana.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to hear from the Minister an explanation of some of the figures connected with this Estimate.  Under the sub-heading covering Appropriations-in-Aid there are certain receipts indicated, arising from the sales of products of rural industries. There is a deduction for workers' wages amounting to £57,000, and for agents' commission amounting to £7,700.  Then we have receipts from the sales of homespuns, after deducting amounts representing (a) workers' wages £307, and (b) agents' commission £943.  I would like to know, with regard to rural industries, if the sum of £7,700 by way of commission was paid to one man or to a number of men and, if so, what was the number.  I understood that the Department distributed these goods.  On what basis is this amount allocated?  What commission is paid to this man or these men, the agents for rural industries who drew over £7,000?  What is the <Col N="2587" /> explanation with regard to the homespuns, where the workers got £307 and the agents' commission was £943?  The workers who produce goods worth £47,500 drew in wages, according to this account, £307 and the agents' commission was £943.</P>
      <P>Last year the total receipts from sales was £57,460, and the amount estimated for 1945-46 is £47,500, a drop of £10,000.  One would expect a progressive increase in the sales of these goods.  I would like to know what is the explanation of the decline for the coming year.  Is it due to a fall in the price of wool, or a lower production in the quantity of goods?  It strikes me that the paying of £7,700 by way of commission on goods like these should be avoided as far as possible. Nobody should get that amount of money.  Certainly, if one man got it, as distributing agent, it seems an abnormal amount, where the State is putting up money in order to do something for the poorer districts of this country.  The Minister may have a valid explanation of that.  I hope the £7,700 did not go into the pocket of one man who acted as agent for the distribution of these goods.  I understood these goods were distributed by the Central Marketing Board, for which there is a special heading here. All the officers come under subhead F.1.</P>
      <P>I regret to see the static position with regard to the sale of kelp and carrageen.  Certainly, in these days when food, particularly of the nature of carrageen, seems to be greatly restricted, when imports of all kinds are cut off and there is scarcely anything of that kind at home, one would expect a considerable increase in the production and marketing of that article.  One would also expect, in view of the serious position of fertilisers for our agricultural industry, that there would be a marked increase from year to year in the collection and production of kelp.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to carrageen, I have been urging for years that an energetic effort should be made to market it for <Col N="2588" /> animal feeding.  The grading of it need not be of to high a standard, and it would not require the handling and picking and grading that would be needed for human use.  In these days, when there is a complete lack of linseed meal for feeding calves, and a scarcity of maize meal, considerations of that type are important.  I would like to knew from the Minister how it is that a success was not made of that industry.  What is the reason? Was it tried, and, if so, and it did not succeed, what is the explanation why it did not succeed?  Under war conditions one would have thought that there would be a marked demand for articles of this kind.</P>
    <P>Very strict supervision should be kept of the account to see that agents do not make excessive profits out of the work of these people, and it would be well to know that the State is making an effort to provide for the people of these districts by bringing work into the homes in the poorer areas.  The total sum for agents under the two heads I have referred to is practically £9,000.  That amount is given by way of commission.  I sincerely hope somebody has not got in a &ldquo;quick one,&rdquo; and got an agency for the sale of these goods and made excessive profits at the expense of the people.  If that amount was not paid in commission it would go back to the workers.</P>
    <P>We have also to consider freights and postage and the carriage of goods. The figure is abnormal.  I think in cases of this kind the Government should be in a strong position to make representations to the railway companies. I believe the State should make representations in this particular instance to get special facilities for carrying these products from the place of production to the points of marketing.</P>
    <P>They do the very same things in regard to the carriage of fish, they charge the full rates.  Where the State is making an effort, in a semicharitable way, to assist these districts, the railway company should not be allowed to draw the fat out of it, simply because the State is behind it <Col N="2589" /> and they know they can get the money. I do not think we should allow that. The Minister should take his courage in his hands and make strong representations to them and, if he does not succeed, he should put transport of his own on the road, taking power to do that it necessary, against the railway companies.  Every halfpenny of this money that can be sent back to those districts should be sent back. We see here the big commission fees and the big amount charged by the railway companies for freight.  Those charges seem very excessive indeed. In my opinion there should be special facilities and special rates for the carriage of these goods.</P>
    <P>Where there is a huge turnover of this kind, the commission should be cut down to a nominal sum that would give a man a reasonable income, assuming that he is in no other line.  To give a man practically £9,000 out of these products seems unjustifiable.  It is all right saying that there is £140,000 or £180,000 concerned between the two items, but that is no justification for one man cornering the commission and making over £8,000 out of it.  That is an unjustifiable sum, in relation to the nature of the goods that have been sold and the reason for the production. The House should take the utmost care to see that every penny voted for this purpose goes to the right place.  It is a very special purpose, to help the poor people in those districts, to keep the work at home in their cottages and in their districts, so that every penny should go to them as far as possible, since that was the purpose for which it was voted.</P>

      <P>Some people think that there are three different dialects in Irish, the Northern, the Western and the Southern.  I have always found it quite as difficult to understand Donegal men talking in English as in Irish, so I suppose there is not much to the argument, but my Southern ears do not grasp them quite readily.  With regard to the point that Deputy McMenamin made, the amount of commission, £943, relates to a total expenditure of £40,000 on homespun and the commission of £7,700 relates to total sales amounting to £196,000, which, I think, puts a different colour on the story.

    <P>That Dáil Eireann agrees with the recommendation of the Commission on Vocational Organisation that there should be established a council of education as a permanent institution to act as the accredited advisory body to the Minister for Education, and directs that a select committee, of which the Minister for Education shall be chairman, and consisting of 11 other Deputies, be appointed with a view to the early formulation of the necessary legislative proposals.&mdash;Deputies Mulcahy and O'Higgins.</P>

      <P>Before the debate concludes, I should like to say a few words on this motion standing in the names of Deputies Mulcahy and <Col N="2592" /> O'Higgins.  I should like to point out to the House that the motion is not quite as innocuous at is might seem at first sight.  The second part of the motion&mdash;that a select committee, of which the Minister for Education shall be chairman, and consisting of 11 other Deputies, be appointed with a view to the early formulation of the necessary legislative proposals&mdash;appears to me to have enshrined in it new principles of Governmental procedure.</P>
      <P>Some time ago the Commission on Vocational Organisation was set up at the request of the Government, and after due deliberation reported to the Government on the whole question of vocational organisation.  In that report they dealt with this question of the establishment of a council of education. The head of the Government has already indicated to the House that this matter is under consideration by the Government at present, but, despite that, it appears that the intention here is to establish a Parliamentary committee to accept the responsibility that properly belongs to the Government.</P>
      <P>This question of a council of education is fraught with many difficulties, as everybody knows.  The Minister for Education has already indicated some of them, and indeed we have got no line from anybody here, not even from the Commission on Vocational Organisation, as to how some of those difficulties may be surmounted.</P>

      <P>The difficulties of having all the educational interests in the country represented on this council; what representation they should get; how the body is to be set up; whether the representation would be on a territorial basis, or on what basis or what representation parents should get.  It appears to me that if all the educational elements in the country were to be represented on this council of education and the parents it would be a very unwieldy body indeed.  However, we have still an open mind in this matter, and, as I said, it is under consideration by the <Col N="2593" /> Government.  We have had a great deal of talk about democracy, and last week when this question was being debated Deputy O'Higgins mentioned this word &ldquo;democracy,&rdquo; and accused the head of the Government of treating this thing called democracy with disrespect. This Parliament was freely elected by the people.  The Government was set up by this Parliament to watch over the interests of the people and the Government is responsible to this Dáil and to the people for everything they do.  Here in this motion we have an attempt to take away from the Government the responsibility which belongs to them, and to vest that responsibility in what is called a select committee of the Dáil.  That, in my opinion, is an attempt to put the democratic machine out of gear.</P>

      <P>The responsibility of considering this report.  I have already indicated to the House, and the Taoiseach has already indicated to the House, that this report is under consideration by the Government, but before the Government has time to consider it in all its implications, there is a proposal to set up a select committee of the Dáil to go into the matter: in other words, another Government. The Government has its responsibilities, and this question, because of its difficulty and complexity, will have to receive very careful consideration before there is any decision on it.  It has also been stated that the Government's decision will be announced to this Dáil in due course.  There are in the motion the words &ldquo;the early formulation of the necessary legislative proposals&rdquo;; in other words, before the Government has time to examine this problem home, legislative proposals are to be put forward by this select committee of the House.  This proposal is on a par with the proposal to set up a Coalition Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether it is the intention of the proposer to force this motion to a division, but I advise Deputies, if it is forced to a division, to examine it in all its implications, and to see whether, if they do set up <Col N="2594" /> this select committee of 11, with the Minister for Education as Chairman, they will not be establishing a precedent which never before was established during the lifetime of this House.  I advise Deputies to wait until the Government has given this matter its due consideration.</P>
    <P>It is, as I have said, a problem which must be examined and scrutinised very carefully.  The educational policy of this country is a very important matter for the people, and before there is any attempt to bring about any reorientation of that policy, everything must be taken into account and due consideration given to all the relevant factors.  I therefore, ask Deputies to oppose this motion, if it is pressed to a division, and to make sure that, by this or any other method, the powers and the responsibilities which properly belong to the Government will not be taken from it and vested in any select committee of the Dáil, or any other committee, for that matter.</P>

      <P>When I look back over the record of this debate, it strikes me that there was never such a shocking travesty carried on in any Parliament as that carried on by the Taoiseach, by the Minister for Education, and now by the Parliamentary Secretary.  The Taoiseach says that not only is this simply and solely a vote of censure on the Government, but it is more or less an upsetting of the whole idea of Parliamentary procedure in any of the democratic countries: that, as a matter of fact, it is a complete upsetting of democracy.  I do not know how anybody who read the report could speak in the way in which the Parliamentary Secretary has spoken.  He has come here just to echo the cry of the Taoiseach: &ldquo;Wait.&rdquo; Wait until when?  Wait until the Government has taken a decision on this report.  How long are we to wait?</P>

      <P>How long did it take the Parliamentary Secretary to read it?  I devoted the whole of three and a half days to it, without doing <Col N="2595" /> anything else.  I knew it was an important report; I knew it covered every detail of our organised life; and I knew it required serious and concentrated study.  I spent three and a half solid days with a pencil in my hand reading it.</P>
      <P>That was the first attempt to get a grip of what was here.  How anybody who read that report, and who looked at the state of education to-day, and at what education means to us tomorrow and next year, could tell a Parliament with representatives drawn from every section and every part of the country: &ldquo;Wait until the Government has taken a decision with regard to this general report,&rdquo; I cannot understand. The only conclusion one can come to is that the Parliamentary Secretary has not read it, and the only conclusion one can come to from what the Minister says is that nobody is going to look into the dark recesses of the Department of Education, or even to blow in any kind of organised or systematised set of ideas.</P>
      <P>I am sorry I cannot give either the date or the column of this reference, but the Taoiseach could, and if he cannot, Sir, I will undertake to find it for you.  In the short time at my disposal I was unable to get the exact reference, but this is the quotation:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is for that reason I think that any Minister who is going to do his work as Minister for Education under our system properly needs to have some form of advisory council with whom he can confer.  I think that is absolutely necessary.  Such a council does not exist, I think, at the moment.  The debate here this evening ought to convince the Minister and the Department that there is need for a general stocktaking. It ought to convince him at least that if he is not prepared to take stock in a general way now, to satisfy himself and us as to where we are going in our educational system, he ought to provide himself with some permanent help in the form of an advisory council.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was Deputy Eamon de Valera some time in the early part of the year 1931.  In 1931 we wanted, in the <Col N="2596" /> opinion of the Taoiseach, for the Minister for Education, if he was going to do his work properly under our system, a permanent help in the form of an advisory council.</P>
    <P>During this debate, the Minister for Education with the kind of slave mentality we have not yet been able to eliminate from a certain type of authority in this country&mdash;and nowhere do you get the slave mentality so rooted as in the person who is not fully emancipated in his mind and who has responsibility thrown on him&mdash; suggested that the proposal here is to bring us back under the British system and to set up boards which will be above the people and above the Parliament.</P>
    <P>The next outrageous thing the Minister did was to suggest that, if this council were set up it would have power to override his functions, to take over his functions and interfere with his administration.  The Vocational Commission was set up 20 years after the people of this country had got their full freedom.  It reviewed every aspect of the country's life.  It was almost as a side issue, but an important side issue, that education was discussed by it.  The reason apparently why it did so was that every section of our people that came before the commission talked about the details of our economic and social life, and in doing so could not but refer to education, because education is the whole basis of our life, our work and our prosperity.  The commission say, with regard to education, that you must have a permanent advisory body to advise the Minister.  That is the recommendation of a body of Irishmen, selected by an Irish Government and living in a free Ireland for 20 years, standing over Irish conditions, considering Irish conditions to-day and only turning aside to consider education. The Irish conditions of to-day require that every single one of them would consider education because there is not an aspect of our vocational, social or economic life that the education of our people does not affect. Doubt is thrown as to what bodies, with educational contacts, came to give evidence before the commission.  All that information is given in the ap <Col N="2597" /> pendices.  Six people from the Technical Education Association gave oral evidence, three people from the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland gave oral evidence, three people from the Irish National Teachers' Organisation gave oral evidence, three people from the Schoolmasters' Association gave oral evidence, and two or three people from the Irish Union of Assistant Mistresses of Secondary Schools gave oral evidence. The report says that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Commission took evidence from many organisations of persons engaged in education.  In addition, many organisations of employers and workers in agriculture, industry and commerce, expressed to it their views on general education and on the present system of education for agriculture and industry.  Education is a subject in which vocational bodies naturally have a deep interest arising from their desire to have suitably qualified entrants for, and high standards of skill in, the different vocations ...  Secondary, vocational and agricultural schools all complain of the defect in general education of pupils coming to them from primary schools.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are challenged with upsetting the authority and position of the Government on the one hand, and the fabric of democratic institutions on the other, because arising out of this massive widespread review on education we ask that effect be given to its very clear recommendations. There is nothing in the report that is not clear as to what the basis of representation on the advisory council, and as to what the functions of the advisory council, should be.  The road is marked out perfectly clearly, the details to be worked out later.  The report says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The council should contain representatives of parents, whose interests in education are preponderant and of all the bodies directly concerned in the various branches of education, religious and secular&mdash;viz., the churches, universities, headmasters, teachers.  We suggest that there <Col N="2598" /> should also be representatives of agriculture, industry and commerce, the educational needs of which are of vital concern to the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister did not expect that this body that was set up to make such an exhaustive review of the country's interests generally would decide on the exact numbers.  They were sensible in their report, and they left that to others to do.  They left it either to the Government or to Parliament to do it.  What are we asking?  We are asking that this Parliament would select through the Committee of Selection a representative committee, that its members would sit down with the Minister and see how the bodies mentioned in that report could best be represented on a coucil of education for the purpose of advising the Minister.  Will any reasonable person, knowing the urgency of letting us know, in the Taoiseach's own words, &ldquo;where we are going in our educational system to-day,&rdquo; object to the proposal that Parliament should carefully examine these recommendations and see how they can be put into practical operation under the chairmanship of the Minister for Education with a view to indicating to the Government the lines on which legislation should be introduced?</P>
    <P>I think the Minister and the Taoiseach are behaving disgracefully in a matter that is of serious importance. I said, when introducing the motion, that when we were talking about education we were treading on holy ground.  We speak of our natural resources and of the necessity for developing them.  What natural resources have we compared with the resources that we have in our men and women?  Where is there any country in the world that has risen to greatness on its natural resources? Countries have risen to greatness because their men and women had great ideals and because great institutions were built up to foster these ideals.  It was not an excess of material resources that made those countries great, but rather the greatness of their men and women.  There is no Deputy but knows what resources we have if <Col N="2599" /> we take even the young people in school to-day and give them better and bigger ideals, if we co-ordinate their work and give them better opportunities, and if our educational system is more co-ordinated and better directed.  The Minister has turned nothing but an absolutely materialistic outlook on this whole discussion. We are all agreed it is a fortunate thing that, in the world to-day, we have preserved the system of managerial control and that it is in the hands of the Churches.  Everyone realises that we want good schools in order to house our children properly. Everyone realises the difficulty in getting schools built entirely on parish support.  The Minister accepts the difficulty of finance in regard to the building of schools, but instead of admitting that it is his function to clear that difficulty out of the way and to help to solve it&mdash;to help to keep the principle of managerial control in the hands of the religious bodies on the one hand, and help to solve the financial problem on the other&mdash;he is making of the financial side a problem and difficulty in the way of doing anything.</P>
    <P>We have, both in our primary schools and secondary schools particularly, workers of the most devoted and self-sacrificing kind who, in a personal way, are doing and have done extraordinary work. You have it from the report here and you get the information from various other sources that a lot of their work is not as successful as it might be through lack of co-ordination; that the primary, secondary and technical schools are completely divorced from one another and that co-ordination is left to some dark room in the Department of Education.  We want to see the talent, ability and devotedness that are there in the schools built up in an institutional way into a council of education on top, so that we can see what educationalists can do, so that we will bring the real educationalists together and let them harmonise their work, exchange ideas, solve the difficulties which they see in a practical way and for which they alone can provide the best solutions, and <Col N="2600" /> make recommendations to the Minister.</P>
    <P>We are asked not to press this motion.  I intend to press this motion for what it means.  It means that we have a recommendation given to us by a specially picked body of the most outstanding men and women of the country after 20 years' experience of freedom, given in relation to present Irish conditions and with a view to an Irish future.  These recommendations are published for the benefit of the whole of the Irish people.  They should be known to the whole of the Irish people.  This Parliament must accept its responsibilities for controlling and advising the Executive.  We cannot allow the Executive to steal away into dark rooms to handle problems connected with education, and with the mind and soul and technical capacity of men and women in the country.  We cannot allow the Executive to go into dark rooms and handle and control these things in whatever way they want.  I challenge this Parliament, every member of it and every Party in it, that they have an educational problem to solve.  It cannot be solved by the officials of the Department. It cannot be solved by the Minister or the Executive.  It can only be solved by everybody here speaking his mind and accepting his responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I think that both the nature of that report and the nature of the examination that requires to be made before we can agree to the type and to the number of the Council of Education that can be set up are such that this Parliament should set up a representative committee to examine the matter and to make recommendations.  I ask that they accept their responsibilities and set up a select committee representative of the whole House.  The Government Party will have their full majority on that committee which, under the chairmanship of the Minister, will have to look at the details of that report which, so far as education is concerned, compacts itself into three or four pages.  How on earth a body such as I speak of could do anything but throw some light on the situation and give some guidance to the Minister <Col N="2601" /> is more than I know.  It is a travesty of government and an insult to Parliament that this debate should have been dealt with in the way it was <Col N="2602" /> dealt with by the Taoiseach, the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

    <P>An t-airgead atá á iarraidh in ocht Bhótaí na Seirbhísí a riartar ag mo Roinn-se, is é is suim iomlán dó £5,631,262.  Sa mbliain atá caite bhí £5,412,951 de shuim iomláin ann (agus <Col N="2603" /> trí Meastacháin Bhreise san áireamh sin).</P>
    <P>Is ionann é sin agus £218,311, nó 4 fán gcéad de mhéadú i mbliana.  Is iad seo leanas na prímh-dhifríochtaí:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Bhóta 45&mdash;Oifig an Aire Oideachais. &mdash;Tá £22,340 de mhéadú ghlan sa gcás seo, agus tá tuairim's £18,000 den mhéadú sin ann mar gheall ar an socrú do rinneadh maidir le Bónas an Chostais Mhaireachtála agus maidir le méadú ráta an Bhónais Eigeandála .i. Bónas an Chostais Mhaireachtála d'íoc, ón lú Eanar, 1945, le gach oifigeach do réir 110 bpointe in ionad 85 pointe, agus scilling sa tseachtain de bhreis sa Bhónas Éigeandála d'íoc leis na h-oifigigh a bhfuil Bónas Éigeandála iníoctha leo.</P>
    <P>De thoradh cruadhóg oibre b'éigean líonadh a dhéanamh ar roinnt fholún-tas a bhí gan líonadh mar gheall ar an éigeandáil agus, ina theannta sin, b'éigean a thuilleadh oifigeach d'fhostú mar gheall ar an socrú nua faoi n-a n-íoctar tuarastail mhúinteoirí na mBun-Scol faoi dhó sa mhí.  Dá thoradh sin go léir, is riachtanach soláthar d'fhoirinn ar a bhfuil 506 daoine (agus 122 Cigire agus Thim-thire san áireamh) rud is ionann agus 13 de bhreis a bheith ar an bhfoirinn. Tá 19 n-oifigigh ar iasacht ag Ranna eile.</P>
    <P>Bhóta 46&mdash;Bun-Oideachas.&mdash;Sa gcás seo táthar ag iarraidh £4,156,733 de iomlán ghlan, rud is ionann agus £93,694 níos mó ná iomlán na bliana seo caite.</P>
    <P>Tar éis iarratais áirithe d'fháil ó Chumann na Múinteóirí socraíodh go ndéanfaí ón lú Abrán, 1945, dhá thráth-chuid in ionad aon tráth-chuid amháin sa mhí de thuarastal aon Mhúinteora Náisiúnta d'iarrfadh a thuarastal d'fháil sa gcaoi sin.  Tá an íocaíocht sin an dá thráth-chuid iarrtha ag níos mó ná leath na múinteorí agus, dá bharr sin, tá £62,000 d'ítem neamh-fhillteach i bhFó-Mhír C (1).  Is í sin an íocaíocht a déanfar i lár Mhí an Mhárta, 1946, ach nach ndéanfaí faoi'n sean mhodh go dtí Mí Abráin san aith-bhliain airgeadais.</P>
    <P>Fá láthair tá £320,600 sa bhliain de <Col N="2604" /> Bhónas Eigeandála le híoc, rud is ionann agus £28,600 de mhéadú mar gheall ar an scilling sa tseachtain de bhreis agus toisc gur cuireadh críoch leis an &ldquo;síleáil&rdquo; do bhíodh os cionn £500.</P>
    <P>Méadófar líon na ndaltaí sna Col-áistí Ullmhúcháin ó 432 go dtí 461, agus tá £3,286 sa bhreis ag teastáil dá thoradh sin.  Na rialacha a cuireadh i bhfeidhm sna blianta seo chuaidh thart, tá siad ag teacht in éifeacht do réir a chéile agus, ar an abhar sin, beifear i ndon Coláiste Oiliúna Dhrom Connrach d'ath-oscailt i Meán Fómhair seo chughainn&mdash;i gceann aon bhliana amháin ó dúnadh é&mdash;agus beifear i ndon bliain sa bhreis de sheirbhís a cheadú do bhan-mhúinteoirí.  Ó bhliain a 1938 bhí sé de ghnáth-riail ann go gcaithfeadh mná éirí as an múinteoireacht nuair a bheidís 60 bliain d'aois, nó nuair a bheadh 35 bliana de sheirbhís inphinsin curtha isteach acu-cibé dáta díobh sin ba mhoille.  Anois, i gcás múinteoirí éifeachtach, féatar a gcoimeád sa tseirbhís go mbí siad 61 bliain d'aois nó go mbí 36 bliana de sheirbhís inphinsin curtha isteach acu. Déanfaidh an socrú sin tuairim's £8,700 sa bhliain de mhéadú ar an airgead a bheas ag teastáil le haghaidh tuarastail múinteoirí, ach coiscfidh sé, i mbliana, an gnáth-mhéadú i gcostas pinsean, óir beidh cuid mhaith níos lú de mhná ag éirí as an múinteoireacht sa bhliain airgeadais seo.  Mar sin de, tá £300 níos lú ag teastail ná mar bhí anuraidh le haghaidh pinsean.</P>
    <P>Ionnas go ndéanfaí laghdú éigin ar dhroch-iarsmaí na h-éigeandála i gcúrsaí freastal scoile, cinneadh ar riail speisialta maidir leis an bhfigiúir is riachtanach a bheith ann chun múinteoir a choimeád ina phosta nó chun duine a cheapadh in ionad múinteora a bheadh ag imeacht.  In aon chás ina bhfuil an éigeandáil ina abhar díreach le meán-fhreastal ráithe ar bith a bheith fán bhfigiúir a bhíodh riachtanach, áireofar meán-fhreastal na ráithe ar an bhforas go raibh i láthair oiread fán gcéad de na daltaí agus bhíi láthair ins an ráithe chéanna den bhliain ar dheireadh di an 30ú Meitheamh, 1939.  Cosnóidh an deonadh sin tuairim's £5,000 so bhliain, ach cuirfidh sé in áirithe nach bhfagfar <Col N="2605" /> scoileanna gan na foirne a bheadh acu le ceart dá mbeadh an éigeandáil gan cur isteach ar mheán-fhreastal na ndaltaí.</P>
    <P>Cuirfear i bhfeidhm ath-shocruithe atá déanta i dtaobh Coláistí Samhraidh le haghaidh Gaeilge a theagasc agus, dá thoradh sin, mhéadaigh an soláthar i gcóir deontas do na Coláistí seo ó £600 go dtí £3,600.</P>

    <P>I gcóir an deontais cheann-tsraithe (Fó-Mhír A (1)) a theastaíos an mhór-chuid de sin (£22,075).  An soláthar chun críoch a chur leis an 10% de &ldquo;ghearradh&rdquo; atá á chur i bhfeidhm ar an deontas ceann-tsraithe ó bhí 1931 ann, is é is príomh-abhar don mhéadú fán bFo-Mhir seo.  Ní cuirfear an &ldquo;ghearradh&rdquo; sin i bhfeidhm feasta ach amháin ar an mbreis ós cionn £500 a gheobhas scoil mar dheontas.  Meastar go gcosnóidh an t-athrú sin tuairim's £15,000.  Maidir leis an gcuid eile den mhéadú faoi'n bFó-mhír seo, thárla ann go príomhach é toisc an gnáth-mhéadú bliantúil (tuairim's 1,000 i líon daltaí na Meán-Scol.</P>
    <P>An méadú ar an tsuim le haghaidh Deontais Saotharlann (£5,075), bain-eann sé go mór-mhór le hath-chóirú an 33?% de. &ldquo;ghearradh&rdquo; a rinneadh ar na deontais seo i mbliain a 1940/41; ní bheidh ach 10% de &ldquo;ghearradh&rdquo; ann sa chás seo feasta.  Sa bhliain chéanna sin (1940/41), do rinneadh &ldquo;gearradh&rdquo; ar na deontais speisialta a tugtar do Scoileanna Gaeilge agus do Scoileanna Dhá-Theangacha mar gheall ar theagasc trí Ghaeilge.  Tá soláthar déanta chun an &ldquo;gearradh&rdquo; sin, freisin, d'ath-chóiriú, agus is mar gheall air sin go príomhach atá an méadú ann faoi Fhó-mhír A (3).</P>
    <P>An £4,000 de mhéadú sa solathar le haghaidh Tuarastail Phágh-bhreise, tá trí nithe ina gcúis leis: (1) an scilling sa tseachtain de mhéadú i ráta an Bhónais Éigeandála, (2) an Bónas sin a bheith anois gan &ldquo;síleáil&rdquo; agus é iníoctha le gach múinteoir atá ar Thuarastal Phágh-bhreise agus (3) an gnáth-mhéadú bliantúil i líon na múin-teoirí a n-íoctar Tuarastal Págh-bhreise leo.  Bhí 1,696 múinteoirí den tsórt sin ann i mbliain a 1944/45 agus <Col N="2606" /> meastar go mbeidh 1,750 ann i mbliain a 1945/46, rud is ionann agus 54 de mhéadú.  An soláthar atá á dhéanamh faoi'n bhFó-mhír seo, tá sé níos lú ná mar bhí sé anuraidh, óir rinneadh soláthar i Bhóta 1944/45 le haghaidh tuarastail mhíosa ins an mbreis mar gheall ar an athrú ó íocaíocht ráithiúil go híocaíocht mhíosúil de Thuarastal Phágh-breise.</P>
    <P>Bhóta 48&mdash;Gairm-Oideachas.&mdash;Teas-taíonn £414,725 de shuim ghlan agus tá £51,728 de mhéadú ins an tsuim sin.</P>
    <P>An tsuim iomlán atá le soláthar le haghaidh deontas do na Coistí, tá sí £46,900 níos mó ná figiúir na bliana seo caite, agus thárla £11,722 den mhéadú sin ann toisc an bun-deontas a bheith curtha in oiriúint do 110 mar fhigiúir costais mhaireachtála.  Teastóidh £41,580 níos mó ná mar a theastaigh anuraidh le haghaidh na Stáit-Deontas breise a théigheas do réir an méid a soláthráitear os cionn an minimum go háitiúil.  Tá £340 (ó £7,960 go £8,300) de mhéadú ar an deontas do Choiste Chathrach Bhaile Átha Cliath den Chomhairle le Leas Óige.  Táthar ag déanamh socruithe faoi n-a bhféadfar deontais bhreise d'íoc le Coistí chun gairm-oideachas a chur ar fáil i Scoileanna Ceartúcháin agus i Scoileanna Saothair, agus tá £700 á sholáthar lena aghaidh sin sa Mheasta-chán seo.</P>
    <P>Do réir an athruithe ar chúrsaí airgeadais atá leagtha amach in Alt 5 den Acht Gairm-Oideachais (Leasú), cuirfear deireadh leis na deontais bhreise a híoctaí go dtí seo le Coistí i gcóir cúrsa éigeantach de oideachas leanúnach agus sábhálfar £7,440 dá bhárr sin i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Na deontais a híoctar le húdaráis áitiúla i gcóir pinsin na noifigeach Gairm-Oideachais atá éirithe as obair, beidh siadsan, freisin, méadaithe toisc figiúir an chostais mhaireachtála a bheith árdaithe ó 85 go dtí 110.</P>
    <P>Beidh £3,500 de mhéadú ar an gcaiteachas a bhaineas le tréineáil mhúinteoirí Gairm-Oideachais, agus is é is príomhchúis leis sin buíon bhreise de mhúinteoiri in obair adhmaid agus i bhfoirgníocht a bheith á dtréineáil.</P>
    <P>Bhóta 49&mdash;Eolaíocht agus Ealaí.&mdash; Táthar ag iarraidh £67,055 don Bhóta <Col N="2607" /> seo, agus tá sé sin £12,229 níos mó ná mar hiarradh i mbliain a 1944/45.  Tá tuairim's £3,500 den méid sin ag teastáil toisc an bónas costais mhaireachtála do na foirne a bheith athraithe ó 85 go dtí 110 agus toisc an scilling sa tseachtain de bhreis a cuireadh leis an mBónas Éigeandála. An soláthar do chostas Foillseachán i nGaeilge (Fó-mhír B. 1), tá sé méadaithe ó £10,605 go dtí £13,000. Rinneadh an £2,395 de mhéadú toisc obair an Ghúim a bheith ag dul i méid; ó bhí an bhliain seo thart ann thosaigh an Gúm ar Théacs-Leabhra Iolscoile agus ar startha áitiúla i nGaeilge d'ullmhú le haghaidh a bhfoillsithe.  Faoi Fhó-mhír B. 7. bhéarfar £5,000 de dheontas-i-gcabhair do Chomhdháil Náisiúnta no Gaeilge, rud is ionann agus £2,250 níos mó ná an £2,000 de dheontas móide an £750 de dheontas breise a fuair an Chomhdháil anuraidh.  Táthar á thabhairt sin don Chomhdháil do chúnamh leo dul ar aghaidh leis an scéim timthir-eachta ar thagair mé di nuair a thug mé isteach an Meastachán Breise i Mí Feabhra seo chuaidh thart.</P>
    <P>Ina theannta sin, thug an Meastachán céanna isteach an tseirbhís nua a bhaineas le scrúdú agus le cóip-fhoillsiú na Stair-Scríbhinn Éireannach atá i gCnuasachta Iasachta, seirbhís a bhfuil £2,000 de dheontas-i-gcabhair á sholáthar di i mbliana lena cur chun cinn. (Fó-mhír A 7.)</P>
    <P>Soláthar nua eile faoi Bhóta 49 is ea an £2,000 de dheontas-i-gcabhair don Institiúid Náisiúnta Scannán le haghaidh an chaiteachais a bhainfeas le Leabharlann a chur ar fáil do scannáin oiriúnacha oideasúla a mbeidh cuid acu i nGaeilge.  (Fó-mhír B 9.)  I bFhó-mhír B 10 tá £10 de sholáthar ainmniúil á dhéanamh i gcóir scannán a chuirfidh an Institiúid ar fáil ar son na Ranna Rialtais.  I bhFó-mhír B 11 tá £1,000 de sholáthar nua eile á dhéanamh i gcóir deontas do Choláistí Gaeilge maidir le ranga Gaeilge do dhaoine nach múinteoirí iad.</P>
    <P>Bhóta 50&mdash;Scoileanna Ceartúcháin agus Scoileanna Saothair.&mdash;Teastaíonn níos mó ná £2,000 de bhreis-suim iomlán ón Bhóta seo, ach ó thárla go bhfuiltear ag súil le £1,700 de mhéadú <Col N="2608" /> a bheith ar na Leithreasaí-i-gCabhair a thagas ó shíntiúis tuismitheoirí, is £440 an bhreis-suim ghlan a bheas ann. Is riachtanach soláthar a dhéanamh do líon mhéadaithe daltaí sna Scoileanna Ceartúcháin agus sna Scoileanna Saothair freisin, óir tá líon na ndaltaí a cuirtear chun na scol sin ag méadú leis.  Tá £550 de laghdú ar an soláthar le haghaidh Costas Iompair (Fó-mhír D), óir ní raibh riachtanas leis an tsuim iomlán a soláthraíodh i mbliain a 1944/45.</P>
    <P>Bhóta 51&mdash;An Gailerí Náisiúnta.&mdash;An figiúir árdaithe ar a n-áiritear Bónas an Chostais Mhaireachtála agus an scilling sa tseachtain de bhreis i ráta an Bhónas Éigeandála, is iad is cúis leis an £320 de mhéadú atá ar an soláthar don Institiúid seo.</P>
    <P>Bhóta 28 &mdash; Institiúid Árd-Léinn Bhaile Átha Cliath.&mdash;Táthar ag iarraidh £20,390 de shuim iomlán don Bhóta seo, agus tá sí sin £2,100 níos mó ná soláthar na bliana seo caite, Méadú foirne in dhá Chomhscoil na hInstitiúide, agus soláthar breise le haghaidh foillseachán, is iad is cúis leis an tsuim a bheith níos mó.</P>
    <P>Bun-Oideachas. &mdash; Bhí 454,647 de mheán-uimhir daltaí ar rollaí na mBun-Scol ins an scoil-bhliain 1943/44, agus orthu sin bhí 2,184 páiste a tháinig chun na tíre seo ar tearmann.  Tá an uimhir sin 5,000 níos lú ná an uimhir a bhí ar na rollaí sa scoil-bhliain 1942/43.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an meán-fhreastal i mbliain a 1943/44, bhí sé rud beag níos lú ná mar bhí i mbliain 1942/43&mdash; 82.1 fán gcéad in ionad 82.8 fán gcéad. Na daltaí a mbaineann an tAcht Freastail Scoile leo (.i. daltaí idir 6 bliana agus 14 bliana d'aois), rinne siad-san 83.7 fán gcéad de mheán-fhreastal i mbliain a 1942/43, ach ní dhearna siad ach 83.1 fán gcéad i mbliain a 1943/44.  Tá an éigeandáil ina cúis mhóir leis an laghdú sin an mheán-fhreastail.</P>
    <P>Meán-fhreastal na ndaltaí idir 6 bliana agus 14 bliana d'aois, bhí sé ní b'aoirde i gContae-Bhuirg Bhaile Átha Cliath agus i gContae-Bhuirg Chorcaighe ná mar bhí sé in aon límistéar eile.  Bhí 86.2 fán gcéad de mheán-fhreastal i gCathair Bhaile Átha Cliath agus 86.1 fán gcéad <Col N="2609" /> i gCathair Chorcaighe, ach tá coistí scoil-fhreastail sa dá chondae-bhuirg sin agus is dócha gurb í a n-obair-sean is cúis leis an difríocht.</P>
    <P>I gContae Chorcaighe bhí 84.9 fán gcéad; i gContae na hIar-Mhidhe bhí 84.5 fán gcéad agus i gContae Cheath-arlach bhí 84.3 fán gcéad de mheán-fhreastal ag páistí den aois-teorainn chéanna úd.  Ach bhí an meán-fhreastal faoi 82 fán gcéad i gContae an Chabháin, i dTír Chonaill, i Muine-achán, i gCathair Luimnigh, i gCill Dara, i Longphort, sa Mhidhe, i gCill Mhanntáin, i Liathdruim, i Ros Comáin agus i Sligeach.  Den méid páiste idir 6 bliana agus 14 bliana d'aois, bhí ó 18 fán gcéad go dtí 21 fán gcéad as láthair ó scoil sna háiteanna sin gach lá.</P>
    <P>Tá méadú áirithe tagtha ar an líon scol in ar thuit an meán-fhreastal níos ísle ná 35.  Bhí 951 den tsórt sin scol ann i mbliain a 1932, ach bhí 1,437 ann i mbliain a 1944.  I dtosach na tréimhse sin bhí 24 scoileanna ina raibh an meán-fhreastal faoi 10, ach ina deireadh bhí 100 scoil den tsórt chéanna; ina tosach bhí 339 scoileanna ina raibh an meán-fhreastal idir 10 agus 19, ach ina deireadh bhí 494 scoileanna den tsórt chéanna; ina tosach bhí 286 scoileanna ina raibh an meán-fhreastal idir 20 agus 29, ach ina deireadh bhí 493; ina tosach bhí 302 scoil ina raibh an meán-fhreastal idir 30 agus 39, ach ina deireadh bhí 350. Tuairim's 50 de na 350 scoileanna sin a bhfuil a meán-fhreastal idir 30 agus 39, níl ach aon mhúinteoir amháin ins gach ceann acu.  Furmhór mór na scol ina bhfuil an meán-fhreastal faoi 30, níl iontu ach aon mhúinteoir amháin.  Ins an tréimhse chéanna úd, 1932-1944, rinneadh aon scoil amháin de dhá scoil ina lán áiteanna agus cuireadh deireadh le 339 scoileanna faoi leith sa gcaoi sin.  Is léir on méid sin gur fadhb inti féin an scoil &ldquo;bheag&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Sna háiteanna in ar bh'fhéidir a dhéanamh fuarathas buaidh ar an bhfaidhb sin trí éintíos, ach aith-nimíd ar na figiúirí go bhfuil roinnt mhaith scol ann a bhfuil acmhainn teagaisc agus riaracháin á chur amú leo, agus is dócha go bhfuil scoileanna eile gan a ndíol ceart d'acmhainn teagaisc a bheith iontu.  Déarfar, b'fhéidir, go <Col N="2610" /> mba chóir na scoileanna atá ar fhíor-bheagán daltaí a dhúnadh agus na daltaí a chur chuig scoileanna atá san aon-cheanntar leo.  Ach bheadh deac-rachtaí móra ag baint leis an obair sin &mdash;deacrachtaí agus costas iompair, deacrachtaí maidir le foirne teagaise, 7rl.  Ina theannta sin ba chruadháil é ar lucht ceanntair ar bith, dar liom, gan scoil a bheith ina mease féin agus gan na páistí a bheith ar scoil i bhfogas dá muinntir agus dá mbaile dúchais.  Ach tuigeann an Roinn Oideachais go bhfuil an fhadhb sin ann agus go bhfuil sí ag leathnú, agus táthar ag féacháil le teacht ar an gcaoi is fearr lena réiteach.</P>
    <P>Is maith liom bheith i ndon a rá go bhfuil laghdú ag teacht do réir a chéile ar an easbaidh oibre i mease múinteoirí tréineáilte.  Ní méadú ar phostaí do mhúinteoirí óga is cionn-tsiocair leis sir, afach, ach an cosc atá ar líon-mhaireacht na n-abhar múinteoírí le tamall de bhlianta.  Gí nach bhfuil an easbaidh oibre d'fhear - mhúinteoirí chomh mór agus bhí, ní bheidh deireadh léi go ceann tréimhse eile agus, idir an dá linn, táimíd ag coimeád ann na postaí sealadacha a cuireadh ar fagháil seal blianta ó shoin leis an ngéar-chás a mhaolú.  Maidir leis na ban-mhúinteoirí, tá an scéal i bhfad níos sásúla ná mar bhí sé agus ní fada go mbí deireadh leis an easbaidh oibre bhaineas leo-san.</P>
    <P>Ó thárla feabhas ar an gcás i gcoitinne, bhí ar mo chumas maolú a dhéanamh ar an riail a rinneadh i mbliain a 1938 maidir leis an aois ina gcaithfeadh ban-mhúinteoirí stad de theagasc.  Seasca bliain an aois stata atá ann do bhan-mhúinteoirí, ach go dtí 1938 leigtí dóibh leanúint den teagasc go mbídís 65, ar choinníoll iad a bheith éifeachtach.  Ach, toise líon na ndaltaí scoile a bheith ag laghdú go mór, d'éirigh postaí do mhúinteoirí óga chomh gann sin gur bh'éigean rialacha speisialta a dhéanamh chun an scéal a leigheas. Mar sin de, socraíodh i mbliain a 1938 nach leigfí do bhan-mhúinteoirí leanúint do theagasc nuair a bheidis ós cionn 60.  On lú Deireadh Fómhair, 1938, mar sin, cuirtí ban-mhuinteoirí ar pinsean nuair a bhídís 60 bliain d'aois nó nuair a bhíodh 35 bliana de <Col N="2611" /> sheirbhís críochnaithe acu&mdash;cibe dáta ba mhoille.  Tuigeadh, áfach, go bhféadfadh an riail nua a bheith ina chúis le roinnt áirithe cruadhála agus ceadaíodh gan a cur i bhfeidhm go ponncúil i gcás ar bith a mbainfeadh cruadháil speisialta leis.  Táthar tar éis maolú a dhéanamh anois ar an riail úd 1938 agus, dá réir sin, féadfar bliain sa mbreis de sheirbhís a cheadú do bhan-mhúinteoirí atá éifeachtach-rud is ionann agus go bhféadfar a gcoimeád sa tseirbhís go mbí siad 61 bhliain d'aois nó go gcríochnaí siad 36 bliana de sheirbhís, cibe dáta is moille.  Tá an maolú sin i bhfeidhm ón 31ú lá de Mhárta seo caite.  Ní féidir a thuilleadh a dhéanamh fá láthair, óir laghdófaí go ró-mhór líon na bpostaí do mhúinteoirí óga dá gceadaítí maolú ba mhó ná sin. Breathnófar an scéal ó am go ham, áfach, agus ceadófar a thuilleadh spáis, más féidir é; ach caithfear a thuigsint nach foláir uimhir réasúnta folúntas a choimeád ar fáil do dhaoine óga bheas ag teacht isteach sa tseirbhís.</P>
    <P>Comhartha eile are an bhfeabhsú maidir le hobair do mhúinteoirí is ea an méid atá le rá agam i dtaobh an Choláiste Oiliúna d'fhear-mhúinteoirí Catoiliceacha-Coláiste Naomh Pádraig i nDrom Connrach.  Mar gheall ar an bhfeabhsú sin d'éirigh linn a shocrú go ndéanfaí an Coláiste d'ath-oscailt i Meán Fómhair seo chugainn.  Idir an méid fear-mhúinteoirí a bhí gan obair agus an méid mac léinn a bhí sna Coláistí Ullmhúcháin, measadh, sé bliana ó shoin, go mbeadh oiread múinteoirí againn agus bheadh ag teastáil uainn go dtí deireadh scoil-bhliana a 1947/48.  De ghnáth, bíonn mic léinn ar feadh sé mblian atg foghluim le bheith ina múinteoirí&mdash; ceithre bliana sna Coláistí Ullmhúcháin agus dhá bhliain sa Choláistí Oiliúna. Níor glacadh mic léinn ar bith isteach i gColáistí Ullmhúcháin na mbuach-aillí i 1939, i 1940 ná i 1941.  Ach tos-naíodh arís ar a leigean isteach i 1942, sa gcaoi a bhféadfaí buíon nua d'fhear-mhúinteoirí a ghlacadh isteach sa tseirbhís i Mí Iúil, 1948.  Mar sin de, ní raibh mic léinn ar bith le teacht ó na Coláistí Ullmhúcháin chun an Choláiste Oiliúna i 1943 ná i 1944, agus <Col N="2612" /> i Mí Meitheamh seo chuaidh thart, nuair a bhí deireadh le cúrsa tréineála na mac léinn a thosnaigh i 1938, ní raibh a thuilleadh mac léinn ann le teacht isteach sa Choláiste Oiliúna.</P>
    <P>Tar éis an scéal a serúdú le goirid, measadh gur chruinn, tríd as tríd, an t-áireamh a rinneamar sé bliana ó shoin, ach go raibh oiread d'fhéabhsú ar an gcás agus go bhféadfaimís uimhir bheag mhac léinn a ghlacadh isteach sa Choláiste Oiliúna i mbliana. Naomh Pádraig d'ath-oscailt i Meán Fómhair seo chugainn agus is iad a bheas ann, uimhir theoranta mhac léinn a tháinig trí chomórtas oscailte agus uimhir bheag eile ar bhfhéidir a gcúrsa sna Coláistí Ullmhúcháin a laghdú ó cheithre bliana go dtí trí bliana.</P>
    <P>Mar aduairt mé anuraidh, coimeádadh an Coláiste Oiliúna agus an fhoireann fá réir don am a dtosnófaí arís ag tréineáil múinteoirí.  Ar feadh na tréimhse a raibh an Coláiste dúnta bhí na hollamhain i gcionn oibre a bhfuil dlú-bhaint aici lena saothar sa Choláiste féin&mdash;ag ullmhú nótaí agus scéim teagaisc agus ag tabhairt cuairt ar bhun-scoileanna sa gcaoi a bhfuighdís cruinn-eolas ar gach a mbaineann le hobair na scol sin.</P>
    <P>Na rialacha ath-chóirithe do Scrúdú chán Teistiméireacht na mBun-Scol, tá siad i bhfeidhm le dhá bhliain.  Go dtí 1943 ní raibh an scrúdú ach roghnach; ach, do réir na Rialach ath-chóirithe a tugadh isteach an bhlian sin, chaith-feadh gach dalta dá raibh ar rolla an tSeiseadh Rang dul faoi scrúdú i 1943; i mbliain a 1944 agus ó sin amach bheadh an scrúdú éigeantach ar gach dalta dá mbeadh sa tSeiseadh Rang, nó i rang a b'aoirde ná an Seiseadh Rang, agus nach ndeachaidh faoi scrúdú cheana féin.</P>
    <P>I 1943 chuaidh 44,272 dalta faoi scrúdú agus fuair 31,535 (tuairim's 71 fán gcéad) pas.  I 1944 chuaidh 32,544 faoi scrúdú agus fuair 23,298 (tuairim's 71 fán gcéad freisin) pas.  Mar is léir ó na figiúirí chuaidh roinnt mhaith níos lú faoi scrúdú i 1944 ná mar chuaidh i 1943.  Iarrthóirí ó na hárd-ranga an chúis ba mhó bhí leis an mór-uimhir i <Col N="2613" /> 1943.  Is fíor go raibh an scrúdú éigeantach ar dhaltaí an tSeiseadh Ranga an bhliain sin, ach bhí sé oscailte, freisin, do dhaltaí gan teis-timéireachtaí a bhí i ranga b'aoirde ná sin agus chuaidh 13,500 dalta ón Seachtú agus ón Ochtú Rang isteach air.  I 1944 ní raibh baol ar oiread daltaí gan teistiméireachtaí sa Seachtú ná san Ochtú Rang agus ní dheachaidh 4,000 féin ó na ranga sin faoi scrúdú i 1944.</P>
    <P>Uimhir na ndaltaí ón Seiseadh Rang féin a chuaidh faoi scrúdú i 1944, bhí sí 2,000 ní ba lú ná uimhir 1943; ach féadfaí a rá go raibh an laghdú sin do réir an lagduithe a bhí tagtha ar líon iomlán na ndaltaí a bhí ar rollaí an tSeiseadh Ranga.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na socruithe a bhi riachtanach chun uimhir chomh mór sin a chur faoi scrúdú, is áthas liom bheith i ndon a rá i mbliana arís gur mhór an gar don Roinn an comh-chunamh a bhí le fáil go háitiúil.  Muna mbeadh an comh-chúnamh sin ar fáil, ba rí-dhea-cair na socruithe riachtanacha a dhéanamh, agus is mian liom anois baochas a thabhairt dóibh siúd go léir a chuidigh linn&mdash;na bainisteoirí, múin-tir na nOrd Creidimh agus na múin-teorí tuata.</P>
    <P>Thrácht mé anuraidh ar bhuntáiste an scrúduithe seo&mdash;ar an bhfianaise atá sna teistiméireachtaí go bhfuil caigh-deán áirithe oideachais sroiste ag lucht a ngnóthuithe.  Rud socharach is ea an teistiméireacht do dhaltaí ar mian leo dul faoi chúrsa meán-oideachais nó gairm-oideachais; ach, ina theannta sin, táim cinnte go mbeidh tóraíocht i bhfad níos mó uirthi ar ball i measc daltaí a bheas ag iarraidh posta in áiteacha ina mbíthear ag súil le caigh-deán áirithe oideachais a bheith ag an lucht oibre.  Is deimhin liom go rach-aidh an tóraíocht i méid do réir mar bheifear á thuigsint go coiteann go bhfuil an scrúdú oscailte do gach dalta shroiseas an Seiseadh Rang.  Táim cinnte, freisin, gurb eol dá lán tuismi-theoirí cheana féin cad iad na bun-táistí bhaineas leis an scrúdú seo, agus measaim go dtabharfaidh na tuismi-theoirí i gcoitinne dá n-aire go mbeidh caoi ag a gclainn féacháil leis an teistiméireacht a ghnóthú.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2614" /> Tá dóchas agam, freisin, go n-aith-neoidh na múinteoirí i gcoitinne cad iad na buntáistí fhéadas a gcuid daltaí fháil ón scrúdú agus go mbeidh lán chúnamh san obair le fáil uathu go léir.  Mar aduairt mé cheana, táim i gcomhnaí toilteannach ar dhul chun agallmha le lucht Chumann na Múin-teoirí i dtaobh aon athruithe ar mhodh oibre an scrúdúcháin a d'fhéadfadh bheith ina chúis lena gcomh-chúnamh san i gcoitinne fháil don scéim mar atá sí bunaithe anois.</P>
    <P>Le tuairim's deich mbliana anuas tháinig laghdú ar an méid scoláirí a chuaidh go dtí na Coláistí Gaeilge. Éiríonn le cuid mhaith oidí óga an Teas-tas Dá-Theangach a bhaint amach ag an scrúdú deiridh sa gColáiste Oiliúna agus míníonn sin an laghdú ar bheal-ach. Caithfidh sé go bhfuil baint, freisin, ag na deacrachtaí atá ag baint le cúrsaí taistil agus ciondála ó thosaigh an cogadh leis an laghdú sin.</P>
    <P>Cuireadh Coiste de chuid na Roinne ar bun féachaint an bhféadfaí feidhm a bhaint as na Coláistí le cuidiúle aith-bheochaint na Gaeilge i measc an ghnáth-phobail agus le cabhrú leis na múinteoirí le toradh níos fearr a fháil maidir le múineadh na ngnáth-abhar scoile tríd an nGaeilge.</P>
    <P>Mhol an Coiste nithe áirithe agus tá beartaithe na moltaí sin a chur i bhfeidhm an bhliain seo chugainn.  Do réin na moltaí sin, leagfar amach cúrsaí a bheas níos feiliúnaí do oidí a bhfuil eolas éifeachtiúil acu ar an nGaeilge cheana.  Bhéarfar níos mó aird ar mhodhanna múinteoireachta agus bhéarfar cuireadh do lucht stiúrtha na gColáistí cúrsaí feiliúnacha a thabhairt sna gnáth-abhair atá ar an gclár.  Táthar ag súil, ar an mbealach sin, go gcuirfear cúrsaí oiliúna ar fáil thríd an nGaeilge do na múinteoirí.  Tá tosnú déanta ag cuid de na Coláistí cheana féin agus d'éirigh leo múin-teoirí a mhealladh isteach i ranganna, cé nár theastaigh cúrsaí sa nGaeilge féin uathu.  Molfar do Choláistí cúrsaí feiliúnacha a chur ar fáil freisin&mdash; cúrsaí Gaeilge&mdash;do dhaoine eile nach múinteoirí iad.</P>
    <P>Naoi bpingne an uair a' chloig an ráta íocaíochta a bheas ann do chúr-saí na múinteoirí ach beidh ar gach <Col N="2615" /> aon mhúinteoir bheith 20 uair a' chloig ar a laghad i láthair.  Ní híocfar ar níos mó ná 80 uair a' chloig in aon tseisiún amháin.  I gcás cúrsaí do dhaoine nach múinteoirí, íocfar do réir 4 pingne an uair a' chloig in aghaidh gach scoláire a chuir ar a laghad 15 uair a' chloig isteach, ach ní híocfar ar níos mó ná 40 uair a chloig in aon tseisiún.  Ní híocfar ar an dá chineál scoláire ach in aghaidh aon tseisiúin amháin sa mbliain agus ní híocfar astu thar trí bliana i ngach tréimhse chúig mblian.</P>
    <P>Ní thig linn aon tuairim chinnte a thabhairt faoi'n gcostas a bheas ag baint leis an scéim seo ar feadh na céad bhliana, ach tá £5,000 leagtha amach ina cómhair.</P>
    <P>Tá breis agus £35,000 d'árdú thar mar a bhí anuraidh ar an Meastachán, i gcomhair an Mheán-oideachais.  An méadú a tháinig ar an líon daltaí atá ag freastal ar na Meán-scoileanna agus an feabhas a cuireadh ar na deontais a híoctar leis na scoileanna céanna, sin iad an dá ní is údar le mór-chuid den árdú.  Le roinnt bhlian anuas tá na scoileanna sin agus an uimhir daltaí a ghníos freastal orthu ag dul i líon-mhaire. Níor tháinig aon trághadh ar cheachtar den dá ní sin le linn na bliana seo a chuaidh tharainn.  I mbliana tá 379 scoil ann agus tá 41,178 dalta ag freastal orthu.  Is taith-neamhach an scéal le n-a aithris é gur ar éigin atá aon bhaile mór raithiúil sa gcuid seo den tír atá faoi n-ár stiúrú-na nach bhfuil fáil ar mheán-oideachas ann anois ag muintir an cheanntair ina bhfuil an baile suite.</P>
    <P>O am go ham laghdaíodh go mór na deontais a híoctaí leis na meán-scoileanna i dtús aimsire.  Sa mbliain 1931-32 laghdaíodh 10 fán gcéad an deontas ceann-tsraithe agus an deontas saotharlainne a bhí iníoctha le gach scoil.  Ar theacht an chogaidh laghdaíodh arís do réir 23? fán gcéad an deontas saotharlainne.  Ina theannta sin rinneadh roinnt mhaith laghduithe ar na deontais bhreise a bhí iníoctha le scoileanna ina ndéantaí an teagasc trí Ghaeilge nó trí Ghaeilge is Béarla.</P>
    <P>Ba mhór an buille ann féin do na scoileanna an laghdú sin ó thaobh airgid.  Ach tháinig an crú ar an <Col N="2616" /> táirgne i geeart i ngeall ar an gcogadh, ionnas go mb'fhollas nach mbeadh ar chumas a lán acu, go háithrid na scoileanna beaga, leanacht orthu ar na deontais a bhíodar a shaothrú.  Le theacht i gcabhair orthu b'eigin na deontais a gheobhaidís ón Stát a árdú. Ar an abhar sin rinneadh athruithe i gcóir na blian-scoile 1944-45 ar na rialacha a bhaineas leis na deontais sin.  Siad na hathruithe iad: (1) Nach gcuirfí an 10 fán gcéad d'ísliú a ceapadh sa mbliain 1931-32 i bhfeidhm ar an gcéad £500 den ghnáth-dheontas ceann-tsraithe; (2) nach leanfaí den 23? fán gcéad de laghdú rinneadh ar theacht an chogaidh ar na deontais saotharlainne; (3) i gcás scoileanna de Ghrad A árdófar an deontas speisialta ceann-tsraithe ó 15 fán gcéad go dtí 20 fán gcéad agus i gcás scoileanna de Grád B 1 siad sin na scoileanna ina ndéantar 3/4 cuid nó thairis sin den teas-gasc trí Ghaeilge iontu árdófar an deontas ó 10 fán gcéad do dtí 12½ fán gcéad.</P>
    <P>I rith na bliana seo a chuaidh thart rinneadh an teagasc go hiomlán trí Ghaeilge i 100 scoil agus rinneadh cuid den teagasc trí Ghaeilge i 113 scoil, sin 213 scoil idir an dá chineál.  Bhí 24,163 dalta ag freastal na scol sin.  B'ionann sin agus 60 fán gcéad den líon daltaí a bhí ag freastal na Meán-scol go léir. Thríd is tríd, tá bail mhaith go leor ar cheist na Gaeilge&mdash;idir labhairt na teangan agus scríobhadh na teangan&mdash; san dá chineál sin scol.  Go deimhin is féidir a rá go bhfuil bail an-mhaith uirthi ina bhfurmhór.  Ach tá roinnt mhaith de na scoileanna eile a bhfuil an Ghaeilge faon-lag go leor iontu, go háitrid labhairt na Gaeilge.  Tá sin le tabhairt faoi deara go mór-mhór sna scoileanna a dtagann furmhór a gcuid daltaí nó mór-chuid acu, chuca ó scoileanna príobháideacha.  Ní chaith-eann na scoileanna príobháideacha sin an oiread ama ná an oiread saothair le teagasc na Gaeilge agus a bheithfí ag súil leis.  I láthair na huaire tá an Roinn seo agamsa ag scrúdú an scéil sin féachaint cén chaoi an bhféadfaí an scéal a fheabhsú sna meán-scoileanna sin.</P>
    <P>Cuireadh cúrsaí Gaeilge Samhraidh mar a bhíodh ann roimhe seo ar fáil anuraidh do oidí meán-scoile.  I mBaile Átha Cliath a bhí na cúrsaí sin <Col N="2617" /> ar siúl agus chuaidh an oireadh oidí ann ag foghluim agus nach mbeadh áit ann dá thuille.  Bhí mé ag smaoi-neadh ar fhairsinge a leigean ar na cúrsaí sin i mbliana agus iad a chur ar bun i gCorcaigh agus i mBaile Átha Cliath, sin má bhíonn a sáith éilimh orthu.</P>
    <P>Is mór a ghoill an cogadh ar na Meán-scoileanna.  An ganntan páipéir, an t-árdú a tháinig ar luach leabhar agus ar nithe eile, ganntan solais agus abhair teine, agus na deacrachtaí a bhain lé cúrsaí scoile, níl sa méid sin ach cuid de na nithe a bhí ina chúis buaidhrimh acu i ngeall ar an gcogadh.</P>
    <P>Ach tá áthas orm é bheith le rá agam gur maith mar a d'fhéach na Bainis-teoirí agus na hoidí leis an gceann is fearr fhál ar na cúrsaí sin agus leis an dochar mór a bhaint astu chomh fada agus ab'fhéidir é.</P>
    <P>Tá rudaí aithrid eann a tháinig treas-na ar an nGairm-oideachas i rith na <Col N="2618" /> bliana 1943-44.  Obair a bheith le fáil thar mar a bhíodh ag daoine óga, ganntan urdhamhna agus an chaoi a raibh an scéal maidir le cúrsaí taistil, sin nithe a chuir isteach air.  Bhí 13,000 dalta ag freastal ar ranganna lae lán-aimsire na scol sin.  Cúrsa teagaisc a d'fheilfeadh do dhaoine a bheadh á n-ullmhú féin i gcóir tionnseal nó tráchtála a leagtar amach i gcóir na ndaltaí iontu.  I rith an tseisiúin 1943/44 fritheadh obair mar cheár-daithe, mar bhan-táilliúirí, obair i monarchain, obair mar fhreastalaithe agus obair thráchtála do 765 dalta a bhí ag freastal ar scoileanna Gairm-oideachais Chathair Átha Cliath.</P>
    <P>Tairgim go dtugtar tuairisc ar a ndearnadh.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, April 27th.</P>
