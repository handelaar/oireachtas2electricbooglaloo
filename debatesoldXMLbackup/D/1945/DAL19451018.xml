      <P>A certain quantity of foodstuffs has already been sent by the Government, through the International Red Cross Society, for distribution amongst the displaced persons, especially children, in greatest need in Central European countries, including Austria, Germany, Hungary and Poland.  A further consignment is being sent at an early date for the same purpose.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the Irish Red Cross Society has had conversations with the International Red Cross about the possibility of bringing children here from the areas mentioned, and these conversations are being continued with the representative of the International Red Cross at present in Dublin. Owing, however, to the special difficulties of dealing with the occupied areas in question, it may be some considerable time before it can be stated with certainly that groups of children will be sent out of these areas to countries which are in a position to receive them.</P>

      <P>No such request as is referred to by the Deputy has been received by me.  The Deputy himself asked for a Departmental inspector to hold an inquiry into the failure of the local authority <Col N="383" /> to provide a cottage for the person named in the question.  My information is that this person's present housing accommodation is inadequate. He was recently an applicant for a labourer's cottage but his application was unsuccessful.  I have made inquiries in the matter and have been informed that the successful applicant was living in a house in which there were 11 adults and one child.  I should like to stress to the Deputy that the letting of cottages is a matter for the local authority concerned who, if the cottages are subsidised under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932, must allot the cottages in accordance with the preferences laid down by the Housing (Loan Charges Contributions) Regulations, 1938, and they must consider and have regard to a report to be obtained from the appropriate medical officer of health as to the existing accommodation of each applicant and as to the degree of urgency of his need for alternative accommodation.  I am satisfied that the regulations were complied with in the allocation of this tenancy. I have no power to review any allocation which has been made in accordance with the regulations.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that there were any recent lettings of cottages to unmarried men and women.  I have no information as to the cost incurred by the Offaly County Council in recovering possession of a cottage let to an unmarried woman in 1941.</P>

      <P>The county and assistant surveyors and other permanent officials of the local authority are whole-time officers and are paid annual salaries for the discharge of the duties assigned to them.  Surveyors are engaged on road works, public health works, various relief works, as well as turf-cutting operations, but no portion of their salaries is specifically charged to any of their duties.  Services in connection with the turf production schemes rendered by the county surveyors and other permanent officials of the Laoighis and Offaly County Councils have not imposed any additional charges on the funds of these county councils.  The question of recoupment from the Central Fund therefore does not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the county and assistant surveyors and the overseers have been withdrawn from these counties, as well as from other counties, for at least six months of the year to produce turf for the community to be sold at a commercial price?  In view of that, is it right that the ratepayers of the counties concerned should have to pay for their services?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

Will the Parliamentary Secretary see that that is done, and that a sum representing the services given by these officers is charged to the turf production campaign and not to the ratepayers of the county who got no benefit from the scheme in the matter of the price of turf?</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any recent developments which call for a revision of the law relating to ground rents.</P>
      <P>The position in this matter is regulated by the Landlord and Tenant Acts, 1931 to 1943.  Under these Acts, on the termination of a lease under which a ground rent had been reserved, the lessor, who was formerly entitled to take complete possession of the property, is obliged to grant a new lease, the terms of which, in default of agreement between the parties, are settled by the court, within the limits prescribed by the Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to move the motion standing in the names of Deputy McGilligan and myself:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Emergency Powers (362) <Col N="397" /> Order, 1945, be and is hereby annulled.</P>
    <P>The motion refers to a particular Emergency Order signed last August dealing with a certain section of deserters from the National Army. The Order is not one over the name of the Minister for Defence; it is an Order signed by the Taoiseach himself. I want to make it very clear at the start that in moving for the annulment of this particular Order I am in no way defending deserters or approving of desertion.  The points on which I desire to move the annulment of the Order are many.  First of all, I think on the face of the Order it will be clear to anyone who reads it that this Order is not aimed at deserters merely because they are deserters, or because they deserted the Army at a time of emergency.  This Order is framed specifically to deal with a certain section of deserters, deserters who joined the armies of the United Nations.  If that is so, the Order is imposing penalties not for desertion but penalties continuing over seven years for those who served in the armies of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>The Order in question refers to deserters who have been absent as deserters for a period of 180 days.  This is a very tiny country.  We have very efficient services in the country&mdash;an intelligence service, secret service agents, a rather big police force in proportion to the area and population, a highly efficient police force.  We have machinery, a system, in the country whereby nobody can purchase as much as a fraction of an ounce of tea without a ration card.  It is beyond belief that with all that machinery at the disposal of the State any deserter could be absent for 180 days without being taken into custody and dealt with.  It is because of all those circumstances that I say that this Order is not an Order to punish deserters, but an Order to punish a special class of deserters.  We have, in the Defence Forces Act, renewed, year after year, since the 1st October, 1924, ample machinery for dealing with desertion or any other offence within the Defence Forces, and I would not challenge any action <Col N="398" /> taken to deal with deserters or with desertion in the ordinary way.  We have gone through five years of the greatest war the world ever knew or ever will know.  All through that time we had deserters or were dealing with deserters, and yet we wait until the war is over, and then bring out an Order which sentences this unfortunate small section of deserters to seven years' destitution, seven years' starvation. We lay it down in the Order that these men, if they return, can get no work whatsoever under the State, under a local authority, under any board or authority established by this Parliament&mdash;that their discharge or dismissal from the Defence Forces is not a discharge for the purposes of the Unemployment Assistance Acts.  In other words, through the machinery of the State, we do everything possible to ensure that for seven years these men and their families are sentenced to absolute destitution and absolute starvation.</P>
    <P>We are doing that in a Christian country and under a Constitution that is festooned with phrases about Christianity, God, et cetera.  I am objecting to this, and I am moving the annulment of the Order, because it is a most brutal, unchristian and inhuman Order.  I do not care whether the number of men concerned be few or many; nobody with any humanity or Christianity in his make-up would stand for a seven years' punishment of that sort, no matter what the crime was.  As I said, we have been dealing with deserters.  We have been dealing with them over a period of five or six long years&mdash;a period of emergency. We have been dealing with deserters for a period of 22 years in all.  Even during the emergency, people deserted from the forces, because they did not like soldiering and wanted to side-step the hard, arduous life of a soldier, and when they were caught within the country, the sentences were comparatively light.  Many of them, when they were taken into custody, were kept for only a few days in the guard-room and then discharged from the Army, and the Minister knows that as well as I do.  The sentences were very light, considering the state of emergency <Col N="399" /> that existed.  But we wait until the war is over, and until there is some possibility of these other men returning, and then bring in an Order of this kind.</P>
    <P>Let us think back.  The Minister found himself, in a time of emergency, without an Army, or without an adequate Army, and every Party and every Deputy in this House put behind them any old divisions or dislikes, forgot past dissensions, and got out, one and all, shoulder to shoulder, to give this country an adequate Defence Force and to recruit an Army up to the requirements of the country.  It was the Army of Parliament.  It was the Army of all Parties in Parliament, and the response was reasonably good. The response was not up to the mark that the Army officers required, and yet the Government of this country was all the time, day after day, through the machinery of the State, allowing men who&mdash;many of them&mdash;were too selfish to join their own Army in a time of danger, to go abroad and work for comparatively fabulously high wages in the munition factories of belligerent States, and there was no disability or no penalty put in the way of these people.  Instead of that, you had the State facilitating their exit from the country.  Others came along and joined the forces of this country&mdash;young men, brave men, men anxious for soldiering, seeking adventure, and believing that there was a real danger to this State.  They did their task and carried out their duties for one or for two years or for longer.  Then, in their judgment, they came to the conclusion that the danger of actual invasion had passed and if the menace that threatened the country was to be met, the place to meet it was at a distance&mdash;to meet it at a distant point, pin it down there, and crush it there, and, as a result, some of them left and joined the forces of other armies.</P>
    <P>Now, any one of us who reads in the papers or knows anything of the horrors of war can have some little picture of what those men went through, of their experiences and their agonies.  Yet, when the war is <Col N="400" /> over, and when they come back, hoping to come back to a mother, to a young wife and to the little children, they find the Government of this State stepping in to sentence them to seven years' starvation, seven years' destitution, and to find themselves branded, as far as the State can do so, as pariah dogs, as outcasts, untouchables, who cannot be employed or maintained here.  They find the Government of this State sentencing them to starvation or exile not for the crime of cowardice, not for the crime of deserting this nation in a time of danger, but for the crime of going to assist other nations in what they believed was a fight for the survival of Christianity in Europe.</P>
    <P>We read in our papers as recently as last week a long and touching letter from a young Irish priest who had been in captivity, and some of whose colleagues had been murdered and others tortured, and we read of his feelings on the day the relief forces reached that camp, and of the relief and joy of those who had been in captivity, but particularly of their relief to find that every second soldier that they met with in that relieving column was a Kelly, Burke or Shea. We read of the way that young Irish priest thanked God that Irish mothers had produced sons who, within the periphery of the world, had faced death in order to come to the relief of such young Irish priests and save them from murder and torture&mdash;men who went from battlefield to battlefield to bring assistance to these Irish priests&mdash;and yet these men are now to be branded as pariah dogs and outcasts.</P>
    <P>We read in the same papers of the horrors that were perpetrated in certain prison camps, and what it meant to those afflicted human beings that were interned in these camps, when the armies of their deliverers came along.  When the humanitarian forces behind these armies came along to try to revive the half-dead bodies of the people who went through all that in order to bring this relief, we in this Christian country, cannot do anything better for the Irishmen who took part in the <Col N="401" /> bringing of that relief, than to say, in effect: &ldquo;You have gone all through the horrors of Belsen merely to suffer a sentence of seven years' starvation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is only three months since we discussed in the Dáil the continuation or otherwise of the Emergency Act, and the Taoiseach, speaking in an apologetic tone, told us that it was only necessary to continue these appalling powers for a period&mdash;for a junta in secret to make laws for certain dangers.  We were told that, as far as it was humanly possible, and as rapidly as possible, one power after another contained in the emergency enactments would be dropped. With these words still echoing around the building, the Emergency Act is used to bring in this particular Order.  An Emergency Act, which has a life of only 12 months, is used or abused to impose penalties upon people for seven long years.  I believe, in the first place, that it is illegal; in the second place that it is unconstitutional and, in the third place, unchristian.  When I ask why it is done, the Minister for Defence throws up his hand.  Is there not ample machinery for dealing with deserters?  We know what public feeling in this country is with regard to these men, that they are being looked upon as fools, and merely sentenced to one or two months' imprisonment. In view of the hardship, the dangers and the sufferings of these men elsewhere, the general good sense of the public was that, whatever their offence, they had sponged the slate clean and there was sympathy with the mothers, wives and children.</P>
    <P>In the early part of this year, questions were put to the Minister from various parts of the House, and his reply was that probably he would &ldquo;chuck&rdquo; the whole thing, that these men might be struck off the register or something like that.  Then, like a bolt from the blue, we find Ministers skedaddling, washing their hands of responsibility, suggesting that the ordinary disciplinary code laid down year after year since 1922 was not drastic enough, and not terrible enough to deal with these men, that this starvation Order must be passed <Col N="402" />&mdash;seven years' starvation, seven years destitution or seven years' exile. What is the good of talking about emigration, talking about national hæmorrhage, saying that the youth of the country, through economic stress is driven abroad, when we frame Orders under the Emergency Act to exile people or to drive them out for seven years, merely because of their action?  These penalties are not for desertion.  Let the Minister tell us the sentences imposed and the number of cases in which no sentence was imposed for deserting the forces of this country.  This is an Order designed and aimed at one particular section of deserters, and it is not to punish them for desertion.  It is to punish them for service elsewhere, for service abroad.  If the proposal of the Minister or the Army was that the ordinary course would be followed, that the ordinary machinery laid down from the beginning for dealing with desertion would operate, my voice would not be raised.  If an army is to be maintained at at all, it is necessary to maintain discipline and to punish infringements of the military code.  It is necessary to deal with absentees.  It is essential to deal with deserters coming under the emergency regulations.  When the war is over, it is better to forget rather than to revive old feuds or point the finger of scorn at men who may be accused of desertion, but definitely cannot be accused of cowardice, as against the fellow who left, not to fight, either at home or abroad, but merely because he could not stand soldiering.</P>
    <P>I do not believe this could be done at a more unfortunate time.  The world is distracted with war, is crippled and bleeding as a result of war.  Statesmen all over the world are trying to heal the wounds and to repair the damage of war, to replace enmity with friendship and, perhaps; in no small country is it more imperative that we should try to cultivate friendly relations with our neighbours and with others, than in this country.  Our whole attitude during the war has been misunderstood and distorted to the detriment of this country.  Now that the war is over, we should not supply fresh <Col N="403" /> fuel to the flames that are already there.  No thinking man could read that Order as anything but an Order to punish those who served in the armies of the United Nations.  It discriminates between one type of deserter and another.  This country is nearly exhausted, without supplies.  A Minister went across to England recently to establish contact, or to try to reopen essential contacts between the two Governments, to try to remove misunderstanding, to try to create a spirit of friendship and here we have an Order of this kind, an Order stimulated by malice, seething with hatred, oozing with venom.  No one who reads that Order would say that that description is exaggerated or uncharitable.</P>
    <P>The Minister may grin.  The Minister knows that we grew rich on the sacrifices, the sufferings and the hardships of others.  We got untold wealth because the war passed us by and the least we can do is to be charitable, to be understanding with regard to the men who went through the flames of that war, to the men irrespective of nationality, who met danger at far distant points and pinned it down and crushed it there.  If we had any of the spirit of soldiers in our make-up, we would forget the past.  We would hold out the hand of friendship and allow those men who soldiered through the toughest times anybody ever soldiered through, come home without penalty, and without scorn to rejoin their homes and resume a life of peace.  There is no one going to tolerate or to believe that it is either Christian or fair to sentence these unfortunate men to seven years' starvation, seven years' destitution.  Let us realise that we are not only sentencing the men themselves but sentencing the families&mdash;the mothers, the wives and little children.  I urge the Government to annul that particular Order, to annul it even if it is only as a gesture of burying the hatchet and of giving some little evidence of a desire for better understanding on both sides of the water.  If we will not do it as an act of statesmanship or as a gesture of friendship, let us do it as the outcome of a Christian impulse rather than; as <Col N="404" /> a Parliament, be branded with a brutal and inhuman outlook for sentencing even one man or one family to seven years' starvation.</P>

      <P>It is rather amusing.  I shall give the Deputy credit for one thing&mdash;he never concealed his attitude during the war.  We would not have been neutral if he could have helped it.  I ask the Minister, in his statement, to refute the imputation that this Order was inspired by malice against a certain group of Irishmen because they held certain political opinions.  Let us regard this matter realistically.  Desertion from an army is desertion.  It cannot be camouflaged. It is either desertion or it is not and it is doubly damaging and doubly dangerous to the army from which desertion takes places if the deserter joins another army which might conceivably be fighting the army from which he deserted.  Let us have some sense of reality.  The Army authorities here are asked to condone the act of a man who deserts from the Irish Army and joins another army which the Irish Army may conceivably be fighting. Such a deserter is in a position to use whatever capacity he has as a fighter against the Irish Army and he is also in a position to act as a very dangerous spy.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister to disavow, in no uncertain way, and to deny the Deputy's statement, that this Order was inspired by malice against anybody or against any country.  The Irish Army authorities are in control of the National Defence Forces.  It is their business to look after the welfare and security of those forces.  The Defence Forces are entrusted with the security of the State and they would be traitors if they did not do their duty in that direction and, especially, take every step in their power to put down desertion.</P>

      <P>Listening to Deputy O'Higgins, I was rather surprised that he did not advocate pensions for deserters from our Army to the British army.  He has advocated practically everything else.  He suggests or implies that we should be out meeting our Army deserters with bands and banners, welcoming them back.  He refers to the service they have given to other countries as if that service had been given to our own State.  What would anybody think of an army which condoned desertion?  What would anybody think of an army, charged with the responsibility which the Irish Army had during the serious crisis through which we have passed during the past four years, which would turn a blind eye to soldiers going off to another army which might possibly be engaged in an armed conflict with the forces of this State?  It was interesting to hear the story told by Deputy O'Higgins about the service of Irish soldiers in those outside countries.  It is very strange that we should hear Deputy O'Higgins sing their praises, while we do not hear their praises sung by the people whom they served. What is the attitude of those people towards some Irish soldiers who were in an alien land, were conscripted by the British into their army and who, subsequently, returned to their own country?  They are being dealt with by the British army authorities and it is not a question of seven years in that case.  They are being sentenced, possibly, to life service in the Middle East and in other white men's graves <Col N="406" /> which the British have under their control.  That is the way they are treating our citizens who happened to be in Britain at the time the war broke out and who were conscripted.  We do not hear any voice raised in protest against that treatment by Deputy O'Higgins' Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not hear any protest in this House about the way those unfortunate citizens of ours are being treated for returning to their own country.  What is the attitude of those people to some of our citizens who, although not in their army, happened to return here on a one-way ticket during the emergency&mdash;possibly, in order to avoid conscription?  No matter how long those citizens were there or whether they were married or not, they find every difficulty put in their way when they try to take up the livelihood which was broken in the way which I have described.  They find that the British authorities are not prepared to allow them to go back to the work they had been at for years.  We hear no protest about that attitude from Deputy O'Higgins but we hear this song and dance about Belsen camps and so forth and about the glorious place the Irishmen who were in the British Army won for themselves. There is not one word about the treatment of our citizens, who owed no allegiance to the British, but who, for one reason or another, found themselves under the control of the British at the time conscription was introduced, and who tried to get back to their own country.  The Deputy's suggestion that an Irish citizen, having joined the Army of this State during the period of emergency and having deserted to a possible enemy, should get either the thanks of this House or should be freed from punishment, is simply putting a premium on desertion and a premium on treason. I cannot conceive anything nearer to treason than the desertion of a soldier of our Army to another army during a state of national crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is about time that the Army authorities and the Government recognised the seriousness of the <Col N="407" /> situation.  It was the first time in our history that we had to face such a crisis.  It was the first time in our history that our Army was called upon to face the responsibility of defending this State in case it was attacked by any outside State.  During that national crisis, even if the Army had no previous experience or no preconceived ideas upon which they might act in such a crisis, they discharged the job effectively.  I think now is the time that the State and the Army authorities in particular should recognise the dangers of desertion from the Army during such a period.  They should recognise in particular the danger of the desertion of our trained soldiers to some army that might conceivably belong to any enemy State.  I think now is the time to lay down a stern rule for future guidance so that it will be known to every citizen in the State that the punishment for the offence of desertion will be very severe.  In other countries the punishment for such a crime is that the guilty soldier is simply put up against the wall and shot.  I think that we here are possibly looking at this matter from a very mild angle.  Deputy O'Higgins, the mover of this motion, does not appear to appreciate the responsibilities that the Army faced in this country during the crisis.  He does not appear to have any fair appreciation of the desirability of making the punishment fit the crime, so long as the individual concerned deserted to the people with whom the Deputy has been in sympathy in this war.  Irrespective of the army to which our soldiers deserted &mdash; let it be the British, German or any other army&mdash; desertion is desertion and I think the measures laid down in this Order for dealing with such offences are not, in fact, severe enough.  I think if anything the State should go further and make it clear to all citizens of the State that crimes of this character during a period of national emergency will be severely punished.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>A deliberate attempt has been made by the last two speakers from the Government Benches to cloud the issue.  Nothing was clearer from the statement by Deputy Dr. <Col N="408" /> O'Higgins than that his quarrel with the procedure laid down by Emergency Powers No. 362 Order of 1945, was that the Army was not dealing with this matter of desertion.  It is quite clear that neither of the two Deputies who spoke last read the Order because the effect of this Order is to take from the Army authorities the disposal of these people who did desert during the time of the emergency.  I would suggest to them seriously, particularly to the last speaker who happens to be a legal man, to read the Order.  The Order means that the Army authorities will not deal with deserters but that, instead, these men will be black-listed, not only for State employment but for employment by local authorities, by the Electricity Supply Board, by Córas Iompair Éireann, by the sugar company and every other statutory board or body set up under Acts of this House.  That is the effect of the Order. Not only do we by this Order effectively prevent them from obtaining such employment but we go even further and say their dismissals from the Army shall not be a discharge for the purposes of unemployment benefit. We say therefore that neither can they get employment nor unemployment benefit.  That is the reward which we give to men who, whatever their motives may have been, left this country to fight on far foreign fields&mdash;and they were not the first soldiers of an Irish Army to desert to fight on far foreign fields.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to attempt to defend men who desert in a time of national emergency, but I put this picture before Deputy Moran.  Many of these young men joined up in the hope that they would see service in this country. They joined up believing that this country was then in danger, and after two or three years, seeing no hope of active service and getting &ldquo;fed up&rdquo; with the boredom of the barrack square, they left for a place where they might engage in active fighting. That was possibly the reason that many of them left.  Whatever the motive may have been, I believe the majority of them left for that reason&mdash; because they were active adventurous soldiers.  Picture the situation that will arise when this Order comes into <Col N="409" /> effect and when these men return.  A man is living in a small village down the country, and he looks for road work under the local authorities.  He is told by the ganger or the surveyor: &ldquo;You are black-listed: you are disqualified from getting work because you fought with the United Nations during the war&rdquo;.  He goes to the sugar company, the Electricity Supply Board or some other body and he is likewise black-listed.  Is that a situation calculated to promote friendly relations between this country and our nearest neighbour?  Is not that very policy&mdash;whatever the motive behind the Order&mdash;designed to promote bad feeling and bad blood between ourselves and our neighbours?</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that there was malice in the Minister's mind or in the mind of the Government when the Order was drafted but I can see cases arising, and Press publicity as a result of these cases, where men will be refused employment under local authorities for which they would be otherwise eligible.  I can see flare headings and these men being described as ex-soldiers who fought for freedom and who are not now allowed to get a living in their own country merely because of the fact that they did fight. That will be the effect of the Order.  I think from that angle, from the angle of our relations with our neighbours, the Order is calculated to have a very bad effect and I deprecate it from that point of view.</P>
    <P>Let it be clearly understood that the Army authorities are not dealing with desertion at all under this Order.  The disposal of deserters is being taken, lock, stock and barrel, from the Army authorities.  These men are being branded as men who are to be disqualified from any class of employment in the State under a local authority or a statutory board because they were soldiers of the United Nations.  Anybody who has even a remote experience of army matters knows full well that in normal times deserters may be classed under various heads, but particularly under two heads.  There is first the young soldier who perhaps deserts to seek a fight elsewhere, as I suggest <Col N="410" /> many of these men did.  When that man is brought back, if he is sentenced by his own authorities, his sentence is a nominal one.  You have then the malingerer, the fellow who wants to shirk his duty, who does not want to see any fighting anywhere.  When he is caught and brought back he is kicked out of the Army and that is the end of him.  By what you are doing under this Order, you are not thinking of the military discipline of the men.</P>
    <P>You are not bringing these men before a court-martial; you are merely depriving them of their civil rights for a period of seven years.  That is the great objection I see to this Order. You deprive them of the right to work-under the State, under the local authorities or under any statutory body set up under an Act of this House.  You are depriving them of unemployment benefit.  That, to my mind, is a serious encroachment on the rights of these men as citizens.  I have not gone into the matter but I would venture the opinion that that is entirely unconstitutional and that this Order is <i>ultra vires</i> for that very reason.  Whilst the intention behind this Order was probably a good one, while the motive was probably to dispense with the court-martialling of these men when they come home, I think we have jumped from the frying-pan into the fire and have made matters worse because the penalty that we are imposing here, the deprivation of civil rights, to my mind, is a far more serious penalty than any court-martial or any civil court would impose. These cases could have been disposed of by the district justices or the military authorities and I venture to suggest that, if they had been so disposed of, in 99 per cent. of the cases the men would have got no more than a month's imprisonment and that would have been an end of the matter. Under this Order we are depriving them of their civil rights for a period of seven years.  I consider that that is unjustifiable and unconstitutional.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to portion of Deputy O'Higgins' speech and, as usual, we listened to venom, in fact I should say, nonsense.  His <Col N="411" /> speech indicated to me quite clearly that Deputy O'Higgins and his Party have no hope of ever becoming a Government and, that being the case, he, together with the seconder of the motion, is completely irresponsible. What has occurred recently may occur again.  A great number of people are of the opinion that another war will follow the last war.  If men are not disciplined in an army then there is no use in having an army.  If the Government had not stepped in and taken control of the punishment to be meted out to these men and if that punishment were left to the Army, I think the punishment would not be anything like as mild as that which the Minister proposes to administer.  There was an actual state of war in existence at the time these men deserted.  We were a neutral country and we were bound to defend ourselves and to take whatever steps were necessary to preserve discipline in the Army.  We were also bound to take whatever steps were necessary to ensure that the succeeding Government would be in a position to maintain discipline in the Army.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins must have no hope in that direction. He took no precautions whatsoever, when he made that speech, to maintain discipline in the Army.  I do not know to what army these men deserted. Some of them may have deserted to the British Army and others may have deserted to other armies, but Deputy Dr. O'Higgins has persuaded himself that it is because men deserted to the British Army, and only because of that, that they are being punished. The seconder of the motion knows a good deal about discipline.  He knows the importance of discipline.  The Minister is doing his utmost to maintain discipline in the Army and to pass the Army on to whatever Government may follow as a disciplined force.</P>

      <P>It is my personal opinion, and I think it is not incorrect, that if the military authorities were left to deal with these men their methods would be much more severe and much more harsh than the methods adopted by the Minister and, therefore, it is an act of mercy, as far as I can see it, on the Minister's part.  He has the right to step in and to administer some form of punishment to these men.  It would be a strange country in which, where such a case occurred, the Government were unable to step in and prevent undue hardship, perhaps sentence of death, being imposed on these men.  This is a definite warning to them and to future generations that such a thing must not occur again.  As far as Deputy O'Higgins' reference, that we are continuously trying to pick little quarrels with other countries and then going to beg favours of them, is concerned, after the calamity that has <Col N="413" /> occurred in the world, very few countries have any favours to grant. I am sorry for it.  It is an awful misfortune, but that is the fact and the sooner we stop talking nonsense to the effect that Tom, Dick or Harry has something to give us, the sooner we will realise tha the only thing we have in this country at the moment is what we can produce ourselves and that if we want to prosper we must maintain discipline.  As a Government, possibly continuing in office for a long time, one of the things we must keep in mind is that there must be discipline in this State.  Deputy Dr. O'Higgins and the last speaker are perfectly well aware of that fact but, on Deputy O'Higgins' part, the venom oozed forth and the seconder of the motion merely followed him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been very much interested in this debate.  On the 17th May last I tabled a question to the Minister for Defence asking him if he was prepared to allow all soldiers who left the Army without leave and joined other armies during the war to return here without fear of legal proceedings being instituted against them.  I was constantly in touch with the Minister for Defence on behalf of these men.  After the publication of that matter in the Press I received letters from Africa, India and every place where British soldiers were stationed.  Some of these men did not join for the love of England.  As the soldiers say, they got &ldquo;browned off&rdquo; in Eire.  Some crossed the Border and joined the air force.  The married men went because they got better separation allowances.  The cost of living being so high in this country, they had to get better wages.  I was very thankful to the Minister and it was a great relief to the mothers, fathers, wives and families of these men when the Minister lifted the ban and allowed them to return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised to hear Deputy Dr. O'Higgins and the other Deputies, who did not raise a voice until now, when the men are coming back.  These men are not asking for jobs.  They will get jobs.  The majority of them probably will not come back at all.  They will get better jobs, probably, in the countries <Col N="414" /> that they have served.  I should like to put this matter to the Minister. Among 16 candidates for a position as rate collector in Wexford County Council there were two ex-lieutenants and two privates of our own Army. None of the soldiers who served our State got a vote other than my own and that of another colleague.  I do not see what hope there is for the men who are to come back from the British Army when our own men are being let down by local bodies.  On behalf of the wives and families of those who deserted from the Army, I wish to thank the Minister for lifting the ban and allowing these young Irishmen to come home.  Since the announcement appeared in the papers, many of them have come to my county to see their wives and families or fathers and mothers.  They are not asking for doles.  They are not worrying about what Deputy O'Higgins said, that they are going to be starved out.  All that a soldier can get from the labour exchange is three days' work a week on relief schemes.  These men do not want these jobs.  If there is nothing better for them in this country, I hope they will stay where they will get a full week's work every week.  We have enough to do here to find positions for the men in our own Army when they are demobilised.  I do not see any work being provided here although the war is at an end.  We have thousands of unemployed here.  I know that the men in our own Army who are looking for their discharge are not looking for it to get work here.  They are thinking of getting out of the country and going abroad.</P>
    <P>When I hear people talking about this matter I wonder why they did not think of it long ago.  I had the courage to put down a question to the Minister asking if he would allow these men to come back to this country, because I knew of some of them who came as far as Dublin but could not go home to their own counties for the funerals of their fathers or their mothers.  I was asked to do something for these men. As I say, I put down a question and, through the goodness of the Government and the Minister, these men were allowed to come back to this country. I do not see why we should have all <Col N="415" /> this talk about seven years in a Belsen camp.  I do not believe that the position of these men will be as bad as has been represented, because there are employers in this country who will probably give work to men who served in the British Army rather than to those who served in our own Army. They will probably give them jobs before they will give jobs to those who joined the Irish Army.</P>
    <P>In regard to this question of giving these men work and providing them with the dole, I have a letter here which appeared in the Dublin <i>Evening Mail</i> on the day I put the question in the Dáil referring to these deserters. The letter is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Sir,&mdash;Will some of your readers tell me what is going to become of the large number of our boys who deserted the Irish Army to join the British?  Some of them left because they wanted to get into real fighting; others because the money was too small with which to support their families, the cost of living being so high in our country.  Are these boys going to be allowed to visit their homes after going through the horrors of war or are they to go into exile?  Many mothers are longing to see their beloved sons.  Is there no one to give them a break?&mdash;My Wild Irish Boy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>An awful fuss is being kicked up about these men now that the war is over.  These men will be all right. There is no need to worry about them. They only want to come back to this country to see their people.  They are not asking for jobs.  I do not believe that the Minister is going to be so harsh with them that they will not get anything in this country for seven years.  I do not think that is right. We are sending food to other countries. Surely when these fellows come back here, if any of them come back, we ought to be able to give them enough to eat anyhow.  I think too much of our time in this House is spent on debating matters that should not be debated at all.  It would be better if we debated questions affecting the future of this country rather than <Col N="416" /> things which happened in the past, and not have any bickering going on from any side of the House.  We are all sent here to do the best we can for our people.  It is our duty to voice their grievances in a friendly way when we come here and not have any bickering or going back over old sores and asking what such a fellow did and what the other fellow did.  We should look to the future.  The Government should get going in order to provide employment for every man who is able and fit to work.</P>

Under this regulation, which there is so much talk about, and so much humanitarianism preached from the opposite benches, we are told that a man is deprived of his civic rights and of work for seven years because, being an attested soldier of this country, he deserted to a foreign Power.  I should like to ask who were the first people who introduced into this country this idea of preventing a man from earning his living here?  Men like Deputy O'Higgins and the Party to which he belongs drove Irishmen into exile and made them starve in this country, their only crime being that they fought for their own country and believed in its right to be free.</P>

      <P>We are dealing in this Order with the cases of men who joined first, of their own free will, to give their services to this country in a time of emergency and who, for some reasons of their own, deserted from that Army in such a way that they could not be dealt with in the ordinary manner.  We have been told that they could be dealt with under the ordinary law governing deserters for the last 20 years.  The ordinary law was not sufficient, in any respect, to deal with the last few years in general, much less with the Army.  These men got away <Col N="418" /> out of the country, so that they could not be apprehended and dealt with, even under that law.  Now we are told we should forget all that; we are told that, in the interests of friendly relations with other countries, we should forget that.  Was the conscription of our people, in other countries, an act to promote friendly relations?  Are we to think first of other countries rather than of our own?</P>
      <P>In the case of people who think it wise to desert from our Army, who think that the policy of neutrality adopted by the huge majority of our people was not sufficient for them, who take it upon themselves to desert from the Army which they voluntarily joined, and who leave the Army authorities in the position that they cannot deal with them in the ordinary way, it is necessary that steps be taken to show them that their duty was first to their own country.  The Order is not, in itself, of the unduly harsh nature it has been represented to be.</P>

      <P>The question involved now is such that we in these benches are entitled to say at the moment that we are of the opinion that the Order should stand.  There are certain points that merit discussion and on which the Minister might be able to enlighten us.  It is unfortunate that, when Deputy O'Higgins started off, whatever his views may be, he started on a wrong basis, and if the discussion has taken a turn that is not helpful to his point of view, he has largely himself to blame.  It is correct&mdash; and even Deputy O'Higgins has made the declaration himself&mdash;that in principle and in practice we cannot condone desertion.  There is no question of that.  Therefore, the only question is the means and machinery to deal with it.  Possibly it is correct that many members of the National Defence Forces who deserted and went elsewhere did so because they were inspired with certain views as to where political and military activity should be carried on and they were interested in it; but that does not apply to all of them.  We are quite well aware that many of them went elsewhere, not because of any political views, but because the financial attraction was much stronger than that which we were able to hold out to them.  For a long time past, I have expressed the view in this House that the conditions we offered to serving members of the Defence Forces could not be justified.  I still hold to that view, both in regard to direct pay given to the men and in regard to the allowances given to the dependents. While recognising that position and while knowing personally that many men did desert and go elsewhere because of the undoubted hardships their dependents were undergoing during the war, countless other men bore equally great hardships on themselves and their families and did not desert.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever may be said for the views held by individuals as regards the issues involved in the war&mdash;and I suppose we all have our own views&mdash;it is <Col N="421" /> correct that our own country claims our first duty and responsibility.  From that point of view, we must take the attitude that we support in principle the continuance of the Order and will vote against the motion.  However, there are certain features that I, personally, do not like and I think the Minister should give us information as to why the established and recognised machinery of the Army was found unfit to deal with this particular problem. Was it a question of the numbers to be dealt with being so large that it was physically impossible to deal with it? Was it a question that, because of the different types of case to be dealt with, certain difficulties would present themselves in deciding on an equitable basis the punishment that would be meted out to the different individuals?</P>
    <P>There are various reasons why men have left the Army.  There is the man who deserted merely because he did not like the particular kind of life; you have the man who deserted because he got into difficulties in his personal relationships; then there are men who deserted for financial or political reasons.  In this respect a whole host of reasons could be considered and probably the best way of dealing with them would be through the established machinery where each case could be considered on its merits and adequate punishment meted out. What I do not like is this seven years' provision&mdash;what is called civil disability. I quite see the point of view that a man who deserts this country in its hour of need has relinquished any claim he may have on it; but possibly if his case was dealt with under the ordinary Army regulations and if he were sentenced, the effect would be almost the same as under this particular provision.</P>
    <P>It is the omnibus nature of the provision to which I object.  There is the point that this man could come back into the civilian life of this country as a citizen and make his contribution to rates and taxes through the ordinary course of employment, but under this provision he will be debarred from doing so.  We must take into consideration that, apart from the man himself suffering <Col N="422" /> punishment, there is another aspect, that his dependents will also be penalised.  From that point of view I think there is room for argument as to why that form of punishment has been decided upon.</P>
    <P>We can all appreciate the position that, where a man has deserted from the Defence Forces, he may desert for reasons peculiar to himself&mdash;personal reasons.  He may have no political reasons whatsoever.  He may not be interested in making financial provision for his family.  In addition to all that, his wife and children may have had no opportunity of expressing their views as to the course he takes.  He leaves them here, but possibly at some later date he may send them financial assistance.  Whatever the position may be, it was purely his decision, yet now we propose to punish his wife and children who had no part whatever in his desertion and who had no opportunity of commenting on the situation.  I think that is very unfair and some very strong argument would need to be put forward to justify it.</P>
    <P>I would not prefer to deal with each case in the manner proposed by the Government.  I would sooner see individuals brought before the proper authorities, and, when the case is dealt with, proper punishment could be meted out to the individual responsible. We should not, as we are doing now, take all cases regardless of the fine points of difference that exist.  In addition to imposing a penalty of seven years' civic disability on the individuals who have deserted, we also ensure that a share of punishment will be borne by the wives and families of these men.  I suggest that it is a fairly severe penalty, because the percentage of employment that can be afforded by the central authority and the local authorities in this country is substantial. Apart from that, there is also a disability suffered by these persons in respect of unemployment insurance.  It could be logically argued that it would be ridiculous to regard a man as a deserted and at the same time give him all the privileges that are granted to members of the forces in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="423" /> It is the spirit that is behind this whole Order that is objectionable.  On the principle of not condoning desertion and taking the attitude that it would be unfair and out of place to the men who did continue with their soldierly duties, regardless of what may have been their political views, their personal inconveniences or their financial disabilities, it could be argued that it would be unfair that the slate should be wiped clean, and that these men could make a fresh start; but I suggest there is a case to be answered by the Minister with regard to the machinery and with regard to the extent of the punishment for the individual and the possibility that it may be levied on his wife and family.</P>

      <P>I have few words to say with regard to what I characterise as a rather vindictive motion.  It should be clear to everybody that those who desert the Army of their own land, who disregard their pledged word and oath to fight for its freedom and its principles, and who join another army and pledge allegiance to another nation, may in the course of world events be pitted against their own native land.  The principle at stake is this, as I see it, that the Army here could deal with its deserters so long as they remain in their own country, or even left it and returned to it without joining the army of any other nation.  We had here a declared policy of neutrality, with the unanimous voice of this nation behind it, and if we cannot insist on the members of our own Army being under discipline and obeying that regulation, how then can we expect the ordinary citizens of our land to follow the lead that the Government, with the united voice of the nation behind them, can command?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not a fact that not only did these men break Army discipline, but they also broke our internationally <Col N="424" /> understood policy, which brings them under the jurisdiction of the Army as well as under the jurisdiction of the Department of External Affairs for fighting in another army while we at home had declared our neutrality, our resolve, not to take part in the wars of the world?  That is the reason for this Order.  Not only did they desert their own Army, but they broke the declared policy of this country by fighting with another army while they were bound, as citizens of this State, to a neutral policy.  That is the reason for the Government's Order.</P>

      <P>He made a speech this evening which consisted of the grossest form of exaggeration.  The rules of Parliamentary debate insist that that is the only description I can apply to it.  He started by getting inside the minds of the Government, the Minister for Defence and everyone for whom he spoke.  He was able to tell us almost everything that all these different and varying sections were thinking, and in his own grossly exaggerated way, he went on to explain only his own views which were incorrect but which he gave to the House as being the positive facts of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He talked about the manner in which the Army dealt with cases of <Col N="425" /> desertion in the past, during the emergency. I want to tell Deputy O'Higgins that any cases which were dealt with by court-martial during the emergency were dealt with in the severest possible manner&mdash;in a manner so severe in many cases that Deputies made representations to me to get the sentences reduced.  I should like to remind the Deputy that if these cases were now to be dealt with by the Army by way of court-martial each of the persons found guilty would be liable to penal servitude.  I am not suggesting that any of these men would be sent to penal servitude&mdash;I am not suggesting that for a moment; I should abhor the idea of any of these men being sent to penal servitude arising out of the act they committed.</P>

Deputy Larkin referred to the fact that a man could be sent to penal servitude for seven years for this crime, and he had previously referred to the fact that this Order which the Government were enforcing was inflicting certain forms of punishment on the man's family as well as upon the man. Would penal servitude not inflict those forms of punishment?  Would penal servitude not also deprive the man of his civic rights for a long number of years which this Order does not pretend to do at all?</P>

      <P>And you proved it by your opening speech.  Much play has been made with the question as to why the Army did not deal with these cases and why we should deal with them through the medium of this Order.  I will endeavour to explain that.  There are something like 4,020 men involved in this whole business.  We could, if we wished, have maintained the position which obtained before Deputy O'Leary asked his question in the Dáil.  We could have insisted that every man, as he came back to this country, should be apprehended or should surrender immediately on landing and then would arise the question of his court-martial.</P>
      <P>From my experience of these courts-martial, they run over a considerable period of time.  The preliminary matters of arrangement run sometimes over a couple of weeks and the court-martial itself may very easily run over two, three or four days.  In the meantime, if the 4,000 people were suddenly to make up their minds to return, it would place a burden on the Army with which the Army would find it impossible to deal, and, as I mentioned, the only alternative was to keep these people out altogether, or to arrest them and to have them remanded until such time as they could be dealt with, which might be a considerable period, and, as I said in answer to Deputy O'Leary, it was not worth the trouble.  I concluded my reply to that question by saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I propose, therefore, if the Government agree, to introduce legislation which will have the effect the Deputy desires, but which will also deprive a deserter of any rights he may have had as a member of the Defence Forces, as well as of any right for a long time to employment remunerated out of public funds.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An effort was made to make our <Col N="427" /> spines curl up during Deputy O'Higgins' speech.  We could see people scattered all round the place, starving to death, with terrible forms of destitution prevailing.  His vivid imagination pictured a state of affairs something like what we are told exists in Central Europe at present.  We are only depriving these men, first, of any of the emoluments which the men who were loyal to the Army were entitled to; and, secondly, of the right to secure employment in any concern in which the government may have an interest. Why are we doing that?  We are doing it because over 40,000 men gave loyal service to this nation and we are going to see that, so far as these appointments, however many or however few they may be, are concerned, they will go to the men who gave loyal service to this nation in time of peril.  That is what we are doing.  No question, good, bad or indifferent, of vindictiveness enters into this matter, but the bad mind of the Deputy had to insist that we were doing it for some vindictive, vengeful purpose.</P>

      <P>What they did consider was that these men&mdash;and the Deputy did not refer to it&mdash;broke the solemn oath they gave to this nation and to the Army to serve it faithfully. The Deputy, in his speech, in his harangue, in his vitriolic abuse, did not once refer to the fact that these men, voluntarily, without any compulsion, took an oath of allegiance to this nation which they did not respect, and which the Deputy now suggests there was no necessity for them to respect. The Deputy wants us to bring out bands and banners to meet these fellows and give them a welcome home for all the gallant deeds they did in China, Japan or the other places he referred to.</P>

They made a solemn bond between themselves and the nation, undertaking to serve the nation and the Army faithfully.  They broke that oath.  As I said, there are over 40,000 men who will be entitled to whatever is going.  All that this Order does is to ensure that they will get priority in respect to any appointments which may become available.  I do not know how many appointments, or how few appointments, will be available, but whether the number be large or small, it is the men who gave loyal service to this nation who will get the opportunity of securing whatever employment is there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say that there will be no deprivation as regards unemployment assistance in the case of these men.  I think Deputy Larkin feared that would be so.  I want to say to him that these men will not be deprived of unemployment assistance, nor will they be deprived of the right to secure work anywhere in the city, or throughout the nation for that matter, if they can secure it on their own merits.  I think that Deputy O'Leary gave the best answer that <Col N="429" /> could be given in this House to Deputy O'Higgins.  I would refer Deputy O'Higgins to what Deputy O'Leary said in the course of his speech.  If he refers to it, it may help to enlighten him.  It is true, as Deputy O'Leary remarked, that most of those men who gave that type of service will get work from certain types of people in this country and that they will get it sooner perhaps than a lot of the men who gave loyal service to this nation. Therefore, Deputy O'Higgins need not worry himself too much.  Despite the gross exaggeration which Deputy O'Higgins indulged in in the course of his speech, and it was mere exaggeration and not fact, I want to assure the House, so far as it requires an assurance from me&mdash;I am pretty certain it does not require very much assurance&mdash;that, as far as these men who broke their solemn bond with this nation are concerned, they are in no worse position now than they were in before they joined the Army.  They will not get the benefits, in the form of gratuities, deferred pay, and so on, that the men who gave loyal service to the nation will get.  The only thing which they will be deprived of, and rightly so, is the privilege of securing work in any of those concerns in which the Government have rights.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to say anything more, beyond emphasising the fact that the only thing the Government were concerned with was that these men deserted. The Government were not concerned with their motives.  They may have acted from different motives such as those referred to by many Deputies, the motive of adventure, the motive to get into a fight, or the desire to get more money than they were getting here; but whatever their motives were, not a single one of those motives gives a man the right to desert an army which he joins voluntarily, an army in which he takes a solemn oath to serve. So far as I am concerned anyway, there is no motive that would justify a man in breaking that solemn oath.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister tells us that the number of deserters who did not surrender and were not caught is 4,000, out of the 40,000 who, he says, served in the emergency, we are in the position that we are dealing with 10 per cent. of the total number of men who over, say, five years, were in the Army or entered the Army.  We are, therefore, dealing with very many different types of characters and with men operating in very different kinds of circumstances.  I do not think that the problem that is suggested by what is implied in those figures can be dismissed by any kind of rule of thumb. The Minister indicated that he told the House earlier that he was going to deal, in some way, with this matter by legislation.  It may be fortunate that the Minister has made this emergency Order and that we have had a discussion on it&mdash;that is, if the Minister will think over the problem before he introduces his permanent legislation to deal with the general question of deserters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy M. O'Reilly told us that what is in this Emergency Order is a warning to future generations, while Deputy Moran told us that now is the time to lay down a stern rule for the future.  Therefore, we are in the position that we are having a warning for future generations and a stern rule for the future to deal with desertion. We are having it promulgated by Emergency Order without publicity of any kind, or a statement of any kind, that, as far back as the 8th August of this year, every aspect of the emergency, from the military point of view, was completely over, and that the future of armies, the future of wars and the future of defence services of every kind was absolutely in <Col N="431" /> the melting pot and that no General Staff in the world would sit down and say what kind of army, or what kind of disciplined organisation, they wanted to meet the next world war. What we principally object to is that this problem should be dealt with on the 8th August of this year by an Emergency Order.</P>
    <P>I submit to the Minister that, as soon as the emergency is over&mdash;and I take it that he is not going to put the date of the ending of the emergency, from a military point of view, later than 1st January next&mdash;from a legal point of view the provisions of that Order will completely go; it will have no continuing effect.  That is a matter which he might have intended to deal with by legislation. As this Order stands there is tremendous discrimination.  In the first place, there is discrimination between officers and men; the Order is intended to apply only to men.  Then there is discrimination between men who were not caught or did not surrender before the date of the Order, and men who did.  Various speakers on the other side have indicated that this is mild treatment to give to people who deserted the Irish Army and joined an army which, as Deputy Colley said, might possibly be in conflict with those men's own country. Do not let us talk awful nonsense when we are dealing with these matters.  What did happen before the issue of this Order in relation to deserters?  The Minister suggests that it was possible under the legislation which existed to impose very severe penalties.  It was possible, and rightly possible, but the cases that were tried by court-martial before the issue of this Order were dealt with on their merits, both on the circumstances of the time and on the merits of the men.  I have seen many people smiling at the tolerance of the British Army authorities, and saying that, when a deserter from the Irish Army joined the British Army, and then came back here on leave and was caught, got six or eight weeks' imprisonment, and then was ignominiously discharged out of the <Col N="432" /> Army, he went back to the British Army and got his back pay and his separation allowance for the period of his unavoidable absence.  That was as well known to the members of the Army and to the officers of the Army as it was to anybody outside who was discussing the matter.  The Minister must know that while a very severe frame of mind was adopted by the Army authorities with regard to desertion from the Army during the emergency, and we all would adopt the same attitude&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the early part of this war, when the Ministers were, in my opinion, for purely political purposes, suggesting that this country was likely to be invaded by Great Britain, if the attitude of the Government were really serious they would have been very severe on desertions.  But the sentences passed on such deserters were very light.  In the latter part of the war it was quite clear to everybody on the street that there was a complete understanding, co-ordination and exchange of views between the Government here and the British Government on military matters, and it was at that particular time that this Order was made.  I suggest that all kinds of interpretations can be placed on this Order.  The outstanding interpretation that can be placed upon it is that the small amount of employment which is available will be distributed in a way <Col N="433" /> that will be dictated by the Government or by the Minister.  I quite agree that in the giving of employment under the local authorities, under the statutory authorities, under the Government, preference should be given to National Army men.  That was the system which we adopted from the time of the formation of the National Army, when an army of 50,000 men had to be recruited and then were demobilised. It is that type of administration that Deputies on the far side have been criticising here this afternoon, but it is the natural thing to do, and it would be natural that the Minister and the Government would do it.  But I submit that that could very well be done without creating a class of 4,000 people in this country who will have to be blacklisted. A list will have to be kept by every employment exchange, by every county council, by every Government Department, and by every body that has any statutory position in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I think there is a grave injustice under clause 4 (b), which says that: &ldquo;No pension, gratuity or allowance in respect of his service in the Defence Forces shall be payable under the Army Pensions Acts 1923/43 to or in respect of any such member.&rdquo;  The Order as it stands allows no alternative to depriving a man of a pension which he might have earned by a service of from 15 to 16 years.  He must lose that.  There is no provision for giving a man the option of taking a court-martial on his particular circumstances or taking what is set out here. I remember, when the Spanish Civil War was on, having great difficulty when it came to my notice that a number of men in the National Army of that time, with perhaps something like 14 or 15 years' pensionable service, were intending to desert from the Army and to go to fight in Spain on the Franco side.  Some of them did go.  When we look back on the circumstances of the last 5 or 6 years it is very unjust and very unwise to think that anyone could estimate the motives of men who, having joined our Army here for the defence of the country, many of them very young men, <Col N="434" /> then made up their minds&mdash;with the impact of very many circumstances in this country and very many circumstances outside&mdash;that they were serving even national interests better by deserting from the Army and going outside, whether into another Army or to work elsewhere.  It is all very well for Deputies on the far side to say that we must have discipline in this country. I remember being in an internment camp when the officers of the camp were paraded by the Colonel in charge of the camp and told that he was going to have discipline or dead bodies.  Well, from his point of view he never got discipline&mdash;not the discipline that he wanted&mdash;but there was in that camp the strong discipline of intelligent men working and acting together.</P>
    <P>I think the Army authorities, if left to themselves, would have dealt with this matter in a very different way.  At any rate we have gone through an extraordinary period, during which a large number of young men in this country who could not, in the world circumstances, get work of any kind, found themselves tempted and distracted in very many ways.  The fact that 10 per cent. of the whole of the Army that the Minister had are involved in the number of unfound deserters should show the Minister that he is dealing with a very difficult but a very human problem.  He should realise that he is at the end of a very extraordinary period and at the beginning of another.  If we are to have an army code of discipline that is going to be respected and if we are to ensure that every soldier going into the Army, taking the oath, will not take it merely as a formality, then we had better leave the framing of the code until such time as we face the discussion of what our new Army will be, its organisation, its equipment and the kind of defence policy for which we will want it.</P>
    <P>I submit to the Minister that he is doing the Army damage by introducing a new disciplinary code for deserters in this way, by an emergency Order, applying it as an absolute rule of thumb, with no alternative and no <Col N="435" /> option, applying it in that particular way to an extraordinary variety of cases.  We, therefore, object to this Order in that it is an emergency Order issued at the tail-end of an emergency; in that it is in its attitude in conflict with the attitude of the Army authorities to desertion when they were dealing with the question of desertion in the most serious part of the emergency, in that it discriminates in the punishment that will have to be suffered by people who are not caught, who did not surrender and people who were caught; in that it discriminates between Army officers and men and that it does not leave to the ordinary military code of law&mdash;the law of this House&mdash;the decision as to whether or not the circumstances are so grave that a man, because of his desertion, should lose a pension earned by service over a large number of years.</P>
    <P>I submit that these are matters that the Minister should very well consider and that, whatever the House may decide, in respect of this Order, the Minister should think over these things and a number of other matters that I am sure the Army authorities will be able to bring very clearly to his mind before he endeavours to enshrine a new disciplinary code for deserters in our laws.</P>
    <P>Arising out of some of the remarks that have been passed here, there is no way of objecting to one item in this emergency Order without objecting to the whole of it.  The only type of criticism and the only type of opposition that can be given to the making of this Order in the House is to vote for its annulment.  There is no way of amending it.  There are sections of the Order that everybody in the House would allow to stand but there are other sections, to which we have pointed, that are of such a kind that nobody ought to be prepared to support them as an emergency Order, particularly an emergency Order issued after the emergency if the date of the military emergency were properly fixed.  There would be many others that we would not be prepared to support as part of our legislation.</P>

      <P>I also think the Minister <Col N="436" /> would be well advised to withdraw this Order and to leave well enough alone, because what we want in this country is a spirit of peace and harmony. Those who deserted and joined other armies did not desert to the enemy.  They deserted to an army which they thought was fighting our battle.  The experience of these men in that army was sentence enough for them.  They have come home with their lives and they have been lucky.  I think we should close the books and leave it at that.  We have not much tradition in the Army, because for 700 years we were struggling for freedom. We have had the Army for only 25 years and there is not much tradition behind it yet and our people do not know where they stand in respect of it.  We are a partitioned country.  We are not a free country.  The men in the Army have different ideas and different views.  Some joined the army from patriotic motives.  Others had different ideas.  Some joined to disrupt the Army from the inside when they could not do it from the outside.  I know men&mdash;some of them have high positions in the Army&mdash;who joined for the purpose of disrupting the Army.  We had not such loyal service from all our people after all.  Some of the Government speakers to-day were very high-falutin and spoke about tradition and honour.  When they were upsetting the Irish Army was it not known that one of their chief objects was to get every man they could to desert, not only to desert, but to bring all the equipment he possibly could with him and to sell it?  They even took the lives of young men who would not leave the Army.  Now they come along and talk about what we should do to-day. We have our memory that takes us back that far.  We know the men who are talking to-day in this House are hypocrites and impostors and nothing more.  They ought to drown themselves and keep quiet for evermore.</P>

      <P>If this debate has served no other useful purpose, at least in putting down the motion, I worked a miracle and made the dumb speak.  The first miracle that was worked was to produce a speech from a Deputy who has been 15 years silent in this House.  A number of minor miracles were subsequently worked. Unfortunately, though I was capable of making them speak, I was not capable of making them or the Minister think.  I never listened in my Parliamentary experience to so many exhibitions of muddled thinking, not only from the back benches opposite but from the Front Bench.  The Minister's speech was an outstanding example of muddled thinking.  Let us hark back and examine his speech. What was the great offence we were punishing?  According to the Minister, the offence was the breaking of a solemn oath, and a contract between the soldier and the State.  I did attempt to correct the Minister.  The breaking of a solemn oath concerns any soldier who deserts, and yet the <Col N="439" /> Minister seemed to forget that we had thousands who deserted, who broke that solemn oath and no penalties whatever were inflicted.</P>

There is a certain section of soldiers that broke a solemn oath and fought in this war, and the Order is designed to punish these men and no others.</P>

      <P>The Minister confesses now that there is such inefficient government and such an inefficient service, that soldiers can desert in this little sod of turf&mdash;this tiny island&mdash;and can remain at liberty undetected for 180 days.  That is a terrible indictment of State services.  I have more respect for the police, Army and other services of the State than to think that it is possible for men to desert, and to remain at home undetected for 180 days, with no ration cards or anything else, and no way of getting a pinch of tea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the main, the Order applies to men who went abroad and not to those who remained at home.  The Deputies' speeches, and the Minister's line of action, were an example of the product of Fianna Fáil political tactics&mdash;when you cannot meet a case, abuse your opponent; if he can make a case, distort it.  The Minister has always the final word, and he got the opportunity to suggest that everybody on these benches was condoning desertion; that we were standing for desertion.  I made it quite clear in my opening remarks that the main reason why I objected to this Order was that it was a case of the Army washing its hands of its own responsibilities; that if the Army Act, which is there over a long period, was availed of in the ordinary way to mete out punishment according <Col N="440" /> to the offence, no voice would be raised here.</P>
    <P>After 20 years operating the Army Act we have the Army and the Minister for Defence washing their hands of their own responsibilities, and asking public boards to punish Army deserters. That is a complete departure from every traditional military precedent and we get no explanation from the Minister.  He threw up his hands and said that there were 4,000 men out of 40,000 still undealt with, who were absent for 180 days.  I wonder how many were dealt with?  If we assume even that only one out of four deserted, what kind of an Army have we had for the last five years, what kind of control and what kind of Minister?  If it was a case of fly-by-night, it is time we knew it.  We are told that 4,000 men were absent more than 180 days. How many more thousands left and were captured out of a tiny Army of 40,000?  I think that is something to investigate other than the Order, if there was such lack of control that apparently tens of thousands out of 40,000 could hook it, and 4,000 remain uncaptured.  At the end we have the Army authorities saying: &ldquo;We are unable to control the situation; we must leave it to the public boards, the town commissioners, the Turf Development Board,&rdquo; boards that should not be concerned with cases of Army indiscipline.</P>

There are 4,000 men affected by the Order.</P>

      <P>The Deputy was left guessing.  I may be a doctor, but I am not a dentist and I cannot draw teeth. The process of getting information from the benches opposite is something equivalent to a dentist's job.  The Minister makes statements regarding desertions, but withholds from the Dáil the number of desertions, until a Deputy has finished his statement, and then by interruption he tells us that there were 7,000 desertions.  I shall not, therefore, say tens of thousands.  There are 7,000 deserters.  They all broke the solemn oath which the Minister spoke about so extensively.  They all committed the crime of breaking this solemn oath, but 4,000 of those 7,000 are to be penalised for the next seven years and the other 3,000 are not.  Presumably, in the 4,000 we have all those who gave service in other armies and the Minister has proven up to the hilt the case I made, that the punishments are not provided because a solemn oath was broken, because those men deserted, but because they served elsewhere.</P>

      <P>If we operate in the ordinary way, soldiers should be dealt with by soldiers.  Military courts should deal with offences by soldiers. Those are the courts which understand best the necessity for discipline, for severe and speedy penalties and for making an example of an individual before his comrades so as to deter them from committing the same offence.  I think that this is the only case in history where an army has so reneged its duties, where a Minister has so run away from his responsibilities, where a Minister for War or a Minister for Defence asked various town commissioners and urban councils to do his job for him.  Instances were cited of how unjust this Order was.  The Minister promised Deputy O'Leary that he would deal with this question by legislation.  If he had done that, we should not have the same complaint. Legislation can be discussed, altered, amended, reduced or extended but an emergency Order cannot be altered and cannot be amended.  One may like <Col N="442" /> some of it and dislike the rest of it. All one can do is swallow the whole lot or annul the whole lot.  That is the position into which the Dáil was forced.  There was no option but to move the annulment of the Order. People over here in this Assembly have shown in the past, are showing in the present, and I hope will show in the future as great a sense of responsibility towards the State as any of the self-reputed heroes opposite.  They have shown more regard for the sanctity of the Army than a great number of those sitting opposite.  Many of us over here served for many years in that Army.  We know the necessity for discipline better than the Minister does.  We never preached indiscipline and we never opposed the Army.  Discipline is absolutely essential but military discipline must be maintained and ensured by military men.  Never in our time in the Army, and never in the time of any reasonable men in the Army, were military delinquencies passed over to be dealt with by various urban councils and town commissioners. When an offence was committed by military men, it was dealt with by military men and punishment was meted out to fit the crime.  Here we have a general, slap-dash Order that applies equally to all, without examining the merits of particular cases, without examining the excellent record which a soldier may have had over a number of years, without having regard to whether or not a man may have given years of pre-Truce service in the Anglo-Irish War and have helped to establish this State and without making any allowance as to whether a man had four days or four years' Army service.  The service of the soldier cannot be taken into account. The emergency Order, passed after the emergency was clearly over, deals with all those common victims by a common method.  There is no sense and there is no justice in that.  As Deputies saw when the Minister stood up, there is no defence for it.  If what the Minister said was the best case that could be put forward, then any person who listened will admit that no defence was made for the Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the motion standing in my name and that of Deputy McGilligan:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that it is contrary to the public interest that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health should sanction an arrangement under which the Bank of Ireland will charge the Dublin Corporation and the Dublin Corporation will pay to the Bank of Ireland interest at as high a rate as 3¼ per cent. on a loan intended for the provision of houses under the Housing Acts.</P>
      <P>This is a question which I discussed on two previous occasions&mdash;on the Central Fund Bill, at the beginning of this year, when Mr. O Ceallaigh was Minister for Finance, and on the Appropriation Bill, later, when Mr. Aiken had taken charge of the Ministry.  I put certain propositions to Mr. O Ceallaigh as Minister for Finance. I said that I considered the House should have the benefit of the advice of the Department of Finance on certain matters connected with finance, that where Deputies went a certain distance in putting up facts and attempting to draw deductions from those facts, in the interest of the proper carrying on of public business we should have an examination of those facts by the Department of Finance and an indication of whether or not the arguments founded upon them were wrong.  At that particular time I charged, that when, as stated in the Report of the Inquiry into Housing in Dublin, in January, 1939, the Banks' Standing Committee declined to underwrite a loan of £2,000,000 for the Dublin Corporation for housing, they did a serious injustice to the Dublin Corporation by undermining its credit at that time.  They gave as their reasons at the time for not underwriting the loan that the character of the housing programme was uneconomic; that it was aggravated by the high level of building costs and, also, the magnitude of the sums required by the corporation for their programme of works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="444" /> While the Banks' Standing Committee reduced public confidence in the loan at that time, they later agreed to underwrite a loan of £1,500,000 of 4 per cent. stock at 96 in April, 1939. Of that stock only £850,000 was taken up and the underwriters, that is, the banks, through the Banks' Standing Committee, themselves took up a loan of £650,000.  I maintain that when the banks themselves took up a loan of £650,000 at 4 per cent. which was intended to be subscribed by ordinary subscribers, they made a very huge profit and they made that huge profit out of the Dublin Corporation although they considered that the corporation was spending too much money already on its housing programmes. What I am endeavouring to do is to isolate completely one aspect of this matter of borrowing.  I am not endeavouring to argue here the rates at which the public should be asked to subscribe money for housing purposes. That is a matter that can be dealt with separately later.  I am just assuming that no loan for housing at the present time is going to be offered to the public at a higher rate than 3 per cent., and I am arguing that in circumstances in which the public should not be paid more than 3 per cent. for moneys lent for housing, where money is borrowed from the banks a rate substantially less than 3 per cent. should be paid to the banks. I asked the Minister the other day whether before agreeing to the borrowing of £1,250,000 by the Dublin Corporation he would make a statement to the House as to what his policy was going to be to deal with housing.</P>

    <P>This transaction took place in August, 1944.  It has nothing to do with the terms at which money will now be offered or what the future financial provision in regard to housing will be.

The motion that I have put down there is in general terms and the very fact that the Minister would not agree to give Government time to have a discussion in relation to the matter regarding which the motion was actually put down and the fact that the Department of Finance have on two occasions definitely resisted coming to the assistance of the House to discuss these matters, make it all the more important that I should be allowed to discuss this question now.  I hope when the Minister replies he will deal with the points I am going to make because this is a matter affecting the whole of this country.  Nothing is more pressing than housing needs at the present time. Nothing is more calculated to raise the cost of house building than a high rate of interest.  I have indicated already that the thought that had been given to this matter by those who carried out an inquiry into Dublin housing conditions contemplated the possibility of borrowing that would mean that for over a period of 60 years excess charges for interest alone would amount to something like £16,000,000. I shall not go into anything except one net point.  I am putting this point before the Minister.  I am putting it to him that normally the public would be asked to subscribe to Government <Col N="447" /> loans, that they would be asked in present days to subscribe at a reasonable rate.  The British Government at the present time is borrowing enormous sums of money at 3 per cent. and 2½ per cent.</P>
      <P>All I am saying with regard to the actual rate at which money will be borrowed is that I do not think we are likely to be asked by the Government, without very serious explanation, to sanction the borrowing of money for any Government purpose at a greater rate than 3 per cent.  I want, however, to put again to the Minister, as I put to the two former Ministers for Finance, what, in my opinion, the effect on the banking system would be if, on the one hand, this £1,250,000, let me say, were borrowed from the public at 3 per cent., and if, on the other hand, it were borrowed from the banks at 3 per cent., and I am submitting figures to show that if the public subscribed £1,250,000 to the Dublin Corporation for its present housing purposes, the effect on the banking system, as a whole, would be a loss of £4,166 of income annually, by reason of the fact that housing activities are of such a nature that we have to import goods for the building of houses, and that it is estimated that out of any sum of money to be spent on housing here, one third of the total amount has to be spent on importing goods into the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, if £1,250,000, to be spent on housing, were subscribed by the people, then I say that the banking system would lose an income of £4,166 a year.  If, on the other hand, the banking system here loaned to the Dublin Corporation £1,250,000, the result would be that they would make a net annual profit of £25,000.  Now, I think that in these circumstances it is desirable that we should examine what happens when the public loans money to the Government for a purpose that involves the expenditure of a third of that amount of money on imports, and what happens when the bank loans that money.  If it is clear that when the bank loans the money directly, it makes a very substantial profit against <Col N="448" /> what happens in the other case, then it seems to me to require, first, an admission by the Government that that is so, and that there is no case for the Government paying to the banks the same rates for loans for housing that they would pay to ordinary people. Now, it has been&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am not here dealing with matters in a propaganda way, but with certain figures that I want to put before the House, and I want to ask the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, if, following the undertaking given by the former Minister for Finance that he would have these figures examined, and in view of his failure and that of the present Minister for Finance to do so, he would be prepared to examine them?</P>

      <P>No.  I have particularly represented to the Minister that I propose to deal only with what happens when the banks loan money, as distinct from the people loaning the money.  I have asked to be allowed to deal with that, but if the Minister would undertake to deal with that matter, then, perhaps, it could be dealt with some other day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to assure the Deputy that I do not wish to exhaust his time for speaking, but before he goes further I should like to point out to him that I propose to deal strictly with the terms of this motion and with nothing else.  If the Deputy wants to deal with other matters outside this motion, then he can put down another motion, and it can be dealt with, but I do not see how any other question can arise on this particular motion.  As I say, however, I do not want to leave the Deputy at any particular disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We know the kind of position we are dealing with and we have another 2½ hours to try to deal with it.  Therefore, I will take the fact that the Minister wants to move entirely within the terms of the motion and that he is concerned with some peculiar points of punctilio which I, at any rate, cannot understand when dealing with a serious matter.  My reason for putting down this motion was to show that the banks should not be paid as high a rate of interest as the ordinary public should be paid.  If the public loans to the Dublin Corporation £1,000,000 &mdash;the Minister need not get upset at the £1,000,000, because when I tell him what would happen in the case of £1,000,000, I will help him by telling him what would happen in the case of the £1,250,000 for which the Dublin Corporation are now looking&mdash;one-third <Col N="451" /> of that £1,000,000 would be spent on importing material for the housing campaign and the effect on the banking system would be that £333,333 would have to be paid to somebody abroad for the goods that we bought. That means that the banks would have to transfer that amount from their keeping to the keeping of somebody else, and they would lose an income of approximately 2 per cent. per annum on that amount.  I submit that I am generous when I take 2 per cent., because the Central Bank at present has anything up to £28,000,000 invested&mdash; an amount that is growing year by year&mdash;and the average income that the Central Bank got last year was 1.6 per cent.</P>
      <P>Now by paying over that amount to somebody else outside the country the banking system would lose an income of £6,666.  But, while losing money in that way, there are ways in which bank expenditure would be saved, because money to that amount would be withdrawn from circulation in this country and in the investigations that were carried out during the inquiry that led up to the Banking Commission's report it was shown that money in circulation in this country was held in various kinds of ways.  One-sixth of the total amount on the average was held in cash; one-sixth was held on current account; and four-sixths was held on deposit account.  In the case of money held in cash in the people's pockets, that had to be backed by the banks by lodging British Government securities at the Central Bank and the banks had to pay 2 per cent. on the amount of money so held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no expenditure of that particular kind in connection with current accounts and the money held on deposit accounts was paid for by the banks at the rate of 1 per cent.  So that by the reduction of the monetary circulation in the country by £333,333 they saved 2 per cent. on £55,555 of cash withdrawn from circulation, and 1 per cent. on £222,222 by which the money on deposit was reduced.  By that means they saved £3,333, so that the effect on the banking system from a loss of £6,666 a year <Col N="452" /> and a saving of £3,333 a year was that the net loss to the banking system by reason of the amount of money that had to be exported out of a loan of £1,000,000 for housing was £3,333 per annum.  For the expenditure of £1,250,000 the loss would be increased by one-quarter and, therefore, if the £1,250,000 that the Dublin Corporation are now looking for is subscribed by the public the effect on the banking system because of the money that will have to be paid for imports will be at an annual rate of £4,166.  It will not affect the banking system directly whether the public are paid 3 per cent. or 3¼ per cent. or any other rate of interest.  The banking system will be unaffected directly by paying for these imports so far as that transaction is concerned.  On the other hand, if for any other reason, say for the reason that prompted the Minister for Local Government last year to allow the Dublin Corporation to borrow £1,000,000 from the banks&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy says if there is any reason such as the reason which prompted the Minister to take a certain course last year.  I put it to the Deputy that for his own sake he should try to ascertain what the reason might have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been doing my best over a number of months to ascertain things from the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is arguing now on the basis of a hypothesis which he has not even formulated to himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what that means, but I know it is an attempt to get me to depart from a small piece of national arithmetic which it would be useful for the Minister to understand.  If I am wrong in this little piece of national arithmetic I would be very anxious to be corrected, because I think our finances are very important and that anybody who speaks in Parliament with regard to our <Col N="453" /> national finances would desire to be correct in every way, and, if he is not correct, he would feel it was the duty of the Minister for Finance to endeavour to correct him.</P>
      <P>I am speaking here with a considerable sense of seriousness.  To get back over the Minister's interlude, I say that if the public subscribed £1,250,000 for housing to the Dublin Corporation, and that money was spent, and one-third of it, or £333,333, was paid for imports of materials for the building of the houses, the loss to the banking system would be £4,166, and that would be an annually recurring loss&mdash; one of those things which affect the banking system.</P>
      <P>If, on the other hand, for whatever reason, the Minister approved of the banks loaning money to the Dublin Corporation, instead of giving the public an opportunity of subscribing, then the following would be the effect on the banking system.  The £333,333 would still have to be exported for the payment of imports of building materials, and the banks would still lose 2 per cent. annually on the securities that they would have to surrender for that purpose.  Therefore, for that purpose they would be losing an income of £6,666.  An additional sum of £666,666 would be in the country as new money, and that new money would be held, on the average, in the same way as money is generally held here and as I have indicated before; that is, one-sixth of it would be held in cash, which would have to be backed at a cost of 2 per cent; one-sixth of it would be held on current account, for which the banks would pay no interest, and four-sixths would be held on deposit, for which the banks would pay 1 per cent.  The total amount of new cash in circulation would be £111,111, and the total amount on deposit would be £44,444, and when the banks paid 2 per cent. for backing the new cash and 1 per cent. for backing the new deposits, they would find there was an additional cost to the banks in respect of that new money of £6,666.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The gross loss to the banks because of the export of money and because of the cost to the banks of the new <Col N="454" /> money that was brought into circulation, would be £13,333.  The banks, however, would have an income by reason of the interest that the Dublin Corporation would pay on the amount loaned, and, if that was at 3 per cent., then they would have an income in that way of £30,000.  With a loss on the one hand of £13,333 a year, and a new income of £30,000 a year, the net result to the banking system, if the banks loaned the amount to the Dublin Corporation, would be £16,667 on £1,000,000.</P>
    <P>I invited the Minister for Finance to question these facts in April, June and July last and I now invite the Minister for Local Government to question them.  I want to say for the information of this House and as a challenge to the Minister, that if, instead of going to the people for £1,250,000, the Dublin Corporation is allowed to go to the banks, then instead of the banking system losing £4,166 a year in a transaction natural to the banking and the financial world, they will be making £20,833.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not address that argument to the Banks' Standing Committee and endeavour to persuade them?  It would be much more effective than talking about it here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is the person who can give or withhold, as he did give last year rather than withhold, permission to the Dublin Corporation to go to the banks.  For those reasons, I am suggesting to the House that it is contrary to the public interest that the loan contemplated now and the loan that was granted last year should be made to the Dublin Corporation by the banks at an interest as high as 3¼ per cent.  I am disappointed with the Minister's attitude, listening to me here, and it does not give me very much hope that our financial situation will be seriously discussed or faced.  I think no Minister in the country is more concerned with this matter than the Minister for Local Government.  He ought to be.  From the point of view of its effect on the general economic situation here, because of the amount of work involved in housing; the general educational <Col N="455" /> system, because I doubt whether we can make the best out of our education without proper homes; or on the general social situation, I do not know if any Minister ought to be more keenly interested in the question of finance than the Minister for Local Government.</P>
      <P>I am not going into the question of whether housing should be dealt with in a separate way from any other matter.  That and other matters can be discussed later.  I am arguing that it was quite wrong that the Dublin Corporation should have been permitted last year to take approximately £1,000,000 from the Bank of Ireland at 3¼ per cent., that it was quite wrong for the Minister to sanction it, and that it will be even more wrong if, in the application that the Dublin Corporation has now made to the Minister for permission to borrow, the Minister would either direct or permit the Corporation to borrow from the banks at a rate as high as either 3¼ or 3 per cent.</P>

As indicated by Deputy Mulcahy, the corporation had a loan in the market in 1939 of £1,500,000 at 4 per cent. at, I think, 96 and the result was as he indicated, that as far as public subscription was concerned it was only subscribed as to one-third and it was necessary for the Government to take up half the remainder.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but the Deputy was not allowed to hear the clear trend of my argument, on account of the interruptions by the Minister.  What happened last year was that the Minister gave power to the Dublin Corporation to borrow from the Bank of Ireland at 3¼ per cent. whatever sum of money it was.  It was all subscribed by the bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case, the position is that, in April, 1939, the Dublin Corporation issued a 4 per cent. stock for £1,500,000 and I stand subject to correction in stating that the application from the Government amounted to £350,000, from the public £500,000 and the balance which amounted to £649,000 was the amount subsequently taken up, half by the Government and half by the Bank of Ireland.  In view of that experience, the Dublin Corporation, for reasons that will be <Col N="457" /> obvious, as they did not want to see the existing stocks depressed or their future borrowing prejudiced in any way, had naturally to be extremely cautious in the years subsequent to 1939.  Therefore, the corporation fell back on the alternative of a private arrangement, so far as the Bank of Ireland was concerned.  We have had two such transactions, which may be said to be covered by this motion&mdash;one was in 1943 and the other in August; 1944.  The 1943 one was for a sum of £949,000 and the 1944 one for something slightly over £1,000,000.  The £949,000 one was at 98½ per cent. and the one of just over £1,000,000 was at par.  That was the last arrangement, at 3¼ per cent.  Having regard to their experience of the public market and having taken sound financial advice that, at the time they entered into those negotiations with the bank, it appeared that better terms might not be available so far as the bank were concerned, the corporation decided that they should enter into that arrangement and seek the sanction of the Minister.</P>
      <P>Now, that had a special advantage. As I say, our last flotation was at 4 per cent., our arrangement with the bank was at 3¼, and we had this advantage&mdash;which I explained when I was speaking on this subject here before&mdash;that the bank agreed to arrange a time-table, so that the instalments of the loan would be made available to the corporation as and when required.  This had a very distinct advantage, in that huge blocks of money need not be put on deposit at 1 per cent. while the corporation would normally be paying 3¼.  The bank agreed to that arrangement in the 1943 negotiations and they continued it in 1944.  In so far as a public issue would be concerned, these arrangements would not apply; the money which would become available from a public issue would have to be taken by the corporation and placed on deposit in the way I have indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as this motion gives me the opportunity, I feel I must refer also to a transaction which is pending at the moment and to which Deputy Mulcahy has referred.  By the way, the rate of interest at 3¼ per cent. was <Col N="458" /> the lowest which the Dublin Corporation experienced for a period of 50 years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to mention one point and urge it on the Minister. It is a fact that there is an application with the Minister at the moment&mdash;and it has been with him for a period of two months&mdash;requesting sanction for a projected arrangement. I am asking the Minister here at least to understand the viewpoint of the corporation in respect of one item of that proposed transaction, which we regard as urgent and pressing.  It will do no harm, either here or outside, if it is <Col N="459" /> known that the Dublin Corporation propose to convert one of their 5 per cent. stocks&mdash;since, as a matter of fact, public indication has been given of that proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a proposed conversion, with very advantageous results so far as the corporation is concerned, of 5 per cent. stock to the extent of something like £748,000.  An intimation has been given to the holders of that stock that redemption would take place on the 1st January, 1946.  In fact, they would be paid in full or given the option of accepting stock at a lower rate of interest.  I want to impress on the Minister that transactions of this kind are not carried through in a week or two.  It would probably take two months to make other arrangements, if the proposed arrangement fails.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it is, as I say, a pressing matter, so far as the corporation are concerned, that they should have the earliest possible intimation of what the Minister proposes to do in respect of that particular item alone.  There are other items to the amount of, approximately, £250,000 in respect of mortgages which it is proposed to redeem in the same way on advantageous terms to the corporation.  It must not be assumed that I am stating these facts merely in direct opposition to the point of view expressed by Deputy Mulcahy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be recalled that, when the Finance Bill was going through last June, I suggested to the Minister for Finance that, having regard to all the reactions of these particular types of borrowings and the reactions particularly so far as the finances of public bodies like the Dublin Corporation are concerned, a new approach to this whole question might be made.  We had the bitter experience in 1939 of inability to secure public subscription of our loans, and we have had other experiences in respect of which our entire housing activities might very <Col N="460" /> well have been suspended because of our inability to secure money on terms which we should like.  I recall to the Minister's mind that, because of existing conditions some years ago, the Dublin Corporation were forced to accept loans at a rate as high as 5 per cent. for one, and, for three others, at 4¾ per cent., from an insurance corporation in the city, which might very well claim to be under semi-State auspices.  As a matter of fact, we considered that we got rather a raw deal in this transaction, in so far as we were held without any break to a period of up to 20 years.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister need not be disturbed.  I am referring to the general troubles and trials of the Dublin Corporation to ensure that its housing problem above all should not be interfered with, and should be on a continuous basis; but while we consider that our housing programme should continue&mdash;and we will continue it&mdash;we are not unmindful of the fact that borrowing money even for a housing programme at 4¾ and 5 per cent. is inevitably ruinous to taxpayers, ratepayers and the tenants who will eventually occupy the houses.  At present the Dublin Corporation is very seriously interested in the rate of interest. Our capital debt at the moment is approximately £12,500,000.  Of that debt, we have to pay in interest charges in respect of housing £475,000 a year, or, approximately 4/8 in the £.</P>
    <P>When you consider that impost, together with the large-scale commitments which we shall have in the future, the rate of interest at which money can be borrowed is of supreme importance to a body like the Dublin Corporation.  I threw out the suggestion here on the Finance Bill that the Minister might confer with the Minister for Local Government and that a new approach might be made in order to prevent public bodies from competing against each other, sometimes on most unfavourable terms, in the matter of borrowing.</P>

That remedy is along the lines I suggest&mdash;that the Government might make arrangements to ensure that in future public bodies will have a continuous flow of money at easy rates of interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion has been on the Order Paper for a considerable time.  Its terms are, to say the least, unusual.  It is to the effect that it is contrary to the public interest that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health should sanction an arrangement under which the Bank of Ireland will charge the Dublin Corporation, and the Dublin Corporation will pay to the Bank of Ireland, interest at as high a rate as 3¼ per cent. on a loan intended for the provision of houses under the Housing Acts.  It would seem to be directed against three parties.  It carries the implication that every single party mentioned in the motion, the Minister for Local Government, the Bank of Ireland and the Dublin Corporation, did something which was contrary to the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would have thought that a Deputy moving a motion in such terms would have taken these three parties one by one and would have stated to <Col N="462" /> the House the grounds upon which he believed their conduct to have been contrary to the public interest.  I listened to the Deputy's speech.  I thought it was a remarkable speech.  It reminded me of the destruction of the Grande Armée in the retreat from Moscow.  That military manoeuvre destroyed the First Empire.  It was the consequence, of course, of a rash and foolhardy act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It was due to Napoleon's rash and foolhardy advance on the Russian citadel.  This motion represents an equally rash and foolhardy attempt on the part of Deputies Mulcahy and McGilligan to overthrow what has been the accepted policy here, that is to say, that lenders will be free to lend, that people who have property will be free to dispose of it in their own interests, having regard, naturally, to particular circumstances. If this motion carried one implication more than another, it was that the Government, and in particular the Minister for Finance, should first of all refuse to sanction a proposal submitted to him by the Dublin Corporation, and, having so acted, should have compelled the banks to make a loan to the Dublin Corporation at a lower rate of interest; that is to say, this motion, in so far as it could state the policy of the Opposition, definitely stated that the Opposition believe that the banks should be compelled to lend money at a stated rate of interest to the Dublin Corporation.  That, Sir, was the implication which this motion carried in the mind of every person who read it, when it first appeared on the Order Paper, and there was, as people may remember, a great deal of astonishment <Col N="463" /> manifested in quarters which had hitherto supported the Tory Party in this House, hitherto supported, I beg your pardon, the Fine Gael Party in this House, that they should, so to speak, have reversed their traditional policy so shamelessly.</P>
      <P>The speech which we listened to to-night marks, shall I say, a retreat. I should perhaps, in that connection, first of all, say this.  I should remind the House that it is not the first time that proposals of that sort have been made, but I know of only one instance in a democratic country where a policy of that sort was given effect to, and that was in the famous province of Alberta in Canada, where, under the leadership of the late Dr. Abelard, some such policy as that adumbrated in this motion was put into practice.  That is why I said at the beginning that this speech of Deputy Mulcahy reminded me of the destruction of the Grande Armée and the Retreat from Moscow.  This represents the Opposition's retreat from Alberta, conducted, of course, under a smoke-screen of verbiage which carefully refrained from addressing itself to the main issues raised by the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion, let me remind the House again, is a vote of censure, I think, on the Minister for Local Government because he sanctioned an arrangement under which the Bank of Ireland proposed to lend and the Dublin Corporation proposed to borrow, a sum of money, to wit, £1,000,000 at a rate of interest of 3¼ per cent.  Now, what was the ground upon which Deputy Mulcahy tried to justify the terms, the very serious terms, in that motion?  I listened with what attention I could to his long discourse as to the effect not upon housing, not upon the public credit but as to the effect upon the profits of the bank if, instead of having made this private issue to the Dublin Corporation, the Dublin Corporation were to make a public issue and allow the public the opportunity of subscribing the £1,000,000 loan.  We had a long discourse pointing out, if the money were raised in the way in which it had <Col N="464" /> been raised by the Dublin Corporation last year, the amount of cash which had been lost to the bank, and then, as against that, a further exposition of the amount which the bank might have lost if the public issue had been made. The Leader of the Opposition summed up the situation by saying that if the public issue had been made the profits of the bank would, in fact, have been £20,000 greater.</P>

      <P>I am speaking from recollection.  The Deputy will have an opportunity of replying.  Whether the Deputy was so confused I do not know, but the Deputy was so confused by the material which he was trying to handle that he mis-stated his case.  I am telling the Deputy what I heard here on this side.  If he wishes to heel-tap his argument and correct himself, he is entitled to do that, but what he did convey to me, and what I think he conveyed to every other person listening to him was, that the reason he moved this motion was that if a public issue had been made the profits of the bank would have been greater.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that a sufficient justification for the motion which the Deputy has put down?  I think that the Deputy, instead of confining himself to one aspect of this issue when addressing the House upon a motion of such gravity as that, ought, at least in fairness to those whom he is asking to support him in the view which he takes, have put before the House what the consequences would have been if I had refused to sanction the issue. After all, the Dublin Corporation, with &mdash;as I believe Deputy Martin O'Sullivan and every member of the Corporation would admit&mdash;the continuous support of my Department, have been endeavouring under great difficulties to carry forward a housing programme over the emergency years.  The money which they proposed to raise out of that £1,000,000 to the extent, I think, of £927,000 was required for urgent housing purposes.  An additional £22,000 was required to finance the extension of Vergemount Fever Hospital, and £50,000 was required for expenditure upon air-raid precautions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy has based his motion upon the money which was to be borrowed for housing purposes.  The corporation had previously secured sanction to borrow money for housing purposes, this sum among others.  The proposal which they put up to me was for sanction as to the manner in which that money was to be borrowed.  What did the Deputy want me to do?  He wanted me to refuse to sanction the raising of the money, and, by withholding my consent to throw the whole housing programme of the Dublin Corporation into confusion, presumably so that he might be able to come here and criticise the Government for not assisting the Dublin Corporation in the efforts which <Col N="466" /> it was making to provide decent homes for the people.  Would I have been justified in holding up the housing programme of the Dublin Corporation on the only ground which Deputy Mulcahy has submitted to this House&mdash;that if this money were raised in one way rather than in another the banks would get a little less?  I am not discussing at all the propositions which the Deputy put before this House.  I am not criticising the figures upon which that argument was based.  The argument may be right or it may be wrong.  It was almost completely irrelevant in any case.  The only thing that was relevant was the point which I am emphasising, that if this money were raised in one way rather than in another the banks might get a little more profit or a little less profit.  It is upon that ground that the Deputy, who used to sit for one of the constituencies in this city which contain a very large slum population, would ask me to impede the operations of the Dublin Corporation, and to condemn people to live a little longer in slums.  That is the argument which the Deputy advanced in this House, in that long tirade of his, to justify the motion which he has put down on the Order Paper.  That is the one aspect of this question to which he said over and over again he was going to devote himself.</P>
    <P>I submitted that this motion was remarkable in the fact that it represented the Opposition's retreat from Alberta.  It was remarkable also in another regard.  Sitting behind the Leader of the Opposition at the present moment is Deputy Peadar Doyle, who occupies the august position of first citizen of the city, Lord Mayor of Dublin, and Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Dublin Corporation. Sitting on the Labour benches is his predecessor, Deputy Martin O'Sullivan, who in August, 1944, was Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Dublin Corporation.  This motion, let me remind you again, condemns not merely the Minister for Local Government but also the principal parties to the transaction, the Dublin Corporation and the Bank of Ireland.  It is, therefore, I submit to you, a vote of censure upon the Chief Whip of the <Col N="467" /> Fine Gael Party, who occupies the honoured position of Lord Mayor of Dublin.  I wonder was Deputy Peadar Doyle consulted when this motion was first put down?  Perhaps he was not, because Deputy Peadar Doyle was not then Lord Mayor of Dublin&mdash;it was Deputy Martin O'Sullivan&mdash;but he has since become Lord Mayor of Dublin, and in that capacity he has been an active participant in the discussions between the Dublin Corporation on the one hand, and its bankers, the Bank of Ireland, on the other.  In the opinion of his Leader, Deputy Mulcahy, has Deputy Peadar Doyle, in his capacity as a member of the Dublin Corporation and as Lord Mayor of the City of Dublin, been guilty of entering into discussions which have not been in the public interest, and of submitting to me proposals for raising not £1,200,000 but £2,320,000?  Has he been guilty of acting contrary to the public interest in being a party to proposals submitted to me for permission to issue stock to that amount?  I think we ought to hear Deputy Peadar Doyle on this matter. Does he approve of this motion?  Is he, in his capacity of Mr. Codling, Lord Mayor of the City of Dublin, asking me to sanction a proposal, while in his capacity as Deputy Peadar Doyle, Mr. Short of the Fine Gael Party, he comes in here to this House and sits behind his leader while his leader condemns that proposal?  Is he in the Dublin Corporation going to vote to enter into this transaction with the Bank of Ireland, and to vote to ask the Minister for Local Government to sanction the transaction, while he comes in here as Deputy Peadar Doyle to criticise the proposal and vote against it?</P>
    <P>This thing is ludicrous.  It is ridiculous. It is dragging public conduct in the city and in the Dáil into the greatest disrepute.  It is a serious matter.  It is very serious, because, as has been pointed out here, the money is required&mdash;part of it at any rate&mdash;to fulfil an obligation already entered into by the Dublin Corporation. It is required in order to enable them to convert a 5 per cent. loan into a loan carrying a lower rate of <Col N="468" /> interest.  It is also required in order to finance housing works which are now in progress or are shortly about to be undertaken.  Surely Deputy Mulcahy ought to have had a serious discussion with the Lord Mayor of the City of Dublin before he made the sort of speech we listened to this evening, or before he allowed that motion to remain on the Order Paper.  I think that the mere fact that a motion in those terms has been put down on the Order Paper by his leader must make the position of the Lord Mayor of Dublin, as a member of the Fine Gael Party in this House, a very uncomfortable one.  However, I am sure he will manage to extricate himself from that position with dignity.</P>
    <P>About the conduct of the Bank of Ireland in a matter of this sort I have nothing to say.  I am not here as an advocate or defender of the Bank of Ireland.  That banking corporation is perfectly competent to look after itself.  I should like those who may be interested in those matters outside to understand that the conduct of that banking corporation has been impugned in this motion.  No doubt Deputy Mulcahy will be able to justify in a way which he has not done in this House the reason why he felt bound to impugn the conduct of the Bank of Ireland as being contrary to the public interest.  That, however, is a matter I will leave to him.</P>
    <P>I now come to the most extraordinary aspect of this motion.  Not only is the conduct of the Dublin Corporation impugned in it, not only is the conduct of the Bank of Ireland impugned in it, but also the conduct of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  If it were a neophyte, a babe in political affairs, who had put down a motion in those terms, if it had been, say, Deputy Flanagan who had put it down, one might understand it.  One would not wonder at it.  One would take it at what it was worth.  But when we see a motion in the terms of this one put down by the Leader of the Opposition Party, a Deputy who once held the portfolio which I now hold, a Deputy who was once Minister for Local Government and Public Health, we can only assume that his memory <Col N="469" /> must have failed him, or that he must be, to an extent to which I believe to be impossible, unaware of the legal position of the Minister for Local Government in regard to proposals put up to him by local authorities who are competent to make issues of stock.</P>
    <P>This proposal, which really constitutes the substance of the motion, was a proposal on the part of the Dublin Corporation to make an issue of stock to the Bank of Ireland.  It is true that the issue was to be made privately, that it was not to be open for public subscription&mdash;that it was a stock issue made by the principal local authority in this country, the Corporation of Dublin, to the principal banking corporation in this country, the Bank of Ireland.  It was an issue to be made under the Public Health (Amendments) Act of 1890, and it was to be made under the Urban Stock Regulations Act, 1892.  Now, Sir, Deputy Mulcahy, one of my predecessors holding the portfolio or in the office of Minister for Local Government and Public Health, seems to have forgotten the terms of those regulations, and it might be just as well if I refresh his mind in regard to them. Article 2 (1) of the Regulations I refer to&mdash;regulations in regard to the creation and charge of stock&mdash;which govern us in this matter, states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where the urban authority have for the time being any statutory borrowing power, and the board have by order consented to the exercise of such power by the creation of stock, then, subject and according to the provisions of these regulations and of the consent order, the urban authority may, from time to time, by resolution, exercise the power by creation of redeemable stock, to be from time to time issued for such amount within the limit of the power, at such price, being not lower than 95 per cent., to bear such half-yearly or other fixed dividend or rate of interest not exceeding 4 per cent. per annum, unless with the consent of the board, and to be so transferable, that is to say, in books or by deed, as the urban authority by the resolution directs....&rdquo;<Col N="470" /> Now, mark you: by the terms of these regulations this urban authority, the Dublin Corporation, has power to make an issue of stock, provided that the issue price is not lower than 95 per cent., and that the rate of interest is not greater than 4 per cent. This proposal, which was put up to me, was, as Deputy Martin O'Sullivan has told the House, a proposal to issue the stock at par, and issue it at a rate of interest of 3¼ per cent.  In these circumstances, bearing in mind that we had already sanctioned the proposal of the Dublin Corporation to borrow £927,000 odd for housing, how could I, or any other Minister who wanted to act within the law and in accordance with the statutes, have refused to sanction the proposal of the Dublin Corporation?  Am I to be told that it is contrary to the public interest for a Minister for Local Government and Public Health to act in conformity with or in accordance with the law?  It is not much wonder, Sir, that in proposing this motion Deputy Mulcahy took the peculiar course he did, of saying that he proposed to confine himself to one aspect of it.  The House will recall how ridiculous that aspect was, and how he ran completely away from the heart and kernel of the whole motion, so far as the Minister for Local Government and Public Health was concerned, and that was the question of whether I had any option to sanction the proposal as put up by the Dublin Corporation: whether I had any power to refuse the sanction.  Bearing in mind the practical consequences of a refusal, and bearing also in mind what the Dublin Corporation&mdash;ably led by Deputy Martin O'Sullivan, who was then Lord Mayor, and, I am perfectly sure, strongly supported by the present Lord Mayor, Deputy Peadar Doyle&mdash;would have said, and the action that they would have taken if I had refused to give a sanction which I am virtually bound to give by the law of the land as it stands, what else could I have done?</P>
    <P>Does the Deputy who proposed this motion desire me to withhold sanction, to act contrary to the regulations, to deny to the Dublin Corporation what <Col N="471" /> is, undoubtedly, their right under the law as it stands?  Is that what he wanted me to do?  We have heard recently from the Deputy and some of his colleagues about the attempt of the bureaucracy here in Dublin to restrict unduly the freedom of the local authorities.  I know what sort of an outcry would be raised if I had said to the Dublin Corporation: &ldquo;I will not sanction this issue&rdquo;.  I would be told that I had no right to refuse sanction, that I was holding up the housing programme of the Dublin Corporation and compelling people to live in the slums of Seán McDermott Street, Gloucester Street, and every one of those honeycombs of misery and poverty with which the city is studded. That, however, is not my policy.  So far as I reasonably can do so, I am prepared to help the Dublin Corporation, and I have no apology to make to anyone for having, in the circumstances, sanctioned that loan, and particularly in the circumstances that existed in August of 1944.  What might happen in the future is another matter. I might, if I had had the power, have attached certain conditions to that sanction. It is at present a matter of some doubt as to whether I have the power or not.  That is a matter to be determined, but in any event I think that that doubt will be cleared up before very long, so that in future I will be in a better position to put forward my whole views to local authorities which may come looking to me for advice, for guidance, or for assistance in matters of this sort; but what those views are, I do not think, Sir, I am called upon at this stage to state.  I can, I think, show this: that there never was a motion submitted to this House which had less justification on any ground&mdash; whether on the ground of expediency, whether on the ground of legality, or whether on the ground of public interest&mdash;than this motion which has been put down, without consideration and without thought, by the Leader of the Opposition Party, Deputy Mulcahy, and by his colleague, Deputy McGilligan. I say, advisedly, that it was put down without thought, and I ask any Deputy who wants to consider whether <Col N="472" /> that statement is well founded or not to read the speech in which this motion was proposed by the Leader of the Opposition.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the tenor of the Minister's speech at the end means.  Whatever the future attitude will be, he cannot, nor can the country avoid facing both the financial and constructive problems that are related to housing.  The British Government have been borrowing huge sums at 3 per cent., and at 2½ per cent., for the carrying on of war.  We have escaped war-destruction.  We are free as far as our resources are concerned to do constructive work.  We had none of the real destruction of war.  We had a certain amount of dislocation.  We were unable to get materials from abroad, that we were able to get before the war.  There was a certain amount of disorganisation, but, nevetheless, we are free to use our resources for constructive purposes.  As the emergency passed, the amount of money available in this country increased.  The conditions of our people generally have not improved.  Bigger problems, from the point of view of employment and housing, are in front of our people to-day than at the beginning of the war.  A bigger amount of money is available. The total amount of money here between June, 1939, and June, 1945, increased by 78 per cent.  In June, 1939, between monetary circulation and deposits in all the banks, we had £131,000,000 to credit, and by June, 1945, the amount was £233,000,000, or an increase of £102,000,000.  In the handling and using of that money for constructive purposes here, we are concerned with what it will demand for itself out of the national income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's speech was in terms of some regulation that allows the Dublin Corporation to borrow money at 4 per cent. on an issue price of £95 for housing purposes.  He spoke without quoting the date the regulation was agreed to, the statute involved or when it was passed.  He did not realise the enormous change that has taken place in the position of money in Great Britain and Ireland, what that money <Col N="473" /> has been used for, or what rate has been paid for it.  The Minister will find, if he is going to deal with the housing problem here, that he will not be able to allow the increased money that has accumulated to hang itself around the efforts of the Government or the Dublin Corporation to create housing or productive employment for our people.  When the public did not subscribe to the loan of the Dublin Corporation, they fell back on the banks. I can promise the Minister that they will not pay the credit-creating machinery of this country the same rate of interest that they are paying ordinary lenders.</P>
    <P>I think it is a very serious dodging of his responsibilities on the part of the Minister&mdash;as it has been on the part of the two Ministers for Finance whom I addressed on the subject&mdash; that they will not take the positive case I put before them, as to what happens when we offer the same rate of interest to the credit-creating machinery as to the ordinary lender. The damage may be small, borrowing £1,000,000, but, in the long run, if we are to deal with the type of programme that the Dublin Corporation has set before it for the next 20 years, or if we are to deal with some of the other constructive measures the Government have in hands, while the Minister may, with a majority backing in this House, still keep up his attitude of ridiculing any serious problem attempted to be discussed here, he will not be able to face the problems before him and the country.</P>
    <P>I have made it clear that when, as happened in April, 1939, the Banks' Standing Committee decried the credit of the Dublin Corporation, they then proceeded to make substantial profits that they could not otherwise make. I have shown quite clearly that they made substantial profits out of the fact that they decried the Dublin Corporation's credit in the eyes of the public, and I have shown how the Minister can deal with the present position instead of having Irish money used for subscribing to British loans at 2½ per cent. or 3 per cent.  If he does not do that, he will be creating new profits and will be allowing the banks to make <Col N="474" /> substantial profits.  When money is sent out of the country for the purchase of imports, the banks lost an income on certain of their investments. I want to repeat, that on the export of money which will take place in connection with the spending of £1,250,000 for housing, the banking system in the country would lose an income of £4,166 as an incidental.  That would be in respect of £1,250,000 lent. by the public to Dublin Corporation.  If the money be lent to Dublin Corporation by the banking system, then, instead of having an annual loss of £4,166, the banks would have an annual increase in their income of £20,833.  We have heard a great deal of talk about inflationary factors.  Here, we are pursuing a policy which, in another connection, the Minister would regard as inflationary.</P>
    <P>The three Ministers concerned have resisted examination of the figures I placed before them.  The matter cannot rest there, because these are the facts of the financial situation and the facts of that situation are going to hit the Ministers and everybody else here in the eye before long.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given no indication to us as to what he proposes to do regarding the permission Dublin Corporation are seeking to borrow this sum of £1,250,000.  He thinks it is inadvisable to discuss that matter.  What he is doing now will cost the people who live in those houses a sum that it need not cost them if the matter were discussed now.  What has happened now may affect the mind of the Minister and the mind. of the country in dealing with the bigger problem that he suggested he was going to deal with in his statement and information given in a couple of Parliamentary answers. The Minister's reply has underlined the necessity for stating the finance policy of the Government soon.  While the Minister may gibe at the unconcern of those who discuss those matters for the housing of the people, the Minister knows that there is nothing we are more concerned about.  We tell him that, with the increased difficulties of the poorer population and with the enormous increase of money in this country, the people should not be held <Col N="475" /> up to ransom.  Money should not be allowed to hold the people up to ransom in their difficulties and, if we are not going to get loans for houses and other purposes subscribed at a reasonable rate of interest, then we should not increase our difficulties by going to the credit-creating machinery and paying interests that are higher than should be given.  I have put the figures clearly enough before the Minister. When we fall back on the credit-creating machinery for the provision of loans which the public do not subscribe, the rates of interest paid should be substantially lower than the rates which would be ordinarily paid.</P>

      <P>To-day, I addressed the following question to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state if he has been requested to hold a sworn inquiry into the repeated refusals (since 1941) of the Offaly County Council to sanction applications made for vacant labourers' cottages in the area by Mr. C. Swords, Clonmore, Edenderry, and the letting of such cottages to unmarried men and women who are not qualified to occupy them under existing regulations; if he will state the cost of legal proceedings incurred by the council in recovering possession of one of these cottages let to an unmarried woman in 1941, and what action he proposes to take in this matter.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister replied: &ldquo;No such request as is referred to by the Deputy has been received by me.  The Deputy himself asked for a Department inspector to hold an inquiry into the failure of the local authority to provide a cottage for the person named in the question.  My information is that this person's present housing accommodation is inadequate.  He was recently <Col N="476" /> an applicant for a labourer's cottage, but his application was unsuccessful. I have made inquiries in the matter, and have been informed that the successful applicant was living in a house in which there were eleven adults and one child.  I should like to stress to the Deputy that the letting of cottages is a matter for the local authority concerned, who, if the cottages are subsidised under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932, must allot the cottages in accordance with the preferences laid down by the Housing (Loan Charges Contributions) Regulations, 1938, and they must consider and have regard to a report to be obtained from the appropriate medical officer of health as to the existing accommodation of each applicant and as to the degree of urgency of his need for alternative accommodation.  I am satisfied that the regulations were complied with in the allocation of this tenancy.  I have no power to review any allocation which has been made in accordance with the regulations. I am not aware that there were any recent lettings of cottages to unmarried men and women.  I have no information as to the cost incurred by the Offaly County Council in recovering possession of a cottage let to an unmarried woman in 1941.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I regret that I find it necessary to raise a case of this kind by way of question or, as in this case, on the motion for the adjournment.  I am forced to do so because this is not the only case of the kind brought under my notice during the past few years. This case has been the subject of correspondence between the applicant referred to in the question and myself and Offaly County Council, and between the Department and myself, over a period of three or four years. One of the Parliamentary Secretaries had been dealing with a complaint I made well over a year ago to the Department, and I had hoped from the reply I received on that occasion&mdash;I think that it was from Deputy Dr. Ward&mdash;that a future application by the man mentioned in the question would be given favourable consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="477" /> The facts briefly are: The applicant mentioned in the question is an agricultural labourer with a wife and four children.  Owing to the fact that he was unable to secure suitable housing accommodation anywhere, he was taken into a labourer's cottage, occupied by his father-in-law, over six years ago.  That cottage consists of two rooms.  Mr. Swords, his wife and four children are living in one room and his father-in-law and other members of the family are living in the second room for over six years.  He is obliged to travel four miles each way every day to his work.  That is not a desirable state of affairs for any agricultural labourer who is expected to do a decent day's work for his employer. In April, 1941, Mr. Swords made application to the local authority for a house which was vacant in Ballybrittan and I assert here and now &mdash;I was amazed that the Minister appeared not to be in possession of the full facts and to hear him state that he was unaware that cottages had been let to unmarried women&mdash;that the cottage which was vacant in 1941 was let to a housekeeper for a local farmer. Her name is Miss Hickey.</P>

      <P>I expected, with great respect, that the Minister's reply would deal with the whole period covered by the complaint, from 1941 to the present day.  I shall give the Minister further information on the matter if he will allow me.  The cottage was let in 1941 to an unmarried lady and at no time since that date has it been occupied by her.  For some years after the letting, Swords and other persons who thought they were entitled to consideration in the allocation of labourers' cottages which are supposed to be let to agricultural labourers, drew the attention of the local authority to the fact that this unmarried <Col N="478" /> lady had not been up to that period occupying this cottage.  It appears that the local authority or the county manager made some inquiries into the matter, and discovered that this was the case with the result that the lady put some furniture into the cottage but still never occupied it. During a long period since 1941 she has been living with her own relatives in the West of Ireland.  The local authority decided, through the county manager at a certain date a couple of years ago, to take proceedings for the recovery of this cottage which was wrongly let to an unmarried woman and which was not occupied by the person to whom it was let.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand the Deputy to say that Miss Hickey lived with her relatives in the West of Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>For portion of the period for which she was nominally tenant of the cottage.  That is my information and I think it is reliable information. At any rate, proceedings for the recovery of the cottage were taken by the county manager and went on for a long period, in the District Court, in the Circuit Court and, in June of this year, came before Judge Byrne in the High Court on Circuit in Tullamore, and there was a definite order made for recovery of the cottage.  I would be interested to know, and I think the ratepayers are very much interested to know, what was the cost of the legal proceedings in the District Court, the Circuit Court and the High Court on Circuit for the recovery of this cottage which was wrongly let in the first instance to an unmarried lady rather than to a genuine agricultural labourer who, as I have said, was living with his wife and a family of four children in one room of an old labourer's cottage.  I asked for information as to the cost of the proceedings and the Minister said that he had no information as to the cost incurred by the county council in the recovery of the cottage.  I have been assured that the county authorities have been in touch with the Department for portion <Col N="479" /> of the period since the cottage was let in 1941.  I assert here&mdash;if the Minister denies it I am willing to accept his word&mdash;that in the case of a letting of a cottage to an unmarried person local authorities are bound to seek the sanction of the Minister.  I am assured that such was the case where a labourer's cottage was let in Shinrone, and my authority for that statement is a letter written by the Parliamentary Secretary, Dr. Ward, to the Offaly County Council.  In that case the cottage had to be recovered by the local authority at, I assume, some cost to the local ratepayers.</P>
      <P>This man, the applicant mentioned in the question, was called to the consultations and to the court proceedings that were held in connection with the legal proceedings.  He lost five days' work as a result of attending these consultations and of being called as a witness on behalf of the county council and, up to the present, he has not received one farthing expenses to compensate him for the loss of wages. He was led to believe that the fact of his going before the court as a witness for the county council would count in his favour when he came to apply again for the cottage, but unfortunately, that did not happen.  Possession was recovered on June 16th, 1945.  The cottage was again advertised for letting in the usual way by the county manager.</P>
      <P>Applicants were invited to send in applications before the 25th July, and about the 8th August, to the amazement of Mr. Swords, the same cottage was let to a turf and timber merchant who employs three persons.  I am challenging the action of the local authority in the first instance in letting the labourer's cottage to a person who was not a genuine agricultural labourer.  In a case where there were genuine applicants who were married men with families, I think it was nothing short of a public seandal to give this cottage in the first instance to an unmarried lady and on the second occasion, to a timber merchant who employs three persons in a very profitable business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="480" /> The Minister, I think, was unfair to-day to me when he said that no request was received by him for the holding of a sworn inquiry.  I think he will admit, if he looks up the correspondence, that on the 25th August, 1 sent him copies of two letters which were received from Swords and in one of these letters, dated the 8th August, he said that this case called for a sworn inquiry.  It is correct to say that I asked for a Departmental inquiry because I was satisfied that if the Minister went into this case personally and got the facts, he would not try to defend the action of the persons responsible for the letting of this cottage in the first instance to an unmarried lady and, in the second case, to a fuel merchant rather than to a genuine agricultural labourer who should get first preference.  I am glad at any rate that the Minister in his reply stated that he was satisfied that this persons present housing accommodation is in adequate.  That is certainly an admission, but the Minister says also that he is satisfied that the regulations were complied with in the allocation of this tenancy.  I again ask the Minister, and I ask members of this House nearly all of whom have more experience as members of local authorities, is it in accordance with the regulations to let cottages of this kind to persons who are not genuine agricultural labourers? If the Minister tells me that an unmarried woman and a fuel merchant are entitled to the same consideration for the tenancy of labourers' cottages as a genuine agricultural labourer, then I am learning that for the first time.</P>
    <P>The Minister also says that he has no power to review any allocation which has been made in accordance with the regulations.  If he is satisfied that the letting has been made in accordance with the regulations, that is a fair statement to make, but I am not going to admit, at the moment at any rate, that the regulations, as I understand them, have been carried out in connection with the letting of this cottage. In 1942, the same applicant made application for another labourer's cottage in the same district and that ottage was let to an unmarried man.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I think I said at the end, &ldquo;and the letting of such cottages to unmarried men and women who are not qualified to occupy them under the existing regulations&rdquo;.  I referred to &ldquo;cottages&rdquo; there, sir, with great respect.  Certain very important matters have arisen in connection with the letting of this cottage.  It is alleged locally that the applications made by Swords have been turned down because of the big political pull of a local councillor in this matter. The Minister has in his possession copies of at least two recent letters written to me by the applicant, one of which states&mdash;this is the Saturday night before the cottage was let on the 8th August:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;George Connell called on me on Saturday night and abused me left and right about following the cottage so far and told me that if I got the cottage he would resign from all public bodies, and I know well that if it is in his power I will never get this house.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, whether through Mr. Connell or somebody else&mdash;Mr. Connell is not the proper authority&mdash;whether it is through the county manager or somebody else, the prophecy made by this unfortunate applicant turned out to be true.  The cottage was not given to Mr. Swords and on the Saturday night after the cottage was let to this fuel and timber merchant, apparently, Mr. Swords also met Mr. Connell and he says, in a letter dated 8th August, a copy of which the Minister has in his possession:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I met Connell on Saturday last and I told him what I thought of him and he gave me to understand that if he can I will never get a house.  He told me I had a political organisation behind me&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;I suppose he knew he was a member of the local branch of the Labour Party&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;...and that I could get Davin to <Col N="482" /> challenge the decision of the manager in regard to the cottage.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not going to assert that Mr. Connell is the county manager or that he has power to override the decisions of the Minister for Local Government. So far as the Minister for Local Government has responsibility for the administration of local authorities, the Minister has responsibility for the administration of the Offaly County Council.</P>

Nearly four years ago his employer offered to the county council, and signed the necessary forms, to provide a plot for the county council for the erection of a labourer's cottage for this man who had been all his life in his employment.  I do not wish to take up the time that the Minister is entitled to have to reply to the query, but I would be very interested in hearing <Col N="483" /> whether or not Mr. Connell is even more powerful than the county manager or the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.</P>

      <P>I have nothing to add to the reply which I gave to-day, which is a full and comprehensive one, because, as I have already told the House and the Deputy, I have no power to review an allocation that has been made in accordance with the regulations.  The only question that really arises on this matter is whether in fact this cottage has been allocated in accordance with the regulations.  The regulations lay down that in allocating the cottages the local authority must have regard to a report to be obtained from the appropriate medical officer of health as to the existing accommodation of each applicant and as to the degree of urgency of his need for alternative accommodation.  Let me say in this connection that I think Mr. Swords has a grievance.  As I said in my reply to the question, no person could regard his existing accommodation as adequate, but he does not happen to be the only person concerned in this case. There are other applicants for this cottage and all that I think the county manager had to assess in that connection was the degree of urgency of each of them.  Or, is it Deputy Davin's position that simply because Mr. Swords happens to be, as he said himself, a member of the Labour branch in the neighbourhood he should get priority?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, and I do not think that any person ought to get priority simply because he happens to be a member of the Fianna Fáil Party or the Fianna Fáil organisation.  The thing that should determine the allocation of these cottages is need and that is the only thing that should determine it.  I said in my reply to the Deputy's question that I am satisfied that this man wants a cottage and <Col N="484" /> I think he should get it as soon as it is humanly possible for it to be given to him but, apparently, that happens to be in that particular neighbourhood a deficiency of accommodation.  To some extent that deficiency, I think, was created by the unjustifiable allocation of cottages to people who did not need them.  When this matter was first brought to my attention, by Deputy Davin, in relation to the cottage which had been allocated to this unmarried woman, I took extraordinary steps to clear up that situation and I insisted, to the extent to which I could insist, that the county manager should do everything he possibly could to recover possession of the cottage which investigation satisfied me had been given to an unmarried person who had not occupied the cottage for a considerable time.  I am not in a position to say that she never occupied the cottage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised when I heard Deputy Davin saying that for a portion of the time she was with her relatives in the West of Ireland.  Knowing Deputy Davin, I wonder whether the period he refers to was a period when she was on holidays or a period during which she was ill or during which there was some temporary occasion for her to go back to her relatives in the West of Ireland?  I do admit that she appeared to me to be a single person who was employed in a household in the neighbourhood and, as soon as I became convinced of the fact that these were her circumstances, so far as I could bring pressure to bear on the county manager&mdash;and my powers in this respect were limited&mdash;I did see that possession of the cottage was recovered by the county manager.  But, the moment the cottage became vacant, then different considerations applied.  Whoever was to get that cottage had to be the person who most required it.  I am not in a position to be judge in this matter.  The county manager is the judge.  He has to review the circumstances, and in reviewing the circumstances he has to have regard to the report submitted to him by the medical officer of health.  That report was submitted and, of three hard cases, three cases every one of <Col N="485" /> whom required a cottage and should have got a cottage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>His family occupied a small house with three bedrooms in which there were 11 adults and one child.  In view of the circumstances under which he was living he was placed No. 1 on the list.  As to whether or not he was an agricultural labourer, the Deputy knows as well as I do that in the housing code the term &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo; has a very wide connotation indeed.  The Deputy has alleged to-night that he is a turf and timber merchant employing three persons.  What was the source of the Deputy's information?  Has he investigated the circumstances of this man for himself or has he taken them on hearsay?  I am not going to spend money on having a wild allegation investigated. Will the Deputy be good enough to tell me now who told him that this person was a turf and timber merchant?</P>

      <P>He has it in writing. <Col N="486" /> Many statements are made to me in writing but, when I investigate them, I find them to be without foundation. I am not as guileless as the Deputy; I am a little more experienced and perhaps more hard-bitten.  I receive many letters, even from the Deputy, the statements in which on investigation are found to be without foundation. Because the Deputy was able to satisfy me that there was some substance in what he said on a previous occasion, I did take the extraordinary step of having an inspector sent down to investigate that original allegation on the spot.  But I am not prepared to do that in respect of this matter unless I receive something more in public than the Deputy said to-night, because I can tell the Deputy that I have had a letter from one of the persons concerned in this matter and he does not make that allegation against the person who got the cottage.</P>
      <P>In fact, he says that this person is an agricultural labourer employed in the neighbourhood.  Now which statement of his is correct&mdash;the statement which he made to me or the one which I suspect he made to the Deputy on which he has based his allegation? If he is a fuel and timber merchant employing three men, one can think of him as a bloated capitalist.</P>
      <P>I can give the Deputy this assurance, that I am as perturbed as he is about the man whom he is interested in, even though he happens to be a member of the Labour branch.  I think he has had very hard luck in regard to these applications. I think his case ought to get reasonable, fair and special consideration whenever a cottage becomes vacant.  But that is only an expression of opinion.  I am not carrying the responsibility for allocating these cottages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not my function to investigate the circumstances of these applicants, but, so far as my investigations have gone, this man's circumstances are necessitous from the point of view of housing accommodation.  But I am not going to over-ride the better judgment of the county manager, because he is better informed in regard to this matter. I am satisfied that the county <Col N="487" /> manager will give every applicant a fair deal.  But, if the county manager finds, when another cottage becomes vacant, that in addition to this man there is another applicant whom he thinks is in greater need of housing accommodation, as it is the county manager's responsibility, I rely on him to discharge that responsibility fairly, having regard to the merits of both applicants.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will furnish a statement for all turf-cutting counties giving details for the year ended March 31st, 1945, of (1) tons of turf produced; (2) quantity sold; (3) quantity on hands; (4) turf loans outstanding, and (5) loan charges paid for the year mentioned.</P>

      <P>County council turf production schemes are dealt with on the basis of production seasons and not on the basis of financial years.  The financial operations for the 1944 season, which are those covered by the financial year ended 31st March, 1945, are at present under examination.  A comprehensive picture of the season's operations will not be available until the examination is completed in about six weeks when the information sought by the Deputy will be supplied to him.</P>
