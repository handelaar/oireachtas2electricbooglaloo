      <P>Four amendments have been submitted to this Bill. No. 1 is out of order, first, as being outside the scope of the measure; and, secondly, because it would impose a charge and make the Minister liable for certain things not in the original Bill. No. 4 is submitted, I suppose, in case No. 1 should be carried, and so is out of order, as it would extend the scope of the Bill. With regard to Nos. 2 and 3, the Deputy submitting them says they are put down for the purpose of clarification. If that is so, they are in order, but if they would involve a charge, actual or potential, they are out of order.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 21, to delete the words and brackets &ldquo;(including assets of the deceased)&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the following words and brackets &ldquo;(real or personal)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My purpose in moving this amendment is to clarify the definition of &ldquo;property (including assets of the deceased)&rdquo;.  I am particularly anxious to ensure that any assets, real or personal, for example, insurance policies, cannot be taken into consideration by the court.  Up to now the courts have interpreted the Act of 1941 on the basis of the principles laid down in Lord Camp-bell's Act, and the House and the Minister are, I am sure, aware that it was necessary to amend Lord Campbell's Act to ensure that in assessing pecuniary benefits accruing to the relatives or dependents of a deceased insurance policies would not be taken into consideration.  Generally speaking, the purpose of my amendment is to ensure that the provision now being made is watertight and that any assets whatever of a deceased will be excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that the expression &ldquo;assets of the deceased&rdquo; includes all his property, real and personal.  I am quite satisfied that the Deputy's point is covered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2) (a) (iv), line 47, after the word &ldquo;loss&rdquo; where it first occurs to insert the words &ldquo;or damages, and in assessing damages in the case of a widow or child of a deceased member of the Gárda Síochána have regard to the loss of consortium and to nervous or physical breakdown through grief or shock or outraged feelings.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is moved with the same object as I had in the last case. I understood the Minister to say on the Second Stage that he had been advised that the words &ldquo;any loss (other than financial loss)&rdquo; contained in Section 2 (2) (a) (iv) were sufficiently wide to cover such considerations as loss of consortium, break up of the home, loss of husband or father and solatium for injured and outraged feelings.  Having regard to the provisions of the 1919 Act, I think that these particular considerations are excluded and that loss may still be interpreted in the legal sense of pecuniary or property loss.  It would, I think, still be necessary to widen the provision in some way to enable the courts to take into consideration the matters I have included in the amendment. Under the 1919 Act, the law was finally settled in the case of O'Connell v. Tipperary County Council regarding the award of a full measure of compensation.  It is not at all clear that, even now, the courts are in a position to award a full measure of compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Here, again, I am advised that this clause is a very wide one.  It is set out in paragraph (a) that</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the compensation shall be such sum as the judge thinks reasonable, having regard to all the circumstances of the case.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That includes the matters to which the Deputy has referred or any other loss which the judge may think fit to take into consideration.  This is the way the draftsman has put the matter and <Col N="2456" /> I prefer it to setting out in detail what should be taken into consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would there be any objection, so as to make sure that the point with which Deputy Coogan is concerned will be covered, to including the substance of his amendment in paragraph (a)</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the compensation shall be such as the judge thinks reasonable, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>the matters set out in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The danger is that if you specify some things you may exclude others.  The provision is as wide as it could possibly be.  If details are set out, the judge may think that these were what were in our minds and may exclude matters, which, otherwise, we would take into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see no advantage in that.  I tried to have the provision drawn as widely as possible and I was advised that this was the best way to put it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, I should like to direct the Minister's attention to an anomaly which has arisen in a recent case which is <i>sub judice.</i>  It has, in fact, been adjourned for the purpose of enabling this House to consider some form of <Col N="2457" /> amending legislation.  Under the 1941 Act, compensation can be awarded only in the case of the death of a member of the Gárda from injuries maliciously inflicted upon him in &ldquo;the performance of his duties as such member while actually on duty&rdquo;.  That puts the onus on the dependents to prove two things&mdash;(1) that when the Guard received the injuries from which he subsequently died, he was acting in the performance of his duties, and (2) that he was actually on duty.  The case I have in mind will not be covered by the second paragraph of Section 2 (1) (d) (ii) &ldquo;while exercising powers or otherwise acting in his general capacity as a policeman when off duty or on leave or otherwise not actually on duty.&rdquo;  A policeman may be proceeding to his beat or to his point if he is on traffic duty.  He is confronted with a sudden emergency and has to act. He receives injuries from which he subsequently dies.  Under these provisions, that man would not be covered because he has not been killed while in &ldquo;the performance of his duties while actually on duty&rdquo;.  He is only proceeding to his duty.  Neither is he killed because he has been &ldquo;exercising powers or otherwise acting in his general capacity as a policeman when off duty&rdquo;.  If a member of the Gárda is proceeding to or from duty and is maliciously killed, the court should have power to award compensation. In these circumstances, the court at present finds itself in a difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case to which I have referred, the Gárda had actually arrived at the station before the hour at which he would normally take up duty in his office.  During the quarter of an hour he was waiting, an unfortunate altercation arose between himself and another member of the force&mdash;not in his office but downstairs in a storeroom. As a result of the altercation, the other party pulled a gun upon him and killed him, subsequently committing suicide.  There is no doubt about malice in that case.  The act itself would, I think, prove malice.  But it is not at all clear that the unfortunate man was killed in &ldquo;the performance of his duties while actually on duty&rdquo;, and the onus is on the widow to prove <Col N="2458" /> those two things.  I think that it is unreasonable to place that onus on dependents of deceased Gárdaí.  I ask the Minister to consider some means by which an event of that kind can be covered, now that an opportunity has been given to widen the scope of legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>When this matter was raised on the Second Reading, I said that I did not propose to widen the scope of the Act or to include within its provisions cases not already within them.  I do not want to comment on this particular case.  If the judge finds that the case comes within the Act, well and good, but, if he does not, I am not prepared to widen the scope of the Act.  On the point raised by the Deputy, may I read Section 2 of the Act of 1941:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This Act applies&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) to the death of a member of the Gárda Síochána who dies after the date of the passing of this Act from injuries maliciously inflicted...</P>
      <P>(i) in the performance of his duties as such member while actually on duty or</P>
      <P>(ii) while exercising powers or otherwise acting in his general capacity as a policeman when off duty or on leave or otherwise not actually on duty, or</P>
      <P>(iii) while on duty or off duty or on leave or at any other time because of anything previously done (whether before or after the passing of this Act) by him as a member of the Gárda Síochána or merely because of his being a member of the Gárda Síochána&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think these provisions are wide enough to bring in the types of cases which the Government considered should be dealt with under that Act. If this particular case comes under it, then it does and that is all.  What I am providing for in this amending Bill is that there will not be a rigid financial interpretation of loss.  In that way I am giving the court a wider discretion to take other things into consideration than merely financial loss, and not to include the assets of a <Col N="2459" /> deceased Gárda.  I do not propose to widen the scope of the Bill any more. If I were to do what I am asked to do it would widen it very much.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that under the three provisions he has read out the case that I have in mind would not be covered at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not deciding that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>From the case as reported in the newspapers it would appear that the judges find a very great difficulty in this particular matter.  It is hard to prove (1) that the man who was murdered was acting in the performance of his duty or (2) that he was actually on duty.  In this case I think the court would hold that he was not doing either of these two things.  It is possible that he would not come in under (2).  The man had not actually taken up office duty.  He came downstairs and was murdered by a comrade who had suddenly gone off his head.  He was not murdered because of anything previously done, so that really it does not come within any of the three conditions laid down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>For reassessment.  I can do it now or on the Fifth Stage of the Bill.  Perhaps if I were to do it now it would save time.  The Minister made a promise that he would look into certain cases which were not covered by the 1941 Act.  I think there are about eight of these cases involving deaths and maiming.  I understand that over a long period of years efforts have been made to try to get a settlement of them, but nothing has eventuated.  I am sure that is not due to any stone-heartedness on the part of the Minister, personally.  The fact, however, remains that nothing has been done. Would the Minister intimate definitely now if it is intended to do anything in the cases of persons who are affected, either of his own volition or by setting up some kind of an interDepartmental committee which might examine the cases and report to him as to what would be equitable compensation, having regard to the provisions of the 1941 Act and the wider provisions which are being made for compensation in this Bill?  The number of persons concerned is not very great.  Their relatives have suffered as much as those affected by the 1941 Act.  I think that the Minister at this stage, knowing the agitation that has grown up around these cases, might say definitely what he intends to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to bring to the Minister's notice one case which has since come to my knowledge.  It is the case of Guard Ward, who was murdered, I think, in 1926.  I understand that his mother is at present in a mental hospital to which she was committed shortly after her son's death.  It is quite possible that, in a case of that sort, no one has put forward a claim on her behalf.  I would ask the Minister to investigate the circumstances of that case with a view to giving Mrs. Ward some allowance. There may be other members of the family who would be entitled to claim, but the fact is that no claim was made which may be due to the circumstances I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with this matter on the Second Reading of the Bill.  I have a full list of the cases relating to dependency.  In the case of a superintendent who was murdered in the County Tipperary the court gave <Col N="2462" /> what was considered to be ample compensation. In all the other cases dependency was not established.  In most cases the parents of unmarried Guards were alive and had other children contributing to their support. I think that provision runs through every Pensions Act, that dependency must be established.  In the absence of proof of dependency, I can do nothing. I am informed by my officials that, since I made that promise at the time that the 1941 Act was passed, no claim in which dependency could be established has come forward.  As I said last week, if cases do come forward in which dependency can be established, we can meet them by <i>ex gratia</i> payments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from dependency, it is correct to say, I think, that under the 1919 Act compensation was payable not only to dependents, but to the next-of-kin or the personal representatives of the deceased.  That is a much wider provision than we have in the 1941 Act.  In this case that I have been referring to, the Minister might perhaps interpret it on a slightly wider basis than mere dependency, having regard to the provisions of the 1919 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not for me alone.  There is a settled procedure in all these cases, and I am naturally bound by that.  I am prepared to look into any case that may be made to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The court decides these cases as far as I can see.  In the case of a Guard O'Halloran the court refused the application.  In another case in Ennis a father's claim was granted. The Clare County Council appealed, and the High Court reversed the decision given.

      <P>I am raising the case of those not covered by the 1941 Act and who subsequently submitted a claim for <i>ex gratia</i> compensation on the grounds of dependency.

      <P>It is just a small point relating to the injuries.  I want to correct a misapprehension the Minister may have laboured under on the Second Stage.  I had not in mind the case of a black eye, or loose teeth, or a crack in the jaw, or anything of that kind.  When I mentioned this matter of the right of appeal in cases of injuries, I had in mind more serious injuries.  Under the 1941 Act, the Minister may decide these matters himself and there is no right of appeal.  If he satisfies himself that the case comes within the £100 compensation clause, he decides the thing finally for all time and there is no right of appeal.  I feel that the injured party is being denied the right of every citizen&mdash;the right to appeal to the courts in this matter.  It is contrary to natural justice and to the rights each citizen has under the Constitution. I think that some provision should be made somewhere, some time, the sooner the better, to give an aggrieved person the right of appeal to the courts if he is not satisfied with the Minister's decision.  That may or may not involve a charge on public funds.  It is quite possible that a vexatious claim might be made to the courts, in which case the person might find himself getting a smaller amount than that awarded by the Minister.  It cuts both ways, but I object to passing a matter of that kind without some form of judicial appeal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This case arose over a mistake that was made in a map.  Up to the passing of the Registration of Title Act a couple of years ago, there was an insurance <Col N="2467" /> fund, and such mistakes were paid for out of that fund.  What happened in this case is that, about 50 years ago, there was an estate sold, and, apparently, the map was not correct.  There was a small cottage included in this map which should not have been included.  That was not discovered until the person who was left in the little cottage, or the descendants, went to sell the cottage and found, when they went to look for the title, that the cottage had been included in the land that had been sold.  The case went to the courts, and it was not until it went to the Supreme Court that it was decided that the mistake had been made and that this cottage should not have been included.</P>
    <P>That could have been paid for before out of that insurance fund, which was fed by fees.  There was a certain proportion of the fees payable to the Land Registry set apart for the insurance fund.  When the Registration of Title Act was being passed, about three or four years ago, that fund was abolished and the Exchequer had to pay for any mistakes of that kind that might occur.  That is the reason why this Supplementary Estimate is introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has told us, an Act was passed a couple of years ago, the Registration of Title Act.  I believe the whole purpose of that Act was to rake into the Exchequer a sum of money which had accumulated for years in the insurance fund.  There was really no other section in the Act, or any other section was of small account.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not, Sir, but it does in this sense, that if that fund were now there this sum of money would not have to be paid.  There was an insurance fund accumulating for years and years as the Minister pointed out.  It had reached considerable dimensions.  The Minister for Finance got his eye on that sum and raked it into the Exchequer.  Here now a case arises in which a considerable <Col N="2468" /> amount of money is involved because of a technical mistake in registration. The Exchequer has to pay up that amount but if the insurance fund were there, in the ordinary way it would have been paid out of insurance. We can see the folly, therefore, of raking in sums like those into the Exchequer and then afterwards having a charge made on the Exchequer for any technical mistake that may be made.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister might give some information to the House on the question of fees.  He has referred to the question of registration fees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1945, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, and of certain Services administered by that Office, including sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate comes under five separate headings, the first being sub-head F (1). In January, 1944, the Government received an offer on behalf of Mr. Maurice Victor Lakin, County Wexford, of Johnstown Castle and demesne, containing approximately 1,000 acres, as a gift to the nation, to be used as an agricultural college.  This generous offer was accepted by the Government subject to the enactment by the Oireachtas of any necessary consequential legislation.  I expect there will be some legislation brought in during the present session to deal with the matter.  As the existing facilities for the provision of agricultural education and training are not sufficient to meet the demand for such training, and as there was a particular need for an agricultural college in the south-east, the gift of Johnstown Castle will solve a difficulty which the Department has been faced with for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say that the farm is most suitable for the purposes of an agricultural college and I hope, in fact, that in time we shall be able to go <Col N="2470" /> further than that and to establish an institute of research for certain phases of agriculture in the same place.  The arrangements for the taking over of the property, the farming of the lands and the preliminary steps for making the place suitable for an agricultural college have been in operation for the past year.  These arrangements involved expenditure on the purchase of additional live stock, the purchase of seeds, manures, implements, etc., and the purchase from the donors of the outdoor effects on the estate which were necessary for carrying on the farm.  The expense of the farming operations from 1st January, 1944, was borne by the Department and the crops for 1944 became the property of the Department.  The conditions of the gift provide for the retention of the existing staff where possible and the payment of certain allowances and gratuities to certain long-service employees.  The employment of additional farm labour was also necessary in view of the more intensive farming practised there. The total sum asked for is £3,570 in respect of salaries, wages and allowances and £9,000 for general expenses of management including the purchase of stock.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the size of the farm?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is about 1,000 acres. There are about 300 acres of timber and about 200 acres of what is, at the present time, waste land, but which we hope to convert into good land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next sub-head is J.  The original estimate for Tully stud farm included a sum of £12,750 for general expenses. It was found, however, that much larger numbers of cattle than were originally estimated would have to be purchased and an additional sum of £7,500 for the purchase of cattle is required. There was also some additional expenditure on the liming and manuring of the lands and the purchase of certain seeds which will come to about £700.  Against these, of course, there will be an additional appropriation because the sales of cattle will be <Col N="2471" /> higher than was anticipated.  In fact, I think the additional appropriation against this will be £9,780 for the sale of crops and cattle.</P>
    <P>The next item in the Vote is M (10) &mdash;Potato Reserve Scheme.  If Deputies will throw their minds back to May, 1943, they will remember that there was a shortage of potatoes at that time which caused some inconvenience.  It was thought advisable, in fact, necessary, to make some provision against the same thing occurring again.  We decided first of all to ask the merchants who supply Dublin with potatoes to build up a reserve stock.  They explained that they had been carrying on business for generations on the basis of buying from week to week and as prices went up or down they followed suit and charged the appropriate commission. At any rate they were not willing to enter into a scheme of that kind on their own but they were quite willing to enter into the scheme if they were guaranteed against loss.</P>
    <P>There were difficulties at the time in the way of a Government Department coming into the scheme because it must be obvious to Deputies that whereas we should have a reserve of potatoes to send into the Dublin market if necessary, at the same time we could not put these potatoes indiscriminately on the market and cause a slump, which would be unfair to growers.  We were caught in the end with these potatoes and had to sell them for a very small amount.  That is why we lost a good deal of money.</P>
    <P>A committee was set up by the Dublin potato factors.  They made the necessary contracts, all in County Donegal, for something near 4,000 tons of potatoes to be delivered in March, April, or May, if requested.  There was a firm contract made with the growers to deliver these potatoes whenever required.  The price fixed for Arran Banners was £8 per ton, free on rail, with 5/- bonus if delivered in March, 10/- bonus, if delivered after that.  As regards Kerr's Pinks, the price was £9 per ton with the same rate of bonus, 5/-, 10/- and £1.  Of course all these potatoes were left as <Col N="2472" /> they were not required in March or April.  This committee, under their contract with the growers, had to take delivery in May.  But, as I say, if they had brought these potatoes to Dublin in any quantity, they would have created a very bad slump and caused great losses to the other growers who supply the Dublin market.  They were only able to bring in a small quantity without doing harm to the market and the remainder had to be sent to the alcohol factories.  Deputies will realise that, if potatoes are bought like that in Donegal at £10 per ton delivered, and sold to the alcohol factories at a net price of less than £4 per ton, there is a considerable loss, and that accounts for the £23,000.</P>

      <P>Yes, except about £900 which went in expenses.  The committee were not paid for their labours, but there were necessary expenses for freight, sacks and for interest on the money.  They paid a sum in advance for the potatoes in order to complete the contract and there was interest on that money.  Then there were expenses for freight, sacks and other incidentals, and all these amounted to £900.  The remainder of the loss was the difference between what they paid for the potatoes and what they got for the potatoes in the alcohol factory.</P>

      <P>I have not the exact figure, but they averaged, I think, if Deputies work it out, somewhere about £3 16s. per ton.  As Deputies know, the price paid by the factories was £4 10s. per ton for the normal starch content. The quantity sent to the alcohol factories was 3,377 tons and the price received was £12,950, somewhere under £4 per ton.  The next sub-head is Appropriations-in-Aid.  I think that is given in detail in the Estimate. There is a sum of £1,960 for the sale of stock and produce from Johnstown Castle.  There is a sum of £9,780 estimated up to the end of this financial year from receipts from the Tully Stud.  Then there is an appropriation from Vote 67.  Any Deputy who has been in the House for some time knows that the Farm Improvements Scheme is financed out of the Employment Fund and whatever the Department of Agriculture spends on that scheme by way of salaries and expenses of staff is recouped from Vote 67, so that there is an appropriation of £5,365.  Then, under the Emergency Powers (Tillage) Orders there is a sum of £2,300 from the sale of crops&mdash;I forgot to deal with that sub-head and I must come back to it&mdash; from land entered upon by the Department.  There is a deficiency in the appropriations estimated at £1,600 on repayment of agricultural loans. The amount of the loans estimated to be made on agricultural implements fell very short of the Estimate and, therefore, the repayments will also be short, and that is how that arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to come back to sub-head O (10)&mdash;Emergency Powers (Til-large) Orders.  There is an additional sum of £11,754 required for salaries, wages and allowances and £6,235 for expenses apart from salaries.  That does not mean that the number of the staff has been changed, but that a change which took place was not anticipated when the Estimate was printed.  The Land Commission pressed very hard to get back some of their inspectors who were working on this job of tillage inspection and who were paid by the Department of Lands. Fifteen of these men went back and we had to replace them by fifteen <Col N="2474" /> others, who are, of course, paid under this Vote.  That accounts for the greater part of it.  There is also a small item in that because some of that staff was employed a little longer than was estimated for.  During the spring of 1944 it became necessary to cultivate 93 holdings by direct action as compared with 17 holdings in the 1943 season, and this unexpectedly large increase in the number of holdings which had to be cultivated by direct action is responsible for the increased expenditure in the purchase of seeds, manures, tillage operations, and fencing.  I have already mentioned that there was an increase in the appropriations from the sale of these crops.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Dáil appreciates the very generous gift to the State of Johnstown Castle.  It is a very big farm and should be of great advantage to the community.  It should give the Department an opportunity of providing the necessary technical training for young farmers, I suggest, for a particular area.  I agree with the Minister that it is essential that we should provide some type of research, more particularly soil research.  The Minister, being a Wexford man, appreciates the fact that there is a particular type of soil in Wexford and that we have no institution in the country that is typical of that particular soil.  There are certain definite deficiencies associated with that soil and little or no research has been carried out in connection with it. I think we should take this opportunity of providing, for a particular area, an institution that will carry out the necessary research into the problems which arise in that particular area.  I might say that it would be <Col N="2475" /> well, if possible, to extend that to other areas.  The research institutions we have are of a particular type and the results we get are not applicable generally to the whole country.  Our trouble at present is that we are trying to apply results peculiar to a particular district to the country as a whole.  For that reason, this property, if properly utilised, will be of tremendous advantage. There could be facilities there for providing students with technical education&mdash;college facilities&mdash; and, I think, facilities for day students. I suggest to the Minister that they ought to be confined to a definite district. I do not know whether it will necessitate legislation or not.  The Minister has not told us whether it will be necessary formally to introduce a Bill covering this whole matter or not.</P>

      <P>The Minister has told us that, in regard to the National Stud, legislation will be necessary.  I suppose the earlier we have that legislation introduced the better.  In the meantime, we ought to make it a real national asset and whatever first-class trial horses are available should be purchased now.  This country is renowned for horse breeding and for the production of racehorses, and we ought to help that great industry in every possible way.  If this National Stud is properly conducted it ought to be a powerful factor in helping that particular industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the potato reserve scheme under sub-head M (10). The Minister apparently anticipates a shortage again this year.  It does seem extraordinary that we should have a shortage because I think the human consumption of potatoes in this country in relation to our total production <Col N="2476" /> is comparatively small.  I think it is only about 25 per cent. of our total production.  It seems extraordinary that we should have to vote a sum of £23,000 for this particular purpose.  One could understand voting a substantial sum of money to be devoted to subsidising the provision of cheap potatoes for the poor of Dublin, but that is not the case.  It appears to me that it should be possible, out of our total production of potatoes, to ensure ample supplies for the City of Dublin without incurring loss.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Emergency Powers (Tillage) Order, the Vote is simply to provide extra sums of money for supervision&mdash;inspectorial staffs.  I do not think that I would be in order in raising a matter that I was to raise on the Adjournment, namely the question of excluding certain lands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>It may take a good while.  I do not know.  With your permission, I will refer briefly to the question of excluding certain areas from the operation of the compulsory growing of wheat, especially areas at high altitudes.  I am not opposed to compulsory wheat growing in present circumstances.  Every member of the House appreciates the necessity for the Order.  Out of our own resources we have to provide as far as possible our bread requirements.  In so far as that compulsory Order applies to land suitable for wheat production, I support the Minister in it.  No matter what Government was in power during this emergency, I think compulsory tillage and compulsory food production would have to be operated. But I do not think it is right or proper that people living on land which is absolutely unsuitable for wheat production should be compelled to grow <Col N="2477" /> wheat.  I see the Minister's difficulty in excluding lands that are unsuitable for wheat production, but I suggest to the Minister that he would have little difficulty in excluding lands at certain altitudes, say, all land above the 500 or 600 contour line&mdash;I am not going to be specific in that respect.  The Minister appeared to suggest that I was wrong in saying that land above a certain contour line was predominantly acid.  It is obvious to anyone who knows anything about geological formation that such land&mdash; above 600 feet especially&mdash;is as to 90 per cent. of it highly acid.  It is a rare thing to find limestone drift above the 600 contour line.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows, and farmer Deputies know, that you cannot produce wheat on highly acid soils.  There are certain crops that are tolerant of acid conditions.  Potato is a crop tolerant of acid conditions.  Oats is a crop tolerant of acid conditions, but barley and wheat and beet, for instance, will not thrive under acid conditions. In regard to land that is situated at high altitudes, it is inevitable that, as a result of exposure, high rainfall and high bleaching out, calcium is washed away completely and the land is left in a highly acid state.  The Minister, no doubt, has received complaints.  I have received a number of complaints from my constituency in regard to land on the side of Mount Leinster.  Deputy Sheldon sent me a list, as he cannot be here to-day, and I may refer to the fact that he had a big number of complaints in regard to his constituency where the average yield was worked out and it was found that the average yield on a considerable acreage&mdash;600 or 700 acres &mdash;was 22 stones per acre.  The average seeding, of course, would be very nearly 22 stones per statute acre. Therefore, from the national economic point of view, that amount of land is waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister might have difficulty in the administration of this scheme if he were going to exclude land as being unsuitable for wheat because there were patches here and there that were unsuitable.  It would be very difficult to exclude that land from the <Col N="2478" /> Order.  I suggest to the Minister that it is very easy to look at a contour map and to pick out the townlands that occur above a certain contour line and to publish in the local paper that the particular townlands are excluded from the operation of the Compulsory Wheat Order.  I think the operation of the Order is a hardship on the people who live in those areas and, economically, the policy is unsound, because the people are not getting a return.  They are mainly very small farmers and they find it a great hardship to have this Order operated against them.  I know that the matter was discussed at length by the advisory council.  The Minister is conversant with the details that were raised there and I think the Minister gave some undertaking that legal proceedings might not be instituted against such farmers.  But that is poor consolation to the man who, according to law, has to sow the wheat but who cannot anticipate a profit because the condition of the soil is such as to preclude any hope of a return.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that there should be some attempt made to correct that calcium deficiency.  He may say that we have the lime scheme. But the lime scheme is merely tricking with this whole question of acidity, and, where the lands are situated in remote districts, far away from limestone quarries or from sources of lime supply, the price at the moment is almost prohibitive.  The transport charges are very high, and the cost of the corrective is, therefore, almost prohibitive, because in most cases it might take up to three tons to the statute acre to correct the acidity.  I am merely raising this matter in order to help the Minister.  I think what I suggest is not impossible from an administrative point of view.  It is most unreasonable to expect people to do something which it is physically impossible for them to do.  It is a grave hardship on the type of people who live on those lands.  They cannot afford it.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about bad farming. The people I am talking about are people who are, very often, good <Col N="2479" /> farmers.  The Minister will probably agree that the people who live under the poorer conditions are hard working and thrifty people, and are good farmers as a rule.  I think the Minister will also agree that you get the more inefficient farmer on the richer land. In this case.  I am pleading for the good, hard working farmer, who has to live under difficult conditions.  I am trying to be reasonable about this.  It is not a political issue at all.  The Minister may say that there would be administrative difficulties.  I do not see how there could be.  You can very easily say: &ldquo;The following townlands are excluded from the operation of this Order&rdquo;.  I submit that in that way the nation would secure more food, because you would get increased oats production.  We thought this year that we had an ample supply of oats.  Oat prices are soaring every day, and the present market has shown a shortage.  In the production of more oats we would be making a useful contribution towards increased cattle production.  I would ask the Minister to try to meet the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two matters to which I should like to refer on this Estimate.  First of all, I join with Deputy Hughes in expressing appreciation of the generous gift to the nation of Johnstown Castle, County Wexford.  I feel sure that all Parties in the Dáil will appreciate not only the magnificent gesture to the nation, but the particular specialised endowment in agriculture which follows from a gift of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is provision in this Estimate for a sum of £8,200, being the additional sum required for the general expenses of the National Stud.  I should like if the Minister could tell us at this stage what his immediate programme is in connection with the stud.  The bloodstock at the stud has been dispersed, and the place is now an ordinary farm.  I gathered from what the Minister said on a previous occasion that the intention was to set up a kind of board to administer the farm, with or without some control by the Department of Agriculture, and with or without some responsibility to the <Col N="2480" /> Government.  I understood from a previous statement by the Minister that that legislation was likely to be introduced at an early date.  I wonder if the Minister, at this stage, is able to give us a closer picture of his intentions regarding the Tully Stud.  Can he say, for instance, when it is intended to introduce that legislation; what type of board he proposes to establish; whether the board is to be controlled by the Department, or is to function on advances provided by this House, and have an independent existence apart from the Department?  I think everybody is anxious that the Tully Stud should be re-stocked as soon as possible.  There may be an opinion of course that, as there are certain difficulties in the way of procuring suitable bloodstock to-day, a wise line might be to build up the Tully Stud from a bloodstock point of view only after very careful scrutiny as to what bloodstock is available.</P>
    <P>I should like if the Minister would reveal in greater detail his plans for the re-stocking, control and development of the Tully Stud.  If he does, he will be providing information on a subject in regard to which there is considerable demand for information not only in the area in which the stud is situated but from those who are interested in the preservation and development of the bloodstock industry, which is a very valuable one in this country.</P>
    <P>There is another item in the Estimate&mdash;provision for the payment of compensation to merchants against loss under the Potato Reserve Scheme. The Minister has indicated that the purchase of potatoes under the scheme resulted in a loss which has now to be met by the payment of a sum of approximately £23,000.  I understood from a reply in the House on, I think, Wednesday last, that the intention was to accumulate reserves of potatoes this year against a possible scarcity later in the season.  I should like if the Minister at this stage would give us some indication as to what his intentions are in that respect, and whether it is intended to follow the procedure adopted last year.  In order to build up a potato reserve, it ought <Col N="2481" /> not to be necessary to underwrite a loss of over £23,000 a year.  It is just possible, of course, that the Department may learn from the mistakes of last year.</P>
    <P>There is anxiety at present, very considerable anxiety, as to what the potato supply is going to be later in the season.  At present, potatoes are fetching approximately 2/6 a stone in Dublin.  Of course, everybody knows that that price is very much beyond the capacity of the ordinary working-class folk in Dublin to pay for a commodity which is a staple article of their diet.  It is not that the producer is getting anything like 2/6 a stone for his potatoes, but, between the time the producer disposes of the potatoes and the time they are sold in the retail shops, the price which the unfortunate consumer has to pay has reached 2/6. Although the fixing of prices is a matter for the Minister for Supplies, I think the matter is not one towards which the Minister for Agriculture can display indifference.  If we are going to have a potato shortage, it is essential that we should know at this stage that steps will be taken by the Government, and in particular by the Minister for Agriculture, to husband the potato resources so that they will be made available particularly in the places where they are not normally grown and cannot be got with the same ease as in rural areas.  I think the Minister must be concerned too with a situation in which the producer gets 8/- a cwt. for potatoes, and is lucky to get it in some places, while they are being sold at 20/- a cwt. in retail shops.</P>
    <P>The disparity is obviously too great, and I hope the Minister will consult with the Minister for Supplies with a view to ensuring that potatoes, particularly in the large centres like Dublin and other towns and cities in the country, will not be sold at such an exorbitant price as 2/6 a stone.  I think a statement from the Minister now, reassuring the public that steps will be taken to arrange for the transport of potatoes to areas where high prices were prevailing, so as to produce some degree of proportion <Col N="2482" /> between the price paid to the producer and the price paid to the retailer, might help to reduce the prices charged in the shops in towns and cities.  In that way, the Minister would make a valuable contribution towards relieving a problem which I can assure him is pressing with particular vigour on the working class people in the towns and cities.  I think the idea of accumulating a potato reserve is a good one.  I think it is desirable that the State should make sure there is a reserve of potatoes available for those who, if there is a shortage of potatoes, may find it most difficult to procure supplies.  The scheme ought to be administered in such a way that it will not be necessary to bear a loss of £23,000 on potatoes next July.  People are unable to buy potatoes to-day because of the high price charged for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's efforts last year in an endeavour to see that there would be no scarcity of potatoes.  He tells us that there was a loss of £23,000 because of that effort.  I say to him &ldquo;What matter,&rdquo; and I will give the Minister further encouragement to do the same this year no matter what the loss may be &mdash;that is, if it is necessary to do it.</P>
      <P>Last Wednesday another Minister, replying for the Minister for Agriculture to a question of mine, said that efforts would be made to accumulate a reserve and, if necessary, a price control would be made effective. Potatoes at 2/6 a stone in Dublin are beyond the means of large numbers of people whom I represent and I hope the potato price control will be given effect to without delay and that the Minister will be as successful this year as he was last year in seeing that there was no scarcity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week and in the preceding week there was a scarcity of potatoes in Dublin.  People had to travel a long distance and prices were far beyond their means.  An explanation was given to me on Wednesday to the effect that the advance in potato prices was in consequence of a temporary reduction in supplies, due mainly to the recent severe frost.  In the event <Col N="2483" /> of a severe frost again taking place, and people being left without potato supplies because horse-drawn vehicles cannot get to the market, I trust the Minister or some Government Department will supply petrol-driven vehicles, such as military lorries.  These lorries could bring potatoes from the outlying districts to the centre of the city so as to keep our people from hardship, save them travelling long distances, and paying high prices for their potato supplies.  We all know the producers are not getting the big prices and I think some investigation should be made to see where the difference between what the producers get and what the working classes are being charged, goes.</P>
    <P>I should like to express the hope that, as potatoes are the principal item of food for most of our people&mdash; potatoes, tea, and margarine, tea when we had it and margarine when we had it&mdash;the Government will make every effort to ensure continous adequate supplies for the larger cities and towns.  If there is a scarcity of essential foodstuffs, such as these, we depend upon the Minister, no matter what the cost may be, and even if he has to report a considerable loss at a later date, to accumulate sufficient supplies and see that the people get them at a price well within their means.</P>

It was a magnificent gift to the nation, and I am sure it will prove a real boon in the matter of educating young people and disseminating valuable knowledge throughout the country.  I should like to deal with the point raised by Deputy Hughes as to the advisability of excluding certain lands from wheat growing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister must realise that land a certain height above sea-level is definitely unsuited <Col N="2484" /> for wheat growing.  If you force a farmer to grow wheat on such land, you are depleting the stocks of wheat that could be utilised usefully for seed in other areas, or alternatively for food. This matter has a very serious effect in my county.  I am sure that half the county is mountainous, or tends to be mountainous.  A large portion of the land is at a fairly high level, and wheat grown on such land, even though that land may be regarded as arable by the Minister's tillage inspectors, is never successful; the land is not suited for wheat growing, and nine times out of ten the wheat crop is a failure.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hughes quoted Deputy Sheldon with regard to the average yield in Donegal being 22 stones to the acre.  I quite believe that.  If you put seed wheat into ground that has not a definite warm temperature that wheat, though it may be 100 per cent. good from a germinating point of view, will not germinate; there will not be germination if the temperature is lower than 45 degrees.  It must be obvious that land above a certain level will not have the correct temperature to give the wheat a start and, therefore, the crop will not come to anything.  In vast areas through my county the farmers sowed wheat&mdash;they were compelled to do so&mdash;but it never came to anything, if you except a blade or two in every square yard. There is no purpose served in compelling people to grow wheat on that type of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity given to us to discuss this subject. I want to bring to the Minister's notice a matter that was brought to my notice on a recent occasion.  The farmers from Hugginstown, Harris-town, Booleyglass and Templeorum, in my constituency, feel very aggrieved on this matter of compulsory wheat growing and they tell me that last year their average yield in these areas was considerably under three barrels. The seed they got was of a particularly poor quality and the crop was unmarketable. They were compelled to grow this crop at a very great loss and they feel that it is unreasonable and unjust that they should be compelled <Col N="2485" /> this year again to grow a crop at a loss, particularly when nothing extra will be contributed to the food supplies of the nation.  They have assured me that none of the wheat grown in those areas was marketable and they ask to be relieved from the growing of wheat this year.  They are quite prepared to grow any alternative crop the Minister suggests&mdash;oats, for example.</P>
      <P>There is a good deal in the point raised by Deputy Hughes, that an emergency Order will get over every difficulty, or the Minister might consider giving discretionary powers to local inspectors who themselves are satisfied that it is unreasonable and unfair to compel farmers to grow wheat at a loss.  Some of these men feel particularly aggrieved as they are holders of land which was divided not very long ago &mdash; land on the Castle-morris estate.  In the division of this estate the Forestry Department took the low land, the good quality land, and planted it with trees and sent the landholders to the hilltops, where they find it very hard to grow any type of crop.  I would like the Minister to make a special note of this case.</P>
      <P>There are other districts in my constituency which suffer from the same disability.  I have not had any specific complaints from them, but I know that complaints have been received in regard to the districts I have mentioned. I would ask the Minister to consider those recommendations, and, as a matter of fact, I have already communicated with him on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the grant for an emergency potato supply, I should like to say that I consider that this grant is absolutely essential. In the constituency that I represent, and in the immediately surrounding district, I find that while a very substantial amount of potato seed was put in last year&mdash;a great increase on former years&mdash;the crop has been very disappointing.  Even worse than that, I find that in some cases almost half the crop of potatoes has rotted in the pits.  I consider that that position is very alarming, and I would ask the Minister to inform us whether any experiments are being carried out, or <Col N="2486" /> whether any research work is being done, with a view to finding out the cause of the incidence of disease in our potatoes in the past few years.  My reason for asking that is that there seems to be a greater incidence of disease in potatoes in the last year than in previous years.  I realise, of course, that that may be due to the long drought that we had last year and to other climatic conditions that occurred during the year, but I suggest that this abnormal loss is a matter for investigation, as the position is certainly alarming.</P>
      <P>It is possible that the position obtaining in my own constituency and in adjoining counties is not universal throughout the country, but so far as I can learn, from people from all parts of the county, it would seem that there has been a considerable loss in the potato crop.  In that connection, I might point out that, having regard to the danger of such a shortage in the supplies of potatoes, very active and vigorous steps should be taken to prevent profiteering, in connection with the potato crop, as between the producer and the consumer.  The producer, of course, is entitled to get the best possible price that he can get for his product, and, naturally, the consumer wants to get it at the lowest price.  This is a time of emergency, and it certainly is not a time when the producers and consumers should be allowed to be exploited by middle-men. I realise that, in the producing and marketing of potatoes, particularly due to the fact that there has been a disease in our potatoes within the last year, there has been a loss in profits, but I think that there should be very careful investigation so as to ensure that there will be no profitering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, with regard to the establishment of a new agricultural school in County Wexford, I welcome it wholeheartedly. I think that schools of this type, in which practical education in agriculture is given to boys, are a necessity, and that they are a necessity even if we adopt a motion such as is under consideration at the moment.  These schools are constituted so as to give an entirely different approach to the question of agriculture. <Col N="2487" /> They are intended to give our young people a grounding in advanced agricultural science; but I think that, now that we are embarking on the subsidisation of a new school, some sort of investigation should be held, to find out how many of the best students of these schools actually go into work as practical farmers.  From my experience, I can say that a large number of those students who passed through agricultural schools find their way, not to the farms of this country but, eventually, to work outside this country.  Some young men that I know of, who got a very good agricultural education in some of our most up-to-date agricultural schools, are now ploughing their way through the Siegfried Line, instead of ploughing the lands of their own country.  We also know that when any vacancy occurs in the Department of Agriculture, or, as a matter of fact, in any other Department, there is an enormous number of applications from past pupils of our agricultural colleges, who are anxious to get jobs there, rather than become practical farmers.  It may be, of course, that there is no opportunity for these people to become practical farmers because the farms are not there for them; but I think it would be a good thing to find out what percentage of these young people, who are trained in our agricultural colleges, go back to work on the farms.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to County Wicklow and other somewhat similar counties.  County Donegal, for instance, has been referred to as a county in which there has been a failure in wheat production.  It has been mentioned that most parts of County Wicklow, like Donegal, have a high altitude, but there is one essential difference between the two counties, and that is that in Donegal they are only compelled to put one-twenty-fifth of their land under wheat, whereas the people in County Wicklow are required to use one-tenth of their land.  Now, 10 per cent. constitutes a very heavy burden so far as those people are concerned. I want to make it clear that the situation is serious.  We are not <Col N="2488" /> concerned so much about the amount of wheat that was grown last year or the year before.  Spring, it seems, will be late this year, and very little winter wheat has been sown, and that means that a very big effort will have to be made if we are to get anything like the same average of wheat this year as in former years.  The land is completely sodden, and anything that can be done must be done in order to encourage the growing of the maximum acreage of wheat: but it must be borne in mind that it will not add anything to the total amount of wheat for human consumption if you compel any farmer to sow wheat on land which will not grow it.  As a matter of fact, instead of increasing food production by methods of that kind, you will only have a waste of land.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I was speaking to a miller last year on the question of Diamante wheat, and he told me that he had sent out 16,000 tons of wheat and only got back half of it as millable wheat.  It may be that a small protion went to some other merchant, but from my experience, people who grew that particular variety did not obtain a full return from the crop. I consider that the Minister should provide some compensation for people who grew the Diamante variety of seed, because it was a failure in County Wicklow.</P>
    <P>There is also a case for giving tillage inspectors a fair amount of discretion.  When the wheat quota was first enforced there may have been a reasonable excuse for not giving discretionary powers, inasmuch as the inspectors were undertaking a task to which they were not accustomed, and did not know the actual conditions or the nature of the soil.  After some years of experience they should know now what farms could be excluded from the tillage quota and what farms could produce the full acreage.  There should be no hesitation about giving inspectors discretionary power, particularly in counties like Wicklow, which has a high content of inferior land.  I am afraid, however, that if discretionary power were given in one county it would have to be given in all counties.  Inspectors may be relied <Col N="2489" /> upon to do their duty fearlessly and impartially, and not to release anybody from the obligation to grow wheat except where they are absolutely certain the land would not produce it. The mere fact that wheat failed in some places last year is not sufficient evidence that the land will not grow that crop.  Corroborative evidence in that respect should be obtained by inspectors and, if there is any doubt, local agricultural instructors could be consulted, as they would know the nature of the soil.  If discretion were given inspectors it would meet objections that have been raised by farmers and would make for the production of more food.  I think a fundamental mistake was made at the beginning of the wheat-growing campaign when a uniform quota was not fixed for the entire country.  The Department must have found that out now.  It is not too late to give inspectors discretionary powers now.  To do so will not affect production, but it will prevent grave hardship on growers and considerable waste not only of land but of good seed.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton dealt with the position of the national stud farm.  County Tipperary is interested in that question as the Blandford stock was produced there, and included Derby winners.  The people of that county are also interested in the future of dairy stud farms.  Regarding the establishment of an agricultural school in County Wexford, anything that promotes <Col N="2490" /> agricultural education will be welcomed but, like Deputy Cogan, I wonder how many of the students remain in this country and continue to farm?  There were 16 applications recently for a temporary position as an agricultural instructor in South Tipperary. I expect that the education of every one of these applicants cost this State a couple of hundred pounds.  I consider that the majority of these students want to become instructors and that very few of them will go back to work on the land.  As wheat-growing has been alluded to by other Deputies, I wish to say that wheat growers in Tipperary have a grievance and I direct the Minister's attention to it.  I had a question about it on the Order Paper recently.  Wheat growers get 55/- a barrel for wheat, plus 2/6 for artificial manures when these are available.  When it bushels over 62 a very large mill in County Tipperary buys all the wheat produced within an area of 20 miles.  Where the crop bushels 63 or 64, farmers do not get a higher price, except from a co-operative society.  Millers will not pay any more.  A good deal of wheat is kept for seed and is purchased by merchants at 67/- but they resell it for 78/- Why should not the farmers instead of shopkeepers and merchants be allowed to get the 78/- for seed?  One farmer who had a good deal of wheat was called upon to make a return of the amount he had threshed.  In his case it was illegal to sell seed.</P>
      <P>Although it does not come under the heading in this Vote, I should like to congratulate the Minister on the migratory scheme established by his Department.  Now that spring work is beginning on the land, I believe that that migratory scheme should be resumed.  It was a great success in County Tipperary.  Men came there to work, principally from the Kerry area, and the scheme was very successful.  If the Minister reintroduced that scheme within the next few months, it would help the campaign for food production, as farm labour is very badly needed at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish first of all to say that I was very <Col N="2491" /> glad that the Leaders of the various Parties expressed their appreciation and thanks for the generous gift to the State of Johnstown Castle.  I did not intend to deal very fully with the matter at this stage, because a Bill will be introduced, I think, during this session, dealing with it, and the subject can then be discussed; but some Deputies have expressed curiosity as to what we intend to do with it, and perhaps I might say a few words about it.  It is an estate of about 1,000 acres, of which 500 acres are arable.  It is land which is very much of the type of Wexford land, which, I suppose, is the type fairly common to all Leinster&mdash;land which must be tilled occasionally and let into grass; in other words, land on which this very modern system referred to, lea farming, is most appropriate.</P>
      <P>There are 300 acres of timber, and, although I have not got an expert opinion, I have been assured by people who appear to know their business that the commercial value of it is at least £100 an acre, which will give Deputies an idea of the very valuable gift we have got, even from the monetary standpoint, from the standpoint of a valuation on that basis, in that great property.  About 200 acres are at the moment practically waste&mdash;overgrown with bracken for very many years&mdash; comprising land which it has been found practically impossible at the moment to bring into cultivation, so that, in those 200 acres, we have something for the technical men of the Department to tackle with all the skill and brains they have to see if they can make something of it.  I am optimistic enough to believe that they will make something of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will not be possible in war conditions to do very much more than start an agricultural school there, because while the building, a castle, a very beautiful castle, is very comfortable for a family, it is not as suitable as one might expect for a very big institution. It will, however, be satisfactory for 30 or 40 students and staff, and, so long as emergency conditions last, I am afraid the best we can do is to start a school.  In time, however, when we are in a position to get supplies for <Col N="2492" /> building and so on, we hope to start a research institute there, and I am glad to be able to inform Deputy Hughes that the lines along which that research work will proceed will chiefly be those of soil research.  We may be able to do some work on soil research there in the course of a year or so, but not very much in the way of starting an institute until we are in a better position to get the necessary laboratories built and fitted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes asked me a question which I was not able to answer at the time as to the amount of land taken over and dealt with by direct action. The area in 1944 was 1,079 acres.  In addition to this area, 697 acres were taken over and let in conacre.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>It showed a profit of about £2 per acre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that at the moment.  It would be a rather involved calculation and would take some time to make it.  The Deputy, of course, will understand that, in the individual instance in which a profit is made, the profit is given back to the owner. There is a slight margin kept for the coming year or some such purpose, but it is a rather involved calculation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>So you do not confiscate then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not altogether; sometimes we give back part of the profit. With regard to potatoes, the potato question, as I explained earlier, is rather involved, because, if the factors had done what we asked them to do, that is, to build up a reserve, I feel that they could have used these potatoes towards the end and nobody could find any fault with it.  If a merchant is supplying potatoes to the City of Dublin and buys them in February, bringing them into the market in May, nobody can have any grievance; but it is a different matter when the Government finances a scheme of this kind. If we had ordered the merchants to sell these potatoes in May, we would inevitably have created a slump and in that way would have destroyed the market of those who legitimately kept <Col N="2493" /> their potatoes to supply the city in May.  We would be making trouble in two ways: (1) doing an injustice to the legitimate supplier, and (2) possibly making it uncertain that suppliers would keep their potatoes this year or next, because of the fear of the same thing being done and possibly creating a worse shortage this year or next year by competing against them in that way, so we had to face the loss.  Deputy Hughes mentioned that it might have been a good thing to give cheap potatoes to the poor.  We did consider whether we could not bring these potatoes, or some of them, up last year and give them cheaply to the poor, but we found that it was nearly an impossible scheme, or at least it appeared impossible to us at the time to administer such a scheme, and we did not attempt it.  I do not know whether we might not consider a scheme of the kind for this coming year, but it is the difficulty of doing it, and not the will to do it, which stopped us.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton and, I think, Deputy Byrne also, referred to the price to the consumer.  We have regarded this recent shortage as due to weather conditions, and I am advised that the potato supply will probably be all right this week or next week, now that the frost and snow have disappeared.  If the present partial shortage continues and potatoes continue to get dearer, the matter will have to be dealt with, but I think we had better allow a few weeks and see if it will settle itself. The less interference there is with a trade of this kind the better.  We should try to let things take their course; if we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A matter dealt with by a number of Deputies was the question of wheat-growing above a certain contour line. Again, that is a question which was considered.  In many of these matters, such as the distribution of potatoes in Dublin and the growing of wheat above a certain line, there are always the two points of view, and I think Deputies may take it that the views they expressed here have been very fully considered in the Department and that, on the whole, the arguments for and against having been examined, <Col N="2494" /> the present policy was adopted because the arguments appeared to be in favour of it.</P>
    <P>First, Deputies know that we are not getting as much wheat as we would like.  We are getting a very good response from the farmers, no doubt, but we would like to get a greater response, so that we cannot afford to drop any wheat at all.  If we do, therefore, exempt any particular class of farmers or any particular district from wheat-growing, we shall have to try to make it up somewhere else, and I do not think the farmers of Leinster and part of Munster would welcome a decision by us to increase the present 10 per cent. of arable land under wheat, because 10 per cent. is a fairly high percentage on the ordinary mixed farm.  It is not so easy for a farmer to go higher, if he wants, at the same time, to grow the necessary potatoes, roots, and perhaps beet, and also a certain amount of oats and barley for his own animals.  If we say that the percentage must be higher than 10, we may create a certain difficulty in his ordinary economy and I am afraid the raising of the percentage would not be very welcome.  Deputy Cogan made the point that we should have had the same percentage for the whole country, with exemptions in certain cases.  I shall deal with the question of exemptions in a moment.  If we were to fix the same percentage for the whole country, we, certainly, could not go above 10 per cent.  I am doubtful that we could go so high as that, because, whatever justification we may have for requiring the Leinster farmer to grow 10 per cent., it would be very difficult to justify the same percentage in the case of the Donegal farmer, who has equally good land but not land which is equally suitable for wheat growing.  I am speaking of the lowlands and the arable land in east Donegal.  Deputies will agree that it would not be fair to ask the east Donegal farmer to grow the same percentage of wheat as the Carlow, Wexford or Dublin farmer.  It is not so easy to see where we would get more wheat if we dropped certain areas.</P>
    <P>Let me come to the difficulties of <Col N="2495" /> giving effect to the proposition which has been put before the House.  As regards exemptions in general, I gave a great deal of consideration to the proposal put up to-day by Deputy Cogan.  It was the first idea that struck officials in the Department and myself: to make wheat-growing compulsory, fix 7 per cent.&mdash;that was the figure we had in mind at the time&mdash; for the whole country and then consider applications for exemption. There are 240,000 farmers in the State and a fair percentage of those farmers would apply for exemption.  Even if only 5 per cent. applied for exemption the number would come to about 12,000.  It would be a very big job to deal with 12,000 applications.  They would have to be dealt with within a few months, because if you asked farmers to put in applications by 31st December they would have to be dealt with by the end of February if the growing of wheat was to be insisted upon.  It might be necessary to deal with them earlier in order to give them an opportunity of growing winter wheat.  In any event, they would have to be dealt with very rapidly and that would mean a large number of tribunals of some sort&mdash;much more than one tribunal in every county. The tribunal could hardly decide a case without inspection of the farm concerned and that would mean a large number of inspectors.  The job was so appalling that we dropped it.  We decided that we could not work this system of exemptions satisfactorily and that the best thing to do was to make wheat-growing compulsory all over the country.</P>
    <P>The next point we considered was the division of the country into districts, making 10 per cent. compulsory in some places and bringing the percentage down as low as four in other places.  It might have satisfied Deputy Hughes and Deputy Cogan if we had proceeded on that line, taking a map of Carlow or Wicklow, painting the 10 per cent. part red, the 7 per cent. part green, the 4 per cent. part white and the part where no wheat would be required black.  Again, the task would be exceptionally difficult.  I have not <Col N="2496" /> gone to a county during the past three or four years to ask farmers to grow more food in which it was not urged that parts of that county should be exempt.  I remember distinctly that requests were made in that connection in Meath, Laoighis, Carlow, Wicklow and Tipperary.  Then, it was said: &ldquo;We will drop that line of approach, take-a contour map and see what we can do&rdquo;.  We found that the contour line would not correspond with townlands, as Deputy Hughes suggests. Deputies will, I think, find that townlands run from as low as 400 feet to as high as 800 feet.  What one should do with townlands circumstanced in that way, I do not know.  Take a contour line in connection with a farm and you will find that one part will go well above and the other well below the line.  Between one part of a farm and another, there may be a variation of from 120 to 150 feet.  If you were dealing with a farmer half of whose farm was above the line and half below it, it would be difficult to say how much wheat you would require him to grow. The difficulties were very great and we had to fall back on the present scheme.</P>
    <P>Farmers are asked to sow wheat on only 10 per cent. of their arable land&mdash; not on their total acreage.  That does not amount to a great deal.  If a farmer is doubtful as to his arable acreage, he can ask the tillage inspector to come along and give him his opinion.  I gave that advice to some farmers and they found that the inspector was more reasonable than they expected, that he put the amount of arable land lower than they thought he would.  They were able to reduce the amount of wheat they were sowing but I do not think they reduced their acreage of tillage.  In those areas, they usually tilled as much as they are now required to till under the Order. The fixing of the line is very difficult. I saw reports from inspectors on this point and I think Deputies will agree that you will get a number of farmers above the line who are doing better in wheat growing than some below the line.  In other words, you have more efficient farmers or better land above the line than below the line, so that drawing a contour line will not settle the matter there either.  I know two <Col N="2497" /> farms where wheat is being grown successfully at a height.  One is that of my colleague, the Minister for Finance, who showed me his wheat, growing 800 feet up, and it seemed to be a very good crop.  I do not say that it was up to the 12 to 14 barrel standard but it looked as if it would produce six or seven barrels to the statute acre.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Eight hundred and twenty feet.  He showed me a map to prove that that was the height.  The other farm was that of Mr. Robert Barton. Very good wheat was being grown there, too.  I have not seen the third place&mdash;Crooksling, but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Atle.  I would go so far with Deputy Hughes as to say that practically all that land is very acid, but I do not agree with him when he says that it is only trifling with the matter to say that farmers could use the lime scheme.  In some instances a generous application of lime and so on brought a fairly decent crop, and I think that good liming will do a great deal for these farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>What would it cost?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would, of course.  I do not know if Deputy Hughes had the same experience that I had on a good many occasions when I met farmers around the Borris area that he mentioned.  I have frequently met groups of farmers in places like that. They have put the same point to me that Deputy Hughes has put.  Nearly always when I have asked the spokesman if he had grown wheat himself he has replied: &ldquo;Yes, and it did all right with me&rdquo;.  When speaking of the wheat crop being a failure, such men were usually talking for their neighbours.  Perhaps it was that they <Col N="2498" /> were too proud to admit that it was a failure with themselves.  The spokesman usually answered that it did all right with him, but that his neghbours did not make much of a fist of it.  I agree with Deputy Hughes&mdash;I do not think anyone has ever suggested that the farmers we are speaking of are in any way bad farmers.  I think these mountain farmers are very efficient and very industrious.  Otherwise, they would hardly stick it out in the places in which they live.  Before leaving this subject finally I should like to say that I have always advised farmers to get the inspectors to come along and have a look at their holdings.  If farmers write to the Department we ask the inspectors to go and have a look at their places. What I cannot do, and what no officer under me can do, is to authorise an inspector to break the law.  We cannot say to the inspector: &ldquo;Do not bother about the 10 per cent. as far as that man is concerned&rdquo;.  That would be against the law, and against the Tillage Order.  The tillage inspectors are there to assess arability.  If they assess the amount of arable land at so much then 10 per cent. of that must be under wheat.  If they think that, would be a great hardship on a man they will probably bring down the amount of arable land in order to give the man a way out.  If you like they can interpret what is arable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton asked me about the Tully Stud.  I expect that, during this session, a Bill will be introduced dealing with it.  The policy is to run the place as a national stud, that is, to have a high-class stud as far as we can.  It is to be run with the object of improving the bloodstock of this country, as far as we possibly can do that.  The idea in the Bill is to set up a company which will be financed by the State.  In the carrying on of the stud, the company will be free in the ordinary business way.  In other words, neither the Minister for Agriculture nor the Minister for Finance will interfere with them in the type of stallion they will buy or the price they will pay, or with the type of mare they will buy or the number of mares they will keep.  The House will be asked to vote <Col N="2499" /> a certain amount of money, and within the limit of that amount the company will be free to go on.  Of course, when that money is spent we will have to come back to the Dáil and it will then be a question whether the Dáil will give them more or not.  I think that is perhaps the greatest amount of freedom that we can give the company.</P>

I think it was no harm to have those paddocks freshened up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Definitely, they are giving <Col N="2500" /> back no horses except what we buy. Deputy Cogan asked if any special investigation had been carried out in recent years in regard to the incidence of disease in potatoes.  I was rather struck about last September in regard to the number of reports that I got, personally, from farmers whom I had met as to the incidence of disease in potatoes.  I asked for an investigation. That investigation did not go to show that there was anything to be alarmed about.  There was no new disease, but, evidently, the weather conditions of 1944 were particularly favourable to blight.  I think that was the cause of most of our trouble.  I do not know what proportion of the students who come to the agricultural colleges return to their own farms.  I should like to say that from the time these colleges were set up it was the policy to try to select boys who would go back to their own farms.  In fact, I was looking at the first forms of application that were sent out to boys when the colleges were set up over 40 years ago.  One of the questions asked was this: &ldquo;Do you intend to return to your own farm after doing your course here?&rdquo; Evidently that was the idea from the beginning.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy O'Donnell, I do not know that we will be able to set up a dairy stud farm on the same lines as the national stud.  I do not think the conditions are the same with regard to cattle breeding as they are with regard to horse breeding because, for one thing, the cash consideration is a big one.  It would take £35,000 to £40,000 to buy a good stallion.  There are very few private people who could afford that amount of money, and, therefore, it is necessary for the State to come in.  In the other case, a very good bull can be bought for £300, £400 or £500, and in connection with such purchases there are loan facilities and so on.  There are many private people in the country who could afford to make such purchases.</P>

Otherwise, <Col N="2501" /> farmers may slip out of tillage altogether.  I would also ask him to give consideration to inspector's reports when they are to the effect that land inspected was not found suitable for wheat.  I make that suggestion so as to prevent wheat being put into ground where the crop will not grow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already explained, there is a certain amount of illegality in that suggestion.  The inspectors are bound by law to carry out the provisions of the Tillage Order. If a man has a certain area of arable land, then the inspector must insist that the required percentage of wheat will be grown on it.  The inspector would be quite within his rights, in a case where he found that a man had been assessed with 20 acres of arable land before the compulsory wheat-growing came in, in saying that, on consideration, he had decided to reduce that amount of arable land.  The inspector could legally do that, but what the Deputy has suggested would be an illegal thing for the inspector to do and I could not make any such suggestion to an inspector.</P>

Sílim go bhfuil na Teachtaí ar an dtaobh seo den Tigh, a bhfuil suim acu ins an obair seo, an-bhuíoch do na Teachtaí i gCumann Fine Gael a chuidigh leis an obair agus a chuaidh amach&mdash;daoine mar an Teachta an Geinearál O Maolchatha&mdash;chun cuidiú san obair.

    <P>Tamall de bhliantaibh ó shoin, bhí spiorad aontachta maith sa tír, mar bhí gluaiseacht ann ag cuidiú le gach dream in aithbheochaint agus forás na Gaeilge.  Gidh go bhfuil buntáistí móra ag an aos óg anois, thar mar bhí san am san, nuair a bhí troid ar siúl againn i gcoinne na nithe Gallda, tá leithscéal ag roinnt acu anois, ag rá go mba chóir an cheist seo d'fhágaint fán Rialtas, agus ní thuigeann siad nach <Col N="2505" /> féidir leis an Rialtas aon rud do dhéanamh chun an teanga do shábháil gan toil agus comhaontú gach uile dhuine.</P>
    <P>As regards the matter of the appointments, the position is that it is considered necessary, as I have been saying in Irish, to make them now owing to the possibility that there may be disturbances on the Continent and that in any event difficulties may arise in taking up this work at a later time. Although there are difficulties there at the moment we have the advantage of having had a visit to one part of the Continent at any rate, the Iberian Peninsula, in regard to this matter and the authorities at the National Library have some idea of what the position is there.  It is intended to concentrate for the present on that area.  Of the two persons whom it is intended to send abroad in the near future, one is a lecturer in Spanish in University College, Cork, and the other is a priest of the Order of Friars Minor.  Both have special knowledge of this work and they are considered to be the most suitable persons.  Special apparatus of a portable nature has to be provided for them and that will cost more than half the amount for which we are looking.  It will take some time as I said to complete this work if other countries on the Continent are to be visited but from time to time no doubt we shall have reports as to progress.</P>
    <P>As regards Comhdáil Naisiúnta na Gaedhilge, this is an organisation set up in an endeavour to undertake planning in regard to the Irish revival and to take more effective steps than seemed to be undertaken by other bodies or to co-ordinate them in such a way that more progress will be made in spreading the use of Irish amongst the people.  This is not a Government organisation, but the Government have been interested in it and, as I have just been saying in Irish, all political Parties have shown their appreciation of its work and have come forward to help.  That is a very good and necessary thing.  I hope this co-operation will continue, that no Party will have any reason to be displeased and that there will not be any attempt&mdash;there has not been any <Col N="2506" /> serious attempt, I think, so far&mdash;to introduce any political or partisan spirit into this great national work, in which we can, I think, happily unite our efforts.  We have not interfered with the internal working of the Comhdáil, of course.  There are representatives there of all the Gaelic organisations and there is a central committee, but we have considered it necessary to give them some support to enable them to get things going in the country.  After some experience they found it necessary to appoint a number of organisers.  I have no knowledge really of the method of appointment nor of the persons appointed.</P>
    <P>In these cases where we give Grants-in-Aid, what happens is that the grant is made available and the body receiving it is not asked to account in detail for the expenditure.  The position really is that the Government Department giving the grant does not interfere with the policy of the body which is receiving it nor in its administration. An example is the Abbey Theatre or the Folklore Commission.  We do not interfere but if it happens that progress is not to our liking, or that we have serious doubts about the wisdom of continuing the grant, the matter can be re-examined, but it has never been the case that the Government Department or the Minister responsible to the Dáil has interfered in the working of the organisation or the institution.  I think it is better to let them work out their own salvation.  They are really only starting on this work and they find that it is impossible to cover the ground with the very slender organisation they have at their headquarters office in Dublin.  I think the Dáil will join with me in hoping that their organisers will be successful in the work they have undertaken.</P>

      <P>Continuing the <Col N="2507" /> debate from last evening, I am glad to see so much time has been devoted to a consideration of agricultural problems this evening.  That is a development which I think will be welcomed by everybody in the House.  As regards this motion, while I have every sympathy with the farmers in this matter I have much doubt as to the wisdom of pressing the motion, because I am not satisfied that if we set up these types of farms in a number of counties they will bring any useful results.  In the first place it would be absolutely impossible to get costings on a farm of this sort that would be of any advantage to the ordinary farmer because we have six or seven different types of farms in this country and if we wish to get costings that would be of any practical value it would be necessary to carry out six or seven different types of farming on the one farm.  We would want farming for the uneconomic holder, farming for the economic holder, ranch farming for the rancher, tillage farming for the tillage farmer and also grazing and dairy farms.  How are you to get the different costings?  I think it is impossible. It would be very unwise to establish 26 such farms in this little country.  We have heard a good deal about white elephants in the past.  I think these farms would be real white elephants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister stated on several occasions, we have throughout the country farms which are run on up-to-date lines where costings are kept. So far as my county is concerned, I am satisfied that we have the most scientific farming perhaps in Europe. There is the farm near Navan run by the Maynooth Mission to China which is cultivated for the benefit of the community there.  It is run on first-class lines and any farmer who wants to inspect it is given every facility. Then you have the Salesian College at Warrenstown for the education of young students and the farm is open for inspection to everybody.  At Maynooth College they have a huge farm which is run on up-to-date lines with modern machinery and costings kept, so that farming is brought to a fine art <Col N="2508" /> there.  That is also open for inspection by anybody.  Then you have the Albert College farm at Glasnevin which is also run on modern lines.  When you have farms of these types which go into the minutest details in connection with agriculture, it would be nonsense to start the farms mentioned in the motion.  I know that the motion is brought forward in the interest of agriculture, but I think, on second thoughts, the movers will find that it would be absolutely impossible to carry out.  There is no use having the farms there as white elephants because they would have to be closed down again.  If anyone can convince me that these farms would be a benefit to the community, I will certainly vote for the motion but, from my own experience, I do not think that they will produce very good results.</P>
    <P>We have committees of agriculture in each county whose officials are doing splendid work in testing seeds and giving advice as to what particular varieties should be grown.  These are tested on different farms and give good results.  I think that is as far as we can go.  All these are costly enough to the State.  The farms proposed would be very costly and would put a load on the agricultural community which they should not be asked to bear.  I do not think they would be useful in producing results.  You would have a good many new officials in connection with them who would establish vested interests in them and who would make sure that they would be kept on for their benefit.  Agriculturists are crying out against officialdom.  They say that there are too many officials in this country and I think they are right. There is such a variety of farming carried on in this country that it would be impossible to know where to start. There are scores of types of farms all over my constituency which are worked on different lines.  On some farms you have men who only make farming a side line.  Others make farming their whole concern.  Other small farmers have to go out to work for neighbours or on the roads or in the quarries.</P>
    <P>Our farmers and farmers' sons are not as backward as some people would have us believe.  I believe they are <Col N="2509" /> progressive and advanced in their ideas.  There is nothing concerning modern farming that they do not know.  They can easily acclimatise themselves to anything new.  In fact, farming would be far more modernised if the finances were there.  There is not a small farmer in the Midlands who would not be a first-class modern farmer if he had the means.  After a few days he would be able to work any of the modern machinery.  He would be progressive if he got the chance. But finance and the instability of agriculture have a great deal to do with keeping agriculture back. During the last 25 years farming has made rapid advances here; I do not say that there has been any great prosperity.  When I was a young man 30 years ago there was desperate drudgery amongst the farming community and the workers on the land. The farmers and the workers were in rags.  They were in a state of poverty. Their children were badly clad and badly fed and the farmers themselves were nearly as bad.  At present the farmers are not the scarecrows they were then and neither are the workers.  Farming has advanced and will steadily advance to the position in which we should like to see it. There will, of course, be ups and downs.  During the last six years it was a case of producing the stuff no matter whether it paid or not.</P>
    <P>I think it would be a bad thing to embark on a system of costings; it could not be done.  As I say, agriculture at all times has its ups and downs. At times, any agricultural produce will pay you, at other times it will not pay. At present any farmer who is lucky enough to have had a bountiful crop of potatoes can reap a good harvest now.  Unfortunately, there are not too many in that position.  Then farmers in the cattle trade can do very well at times.  A man could buy a heifer or a springer for £15 and be able to get £40, £50, £60 or £70 for it after some time.  These things happen periodically. There is not always a lean time. The farmers, as I say, have their ups and downs and what they lose on the swings they make up on the roundabouts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2510" /> The Minister should evolve a system of mixed agriculture so that we would not have this one-line farming which I detest.  Farmers who carry on that type of farming, when they come on lean days are down and out altogether. The farmer who carries on mixed farming, and who grows root crops and does some stall feeding in the winter time can nearly always weather the storms.  He is able to stick it out. That is why I should like to see a permanent system of agriculture evolved so that, whether this Government is in office for a long or a short time, the new Government would take over where they left off, and agriculture would be stabilised and be in such a position that a farmer would know where his future lay, and would not be doubtful as to what would happen.</P>
    <P>We must have a fixed line of policy. I am one of those who always believed in tillage farming.  I believe we should have a certain percentage of tillage on every farm.  Of course, I know that when the war ends the very large farmers in my county and neighbouring counties will do their utmost to put in all the grass seeds they can.  It is a paying proposition for them at all times to be able to export big cattle.  It is easy for them and does not cost much in the way of employment.  I would rather see every type of farmer do his percentage of tillage so that we would be able to give more employment and have more manure to bring our land back to fertility again.  I ask the Minister to keep that in mind, because it is one of the main things to be considered.</P>
    <P>In the past the small farmer had to work hard to make ends meet; in fact, he was hardly ever able to do it.  The big farmer was able to reap huge profits at a very small expenditure. When he got the money he did not spend it in this country.  Probably 90 per cent. of it went abroad for the purchase of stocks and shares, so that it was not spent for the benefit of agriculture here.  I should like if something could be done to see that that money is spent in this country, where these people get their bread and butter.  We should have a line of agricultural policy fixed definitely for our <Col N="2511" /> generation and we should try to evolve the best type of policy so that farmers will know where they stand. We should do our utmost to encourage mixed farming.  I think the Minister will agree that that is necessary.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will make every effort to extend the markets at home and abroad for agriculture and, particularly, now that the war is coming to a close, that he will see what he can do across the channel with regard to our export trade.  Our chief export trade was in agricultural produce.  Unfortunately, we had not many markets for it.  But there was one in which we had a fairly good footing.  I believe that, with goodwill and a sustained effort on the part of the Minister and the Government, we will be able to regain what we have lost in that market.  If we can do so, it will be a very good thing for every one of us.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to make every effort to induce the Minister for Local Government to relieve agriculture of the heavy overhead charges in respect of main roads.  They weigh too heavily on the farmers.  If these things were tackled, agriculture would be given a chance.  At present, agriculture is bearing too big a burden at the top.  We all know that in the future rates will be increased month after month, year after year, to meet the post-war emergency and that agriculture will have a huge load to carry.  I think the Government should make some effort to take the top load off&mdash; that is, the charges in respect of main roads, mental hospitals, and so forth, and many of the State subsidies which we have to grant in order to keep people alive.  If they could provide more work and less subsidies, we would be better off.</P>
    <P>The Minister should endeavour to have the country zoned in three or four districts and to create a tillage area, a dairy area and a cattle grazing area. It would be a good thing if the country were zoned and proper attention given to the different areas so that we would not force on one county what might suit another county eminently.  I would suggest also that the Minister should impress upon the Minister for Lands <Col N="2512" /> the necessity for making small uneconomic holdings economic before he divides any land.  In my county there are too many uneconomic holdings.  If we get the Minister to work along those lines there will be no need for the Farmers' Party or this Party to press for schools or classes or costings, such as are mentioned in the motion. In fact, in my opinion they would be a white elephant and would be of no advantage to the farming community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Giles wandered a long way from the motion and I do not think I quite agree with some of the things he said.  I do agree with him, however, in one particular respect, that is, the necessity for a balanced agriculture.  I think we must all recognise that a balanced agriculture is essential.  Deputy Giles referred to &ldquo;one-line&rdquo; farming.  It is bad farming, definitely, and unwise, not merely for the individual, but for the nation.  We ought to aim at a balanced agriculture by having a proper mixed farming policy for the country.</P>
      <P>One of the peculiar characteristics of Irish agriculture is the stagnation in production that has been noticeable for many years.  I think that is due, in no small measure, to the fact that we lack application of modern technical methods.  Whatever knowledge is available in Merrion Street, whatever solutions to problems of soil, feeding, etc., have been discovered by our experts at Albert College and other colleges, is not disseminated, is not percolating down to the individual farmer.  When we examine statistics and compare production here with the enormous expansion in production that has been secured by competitor countries in the British market&mdash;New Zealand, Denmark and the Scandinavian countries &mdash;we have definite ground for uneasiness. I think we will have to spend very much more on technical education and ensure that the technical knowledge available is brought to the individual farmer in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the question of experimental or demonstration <Col N="2513" /> farms has been divorced in this motion from the whole question of technical education.  It is inevitably bound up with that question. Peripatetic instructors are not enough to convince the farmer as to modern and efficient methods and the application of new technique.  You must have practical demonstration and you must have the application of technical knowledge.  Agriculture is not an exact science, but modern technical progress has gone a long way to making it much more exact than it has been in the past.</P>
    <P>The Minister told the House his intentions regarding Johnstown Castle and that he proposes to set up a research establishment there.  That is a step in the right direction.  We cannot overlook the fact that, from the beginning, candidates for admission to agricultural colleges were asked was it their intention to return to the farm when qualified.  I suppose the Minister will agree with me that 90 per cent. of the students&mdash;especially those who go to Albert College&mdash;do not go back to the farm.  They go to Albert College for the purpose of getting a job, not for the purpose of acquiring knowledge and applying it in a practical way to agriculture.  That is very unfortunate and a sad state of affairs. If we were to estimate the percentage of people who get proper technical training in this country, I think we would find that the percentage is very low.  In Denmark, it is estimated that the number of farmers who receive a modern technical education is about one in five.  The advantage that the Dances have over Irish farmers is that they start off with a much higher standard of technical education.  That imposes a very severe handicap on Irish agriculture.  We also lack research facilities.  I believe the establishment of a research institution at Johnstown to be a step in the right direction.  In Sweden there is a number of research stations situated through the country, in locations that are typical of the district. Albert College is situated in a most favourable location, in the dry belt, on very rich land, where there are ideal conditions from the point of view of production.  The results <Col N="2514" /> obtained from the soil on which Albert College is situated bear no comparison at all with those that can be secured under the conditions that obtain generally throughout the country.  Soil problems such as arise in other parts of the country do not occur at Albert College.</P>
    <P>Soil conditions constitute a problem. In the past, agricultural scientists believed that it was only the more important constituents of the soil that were essential to good production.  It is only in recent years that scientists have discovered that there are what are called trace deficiencies in the soil, which militate against proper production. For instance the manganese deficiencies that occur in certain soils give you grey speck in oats and browning in potatoes, which result in a very low yield.  Again, beet growers know that a boron deficiency in the soil will give you trona, and calcium deficiency in the soil will result in blackleg.  Those are all trace deficiencies.  A stone and a half of borax to the acre will correct boron deficiency.  Mind you, you can have men labouring for years trying to produce a crop because they have not the technical knowledge necessary to make those small adjustments which mean all the difference between profit and loss.</P>
    <P>In a country like Denmark, one in every five of the population goes back to the land with modern ideas and methods, and has a profound influence on his neighbours.  It has not been found necessary in any country to provide each and every individual with a modern technical education.  If it were possible for even one in ten of the population here to have a proper technical education, I have no doubt that when those people went back to the land and applied modern technical methods, showing satisfactory financial results, their neighbours would immediately apply the same methods on their own farms.  That is what we should aim at so far as demonstration farms are concerned.  I think it is necessary to have ocular demonstration, showing the net result in pounds, shillings and pence.  The farmer is just an ordinary human being.  He lives in <Col N="2515" /> a mundane world.  He has to pay his bills and balance his accounts at the end of the year.  He has to try to put a little bit by to educate his family, and to have something for his old age. He must, therefore, be profoundly influenced by any demonstration which will show him conclusively that if he proceeds on certain lines he will reap financial benefit.  I have no doubt that the Committee on Post-War Planning in Agriculture will give a good deal of consideration to this problem of agricultural education, because, as I said before, it is the most important problem of all.  Our trouble here is that we have too many farmers getting mediocre results.  Of course, there are farmers in this country who have very little to learn.  They compare favourably with farmers in many other countries, but the trouble is that we still have a very high percentage of farmers getting mediocre results, and even indifferent to results.  Another characteristic of Irish farmers is that they lack ambition.  I will not go into the reasons for the lack of that ambition which is so essential to success.  I suppose it is all a matter of education.</P>
    <P>Whether the State is going to purchase demonstration farms, as suggested in this motion, and show how modern methods are to be applied, is a matter which requires very full and thorough investigation.  The Tennessee Valley authority, one of the finest authorities in the world, has made tremendous advances in educational matters, and in many fields of activity. The policy of the Tennessee Valley authority, so far as demonstration is concerned, is not to involve the State in any financial outlay at all, but merely to approach a particular farmer and ask him if he will work his farm according to a blueprint, under the supervision of an expert, and with a guarantee against any loss.  Having operated that farm for a period of years, and convinced the people of that locality that such a line of policy is the best line to pursue in their particular circumstances, they are free to shift around to some other farm.  Whether the practical demonstration here should be done by means <Col N="2516" /> of State-owned farms, or whether we should adopt the system which has been adopted with great success in the Tennessee Valley, is a matter which should be very fully investigated.  I am convinced that we want much more educational facilities for people who have to live by practical farming&mdash;not merely facilities for people who are prepared to go into residence and do a course in practical agriculture, but opportunities for day students as well. I think the Minister will agree that there will have to be far more facilities if we are to step up agricultural production.  All our social services have to be provided for out of the national income, and the industry which provides the bulk of the national income of this country is agriculture. If we want to provide a standard of living here which will compare favourably with that in other countries, we will have to put our backs into the job of expanding agricultural production by a very substantial amount.</P>
    <P>It is a mistake to divorce this question of demonstration from the whole big question of agricultural education and research, not merely soil research but animal research and the production of indigenous grasses and all that sort of thing.  There is a tremendous field there for exploration and development. Mind you, we would not be by any means pioneers in that respect; other countries are forging ahead and have met with considerable success.  No matter what the outlay may be&mdash;and it would mean a considerable financial outlay if we were to provide ample facilities for technical education and research&mdash;the money would be well spent, and would be repaid one hundred fold.  I am satisfied, and I think many other people are satisfied too, that a considerable expansion of our production is within our capacity here, and I believe that the starting point is agricultural education.  I think the system we have in operation at the present time is not meeting with success; we are not getting from the expenditure the value which we are entitled to expect.  I hope the committee the Minister has set up will give this matter a thorough examination and <Col N="2517" /> that the Minister in the near future will bring in a comprehensive measure so that we may be able to criticise it in a constructive way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>For a number of years some of us on these benches have been advocating the provision of a demonstration farm, something similar to what is now proposed in this motion. It is, to my mind, more necessary now when we are facing a crisis in our agricultural affairs, when none of us knows what the immediate future holds for the agricultural population, or what our position in the export or the home market will be.  We have in this country two or three experimental farms run by excellent, competent men.  We have also two or three scientists of very high status.  We are not as far short of a scientific approach to agricultural matters as some people would lead us to believe, but to my mind one ounce of practical farming is worth all the scientific and theoretical approach that one could expound in a month.</P>
      <P>I was interested some time ago in an article in a southern paper by a very competent writer on agricultural matters, a gentleman who has farmed extensively in this country for years and in another country for almost an equal number of years.  He approached the matter in a somewhat comical way. He said that in all the years of his experience he had been listening to practical people and scientific people preaching to the farmers of this country and other countries as to the methods they should adopt in running their business.  He said he had never seen a scientist, with one exception, with courage enough to put his scientific theories into practice.  The exception was a professor in a university in Western America.  This professor or scientist, taunted that it was easy enough to preach but much more difficult to practice, said that if he had the ways and means he would immediately put his theories into practice.  Some friends who had more worldly wealth than the scientist, came to his assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He resigned his professorship and took over a farm and worked it for five years and, as this writer says, all <Col N="2518" /> the farmers in the locality were very interested in the operations and spent their Sundays and half-holidays&mdash;if the farmers in America have such things; they have not in this country, anyhow &mdash;watching the work of this farmer-scientist. At the beginning everything appeared to be lovely.  After the first year it was not natural to expect results; after the second year there was not much of an advance, but really one could not expect any tangible results for at least four or five years.  Anyhow, at the end of the fifth year the farmer-scientist threw in his gun, so to speak.  He had spent all the money provided for him by his backers, but there were no great results.  He was glad to get back his professorship in his old university and to proceed along the scientific lines to which he was accustomed in other years.</P>
    <P>I am not saying this by way of being critical of the scientists of this or any other country.  I have as much faith in and respect for scientists as most people have, but I believe that practical demonstrations are more necessary in this than in any other country. We are a highly conservative people, probably the most conservative in the world at the moment.  We are liable to stick to the usages of generations&mdash; indeed, centuries.  We are more apt to stick in a rut than any other people and more difficult to move.  I rather resent the implication that the farmers in this country are not as capable, intelligent and hardworking as the farmers of other countries.  But, unfortunately, our farmers are rather sceptical of theories and of the advice of scientific lecturers and unless they can see things demonstrated in a practical way they will not be convinced.</P>
    <P>I am one of the people who have been anxious for a great number of years to have something done in this State to bring more immediately to the notice of the farmer the value of scientific teaching and the value of experiments made both here and in other places.  It is only in that way we will get down in practical fashion to increased production and a better quality in our produce.</P>
    <P>The Minister, it was reported in the <Col N="2519" /> Press yesterday, was talking in Limerick with the representatives of various southern committees of agriculture. I was particularly interested in the Minister's remarks, and I agree almost <i>in toto</i> with what he said. What the Minister is anxious to arrive at is the goal that most of us had in view for a great number of years, and which we are as far off reaching now as we were 25 years ago.  That is tantamount to saying that we are still 25 years off reaching anything like a satisfactory solution of the dairy problem, and I am going to stand on that.</P>
    <P>We have had in this country for years a system of cow-testing.  I am as strong an advocate of cow-testing as anyone.  Experiments have been made in many places.  We have attempted to bring the ordinary dairy farmers into the working of this cow-testing system.  Only a small percentage of them has consented to engage in cow-testing, and the reason is that we have not been able to demonstrate to them in a practical way that cow-testing offers them a particular financial advantage.  My district is not one that engages very intensively in cow-testing, but it is not more backward than any other district.  I venture to say, though perhaps it is not popular to say it, that not one of us could, with any degree of truth, say to our neighbours that our activities over ten, 15 or 20 years in cow-testing have given us any result beyond what the ordinary farmer who did not engage in those operations obtained.  There may be reasons for this that one cannot put in words.  Perhaps the great reason is, as I said on another occasion in this House, that cow-testing without a big credit behind it is useless.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the production issued lately by the planning committee on the dairy problem.  There has been some talk about good and bad counties in regard to farming at this time, but I was rather shocked&mdash; and, I must say, rather pleasurably shocked&mdash;to find that, according to the statistics in connection with the operations of cow-testing associations all over this country for many years past, there has been no advance in the production <Col N="2520" /> of dairy produce, except in the County of Limerick&mdash;the lazy county, as some people say, and the county where we could not do anything right. I was, as I say, pleasurably shocked or surprised to know that in our county we were producing from 30 to 50 per cent. more in milk, per cow, than in any other county in Ireland, notwithstanding the fact that in County Limerick only a small percentage of the farmers were taking part in the cow-testing scheme.  Of course, I realise that that might be due to the rich pasturage in Country Limerick, and that that might be a primary reason why milk production in that country should be higher than in other counties in Ireland, but I do not say that that is altogether the reason for it.</P>
    <P>I am going to make a statement now, and I am making it with all deliberation, in connection with this proposal of demonstration farms; and that is that I am not at all sure that we have not arrived at a stage when the shorthorn breed of cattle in this country is a decadent or a nondescript breed.  I suggest that that is a possible explanation as to why the milk or butter production in this country is not as good at the moment as it was in former years.  Of course, anybody who attends the show in Dublin each year will say that Deputy Bennett is talking trash; that he is talking through his hat, or does not know what he is talking about; but I think I am right. After all, the shorthorn breed has been in existence in this country for over 100 years&mdash;at least 125 years, and, probably, a century and a half.  Undoubtedly, it has produced excellent results in this country, but anybody of my age, or even of somewhat lesser age, can clearly remember the type of shorthorn cattle that were at the shows 20, 30 or 40 years ago, and I am sure that they cannot deny that the shorthorn beast of to-day is very different from the beast of 30 or 40 years ago. I am sure that people of experience will agree that the shorthorn cow, or the shorthorn bull, is not as good as the beast that was on offer 30 or 40 years ago.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I may say that I <Col N="2521" /> read a statement by the chairman of the Shorthorn Cattle Breeders' Association some months ago, and it appeared from that statement that he was perturbed at the scarcity of good shorthorn cattle in this country.  Now, I happen to be interested in this matter of dairy cattle in County Limerick.  I am acquainted with some of the best-known and largest buyers of shorthorn cattle in the country.  I remember an occasion when, 40 years ago, the Dwyers of Roscrea and the O'Connors of Charleville, between the two of them, would buy 1,000 of that type of cattle, of the best possible quality, at one fair.  I am sure that there are some Deputies here who would remember that: that these people could buy 1,000 head of the best of these yearlings in one day at one fair.  Now, I was speaking to one of these men recently, and he said that if he were to travel through all the fairs in Ireland for a month, he could not get anything like what he could get in one day at one fair 30 or 40 years ago.</P>

      <P>Is the Deputy suggesting that he can relate what he is saying to the question of a demonstration farm?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Sir; I am endeavouring to relate it, and do not be the least bid afraid that I shall not relate it.  I am afraid that the Ceann Comhairle has broken the thread of my argument, but he has not injured the real purpose of what I am saying. One thing that I would suggest is that any Deputy should go to the Cattle Market in Dublin on any Wednesday of the week if he wants to get practical and ostensible corroboration of every word I have said with regard to the dairy shorthorn breed.  I do not think you could find anywhere such a nondescript type of cattle. They are of all colours and makes. You cannot go into the market to buy these cattle without finding all types: one cow with a black nose, another with streaks of black in her hair, and another with streaks of white in her hair.  Now, the Minister must be aware of that, and I am sure he realises that there must be a solution. I think that the Dairy Shorthorn <Col N="2522" /> Breeders' Association have gone as far as they can to deal with the problem. I think they have gone as far as they can to bring about a proper shorthorn breed, but the foundation is not there.  In my opinion, it was a cursed day for this country when bulls of breeds such as the Polled-Angus, the Aberdeen-Angus and the Hereford were allowed to come in here to mix up with the dairying breeds.  That was a bad thing, and I think it is time that we should get a solution for it, and I hope that when the Minister comes to deal with the matter before the House to-day he will agree to do something such as has been suggested by Deputy Hughes, and that if it is possible to set up a demonstration farm in this country, where operations could be carried on in a way that would be economical for the ordinary farmer, the Minister might adopt Deputy Hughes's suggestion and give to selected farmers, here and there, the opportunity of working on such a farm under the guidance of the best brains of agricultural scientists&mdash; people who, themselves, have experimented and worked a farm on that particular line, and who have had experience of keeping accounts of production on such a farm.  That is the only way in which you will convince the conservatively-minded people of this country that there is anything tangibly good about modern methods of producing agricultural goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to preserve shorthorn cattle we should pick out the best strain.  I make these remarks in the hope that some action will be taken before that breed becomes a more nondescript type.  I anticipate that it would take from 20 to 25 years before the breed would be anything like what it was in the past.  On these demonstration farms only the best shorthorn heifers and bulls should be kept.  It would also be necessary to undertake cow-testing so that neighbouring farmers would be impressed by the fact that such a policy was sound.  Proof should be forthcoming, whether in dairying or in any other line, to show that production can be increased and that it is vital in the interests of the State to do so.  It is all right to say <Col N="2523" /> that production can be increased, but the question is: can it done so economically?  In the case of a 500-gallon cow, it is not possible to increase the yield to 570 gallons within a year.  The ordinary farmer wants to know if he can economically produce the extra gallons.  When he attempts to get an extra 78 or 100 gallons he generally finds it is not worth the extra expenditure that he has to incur.  The contrary must be demonstrated to farmers, but not by experiments of which they know nothing.  The same thing will apply to the production of beef.  A heifer or bullock could be kept without any great expenditure in the stall or on a good grass farm until it reached 75 per cent. of being finished.  Farmers are &ldquo;up against it&rdquo; when they want to get the extra 25 per cent.  It is the same with regard to pig feeding.  It is the last ounce of production that counts and that is expensive.  The crux in agriculture is the getting of extra production economically.  Until we can convince farmers that the extra 25 per cent. can, with effort, be got economically, and that those who experiment can prove that, we will not be able to get much further.</P>
    <P>Farmers, like other Irishmen, are highly conservative and need to be convinced before they will depart from the practices carried out by their fathers and grandfathers.  They need every inducement before they can get out of the rut to which they have become accustomed.  All the teachings of scientists about the value of experimental stations are not going to produce results, until it can be practically demonstrated that reforms can be brought about in agricultural methods. There is certainly room for development in tillage, butter and milk producing areas.  We shall have an opportunity at an early date of having a debate on the general agricultural policy.  I should like to stress the importance of the motion before the House urging the setting up of some sort of demonstration farms or, as Deputy Hughes suggested, giving a guarantee to certain farmers in various localities that if they work their holdings <Col N="2524" /> on lines proposed by the Minister's advisers, they will be at no loss. If land is worked on modern scientific lines, I believe we could get Irish farmers to adopt such methods; otherwise I do not believe there is any hope of success.</P>

      <P>I am not in agreement with Deputies who ask that institutions should be set up to show farmers how to carry on farming, especially in a county like Wexford which the Minister and I have the privilege of representing. To do so would be to suggest that farmers do not know how to work their land, and that they can be shown how to do so by people in colleges or by books.  County Wexford is the leading county for farming.  If other counties take example from the way Wexford farmers work, it will be a lesson for them without the necessity of setting up demonstration farms.  I do not believe in that proposal at all. Farmers complain that they are interfered with by the Department as to the way in which they are to work land.  Consider the position of the farm labourer who works as a ploughman or at any other skilled work on the land.  Very few of the owners of farms plough.  They engage men to do that work, and for skilled work of that kind, the ploughman gets the lowest wages paid in any calling in this State, a miserable £2 a week.  We are told what ought to be done, but what the Minister ought to do is to control the price of beef and mutton.  There will then be a better market for that beef and mutton because people will be able to buy more and probably the farmers will get a better price for their cattle than they are getting to-day.  I ask the Minister why he made the statement that the farm labourer's wages would not be increased this year.</P>

Land in County Wexford at present is fetching a great price and there is keen competition between farmers when land is put up for sale, so that the farmers are not losing everything.  I am very glad to learn that County Wexford is to be given the honour of having this college.  It is the first thing the county has got from the agricultural point of view.

      <P>Deputy Hughes said that, in all probability, the Committee on Post-War Agricultural Planning would consider this question.  I believe it is one of the questions that committee will consider. They have undertaken to present a report on agricultural education in general and I know that this question of State farms, colleges and demonstration farms will be considered by it.  I do not know what view the committee will take, but as they may present a report on the question, in which case I would be expected to have an open mind, Deputies perhaps will understand my difficulty if I do not come down on one side or the other.  I am naturally anxious to give the points for and against.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With one argument put forward by a number of Deputies, I agree; that is, that, over the years, we have spent a good deal of time in the colleges and institutions on establishing certain facts.  That knowledge is there, but it is not possible in many cases to get it down to the farmer.  The difficulty has always existed, and I have recognised it, of getting the farmer to realise certain facts well known to agricultural experts and scientists.  I think, however, that there is an improvement in that respect.  As the years go on a bigger number of the younger men are attending the winter classes.  The number who go to the agricultural colleges is comparatively small, but a larger number are certainly attending the winter classes, and these boys are becoming interested in trying to find out facts for themselves.  There is a very marked increase in the demand for the leaflets issued by the Department, which goes to show that the rising generation of farmers and farmers' wives are more interested in matters of this kind.  It is a very slow process.  The increase in the dissemination of knowledge of that kind over the last 40 years is not <Col N="2527" /> phenomenal and it will be many more years before the farmers will have reached the standard of education which would be useful and which one would like to see them have.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Hughes on another point: that we must not come to the conclusion that the Irish farmer is worse than the farmer of other countries in that respect.  We have, as Deputy Hughes said, some farmers who are as good as any in the world, and, on the whole, I think that the general body of farmers here would probably compare fairly favourably with the general body of farmers in most other countries.  I spent holidays in at least two of the Continental countries in the last 12 years, and I made whatever observations I could amongst the ordinary farmers, and I do not think they were a bit better than ours.  In fact, if we sent across an ordinary Irish farmer to see how they do things, he would be inclined to say that he had nothing to learn there. That does not mean, however, that we should not try to improve things.  We certainly should, so far as we can.</P>
    <P>I am not quite sure as to what exactly Deputy Cogan advocates.  One could regard his proposal as a proposal for absolute State farms&mdash;the Department of Agriculture, on behalf of the State, purchasing a farm and equipping and stocking it, and, as I take it Deputy Cogan would say, keeping accounts so that those running it could see that on the running of the farm they were getting 5 per cent. on their capital, because if an ordinary man bought a farm and stocked it, he would have to pay 5 per cent. to the bank.  I take it we would then go ahead with the appointment of a manager and tell him to farm on proper lines and get him to keep accounts.</P>
    <P>Whether that is what is visualised or not, I do not know, but there is also the method of getting it done by the county committee of agriculture.  If it has to be done, it would be easier to do it in that way, because the officers of the committee are available. They have a knowledge of agriculture <Col N="2528" /> and they have local knowledge.  They know more about local opinion on agriculture and the type of agriculture being carried out locally than others and they see what mistakes, in their view, are being made by the farmers locally.  There might be an advantage in putting these farms under the control of the local authority rather than under that of the central authority, but whether it should be done at all is another matter.</P>
    <P>I saw a review&mdash;it was prepared for the Committee on Post-War Agricultural Planning by my Department&mdash;of the trend of agricultural education in other countries.  I notice that this system of model farms is being departed from.  Evidently they did not find that they were completely successful in Continental countries and they are moving towards what they call the &ldquo;travelling school.&rdquo;  That would correspond, more or less, with our winter classes.  An intinerant instructor goes to a certain centre and holds a school there for a certain time for farmers' sons.  In most cases, I think that the instructors bring them out to the farms around and demonstrate what they teach in the lecture room.  After six weeks or two months they pass on to another centre and give a similar course.  They found it necessary in those Continental countries to bring instruction to the door of the farmer.  The farmer was not inclined to go to the model farm even when it was within a short distance. That point regarding model farms will be taken into consideration by the post-war agricultural committee.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan made the case, more or less&mdash;I do not want to wrong him because there is a &ldquo;for&rdquo; and an &ldquo;against&rdquo; in all these questions&mdash;that unless I could turn down the idea, the Dáil should accept it.  I do not think that Deputy Cogan gave very strong reasons for the adoption of his proposal. He did not argue very much on the positive side.  He put it up to me to argue against it and said that there was only one ground on which I could reject it &mdash;fear that it might not pay.  I should not be afraid of that.  I do not think <Col N="2529" /> that it would be very difficult to make a farm pay at present.  The great majority of farmers are, I think, making their farms pay.  As a Deputy said here last night, any farm that is put up for sale fetches £30, £50, £70, or even as high as £100 an acre.  In many parts, land for conacre&mdash;grazing, meadowing or tillage&mdash;is let at from £5 to £14 an acre.  If competition amongst farmers is so keen that they pay such a high price for land, when sold, or so high a rent for conacre, it is fairly obvious that farming is paying. I should have no great fear that it would be impossible to make those farms pay at the moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan went on to say that, if I were afraid the farms would not pay, it proved either that the Department was incompetent in the management of farms or that the margin of profit was so small that it might not be possible to make anything out of them. That is a point on which I should like the members of Clann na Talmhan to give me information.  I should like Deputy Cogan and Deputy Blowick to tell me and the Dáil whether or not they can make their farms pay.  I think that they are evading that question.  I imagine that, if I were ever to have the ambition to stand as a farmers' candidate, the first thing I should say to farmers, in appealing for their votes, would be: &ldquo;I am a farmer and I am able to make my farm pay.  I am a competent and efficient farmer and the man for whom you should vote&rdquo;. Clann na Talmhan do not believe in that and they give the impression that it is impossible at present to make farming pay.  I may be doing them an injustice.  If I am, I should like them to take advantage of the occasion to tell me that I am wrong, that they are able to make their farms pay but that they would like the farmers to be better treated.  I agree with Deputy Cogan that it is the duty of a farmer to get the maximum amount out of his land and that it is the duty of the State to see that he gets a fair return for his labour and produce.  That is the basis on which we have regulated beet prices, wheat prices and other prices fixed during the emergency or regulated in some way before the emergency. <Col N="2530" /> But I should like to assure Deputy Cogan that we did not proceed on the basis of maximum output. Again, I may say that, if I were leader of a farmers' Party, I should not like to advocate the fixing of prices on the basis of maximum output.  Only a percentage of the farming community could reach the figure which would be fixed in that way.  Only a percentage could make their farms pay.  We must be somewhat more lenient to the farmers and we must not base our prices on maximum output.  We must assume that the great majority are not able to get the maximum output but only a fair output.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan wants demonstration farms established to show farmers, in the first place, how to improve their methods and, secondly, to ascertain the costings of farming.  I admit that costings would be very useful.  Deputy Cogan said that the Department of Agriculture decided about 20 years ago that it was unwise to continue the collection of costings because the costings were, more or less, going against them in the Department.  My predecessor continued that scheme for collecting costings for many years after coming into office, and he and I pressed very hard for a costings section of the Department.  The Minister for Finance would not agree; he could not afford to pay the necessary staff.  Since the emergency, we dropped that question because there would be no use in building up such an organisation under the present abnormal conditions.  When the war is over, I think that it will be necessary to have some organisation of that type.  I have expressed the view elsewhere in public&mdash;I do not see why I should not express it here&mdash;that I should like, from a personal standpoint, to see some outside authority set up to fix and regulate the prices of agricultural produce when the war is over, because it is very difficult for a Minister or for the Government to do that.  If some effective authority could be set up&mdash;it would not be easy to get an authority which would do it &mdash;that would hear the farmers' case and the consumers' case and fix or regulate the prices impartially, we <Col N="2531" /> would be better off all round than we are under the present system.  That would, of course, necessitate the keeping of costings.</P>
    <P>To revert for a moment to the question of the model farm; if a model farm were being set up, it would, probably, be well to have it under the local authority.  If the post-war agricultural committee advise that it is not wise to go ahead with this question of model farms, then we could go back to a modified form of the scheme of costings which operated before 1923 or 1924.  At that time there was a number of farmers who kept accounts.  Books, which were drawn up in a certain way, were supplied to them.  The farmers made entries of certain information that they were asked to supply with regard to their farming activities.  At the end of the year the books were examined by competent officers, and costings were made out fairly scientifically from the returns furnished.  I think that system could be revived and, perhaps, even amplified or improved to the extent, perhaps, of getting a number of individual farmers in each county who would leave their affairs open to scrutiny by some officials of the local committee of agriculture in consideration, of course, of some slight payment to the farmer for doing that, because there would be a certain amount of trouble in keeping the accounts up to date.  The point that I want to get at is this: that we can get over the question of costings without model farms. We can get them almost as efficiently done.  I think that, on the whole, they would be just as reliable.</P>
    <P>There are, undoubtedly, advantages to be got from a model farm in the way of demonstrating how things might be done, but then these advantages are not there unless farmers go and see what is being done.  The experience of Continental countries would appear to be to the effect that knowledge has to be brought to the doors of the farmers rather than that farmers should go and look for it.  You will always have in every county a small percentage of farmers who will go a long way looking for knowledge.  We all know of such <Col N="2532" /> men.  If they hear, for instance, of demonstration plots of wheat they will go a certain distance to have a look at them, and will make inquiries as to how the wheat was sown, manured and so on.  If they hear of a model cow house being built, they will go and see it to try to find out if they can improve their own cow houses.  You will find farmers who will do that, but on the other hand you will find many who will not do it.  It is the latter type that you want to convince because they are so sceptical about the whole thing.  If you have a model farm and try to prove to them by every way possible, by books and everything else, that the model farm is paying, their comment will be: &ldquo;It is easy to make a farm like that pay with the whole State behind it&rdquo;.  But suppose you have a failure with a crop of potatoes or a crop of turnips on that model farm they will say: &ldquo;How could we make farming pay when the Department of Agriculture cannot make this model farm pay?&rdquo;  You will have that disadvantage in the case of the very people to whose notice you want to bring knowledge.</P>
    <P>Again, it is not so easy to get the same efficiency or, let us say, the same hard work on a model farm as you will get on a farm owned by a man himself. If, say, there is a 100-acre farm you will first of all have to appoint a manager.  I suppose Deputies will agree that a 100-acre farm could not pay a very high salary to a manager.  Let us say that he is paid £4 or £5 a week.  He will have to employ three, four or five men. The manager is getting a salary, and will be inclined to go away a few evenings a week to enjoy himself.  He will want to go away on Sundays.  He will not be like the owner of a farm. In the case of the owner of a farm, if there is something essential or extra to be done in the evening, or if there is some animal to be watched on a Sunday, he will stay at home, but the manager may not stay.  I am not saying that employees are not very good in their own way, but the point is that they have not the same inducement to stay and watch things as an owner has.  In that way, you might not get the same efficiency on a farm of <Col N="2533" /> that kind as you would get in the case of a privately-owned farm.  Another thing is that the manager must be, more or less, at the disposal of visitors, since the object of the model farm is that farmers can come there and have a look at things and see how they are being done.  That cannot be done unless there is someone to show them around, to show them how the crops are sown, manured and so on. Therefore, the manager must be, to a great extent, at the disposal of callers. When you take that into account, he cannot give his whole time to the management of the farm.  These are points that must be kept in mind.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell told us that for some years he kept accounts on his own farm but that he gave it up because they almost drove him daft. I suppose a man's own accounts sometimes do have a disturbing effect on him.  The Deputy seemed to be under the impression that the Agricultural Wages Board fixes certain hours.  They do not.  They fix a certain wages against a certain number of hours, but there is nothing to prevent an employee agreeing with a farmer to work 12 hours a day, if he likes.  There is nothing to prevent a farmer making an agreement with his employees to have his cows milked at much more even intervals than the 15 hours, and nine hours mentioned by Deputy O'Donnell.</P>
    <P>Deputy Giles started his speech by saying that the farmers know their own business best.  I do not altogether agree with that.  I do not think there is any body of men, whether farmers, business men, tradesmen or any other class, who are so knowledgeable that they cannot learn more, and if we can teach farmers some little more it is all to the good.  As a matter of fact, what you will find is that it is the best farmers who are anxious to learn.  They are the men who will be anxious to go to a model farm to see if they can learn a little more.  What Deputy Giles said later is probably true, that a lot could be done to help farmers in the way of co-operation and so on.</P>
    <P>With regard to another point that was made, I do not think it is possible to say that one part of the country is <Col N="2534" /> dairying, another part tillage and another part suitable for grazing or store cattle.  We have not any such uniformity here.  Take any county that you may go into, in a few parishes you may have a good deal of grazing, in other parishes you may have very intensive tillage, while in other parts you may have as intensive dairying as they have in the County Limerick.  Some other Deputies said that probably the best system of farming was to try to do mixed farming as far as possible: that is to say that every farmer should try to do a bit of tillage to provide for his own stock, that he should try to do some dairying by keeping some dairy cows to supply the country with dairy products, and have other farmers with the minimum amount of land for grazing. Deputy Hughes agrees, I think, with that because he talked about a balanced agriculture being the best system.  I take it he meant by that that we should have no such thing as one line agriculture.  I think it is wise that there should be no such thing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes spoke about the stagnation of production.  Unfortunately, there has been very little change for many years in production here.  There has been very little change in the number of cattle and there has been very little change, compartively speaking, in the output from tillage.  There has been, of course, a substantial increase during the emergency, but, taking the position over the last 30 or 40 years, there has been no great change in the amount of land under tillage or in the number of cattle.  Apart from some reduction in the number of pigs, due to the emergency, there has been no great change.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes wants to know if anything is being done, as far as this post-war agricultural committee is concerned, regarding this matter.  I think it will be a very big problem for them, naturally, as to what recommendation they are going to make for future production&mdash;whether we should continue as we are or change our system slightly by giving it a bent in some other direction.  I do not see that the committee can hold out any other objective but the future production <Col N="2535" /> policy of the country, whatever that may be.  I am quite sure that the committee will give practically all its attention to the question of production and what the future trend of production should be.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes spoke of the travelling instructors and I have already dealt with that point by saying that, on the whole, I think they are on the right lines at present.  I do not want any Deputy to say that I am complacent or satisfied with the present system&mdash;I am not&mdash;but I say that, possibly and probably, our present line with regard to this aspect of education here is about the best one.  We have the local technical staff, who go around more or less demonstrating for the farmers by means of demonstration plots showing what should be done, and who help the farmers sons by teaching them in winter classes, and so on; and that is probably just as sound as the demonstration farm idea.  It may be that, if we were to elaborate and extend the present system a bit, we might be doing more than we would by turning to this idea of a model farm.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bennett talked about the necessity for disseminating knowledge to the dairy farmers, as to how they could improve their output and he spoke about cow-testing.  As he says, it is very extraordinary that the number of farmers who undertake to test their cows has not gone up.  There are undoubted advantages in cow-testing: in fact, if any Deputy looks at the figures, he will find that the average yield per cow of all the cows under bodies having their cows under test, is a good deal higher than the average yield of all cows in the country.  So it is evident that it has done something to improve the milk yield.  Deputy Bennett says that, of course, it is not much use to a man, unless he can afford to get rid of the bad cow and get a good one.  I think any farmer who is doing cow-testing, if he has a bad cow, will get rid of it.  He may have to wait a year or two and take on a heifer in its place; but in that way he will gradually improve the average milk yield.  A man who is not testing very often does not know he <Col N="2536" /> has a bad cow and may often be deceived&mdash;as those who are doing cow-testing know&mdash;by a big flush of milk in the beginning, whereas when the cow goes into a milk test, it is found to be not nearly as good as it was thought to be.  In fact, the cow which is not milking well in the beginning, but is a good stayer, is more profitable to keep, as it gives the better yield in the end.  The man who is not doing cow-testing does not know that and, therefore, may be inclined to breed from the wrong cow.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bennett also referred to what is being done in the County Limerick and said that if you take all the cows in the County Limerick they have a better average yield than the cows in the rest of the country.  I believe that is a well-known and well-established fact, statistically, at any rate.  He says that that is true, even though cow-testing is done only to the extent of 4 per cent. in that county. I think that 4 per cent. is the figure for the whole country also, so evidently the farmers in County Limerick are up to the average in the matter of cow-testing, as compared with the rest of the country.  I do not think we can come to any conclusion on that fact, which was given to us by Deputy Bennett.  We cannot conclude from it that cow-testing is not doing any good, neither can it prove that cow-testing is doing a whole lot of good. However, we may leave that aside for the present.</P>
    <P>The last point Deputy Bennett made was with regard to breeding.  He said he thought the shorthorn was decadent or nondescript.  There is a very well-known institution in County Limerick where they go to a lot of trouble on this point&mdash;I have not the authority of the principal to quote it, although I do not think he will object &mdash;and where they have a heard of shorthorns and a herd of Holsteins; and the average yield from the shorthorns is just as good as that from the Holsteins.  Deputies will agree that, if the shorthorn is as good for milk as the Holstein, we should stick to them, because from the shorthorns we have very much better type of store.</P>

      <P>No, he is keeping them apart.  As I said in the beginning, I do not want to come down on either side in regard to this motion.  I do not see a whole lot of advantage to be derived from either side.  I can see some advantage, but not a whole lot, and I think there may even be some slight disadvantages from setting them up.  But neither do I want to prejudice my own mind on this question, as I know that this committee is considering the matter of model farms, State farms, and so on.  I do not know what the report may be, but whatever it may be, I would like to keep an open mind on the matter, at least until the committee has reported.  Perhaps, if Deputies would take the same line, it would be well&mdash;that is, if they would leave this matter over until we see the report.  I am not saying I would agree with the report, or that Deputies would agree with it.  I cannot say, so far as I am concerned, so it would mean I would have to vote against this motion, if there is a division, as I do not want to be committed one way or the other until we see the report of the committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I only wish to make a small point.  I am sorry the Minister could not decide now, as I think the motion before the House is a very reasonable one.  He must admit the usefulness of the first part of the motion.  Suppose we forget about the latter part, where there may be a bit of tautology.  Surely the Minister could have no difficulty in agreeing to the latter part, that is, the establishing of demonstration farms in various counties, which would be typical of the localities in which they are situate. They would be for the purpose of educating the farmers and showing better and improved methods, and also for imparting knowledge about improved <Col N="2538" /> types of seed, and so on&mdash; knowledge which is very necessary at present.</P>
      <P>I shall be as brief as I possibly can. The Minister must be well aware that in many parts of the country, particularly in the west, there are a few farmers in each locality who are doing pioneer work in this matter themselves but before they reach even a fair stage of perfection they have to incur a good deal of personal loss.  I myself have had experience of that.  The Minister has stated that, on the other hand, only a few farmers will go to seek this knowledge if it is made available.  That is not the case to my knowledge.  The vast majority of farmers are anxious to acquire a knowledge of the most efficient and modern methods of farming. They like to see the differences between various breeds of stock and between different types of seeds, etc., demonstrated.  Even a few small holdings in each county would be sufficient for this purpose and there should be no difficulty in picking them up at the moment because there are unfortunately plenty derelict holdings all over the country.  Even if they had to be run at a loss to demonstrate the most up-to-date methods of farming it would be a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>The motive that actuated the tabling of this motion was that in many cases, as the Minister admitted, farmers will not attend lectures given by agricultural instructors on week-nights in schools.  Some of them may go there and pick up a certain amount of knowledge but by the time they have a chance of applying that knowledge to practical work they have forgotten all about it.  In my opinion there could be no better instruction than the ocular instruction afforded by demonstration farms which they could visit on a Sunday or any other free day which they had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Moran and Deputy O'Leary spoke of the fact that land was fetching such a high price at the moment as an indication that there was prosperity amongst farmers.  In my opinion that is no line to go by.  In my part of the country I admit that land is going at an exorbitant price, a price in most cases out of all proportion <Col N="2539" /> to the value of the land or the living that can be made on it.  What is the explanation of that?  It is that many young people reared in farmhouses migrate to England or America and earn there sufficient money to buy a small holding.  When they come home and a holding of land which is near their old home, adjacent to old friends and associations, is offered for sale, they plunge in and drive up the price.  As I say, the fact that such holdings are going high prices is no indication of the kind of living which can be made subsequently on land of that kind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moran later on suggested that this motion advocated the taking over of a number of farms and staffing them with a host of officials.  We do not agree with that at all; we are utterly opposed to it and that is not what is behind the motion.  The motion is aimed at establishing demonstration farms which would carry out a certain amount of educational effort in various districts.  Deputy O'Leary painted a desperate picture of farms in County Wexford.  In one breath he said that it was a model county and in the next he said that there was no farmer there who could plough.  At the same time he advocated gathering all the farmers of Ireland, 240,000 of them, into County Wexford.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of correction, I think the Deputy misunderstood me.  What I said was that the majority of the farmers in this House do not plough; they always employ a ploughman.  We have the champion ploughman of Ireland in County Wexford and I asked farmers from the other counties to go down there to that model county to get some instruction in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Where would the 240,000 farmers from the rest of Ireland be accommodated in Wexford?  Every house in the county would have to be turned into a boardinghouse or an hotel and the fortunes of the owners would be assured.  The picture which the Deputy has painted is the funniest I have heard of for quite a while.  I am sorry that the Minister cannot <Col N="2540" /> adopt the first part of the motion even if he were to disregard the latter portion. It would do a tremendous amount of good if he could establish farms just for the purpose of demonstrating improved methods of cultivation, cattle rearing, etc.  Farmers generally are anxious to improve their methods and are desirous of knowing all about the most up-to-date types of farming.  Deputy Giles, Deputy O'Leary and several other Deputies would have us believe that the farmers already know the last word about farming. That is an idiotic statement because new ideas in farming, as in every other form of activity, are constantly being evolved and the farmer who falls behind while agriculturists generally are making progress, is going to lose. I am sorry the Minister could not decide to set up a number of these farms for instruction purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has put the House rather in a difficulty by not being able to make up his mind as to whether he should accept the proposal contained in the motion.  Whatever the Minister may decide to do, I think at least Deputies are capable of making up their minds and I am asking Deputies freely and independently to make up their minds to accept the motion.  The Minister has said that the commission of inquiry into post-war agriculture is considering this question.  I am very glad that they are and I think it might be helpful to that commission if we were to give them a definite lead in the matter. If we were to leave the matter to them they would probably misunderstand our action and think that we were unable to decide in favour of the motion or that it was not as good as we claimed it to be.  I think that the House, therefore, should make up its mind definitely to accept the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has dealt at considerable length with the various points raised in support of the motion.  He has admitted right away that there is a certain difficulty in getting advanced agricultural knowledge across to every individual farmer.  Everyone will appreciate that difficulty.  It is not due to any lack of brain-power, initiative or <Col N="2541" /> any lack of desire for knowledge on the part of the farmer.  It is more or less inherent in the system under which the farmer works.  Each farmer works his own farm isolated to a great extent from his neighbours&mdash;isolated, at least, to a greater extent than people engaged in industry and commerce who are freely associated with one another.  Therefore, individualism is naturally implied in farming and that creates certain difficulties.  We know that there are progressive farmers, we know that the average farmer is progressive, but nobody should set any limit to the onward march of the farmer in the pursuit of knowledge of more advanced and scientific farming methods.  Deputy O'Leary would set such a limit as far as the farmers in Wexford are concerned but I do not think that the farmers of Wexford will accept that limit.  I think the farmers in Wexford would be ready and willing to avail of any opportunity to advance in the knowledge of the industry in which they are engaged.  I have personal experience of the fact that a farm has been established on the border between Wexford and Wicklow to demonstrate the advantages of the new system of ley-farming.  That farm has been established by a distinguished foreign gentleman who has at his disposal the highest expert advice.  I think even in the district where that farm has been established a very keen interest has been taken in the experiments carried out there.  There may be some people in the locality who may ridicule the idea but average prudent farmers are definitely not committing themselves for or against it but are watching the experiment very closely. I believe that that gentleman is doing a very considerable service by the experiments he is carrying out.</P>
    <P>The Minister asked what system exactly of demonstration farms we desire.  We are not definitely tied to any particular system or to the details of any scheme that may be put in operation.  We think that whatever would be found to be the most efficient and fair system should be adopted.  I do not think that a system of having accounts kept on farms, as was operated in the last war, is a good <Col N="2542" /> approach to this problem.  In the first place, the Department would not have the real effective control over those farms which it would have over a farm in its possession.  Then there are human factors to be taken into consideration. A farmer may decide to discontinue keeping accounts, or he may not keep the accounts exactly as the Department desires them to be kept, and that would not make for a proper accounting system which would be of advantage either to the Department or to the community.  I think the Department must either lease, on a long-term basis, or purchase farms and operate them according to its own ideas as to how they should be operated.</P>
    <P>There is no question of these farms being an infringement of the rights of private property.  There are 240,000 individual farmers in this country and it is only proposed to set up about 100 demonstration farms at the outset. That would not interfere in any way with the rights of private property.  On the other hand, I think it would more or less strengthen the rights of private property, because it would be a demonstration on the part of the State of the most efficient way to run farms.  In that way it would help farmers to run their farms.  It would also discover for the Department and for the producer and the consumer what are the costings in the industry, thereby enabling prices to be fixed and ensuring that the owner of a farm could keep on his business.</P>
    <P>The Minister has more or less flung down a challenge to Deputies to say whether their farms are paying or not. I should like to ask the Minister this question.  Suppose we had demonstration farms, such as are outlined in this motion, for the past 12 years since the Minister took office, does he think that generally those farms would have paid? Does he think that, in an industry in which there are over 600,000 people employed and the total net income of which was less than £40,000,000 per year, or about £1 per worker in the industry, a profit could have been made out of farms operated by the Department and paying a proper legal wage?  He knows well that there would <Col N="2543" /> have been a dead loss over that period of years.  But he may ask and I think some Deputy did ask, how was it that the farming community survived through all these years; how is it that farming is still going on, in spite of the fact that we claim that agriculture has not been paying for a considerable number of years?  Agriculture has been carried on simply through the work contributed by unpaid workers on the farms.  In the first place, we know that agricultural wages were very low during the inter-war period; they were as low almost as £1 per week. But that was not all.  A very large percentage of those who worked on farms during those 20 years were unpaid members of the farmer's own family, brothers, sisters, sons and daughters.  These were the people who made up for the deficiency in profits in agriculture; who made up for the fact that there was no margin of profit in agriculture.  By their unpaid labour they enabled the work to continue.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that I have not time to deal with all the points raised by various speakers.  I am glad, at any rate, that the Minister has accepted the two fundamental principles which I outlined in introducing the motion, namely, that it is the duty of the farmer to work his farm to the best possible advantage, to work it as efficiently as possible, and to get the maximum output out of the farm without lowering its fertility.  On the other hand, it is the duty of the State to see that the farmer gets a fair return for his work, and that he is in a position not only to pay a reasonable wage to his regular employees, but to make a fair return to his family for their work.  These are the two fundamental principles on which agricultural policy must be based, and there is no means by which those principles can be embodied in agricultural policy unless the State is prepared to engage in the work of farming on the same terms as the ordinary farmer, as implied in this motion.</P>
    <P>How can any Government Department fix a fair price for agricultural <Col N="2544" /> produce unless they know exactly what it costs to run a farm?  You cannot find that out by piecemeal demonstrations in regard to certain crops.  You cannot find it out by juggling with figures on paper.  You have to engage in the actual work on a farm in order to find out what the costings are.  It is not possible to ascertain the actual costings by operating one or two farms, which, as Deputy Hughes pointed out, might not be typical of agricultural conditions all over the country.  This motion advocates that we should have farms set up in districts of varying agricultural conditions, varying soil fertility, and that there should be farms of varying sizes.  Thus we would have all types of farms, and the Department of Agriculture would be able to see then what profits were being made under all these varying conditions.  An English Minister of Agriculture some years ago put on record this view in regard to agriculture: &ldquo;Farming, though perhaps the slowest, is certainly the surest way of losing money.&rdquo; That was a statement made by a Minister who was in control of agriculture in one of the most progressive agricultural countries in the world.</P>

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business. - Housing of Dublin Workers&mdash;Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. H.M. Dockrell Mr. H.M. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the honour to propose the following resolution:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that the provision of 20,000 more working-class dwellings for Dublin is a major post-war problem, and that the failure of the Government to announce its decisions with regard to some of the aspects of this question is holding back the plans of other Parties who must necessarily share in the solution of this vexed problem, and accordingly asks the Government to make an immediate pronouncement in the matter.</P>
      <P>I am quite sure the Government are just as anxious as we are to solve the housing problem.  My contention is that they have not given enough consideration to a very complicated question. The Dublin housing problem is a very old one.  It has many facets.  It is intimately linked up with the twin problem of unemployment, and it has been a major problem in this country for three generations.  Why is there any housing problem?  Dublin started in early times as a desirable military position.  The angle caused by the junction of two rivers, and, more desirable still, high ground in between, made a site which was eminently suitable for military operations in olden times.  The Danes were probably the first to seize this advantageous position.  Coming down to the Middle Ages, Dublin was a walled city, and, when those walls were done away with, the city boundaries were just as constricting.  As an instance of this influence as between Dublin, an old city, and say, Belfast which is a modern one, in the early part of the present century many people started businesses in the latter place, due to a wider choice of location and facilities.  This, of necessity, had its attendant repercussions on employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2547" /> Many mistakes have been made in housing.  It used to be the aim of most of the city corporators to get a building scheme promoted in their particular ward.  Before the boundaries were extended, the corporation objected to promoting housing projects on which Pembroke and Rathmines would draw the rates.  Another aspect on which there has been much muddled thinking is where the houses are to be built.  This House has heard of the man who works on the docks and lives in Rathmines, but what about the man who works in Rathmines and lives on the docks?  If there were a free market and an ample supply, those people could change their houses and get near their work.  I remember some years ago hearing of the case of a bus driver who lived in Kill o' the Grange, and sometimes had to leave the last bus into the garage at Donnybrook. When he had left the last bus into the garage he had to walk home to Kill o' the Grange, taking his chance of getting an odd lift from a motorist.  Who will deny that manufacturing firms, and especially wholesale ones, are moving out of the city to sites with good roads and sewers, and with gas and water laid on?  Is industry to have the centre of the city, and the workers the outside, or are the workers to have the centre of the city and industry the outside?</P>
    <P>The 1926 Census showed that in the present city area there were 26,000 families each living in one room, made up of 15,000 families of three persons and over, 6,000 families of two persons, and 5,000 families of one person. Nearly 2,000 insanitary basement dwellings are occupied, as well as a large number of condemned habitations.</P>
    <P>Of the candidates for houses, the people from unsound and insanitary dwellings and people suffering from serious diseases have first call on the supply of houses.  There is also the normal increase in Dublin's working-class population.  Newly-weds have to compete for houses and the chance arrivals from the country swell the number of <Col N="2548" /> candidates for corporation houses.  Is it any wonder that the ordinary claimant for a corporation house has lost heart?</P>
    <P>The high-water mark of building was 2,000 working-class houses per year. The Minister for Local Government told us there were 4,000 sites planned. After the first two years in the post-war period we will probably come to a standstill.  How long ago was the clearance of the Whitefriars Street area started?  I suggest it is coming close to seven years.  If 20,000 sites were planned it would change the face of the city and one would get an idea of the extent of the problem.  The Government have elbowed everybody else off the job and I submit they have considered only one facet of the question. They said they were doing their best, and possibly they were doing their best according to their lights. They said no one else could do more and they stopped at that.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects of the matter not touched by the Government. There are many people living in working-class dwellings who could pay for a house for themselves.  Look at the number built under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  Many of the purchasers under these grants were potential competitors for a worker's house.  Belfast has made substantial progress by giving a free grant of £100 to anyone who built a house to Government specification, and £100 at a very low interest.  Private interests have built or taken up many of those houses. For the last 11 years the output of houses has been:&mdash;Dublin, urban and rural, by the local authorities, 14,000; private persons, 8,000; public utility societies, 2,000, making a total of 24,500.  I have altered the figures slightly so as to make them a little bit plainer.</P>
    <P>If one allows for the war, will this rate of progress solve anything?  The corporation are doing their best, but the Government will have to approach the problem from several angles.  Many more sites than at present envisaged will have to be provided.  Anyone who can pay for a working-class dwelling should be given one, and let him go out of the crowd.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2549" /> I suggest that these figures, though they are very rough and ready, are more or less true about schemes in the centre of the city.  It takes a year to plan a housing scheme, a year to acquire the site, a year to clear it and a year to build it.  I do not think the ordinary person realises that there is so much preparation before the builder comes on the scene.  Some people have jocularly said that the city is falling faster than it is being built.  I would not like to say that that is quite true, but it is a picturesque description of a very undesirable state of affairs.</P>
    <P>Mr. La Guardia, the Mayor of New York, has spent millions of dollars preparing drawings for post-war building in his area, and if the war ceased to-morrow he could lay contracts in a few days.  It is no use the Government saying they will have a wonderful building programme completed in 25 years. Can they start any scheme to-morrow? In England they are turning the plant used on the preparation of aerodrome sites to the preparation of sites for houses in the post-war period. Have our Government got any plans along these lines?  If they have, why not make them known?</P>
    <P>There are certain reasons for the failure of private enterprise to supply houses.  Each one of them has its due weight.  I would like to suggest that the housing problem is made up of a number of questions.  Each one of them examined by itself is so small that it scarcely looks as if it merited attention.  I think housing is about the only want in this city that, certainly before the war, had not been fulfilled for anybody who had money in his pocket to pay for it.  I think we can all remember that at the end of the first war there was a whole lot of shortages of clothes and various other things and in a few months there were no shortages at all.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest to the Minister some of the, possibly, lesser reasons for private enterprise having practically ceased to build these smaller houses.  One of the reasons is the five-fourths assessment, under Schedule A, which an owner has to pay, and the withdrawal of the allowance for repairs to a man who owns his <Col N="2550" /> own house.  On the Labourers Bill it was stated that repairs cost from 29 per cent. of the rent in Co. Wicklow to something like 120 per cent. in other districts.  The Rent Restrictions Act has prevented the building and letting of houses becoming a commercial probably say: &ldquo;Oh, well, would you contemplate taking off the Rent Restrictions Act and letting houses go to their economic price?&rdquo;  I do not think I should be prepared to do that, but I should like to suggest to the Minister that for too many years the Government have looked on at that question, and that they ought to have realised that it would ultimately dry up the supply of houses at the source from which they were formerly supplied.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the solution of the housing problem calls for an alteration in the approach to it by the Government. I have already said that some of them were very small, but the effect is cumulative.  There are not enough sites available, and I should like to suggest that the acquisition and layout of such sites as are available should be gone on with at the present time.  No builder gets clear possession of a site, and it is popularly said that most builders, when they are asked to go in on a site and start building on it, use a certain amount of bad language over the way in which they are given a piecemeal delivery of the site.  I am not denying that there is something to be said for that on the corporation side also.  Is it suggested that 2,000 houses per year is the maximum output of Dublin builders?  If so, I should like to deny that.  What is wanted is a long-term policy.  We have heard about delays resulting from all sorts of things.  I have mentioned the acquisition of sites, clearance of sites, and so on, but there may also have been strikes and other things.  All these things, however, only cause delay for a certain time, and if enough attention were given to these matters, I feel that these 2,000 houses could be doubled once supplies are available, and, possibly, stepped up still further.</P>
    <P>Another point that I should like to make is that a tremendous amount of consideration is given to the selection <Col N="2551" /> of a site for housing.  I believe that some people who back horses are wont to shut their eyes and point with a pin at the list of starters, and that the horse at which the pin points is the horse of their selection.  I think that you can almost approach a map of Dublin with a pin, with your eyes shut, and, provided that you do not land in a river or on an existing building, you can be practically sure that any place where there is room for a house is a desirable site.  Dublin is very badly laid out from the point of view of people wishing to cross the city, and if there were more traffic arteries, I think there would be less complaints about housing, particularly from the point of view of the workers who, naturally, would like to be housed as near as possible to their place of employment.</P>
    <P>The corporation say, in effect: &ldquo;We are out to house the poorest section of the community.  We want to cater for those people before anybody else. We are not trying to cash in on the demand for housing, but we are doing the best we can to catch up with the demand.  Our housing scheme involves a loss of over 2/- on the rates, and we will not build houses for people who are able to build them; we will be putting too heavy a strain on the city finances if we move any faster.&rdquo;  The Government, on the other hand, say: &ldquo;We have used all our powers.&rdquo;  Now, most people can agree with those two points of view as a general statement, but where does all this get us?  Does anyone think that we will solve the problem on these lines?  I would suggest that most of the Deputies in this House will have headstones over them before this problem is settled, at the present rate of progress.  Of course, that does not mean that I am wishing my fellow-Deputies any harm, but the problem certainly calls for some clear thinking. How is one to increase largely the supply of very cheap dwellings?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy and the House, Sir, that I am not reading this out word for word, but I have a number of notes here that I am trying to string together. I can show them to the Deputy afterwards, if he wishes to see them and, if he looks at them, I think he will find that there is a considerable discrepancy between what I am saying and the notes that I have here. However, I was saying that this is a problem that calls for clear thinking, and I was asking: how is one largely to increase the supply of cheap dwellings? I think that the first step to be taken in that direction should be to build many more houses in the outskirts of the city, until the cost of sites in the centre falls or until industry takes up such sites.  I suggest to the Government that their approach and that of the corporation to the problem is on too narrow a front.  As I pointed out to the corporation, they are looking at the problem only from the point of view of the under-dog or the most lowly-paid portion of the population. Let them look at what that has resulted in.  At present, houses that are unfit for habitation cannot be condemned because there is no way to provide alternative housing for these people.  I suggest that everyone who builds a house in the Dublin area is really contributing to the solution of the housing problem because, like it or not, the supply of houses seems to be made up from two sources, by the corporation, and by turning larger houses into tenements.  The tenement owners can let rooms at 5/- a corner. Should the corporation decide that it will be many years before they can solve the housing shortage and say: we will get increased tenement houses, but not by purchase as we are doing at present.  Why not set us a block of houses to let at 5/- a corner or in some way like that?  Let the authorities take a realistic attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem has to be solved in some way.  I hope the Minister will not quibble over the precise extent of the <Col N="2553" /> problem.  I put down 20,000 houses, but some people worked the figure down to 16,000 while others worked it up to 26,000.  It is a very extensive problem, no matter what figure is taken.  I contend that everybody who builds a house in Dublin leaves a vacant space somewhere for someone, just like the overcoat that some people discard is taken up by humbler citizens and serves its purpose until it becomes useless.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>For the information of the Deputy I am stating that the problem exists in other cities, but that it is very much smaller than in the case of Dublin, and that any approach to, or solution of, the Dublin problem, can easily be applied to other areas.  I have spent all my life in Dublin, and naturally my ideas turn more to this city than to the country generally.  I purposely refrained from making this statement controversial.  I put this motion down in December, 1943.  It is more important for people to have food than houses, but if the payment of increased rent brings the family budget below the subsistence line, it really leaves them in a worse position.  That is why I suggest trying to make some of the corporation schemes into real tenement houses.  I said nothing about pre-fabrication.  That is merely a detail of the housing question.  I said nothing about the proposal to reduce rents for some people by having a standardised <Col N="2554" /> rent.  I feel that an entirely new approach will have to be made to this gigantic problem.</P>
      <P>I hope that what I have said will not be in vain.  Out of a survey of 33,000 families in 1938-39, over 21,000 were occupying dwellings of one room; and nearly 11,000 of the 21,000 families were occupying unfit one-roomed dwellings. That is so important that I wish to give the reference for it.  It is in paragraph 457 of the Report of the Inquiry into the Housing of the Working Classes in the City of Dublin, 1939-43. That paragraph prompted me to make the suggestion that perhaps some entirely new approach ought to be made to the housing problem.  If asked if we would rather have families in unfit, one-roomed tenements or in fit habitable one-roomed tenement houses, I suggest we would not be long in making up our minds as to which we would prefer.  I think it was Marshal Foch who spoke about trying for a limited objective.  I suggest to the Government that a one-roomed sanitary dwelling might be a very convenient half-way towards a solution of the Dublin tenement problem.  Supposing they used the product of two years' tenements as single-roomed dwellings, look at some of the benefits that would accrue from that temporary measure.  That would enable the corporation to clear away unfit rooms and would allow the corporation to get a much higher rate of profit that is at present going past them to the owners of unsanitary dwellings; it would enable them to see where the population is tending, and would cheapen rents all round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present the chance of getting a corporation house is nearly equal to the prospect of getting a prize in the Hospitals Sweep.  The corporation, I suggest, are aiming too high in the rate of rehousing that even in pre-war days was going on.  For many years the prospect of the average citizen is a corporation house or a room unfit for human habitation.  Let us be honest with ourselves.  Broadly speaking, there is not a modern house to let in Dublin at a reasonable rent.  It seems as if the problem will not be solved on present lines.  The corporation has all the skim milk.  An increase in tenement <Col N="2555" /> houses is more necessary than an increase of ordinary houses.</P>
    <P>Buying houses for reconditioning on the basis of present earnings is not likely to settle anything, and is not increasing the supply of rehabilitated or reconditioned houses.  It only means swapping a house which was probably getting near the borderline of unfitness, or was frankly unfit, and the corporation making it fit.  I suggest to the corporation that they should build on virgin sites till they can enforce their own by-laws and clear areas quickly.  That will prevent artificial profit being made on houses unfit for habitation and get nearer to an economic rent.  I have not quoted a lot of figures.  My proposal can be summed up in two words&mdash;more houses.  Only the application of that principle is in dispute.</P>

      <P>The resolution is valuable if only for the fact that it affords the Minister an opportunity of giving his views on the Report of the Commission of Inquiry of 1939-43, which was issued early in December. I may say at the outset that I am in agreement with Deputy Dockrell in relation to the urgency of the problem of housing in Dublin, but I do not share his pessimistic view as to its ultimate solution.  The Report of the Commission of Inquiry is a very valuable report.  It is well documented and carefully prepared and gives magnificently the background of the housing position in Dublin.  In the main, it agrees with the activities of the Dublin Corporation, particularly during the last ten years.  Certainly it contains no strictures on the corporation's operations, and, on the other hand, makes no revolutionary recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Its main recommendations are first, in relation to differential rents; secondly, the extension beyond 35 years of the redemption period of the <Col N="2556" /> loans; and, thirdly, and perhaps most important, the lowering of the rate of interest to a figure not higher than 3 per cent.  So far as differential rents are concerned, these are entirely a domestic matter for the corporation and will not be affected by any debate which may take place here.  They have the power and the machinery to adopt these rents, if they so decide, but certainly the extension of the period of redemption and the lowering of the rate of interest are matters upon which we are very anxious to have the Minister's views.  The report gives tables, very excellent tables, showing the effect of an extension of the redemption period and, more particularly, a lowering of the rate of interest, which are conclusive evidence of the fact that, on the basis of comparatively cheap money, the immediate effect would be a saving to the Government in respect of its subsidy, a saving to the ratepayers and the possibility of lower rents for the tenants.</P>
    <P>I submit that this question of easy or cheap money is the main factor in relation to Dublin housing in a normal period.  The last five years cannot be classed as normal in respect of housing or other activity, but we have had an experience from the financial point of view of a rather startling character. Going back to 1938, when we had adumbrated our programme as best we could and were going ahead nicely, we found ourselves refused any easement in relation to our financial requirements by the banks.  They refused us on the ground that our housing programme was uneconomic, and apparently they were alarmed by the magnitude of that problem.  That position was eased later.  We had various arrangements of 4 to 4½ per cent. until last year, indicating the position of the market due to conditions which the House will appreciate, we were able to secure from the Bank of Ireland, on the basis of a private stock issue, a loan of £1,000,000 at 3¼ per cent. at par.</P>
    <P>The Minister or some Deputy may ask why we did not go into the open market for the flotation of our own issue last year.  We considered it very carefully.  We were anxious to tap the <Col N="2557" /> market for various reasons, but we had this advantage in the arrangement with the Bank of Ireland, that, for the first time, it was possible for us to get our needs in instalments.  The House will readily appreciate that in relation to the flotation of a stock issue of £1,000,000 at 4 per cent., we might need only a certain proportion in three months, six months and nine months, as the case might be, and we should have had to put our £1,000,000, or the greater portion of that sum on deposit at 1 per cent. while paying 4 per cent. for it.  We had the advantage for the first time that we were getting it on the basis of an instalment plan.  Every three months, we could get what we required and were thus saving the interest loss which would otherwise have accrued.</P>
    <P>Obviously what occurred last year is not to be taken as indicating the position in the post-war period.  The present position with regard to the increase in bank deposits is due to the fact that there are no investment outlets because of restrictions on industrial development.  That will cease in the post-war period and we may well be driven back to the period we had to face in 1939.  From my personal point of view, the most valuable recommendation in this report is that which sets out that the corporation should have money at a figure not higher than 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>We feel that, for a municipal activity, the rate of interest might be even lower.  They also recommend that, because of the more easy form of market available to Government might securities, the Government might undertake in the case of the municipality the flotation of such loans, or at least take responsibility for them in future, rather than to adopt the corporation's own haphazard form of flotation, dependent on an up-and-down market, of which we have had bitter experience.</P>
    <P>If the Minister would indicate that he was prepared favourably to consider that aspect of the recommendations he would be advancing along lines which we members of the corporation, and particularly those of us who are members <Col N="2558" /> of the Finance Committee and who had all these worries over the years, would be exceedingly pleased to see him advancing along.  The extension of the redemption period is a matter which, I am sure, the Minister has examined, arising out of the report.  The report refers to a ten, 15 or 20-year programme.  It is a remarkable coincidence that, in 1939, the Corporation budgeted for a ten-year programme&mdash;to build 2,000 houses a year from 1939 to 1949, making in all 20,000 houses.  Having regard to our experience in previous years, we were confident that we would be able to carry out that programme.  The only difference between the contents of the report of the commission and the line on which we were prepared to advance is represented by two new factors which they introduced&mdash;obsolescence and family growth.</P>
    <P>These may be off-set, to some degree, by the activities of private builders, particularly in the case of families in the lower scales.  That was our programme and we are entitled to some credit for the fact that, notwithstanding the restrictions which have operated for the past five years, we succeeded in building, on an average, 800 houses during each of those years. Since Deputy Dockrell assumes that delays take place and that planning for the future is necessary, I should like to point out that, during the past five years, planning has been carried out in an intensified form by the corporation &mdash;to such an extent, indeed, that, if the war were to cease in the morning and if the necessary materials were available, our programme could be commenced within a week.  The planning section of the housing department have made arrangements over the past three or four years, 12 months ahead so far as acquisition, bills of quantities and the necessary preliminaries up to the stage of tendering are concerned. I am satisfied that, given reasonable conditions, particularly under the heading of easy money and sufficient supply of materials, we should, during the next ten years, be able to break the back of the slum problem so far as Dublin is concerned.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Deputy referred <Col N="2559" /> to the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  That is a matter in which I have taken a keen interest in the corporation. Up to six or seven years ago, it was possible to get a loan under the Small Dwellings Act from the corporation, and, while the rate of interest was comparatively high, the system of easy payment was of such a character as to enable quite a number of people to build their own homes.  We had about 3,000 borrowers on our books who secured their homes by that facility.  The sum advanced amounted to £1,500,000.  At the time that the commission made its inquiries, only 60 of the borrowers were in arrears, and I can assure the House that the arrears were of a nominal character&mdash; perhaps only for a month or two in the period which came under review. The arears amounted to only 49 of the total amount falling due during the whole year.  That was one of the most successful activities of the corporation. It enabled a man who had saved £100 or £150 to supply himself with a new home.  A number of the members felt that slum clearance should have priority in connection with our finances, and, because of the heavy commitments in connection with that item, operations in connection with the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act were dropped.  Funds were not available for that particular activity from our flotations.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Minister give attention to that particular matter, because I know of no better means of creating a good civic spirit than by encouraging the young man who has saved £100 or £150 and who has it on deposit receipt to invest it in a new home.  Our chief, the city manager, stated, according to the report, that that was an activity that should not come within the purview of the corporation. I venture to disagree with him and I do so because of my experience regarding the type of person who borrowed the money.  The borrowers knew that, if harsh conditions arose or upsets in their domestic affairs occurred, affecting their payments from month to month, they would be dealing with a body which would have a human understanding of their position and the <Col N="2560" /> axe would not fall upon them as it might if they were dealing with a private company, thus depriving them of a good deal of the money they had invested up to that stage.  I advise the Minister to arrange for an extension of this activity, whether the corporation be chosen for carrying it out or not, for the reasons I have stated.  I believe that the most desirable form of administration is by an organisation such as a municipal or borough council.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell referred to a great many phases of building.  I should like to refer to the question of building by direct labour, which is dealt with in the report.  It is an extraordinary fact, as evidenced by the report, that, notwithstanding the extensive building which has taken place in the city, there were not, on an average, more than three tenders for each contract set by the corporation. So far as the contractors are concerned, I wish to say that they have given us complete satisfaction.  It is rarely that we have had complaints so far as the building or structural aspect of our programme was concerned but it is remarkable that only three contractors have been tendering on an average for each of our contracts.  I suggest that, since we have had an experiment in connection with direct labour on what is known as the Elm-field scheme, we might have an extension of that system up to 25 per cent., at least, of the total programme of the corporation.  It would have the effect of imposing a check on existing prices and conditions so far as the building is concerned.  The one scheme which we did try out in that way compared quite favourably with the contractors' scheme on the other side of the road, but this disability attaches to it&mdash;that, under the requirements of the Public Health Act and other Acts, delay is inevitable.</P>
    <P>Deputies who are members of local authorities are aware that contracts for sums over £100 have to be advertised and that a period of ten days has to elapse before anything can be done. You have these and other delaying factors with regard to building.  In that respect the scheme, such as it was, did not get a fair trial.  I may say that the municipal authorities in England were able to get legislation, to ensure <Col N="2561" /> that these restrictive clauses in the local government code would be eased to a very great extent so far as direct labour operations by public authorities are concerned.  I suggest to the Minister that that is an aspect of the question to which he might direct his attention.</P>
    <P>There is one other point to which I have referred frequently in the House, and that is the subsidy payable under the 1931-32 Acts.  I have again and again drawn attention to the fact that the conditions which obtained between 1931 and 1932 are totally dissimilar from those which obtain to-day owing to war conditions.  The ceiling figure for cottages under those Acts was fixed at £450 and for flats £500.  But every Deputy who has knowledge of conditions in Dublin is aware that cottages and flats are costing the Dublin Corporation considerably more than that, and have been for some time.  Cottages to-day run into a figure of £675, while the cost of a four-roomed flat is as high as £900.  That means that the Dublin Corporation has to bear the difference between £450 and £675 in the case of cottages, and of between £500 and £900 in the case of flats.  I think that the time has arrived so far as the Department is concerned for a revision of the ceiling, and in any case of the subsidy.</P>
    <P>May I suggest that, in any approach to this question, one of the factors that will have to be taken into consideration is that of transport charges for our housing schemes?  We have found tremendous difficulty in bringing families out to Crumlin and Cabra West and to Marino and Donny-carney. Transport charges eat up a considerable amount of the wages of the ordinary worker where you have a father or perhaps one or two members of the family travelling to their work in the city.  These charges are a serious matter in the budget of the average working person.  There are those who plead for a higher ratio of cottages to flats.  I think that we have reached a reasonable figure in that respect. Of the total number of cottages and flats built, the flats represent, roughly, about 20 per cent. of the total. The ideal thing, of course, would be to <Col N="2562" /> continue the building of cottages.  Personally, my view is that serious consideration will have to be given to this question of transport charges.  Recently, in the Dublin Corporation, the question was discussed of making provision for newly-weds.  This is a social problem of very great importance.  I may say that his Grace the Archbishop, the Most Rev. Dr. McQuaid, about 12 months ago, at a gathering of members of the corporation, made reference to it and said that he would be very happy to see an approach to that particular question: to see if it would be possible for the corporation, on the one hand, to meet cases of that kind, and on the other to meet cases of aged people.  Difficulties abound in regard to this question of making provision for newly-weds.  The corporation have taken a very sympathetic view of it, and by a unanimous vote have agreed that something should be done, even as a gesture.</P>
    <P>The actual implementation of that proposal is still under review.  But side by side with what we may be able to do in the immediate future as affecting that particular problem, something might usefully be done by the adoption of the facilities which the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act provides, and that is to give loans where a young man getting married is able to put down £50, £60 or £70.  If such a person is assured that he can get a loan on easy terms he may be able to make arrangements with a private builder or a public utility socity, and in that way, I believe, we may be able to make a valuable contribution to this particular aspect of the housing question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>We all, and particularly those of us who are members of the Dublin City Council, are well aware of the necessity for an additional number of houses in the city. If there is one thing more painful than another to a councillor it is to have people coming to him and telling him that they are living with two, three or four, children in one room.  If this motion had simply been that the Dáil was of opinion that a large number of extra houses for Dublin was necessary, <Col N="2563" /> we would all be in complete agreement with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot regard this motion as a candid or frank one.  It is divided roughly into two parts.  The first is, that 20,000 houses are necessary.  The second part of it amounts to a vote of censure on the Government for its failure.  In neither of these directions is the motion true or necessary.  As a matter of fact, the Dublin Corporation has planned for the erection of the necessary number of houses within the shortest possible period, and, of course, that is only done on the condition and understanding that the Government will continue to give during the implementation of that scheme the support it has given to the housing problem from the day that it took office.  To be candid, I think the statement that 20,000 houses are necessary is an overstatement. Thank God, in this city our people, on the whole, have a Christian way of living, and the normal Christian family is the standard here&mdash; that is a family of four children, with the father and mother making six.  On that basis, 20,000 houses would make provision for the housing of 120,000 people or practically half the population of Dublin.  Therefore, I think that is definitely, on the face of it, an overstatement. These are the only two points covered in the motion.  Nine-tenths of the speech of Deputy Dockrell was completely outside the motion.  He dealt with things that are <Col N="2564" /> useful and informative, but what he said should have been said not on this motion but on some other.  Of course, it is now a very popular thing to say that the poor are in need of housing and that we require 20,000 houses.</P>
    <P>That is an excellent piece of propaganda, but candidly I am afraid there is a good deal of propaganda in it. We are all sympathetic and we all agree that more houses are needed.  I think the majority of us believe that these houses are being provided as quickly as it is possible to provide them in existing circumstances.  When I first became a member of the Dublin Corporation, shortly after the Fine Gael Government had gone out of office, I found a very sad state of affairs existing, sadder even than the present position after five years of war.  I found it very hard to get a family housed at that time, a family that had less than seven children.  But a gradual improvement&mdash;possibly the word &ldquo;gradual&rdquo; is not the right word to use; I should say a rapid improvement&mdash;set in.</P>
