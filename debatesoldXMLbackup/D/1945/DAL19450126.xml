      <P>I move the motion standing in my name and in the names of Deputies M. O'Sullivan and James Larkin (Junior):&mdash;</P>
      <P>This House is of opinion that steps should be taken immediately to amend the law relating to blind persons so as to secure in particular&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  compulsory primary education for all blind children and the opportunity of secondary or higher education where deemed justified;</P>
      <P>(b)  the provision of efficient technical training for blind persons able to avail of it with a view to affording them opportunities of obtaining suitable employment;</P>
      <P>(c)  the abolition of all forms of piece-work in institutions and workshops for the blind, with a guaranteed minimum wage to be based upon the rates paid to workers in the unskilled departments of the municipality where such workshops are situated, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d)  the provision of adequate allowances for the incapable, aged <Col N="1738" /> and infirm blind, sufficient to maintain them in a proper and humane manner,</P>
    <P>and requests the Government to introduce proposals for this purpose without delay.</P>
    <P>This motion must bespeak unanimous sympathy.  No one will deny that blindness is a grievous disability.  I am sure everyone would wish to do anything in his power to relieve some of the hardships associated with that affliction.  The acid test of our sincerity in this matter is to relate what has been done and is being done for blind persons to our expression of sympathy, individually and collectively. I think we are forced to the conclusion that we have been very lax in carrying out our duties to the blind population of this State, in comparison with what has been done in other countries or according to any standards we like to set up for ourselves.  In this country blind persons represent a comparatively small proportion of the population.  The total number is 7,000. They fall into two classes, those blind from birth and those who have had the misfortune to incur blindness through industrial or other disease.  For either class, I am prepared to say&mdash;and I challenge contradiction&mdash;we have not done well.  The child born blind is a strain, a misery and a sorrow to its parents irrespective of their position in society.  That child requires constant attention and care.  The majority of such children are the children of people in poor or middle-class circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is compulsory education in respect of children who have their sight.  There is no such provision in respect of the blind child.  Blindness in itself is a very severe handicap, but it is aggravated when it is left to the parents, who, perhaps, have no means, to educate the child.  No proper provision is made for suitable schools or suitable teachers.  We allow many of these children to suffer the double hardship of blindness and lack of education. We allow them to grow up without any conception of the world they are living in.  If it is necessary to have a scheme of compulsory education for the ordinary child, is it not much more essential to have such <Col N="1739" /> a scheme for children who are born blind?  In this motion we are asking that compulsory primary education should be provided, in suitable schools and under suitable teachers, for children who have the misfortune to be born blind in our State.</P>
    <P>Whatever haphazard arrangements may be made for their primary education, there is no scheme whatever for secondary education for the blind in our country.  I suggest that that is a matter that should be attended to and we are asking that Parliament should give attention to that matter. We find that where opportunities have been provided for blind persons and where they have been given suitable training, they have, in very many cases, overcome their disability and have proved themselves very useful citizens.  They have given evidence of their ability to contribute to the social services when their colleagues, who have sight, are prepared to assist them.  In this regard I think we compare very unfavourably with Great Britain.  I have statistics as to what the blind have been capable of doing in the sister island when they are given an opportunity of education.  They have a blind population of approximately 70,000.  We have 7,000.  In recent times they have trained blind persons to become typists, clergymen and to fill other positions which one would think it would be impossible for a blind person to occupy.  Out of 70,000 blind persons in Great Britain, over 11,000 are in course of training or in actual employment, excluding 1,500 who have been absorbed into war industries.  This represents an average of one in every ten of the blind population either in course of training or employment.  In Éire there is a total blind population of 7,000, out of which only 87 or, approximately, one in 80, are engaged in our industrial schemes. This figure shows retrogression over the last 20 years.  Twenty years ago we had more blind persons in training and being educated for industry than we have to-day.  Wide developments have taken place in other countries while we have been, not standing still, but moving backwards.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1740" /> As I say, when we find that only one in 80 of our blind is being attended to in that direction, as against one in ten in Great Britain, we have a fair criterion of our negligence.  In New Zealand, they are very much further ahead even than Great Britain in their care for the blind, and the blind have been able to respond to that attention by contributing useful citizenship.</P>
    <P>I suggest that in addition to providing for compulsory primary education, we should provide suitable secondary education and the highest possible cultural education as long as the students find they are capable of absorbing and responding to it.  I do not think their blindness should be allowed to continue to prevent them from being educated. Under existing legislation, certain provisions were made enabling the local authorities to undertake the education of the blind, and their industrial development to a certain extent. That function was handed over by the State, and the 20 years' experience we have had furnishes ample proof that that was a mistake.  It might have been done with the very best intentions, but the figures show that the existing arrangements are not successful, and I would respectfully suggest that the care of the blind is really a matter for the State.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the local authorities are entitled to come to the assistance of the blind in certain circumstances. Their contribution is also limited by the State.  If the local authority gives 6/- to help a blind person, that 6/- is taken into account in the means test, just as if the person had three eyes or had the best sight in the world.  That 6/- is calculated for the purposes of the means test, and he cannot get any more than 10/- State pension.  That is not very much encouragement to the local authorities to give from their the local funds for the assistance of the blind.  Having regard to the small number of blind in the country, and the smaller number still who would be eligible to apply for this pension, they ought not to be put on the same basis as a person who is looking for an old age pension.  The same rigid means test should not be applied against them.  In the case of a man who becomes blind in middle life, and who <Col N="1741" /> fits himself, by his energy and application, for some trade or calling, so as to be able to earn a few shillings, it is surely a hardship that those few shillings which he may earn by basket-making, or some other type of work of that kind, should be taken into consideration for the purposes of the means test.  In that way, his one little triumph is taken from him.  He has triumphed over his disability to the extent of being able to earn a few shillings.  Is it magnanimous to say: &ldquo;We will nullify your triumph by robbing you of the few shillings you earned&rdquo;?  Similarly, if the wife of a blind person earns 2/- or 3/- a week at charring or washing, or anything of that kind, that, too, is taken into account for the purposes of the means test.  I suggest that all that is really due to carelessness or lack of attention to consideration of the point.  The amount involved is so very small in comparison with our national expenditure that, if sufficient consideration were given to the matter, I do not believe that the Government or any section of the community or of this House would agree to perpetuate the hardships under which the blind are undoubtedly suffering.</P>
    <P>We have put down this motion for the purpose of giving the House an opportunity of discussing the matter, and we are hopeful that the various points will receive kind and capable consideration.  I attach very great importance to the matter dealt with in the first portion of the motion, that is, the education of the children, their primary and secondary education.  I do not think that education should be limited in any way when the pupils show that they are capable of absorbing and availing of it.  I also urge that the means test should be abolished as far as the blind are concerned. It would not involve the State in any very serious additional contribution; it would be a gesture showing those afflicted people that we are appreciative of their disability, and that they have the sympathy of their fellows.  I am aware of the efforts made by the National Council of the Blind and the Welfare of the Blind Societies in the country.  They are <Col N="1742" /> doing very good work, but it is really only on the fringe of the problem. They are not capable of grappling with the task, and I suggest that it is really a matter for State intervention.</P>
    <P>I happen to be associated with the Council of the Blind in Limerick; I have been chairman since its inception. I cannot speak too highly in praise of the work done by that council.  They visit the blind in their homes, and have set up classes in the technical schools in order to try to get them to come out and mix with their fellows, doing little bits of raffia, basket-work, needlework, and so on.  It is essential to employ teachers to go into the homes in town and country and teach the blind through Braille and Moon in order to give them some little relaxation from their obscurity.  When they are capable of reading, such books as can be obtained in Braille are lent amongst them.  In Northern Ireland those home teachers of the blind have half their salaries remitted by the State.  There is no such contribution here.  Those visits may seem a small thing, but it means quite a lot to the blind to have those people coming to their homes, cheering and brightening them by reading to them and giving them work to do.  Here, the salaries of those teachers have to be met out of private charity, whereas in Northern Ireland the Government has seen its way to contribute half their salaries.</P>
    <P>I have briefly indicated the ideas which lie behind the motion, and I am committing it to the consideration of the House.  I am sure that many other Deputies would like to participate in the discussion.  I suggest that this is a matter which calls for our careful individual and collective attention.  The number of people concerned is comparatively small, and owing to the shocking nature of their disability I feel that something better should be done for them.  The lines suggested in this proposal would prove the <i>via media</i> by which the State could redeem its obligations to its blind citizens, and render them the assistance which is their due.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like <Col N="1743" /> briefly to express my approval of this motion.  Many motions have come before this House but I doubt if any motion was ever put on the Paper which should&mdash;and I believe will&mdash;find more support on all sides of the House. The case which has been so well made by Deputy Keyes is one that I think will appeal to every member of this House.  Perhaps it was news to many members here that the conditions relating to the blind population of this country are so bad.</P>
      <P>We do very little for them.  Perhaps in cities some little attempt is made by people who give their services voluntarily to try to ease the condition of the blind, but in rural areas&mdash; I am speaking for the moment of the adult blind &mdash; we content ourselves with giving them a blind pension of anything up to a maximum of 10/- a week.  It does not seem to be anybody's business to see whether that blind person is capable of performing any useful work or to attempt to occupy the minds and the hands of the blind person with work.  I would suggest in that respect that in every case where a blind pension application is investigated, and where the applicant for the pension is found to be entitled to it, the pension officer should be asked to make a report to some central authority as to that blind person's condition&mdash;age and so on&mdash;and that it should then be the responsibility of somebody to see whether whatever talents that person may have could be usefully employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Keyes has said, the fact that it is nobody's business in this State to see that a blind child should get any education at all is something of which we should be ashamed.  It is bad enough that a child should be blind but it is still worse that a child should be completely illiterate and ignorant.  One of the greatest blessings ever conferred upon the blind, those of them who are in a position to enjoy the privilege of it, is wireless, but even that pleasure is largely denied to the blind person who has no education whatever, because he is unable to follow or understand a great deal of what comes over the radio.  In that <Col N="1744" /> respect I would suggest that it should be the duty of the State to see that as far as possible there would be a wireless receiving set in the home of every blind person.  I know myself, and I am sure it is typical of every county in the State, a number of young men and women who are blind.  No attempt has been made by anybody to see that they should be fitted for any gainful occupation. It is not a matter, I think, that needs long speeches or that needs to be laboured.  I shall be surprised if the Minister does not see his way to accept this motion or at least the principle underlying the motion.  Deputy Keyes told us that we have 7,000 of a blind population.  Looking at it even from the point of view of the finance involved, the expense of giving the benefits which are sought for in this motion would not be very great and I think that every member of the House would desire that the utmost possible should be done to bring some brightness into the lives of these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as sympathy with the people who are concerned in this matter, the 7,000 of our population who are deprived of their sight, is concerned, I do not think there is any need for any Deputy to express his views.  Sympathy with them is, of course, universal.  I think even the most hard-hearted member of the House will feel that everything that possibly could be done should be done for this comparatively small section of the community.  It is, of course, of fundamental importance that the education of this section of the community should first of all be considered. Without education those unfortunate people must face life with a much greater handicap than that which is imposed upon them by reason of their disability.  In the matter of education, the needs of the blind are immeasurably greater than the needs of the person who has the full use of his senses.  The blind can be educated only with much greater difficulty than would be the case in regard to other people.  There is no profession, with perhaps the possible exception of politics, that a blind person can take up without a long and laborious training. The blind person has, first of all, to <Col N="1745" /> substitute the sense of feeling for the sense of sight and can learn to read only under the most complicated difficulties. Then, again, in learning the various arts and crafts, they are very seriously handicapped.  The problem of providing education for our blind population, the small number of 7,000, scattered throughout the length and breadth of the Twenty-Six Counties is not a very easy one.  For that reason, while I entirely agree with the first two sections of this motion, that of providing compulsory primary education for blind children, and that of providing technical education in so far as they can avail of it, I think that we should approach with some caution the question of the compulsory attendance of blind children at school.  We must be sure, first of all, that the schools which these blind children are compelled to attend are schools which are equipped to teach them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the position is, but I have the feeling that the ordinary national school is not equipped to provide education for blind children&mdash;not fully equipped, at any rate. The ordinary primary school is not in a position to provide them with education in such subjects as reading and writing, which are fundamental to education.  If this motion contemplates sending these children to some residential school or institution compulsorily, it is a rather serious matter because, naturally, one would be slow to take young children who are blind from their homes without the consent of their parents and send them to an institution.  While the particular institution might be fully equipped to provide education suitable for that blind child, the severing of the child's relations with its own family, the taking of it away from its familiar surroundings and depriving the parents of the child without their consent, is a very serious matter.  I think that that portion of this motion might be qualified by some provision that compulsory attendance at school for these children would not be imposed unless there is clear proof that the child concerned is not being educated in its own home or is being neglected.  It is possible that a blind <Col N="1746" /> child might be receiving, perhaps, a fairly substantial measure of education in its own home from its parents or other relatives, and it would be very unfair to send that child away.  We must remember that children so afflicted feel some kind of sensitiveness in regard to their condition, and it would be an added hardship on them at an early age if they were to be sent into strange surroundings.</P>
    <P>So far as technical education is concerned, I think no one will have any hesitation whatever in agreeing that the fullest possible measure of such education should be provided for all young persons and, if necessary, even adults, in order to assist them in earning a living.  I am not quite sure whether the abolition of piecework in the case of blind persons is entirely necessary, provided there is no injustice, no underpayment, no low scale of reward for the piecework.  I think that piecework is not only an incentive to work, but it helps to hold the interest of the person engaged in the work.  Some of the work in which blind persons engage might be of a rather monotonous character and it would help to relieve the monotony if the blind person was seeking to find how much work he or she could get through in the period of time in which he or she would be engaged, and it would add to the interest of the work. For that reason I do not see why, with necessary safeguards against injustice or underpayment, piecework should be regarded as undesirable.</P>
    <P>Among other things this motion deals, as Deputy Keyes pointed out, with the abolition of the means test in relation to blind pensions, and I think the House will feel that a good case has been made for the abolition of the means test so far as this section of the community is concerned&mdash;or, at least, a very drastic modification of the means test.  The amount of money involved is comparatively small and the number of people who will be affected is comparatively small.  Having regard to the serious difficulties under which these people labour, is it necessary to add to them by making any little earnings they are able to receive a handicap when it comes to granting <Col N="1747" /> them pensions?  I think they should be encouraged, not only for their own happiness and well-being, but for the general well-being of the community, to add as much as they can to the general output of the community and they should not be discouraged by being handicapped in respect of pensions became of any little work they are able to do.  What they do is small enough, God knows.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which I think is important and that is that not only should those people whose sight is affected or who are completely deprived of their sight be given the technical education necessary to enable them to contribute something in the way of work, but they should also be encouraged to engage in work; they should also be assisted by being trained in cultural accomplishments, such as music, singing and forms of art in which they might become very proficient.  I think that should be the main object of any educational system for the blind.  They should be given an opportunity to develop their talents, talents with which many of them are highly endowed.  So far as music and other accomplishments of that sort are concerned, I think blind persons should be given the greatest possible assistance and encouragement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards this motion which is before the House, I think it is as well that we should have due regard to the order in which the paragraphs are set out.  It is quite correct that Deputy Keyes did emphasise the injustice that devolves upon blind people by virtue of the operation of the means test.  That, however, is a general question which affects not only blind persons but many other sections of the community who are thrown upon the goodwill of the State and society as a whole for their sustenance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that in the case of blind persons, having regard to the effect of the means test, we should try to approach the problem of these brothers and sisters of ours from an entirely different viewpoint.  We are dealing here not with persons who, <Col N="1748" /> because of age or incapacity, or, in the case of orphans, their youthfulness, are unable to make a contribution of any value to society.  We have here, if you like, a section of society which we must carry, because we are human in our outlook, and it is not our desire to cast aside those not able to care for themselves.</P>
    <P>But, when we come to deal with blind persons, we are dealing not only with people suffering from a physical disability, but with people who have tremendous latent qualities who, if we only appreciate and develop them properly, can, in many cases, give a greater contribution to our nation than many of those gifted with sight. Therefore, our neglect&mdash;if that is the word to use&mdash;of our blind brothers and sisters is not merely bad and inhuman in itself, but it is a form of waste of energy, because, if we had a proper approach to these persons and afforded them facilities to bring out their abilities, we might get a return which would be a thousandfold on anything we would expend.</P>
    <P>In the motion Deputies will notice that while we stress the basic fact that a blind man or woman or child should be afforded the minimum of assistance in order to enable them to secure the bare necessities of life, we have put that at the bottom and we have tried to approach the problem from the other angle, starting with the education of the blind children and providing facilities which would enable those blind from birth, or those unfortunate enough to lose their sight in later life, to obtain technical education which will enable them to assist in maintaining themselves and, where they have special qualities, of contributing their share towards the well-being of the community in the form of manual work, mental work, or the development of artistic abilities.</P>
    <P>We stress that, if we are to provide employment for blind persons whom we have trained, that employment should be of a certain character, and, finally, we refer to the general problem of the maintenance of the incapable, aged and infirm blind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keyes has dealt at some length with the question of the education <Col N="1749" /> of the blind child, and I think the point raised by Deputy Cogan, namely, that we should not take up the position of making it compulsory on a blind child to attend school, is one which merits consideration.  We will all agree with his submission that, because of the physical disability under which a blind child suffers, the fact that there are certain, if you like, spiritual and mentalities between such a child and its parents, which might be shattered in certain cases if we arbitrarily compel that child to attend school, regardless not merely of the actual conditions in the school but even of the child's particular mental and spiritual make-up and the conditions in the home, should be specially kept in mind.</P>
    <P>I had the experience of living in an institution, and I know and appreciate that in the case of a certain type of children, no matter how kindly the atmosphere and how good the conditions of the institution, there is always a tearing away when they have to leave home, and when we are dealing with persons who lack sight, it is most important that we should have regard to their mental state of health and to their feeling that they have around them not merely people who have a kindly interest in them and their physical welfare, but people who are closely tied to them by love and affection and on whom they can depend.</P>
    <P>I do not know that anyone will disagree with me when I say that there is no human being who has a greater need of human affection, care and comfort than the person without sight, and surely that need is all the greater in the case of children.  While we make that reservation, I think we all accept the viewpoint put forward by Deputy Keyes and supported by the other speakers that there is something which must be remedied when facilities are not available, whereby children who are blind from birth will be given that minimum of education which will make it possible for them to fit in and to find some niche in the ordinary world in which they are forced to live.  We feel that they should be able, despite their handicap, to acquire that <Col N="1750" /> ordinary knowledge and ordinary experience of the world which make life a little fuller, which, as Deputy Morrissey says, will make it not only possible but enjoyable for them to listen to various items on the wireless.</P>
    <P>Secondly, we feel that after giving that minimum, we should recognise the fact to which I have already referred that the very fact that blind persons are denied this physical attribute, which so many of us fail properly to appreciate, they are often capable of developing mental and artistic qualities to a higher degree than people who have sight.  That has been found time and again and, therefore, it is something which we should not regard as charity but in which we should take pride, that is, utilising part of the human resources of our people and allowing these blind people the facilities, the assistance and the means to develop to the full, mentally and artistically, either through secondary or higher education, or by means of special provision whereby they can take up whatever artistic profession they are interested in.</P>
    <P>I want to speak more particularly on the third paragraph, that is, the suggestion that in relation to employment for blind persons, we should agree upon the abolition of piece work and should institute a guaranteed minimum wage for all blind persons, whether engaged in institutions or in workshops maintained for the blind, and that that minimum should be fixed at a level comparable with the rate of wages paid to unskilled labour in the particular municipality in which they are engaged.  Why do we suggest that piece work should be abolished? Deputy Cogan has said that, subject to necessary safeguards against underpayment and injustice, he cannot see the force of our argument against piece work.  He feels that very often work on which blind people are engaged is, of necessity, of a monotonous character, and that piece work, because they would take a certain interest in their output, would help to do away with monotony. Whatever advantage that might have <Col N="1751" /> is altogether overborne by other considerations.</P>
    <P>We overlook the fact that piece work, even for persons with sight, is the exception rather than the rule, and that it is not accepted by people with any kind of high standard of employment conditions as being good in itself or as something which should be maintained.  It is a stopgap, developed to suit particular conditions in modern industrial society.  The basis of piece work is the use of the selfishness, greed and cupidity of the individual man or woman in order to secure a higher output, and you treat them in the same way as you treat a work animal, that is, the harder the work, the more you give them.  We have always objected to that contention. We feel primarily that a man or woman has a certain claim to a minimum standard of living in return for the service given in any trade, and, secondly, that it is the duty of the management concerned to provide such reasonable conditions of employment, of management and machinery as will make it in the interest of the individual worker to give the highest possible output, with due regard to his health and welfare.</P>
    <P>Under piece work arrangements, all these considerations go.  The only thing measured is the actual output, and so far as the individual worker is concerned, the actual amount of money that will come back to him.  It is recognised and accepted that piece work automatically calls for a greater expenditure of physical and mental energy, and, above all, of nervous energy, than time work, and so it is axiomatic that the piece worker is automatically entitled to and guaranteed at least 25 per cent. more than the time worker receives on the same type of operation.  Yet here we are dealing with blind persons who not only are suffering from the incapacity of blindness in so far as it interferes with their actions from moment to moment, but who, in the case of persons who have become blind in later life, have to acquire a new training, a training entirely foreign to them, such as basket-making, <Col N="1752" /> when previously they were clerks, accountants or persons used to doing mainly clerical work or heavy manual work.  They have to take on this new form of activity.</P>
    <P>They have got this new training, however, not under ideal conditions of using their sight or being in direct visual contact with their work, but under the tremendous handicap of having to acquire that training in a world of which they suffer from a complete lack of knowledge.  There is a wall between them and the world to which they were formerly used, and yet we suggest that they should get training to enable them to do piecework, which would mean that they would be working in competition with persons who have their sight.  It has been found that the individual blind worker, working on the same individual task as the worker in possession of his sight, finds great difficulty&mdash;even in the case of the best blind worker&mdash;in maintaining even 50 per cent. of the output of the worker who has his sight.  Of course, we have often heard about blind workers being able to perform the most amazing feats, and that is undoubtedly so, but such cases would be the exception, and if we are to take the average, and try to strike a mean, it will be found that the blind worker will not be able to do the same amount of work as the person with sight, or even 50 per cent. of it.  I think that, when we take the average of the output of work by the blind, and try to strike a mean, it will be found that if we can get 25 per cent. of production by the blind, as compared with production by a worker with sight, we are doing very well.</P>
    <P>Already, in cases where this kind of work is being done, the actual earnings of blind persons on piecework are too low.  Some time ago we had industrial trouble in connection with one of these institutions as a result of this, and there was a strike.  Happily, the dispute was fixed up afterwards, following a little hiatus.  That dispute was due to the fact that these people found it impossible, under existing conditions, to earn even the minimum sufficient to enable them to keep body and soul together.  There was an industrial <Col N="1753" /> dispute, due entirely, as I say, to the fact that the rate paid to these people was entirely insufficient, and we had pickets put on.  It was an unusual thing to have an industrial dispute in such circumstances, but it was settled, and a new spirit of accommodation was arrived at.  If, however, we are dealing with blind persons engaged in piecework, and if we are to impose the conditions that Deputy Cogan finds necessary, and with which we would agree: namely, that those people should not be underpaid, and that there should be no injustice done in regard to them, it means that we shall have to pay them piecework rates at least 150 per cent. more than is paid to workers who have sight and who are engaged on the same work.</P>
    <P>Now, if we require from blind persons some contribution in return for the training given by society, we do not expect it on the same basis as in the case of the man or woman in possession of sight and in possession of their full physical capacities.  All we expect, in relation to blind persons, is that they will be trained, first of all, to find some useful and valuable place in life, not only for the sake of making a contribution in return for the training they have received from society, but also so as to enable them to be of help to themselves.  We certainly do not expect to get pound-for-pound back and, therefore, in our motion we suggest that this system of piecework, because it is bad in itself and because it is particularly objectionable in relation to blind workers, does not give them an opportunity to earn a minimum wage, such as to enable them to keep body and soul together.  Therefore, we suggest that we should take upon ourselves the responsibility of guaranteeing to those blind persons who are doing skilled work at least the same wage as a worker with sight, in the city, or under a municipal council, is entitled to.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, that is not an unreasonable demand.  As a matter of fact, it has already been adopted in some municipal centres in England. References have been made to the fact that in other countries there is a higher standard in relation to the <Col N="1754" /> treatment of the blind, and we have used that argument when discussing other forms of social service, but, when putting forward such arguments, we are always reminded that this country cannot be compared with other countries in wealth or the resources at our disposal.  Here, however, we have a problem that is not so great.  There are some 7,000 persons, as a whole, suffering from this terrible infirmity, and I suppose that our total contribution, either through the State or local authorities, at the most amounts to about £30 or £40 per head per year for all those people.  Surely, we are entitled to suggest that something should be added to that sum so as to give comfort to those unfortunate people as human beings and, secondly, that we should try to find ways and means by which we, as representing our people and society in this country, can obtain for those people the benefit of the contributions that they can make, not alone for their own comfort, but for the benefit of the Irish people as a whole, from the point of view of the artistic or other achievements of which these persons are capable.</P>
    <P>This motion, as I say, has not been put down merely as a question of cash, and I do hope that it will not be approached in that way.  I believe that by finding ways to help these blind persons to help themselves, we would be helping the nation, and that there would be a practical return for anything that can be done for them.  For that reason, I hope that there will be a sympathetic and human approach on the part of the Government to this question.</P>

      <P>Is this matter being taken really seriously, Sir?  There is a motion dealing with, perhaps, the most afflicted group of people in the community. There have been five speakers, all putting forward various suggestions, and we have heard nothing from the Minister so far.  I think that the time has come when the House is entitled to hear the Government view on some of the requests that have been made.  It is not a case of playing a Party game around the House, where nobody is strengthened, influenced, or <Col N="1755" /> directed by the views of the Government as to the feasibility or possibility of easing the lot of the unfortunate people concerned, and I think it is reasonable for the Minister to intervene at this point in the discussion in order to give the House some idea of the Government's view.</P>

Might I remind him that there will be plenty of time within the scope of three hours, but that there are certain Deputies in this House who take their responsibilities fairly seriously and who, before speaking, would like to get some information, some guidance, or some assistance as to the Government's view on the requests that have been made?  It is neither a joke nor a Party game.  It is not a case of taking the Minister short, because this motion has been on the Order Paper for a number of months, and his advisers are beside him.</P>

      <P>It does not seem that we are to have that amount of elucidation of the motion that one would expect.  This matter, as has been said, has been a considerable length of time on the Order Paper, and the manner in which it was set out suggests that the different aspects of it referred to would receive some detailed examination from the speakers who have placed it on the Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who have been listening will be able to judge for themselves whether the speeches delivered by the proposer and seconder have established a case for the acceptance by Dáil Eireann of the assumptions and recommendations contained in the motion.  This is not the first time this matter has been discussed in the House.  In the last Dáil, the matter was raised and a motion dealing with the amount of the allowances payable to blind persons was <Col N="1756" /> replied to by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government, who is at present dealing with public health.  In the course of that discussion, the Parliamentary Secretary was able to show, I think, to the satisfaction of the House, that considerable improvement has been made by Government action in the position of blind persons.  One of the first things the Government did was to amend the legislation dealing with blind persons.  The effect of the amendment was to give pensions to blind persons over 30 years of age.</P>
    <P>The benefits which those persons might have been deemed to be receiving, and which would have counted against them as means under the law as it then existed, was no longer to be taken into consideration. In addition, the definition of &ldquo;blindness&rdquo; was altered to the advantage of blind persons, so that if, because of defective sight, a person could no longer follow his ordinary occupation, he became entitled to a blind pension. In addition to that, as the House is probably aware, local authorities have cast upon them by law the duty of providing welfare schemes for the blind in their areas.  Where there has been any reluctance to prepare those schemes, I understand that local authorities have been compelled to do so, and to satisfy the Minister that they are of a suitable character.</P>
    <P>The question of the blind is a very serious one.  If I, as representing the Government, have to make the case that the amount which can be done for the blind, or any other deserving class of persons, is limited, nobody should assume that there is any lack of desire on our part to do more.  The amount that can be done is limited because the cases of hardship are so many.  On the Order Paper, there is a number of motions dealing with special cases of hardship which have become still more serious owing to the emergency&mdash;all clamouring for Government assistance.  If the Government were to agree to give additional aid in any one of those cases, they would be asked to act similarly in regard to other cases.</P>
    <P>I have said that there has been an <Col N="1757" /> improvement in the general situation of blind persons.  That, I think, is admitted by those who have taken an interest in blind persons and who have been trying in a splendid, voluntary spirit to make their lot easier.  The Parliamentary Secretary pointed out, when this matter was last under discussion, that, whereas in 1931-'32 the total amount spent on old age pensions and blind pensions &mdash; unfortunately, the figures have not been segregated &mdash;was £2,696,000, the amount in 1942-'43 was £3,935,000.  That was an increase of approximately £1,240,000.  In addition, the Government has introduced a scheme of children's allowances which has imposed a burden of £2,250,000 on the taxpayer.  Blind persons, with families, will, of course, receive a considerable amount of benefit from that expenditure, in common with other persons with families.</P>
    <P>A great deal of complaint was made on the present occasion and on the previous occasion about the means test.  There is a limitation on the amount of the cash income which a blind person may receive under the State scheme and the local authority scheme but there is nothing to prevent a local authority from giving additional assistance in other forms such as food or other necessaries.  I think that we ought to ask ourselves whether the local authorities can do more or whether what they are doing is not reasonable, having regard to all the circumstances, before we agree to place this further charge upon the State.  The Parliamentary Secretary explained to the House&mdash;I am merely quoting his figures&mdash;that in 1943 a married blind pensioner with two children in the City of Dublin could receive between cash, food vouchers and cheap fuel a total sum of 42/-per week.  That may not be a reasonable amount.  We should all like to increase it.  But if we decide to increase it, we shall have to look very seriously at the position of other persons in receipt of public moneys by way of assistance schemes&mdash;widows' and orphans' pensions, old age pensions, unemployment assistance, and so forth.  As I said at the beginning, <Col N="1758" /> if the Government were to accede to the principle of the motion in this particular case, however deserving the persons concerned may be, they would be coerced into increasing the amounts in the other cases to which I have referred.  A very small increase in the amount of the old age pensions, for example, would cost the Exchequer £1,000,000 a year.  I do not think that the persons who have argued the case for the blind on the ground that the additional expenditure would not be considerable will deny that, if the claims of the old age pensioners were under consideration later, they would advance the argument that the Government, having conceded an increase in one case, should do it in the other case.</P>
    <P>Since the war began the vouchers for food have been made applicable not only to the pensioners but to their children.  The children's allowances scheme has been introduced and, in addition, as I understand it, these vouchers were made available for the dependent children of pensioners.  If the position was that the additional cash allowance which was granted in 1942 in the Borough of Dublin was not available in other areas, the Minister for Local Government, as the House knows, introduced a special measure by which, with the assistance of the local authorities, additional provision was made to provide food for persons in receipt of allowances under the local blind pensions and other schemes. So that, while the cash allowances may not have been increased as much as we would all wish, owing to our resources and the other calls that were made upon us, it cannot be said that the Government has not, through the introduction of food vouchers and fuel schemes, tried to see that the persons in receipt of public assistance of one kind or another were not neglected. Provision has been made for them.  I think that is the position and that I need not dwell on it further.  That is the general question of the provision of allowances under clause (d). What I am particularly interested in, of course, is clause (a) and, in addition, clause (b).  The suggestion by Deputy Cogan that, in dealing with compulsory <Col N="1759" /> primary education we should have regard to the circumstances of blind children, is one with which I am in hearty accord.  Clearly, when the Compulsory School Attendance Act was passed in 1926, it was hardly envisaged that it should apply to blind children. Presumably, it was only intended that normal children of school-going age should be compelled to go to school, as they have been since compelled between the ages of six and 14.  To compel blind children to attend the ordinary primary school would be, as the Deputy suggests, perhaps useless and, I think, even cruel.  There would hardly be a sufficient number of them in any one school area to warrant the making of special provision for their instruction in the local school.  If primary education is to be made compulsory for them, it must be provided in special schools, where they can be gathered together and placed in the charge of teachers who are specially trained to deal with them.  This will involve separation from their parents, as Deputy Cogan again mentioned.  I think this point is a very valuable one. There is the aspect of the problem of the children having to be taken away from their parents and from the special ties that they must have.  In the case of children who have not been given their sight or who are defective in any other way, these ties must be of special value to them.  The bonds of affection and helpfulness, and so on, in the home must be much stronger in their case than in that of ordinary normal children.  I do not know whether the Deputies who are proposing this motion think that all these children ought to be taken away.  Presumably, even if legislation is introduced to deal with the whole problem, parents will still have the right to keep their children and to give them whatever education and training they themselves may consider suitable.</P>
    <P>It is extremely difficult to get an accurate estimate of the number of blind children of school-going age in the country.  The reason for this is that up to the time of the 1911 Census returns particulars were given in the census forms about blind persons <Col N="1760" /> generally.  It was alleged that the parents were reluctant to give particulars as to mental or physical defects in their children and that, therefore, the returns were unreliable and misleading. Since then we have not the advantage of having figures, however incomplete they may be, based on the census returns.  What we do know is that at the present moment we have a number of children in two primary schools in Dublin, at Merrion and Drumcondra.  The total number between the two schools is 57, and it certainly can hardly represent the total number of blind children of school-going age.  However that may be, I have been making inquiries through the school attendance enforcing authorities, and I have not been able to find that there is any considerable number of school children, so far as they know, who would require instruction and who are not at present being provided for.  According to a report from the police authorities some time ago, they were able to trace only six blind children in country areas.  Probably these figures are not accurate, but, even allowing for a generous margin of error, I think that we cannot accept, on the basis of the speeches that we have heard, the charge that there is neglect, that nobody is doing anything about this matter, and that, in fact, the whole situation is being overlooked.</P>
    <P>As regards the figure of 7,000 which has been mentioned as the number of blind persons in the State, I do not know whether an appropriate proportion of these, such as one would expect in the ordinary population, would be of school-going age.  It seems to be the case that the number of children blind from birth is very small.  If that figure of 7,000 is accepted, and if the proportion of it who are, let us say, under 30 is greater than we imagine it to be&mdash;if it is more than some hundreds&mdash;nevertheless, the problem does not seem to be as great as some speakers would lead us to believe.  Obviously, the first necessity for dealing with it is to have a proper census of the number of blind persons of school-going age.  That matter is being examined.  We cannot have a census which will be satisfactory <Col N="1761" /> without some form of compulsory notification.  Under the new Education Bill across the water, the onus of ascertainment is placed on the local authorities. I do not know whether it is suggested, seeing that these schemes for the welfare of the blind are being carried out under the local authorities generally throughout the country, that they should not be the appropriate persons to make the census.  However, I am having the matter examined and I hope that, as a result of co-operation between those concerned, really valuable statistics may be made available.</P>
    <P>With regard to secondary education, this is entirely voluntary in this country at present.  The State does not take the initiative in providing it in any area or for any section of the community. It is true that the Department of Education helps financially, it frames the curricula and inspects the schools, but these are established and owned by private individuals or by religious bodies and attendance is not compulsory.  As in the case of the primary schools, it would be profitless, I think, to compel blind children to attend secondary schools established for normal pupils.  If we are to make secondary education available for the specially gifted blind children who seem to be in a position to benefit by it, we must provide it in institutions where they can be congregated and where they will be placed under teachers specially trained for the work. As I have indicated, the number of those of primary school age seems to be small&mdash;we have not the exact figures&mdash; and the number looking for secondary education would be smaller still; and in actual practice, there would have to be a careful selection made.</P>
    <P>The same principle would seem to hold in the case of technical education, that is, that we cannot as a general rule send blind persons to the ordinary technical or vocational schools established for the normal students.  In this case also, as in the case of primary schools, special arrangements may be made, and I hope it will be possible to make them, particularly in the county boroughs.  Deputy Keyes, who is interested in the matter, says it has been possible to make arrangements for <Col N="1762" /> special classes in Limerick; and I am sure that the vocational education authorities in the county boroughs or elsewhere would be glad to make teachers available.  However, with the best of goodwill, the amount that can be done in that way will be limited, as obviously the teachers, if they are to be of value in this work, must have special training and must be able to give efficient instruction.</P>
    <P>My belief is that, on the whole, the best method of tackling this matter satisfactorily would be to provide continuous training and to increase the provision made in the existing blind institutions, so that the children who had passed through the primary course would come on to some form of post-primary work, either to secondary&mdash;if they seem specially suited for it and there would be openings available for them later on&mdash;or to vocational training proper.  There is a certain amount of vocational training at present and a certain amount of technical training, but it is limited.  We have a sufficient basis in the existing institutions, we have the organisation and a certain amount of teaching facilities available, and these could be improved.  The inadequate and, perhaps, unreliable and incomplete figures that we have show that there must be at least 200 blind persons in the country between the ages of 15 and 30, and 100 of these at least are maintained in institutions, as matters stand.  Probably the number who would require special training and who would be willing to leave their homes and who would be capable of benefiting from being taken away for this training must be small.</P>
    <P>Recently, I have had the matter examined by the inspectors and they have assured me that, as far as these two institutions in Dublin are concerned, the primary education, at any rate, is certainly highly efficient.  Those institutions also provide some form of continuation education.  We should like to get more done, of course, as regards the technical training of the blind children, and I have appointed a committee to advise me regarding their training, not alone during their primary course of instruction but subsequently.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1763" /> The suggestion that the matter is being neglected by the State or by the local authorities is a suggestion which I think I have dealt with sufficiently. I may mention in passing that a great deal of valuable work is being done by voluntary workers.  We have the National Council for the Blind working very actively throughout the whole country, entirely on a voluntary basis.  Those who know these problems will realise that the intimate personal touch, the encouragement that social workers of this character can give to the blind or to other afflicted persons, is out of all proportion to the psychological advantages or even the material advantages that would be given under purely State action.  I believe that there is scope for voluntary activity and for charitable effort in this direction.  I am not saying that that should prevent the State from doing more, if it is possible, to deal with this particular problem, though allowance ought to be made for what is being done through charitable agencies.</P>
    <P>I feel that, on this occasion, I should express my gratification and satisfaction at the amount that is being done.  For example, I find that the national council has supplied 26 home teachers recently for the blind in their homes, where there was only one teacher ten years ago.  They have three qualified teachers in Dublin City and County, and two in Cork City.  They have supplied radios to the blind in very large numbers, and were it not for the existing difficult circumstances, I have no doubt that we would be well on the way to the point where all the blind would have the advantage of the radio.  Then, the national council has been able to take up the special training of young men and women who have special aptitudes.  Some of them&mdash;like the soldiers who lost their sight during the unfortunate explosion a few years ago&mdash;have been trained and are now able to carry on work.  Others have been trained as music teachers; some have been trained as masseurs; some have been trained even as organists.  There is the well-known case here in Dublin of a young man who <Col N="1764" /> secured his Degree in Music while acting as a city organist, although blind.</P>
    <P>The national council has sent a number of young men across to London, where there are facilities which are not available here, and they were trained specially as shorthand writers, and now, I understand, they have good positions over there.  As has been said, Providence may have endowed the blind with special aptitudes, and it should be the task of a proper system of training to provide the necessary facilities to bring out those special aptitudes.  There are certain definite lines of work, apart from craft-work: it seems clear that for telephony, typewriting, shorthand, massage and music, the blind can be specially trained, and that many of them have a special aptitude for these particular lines.</P>
    <P>With regard to the dispute referred to by Deputy Larkin, I am not familiar with the details of that matter.  It is very unfortunate that there should be a dispute of this kind, as nobody realises more than those who are dealing with this matter&mdash;either from an official Government point of view, from the point of view of the local authorities or of the charitable organisations &mdash;that what is being done for the blind is limited and that it would be well indeed if more could be accomplished. It would be a pity if anything were done on the one side or the other to spoil that feeling of goodwill which seems to be necessary and to which, as I have said, I attach the greatest importance in dealing with these poor people personally and in helping them along and bettering their conditions.</P>
    <P>What I do know, though I have no up-to-date information, is that some years ago in Great Britain the advisory committee to the British Ministry of Health recommended that piecework ought to be continued in the best interest of the blind and in their report for the years 1934 to 1937 they confirmed the view they had previously given in 1926, that on the whole, after carefully considering the matter, they thought the system of adhering to piecework payment was more suitable for the particular conditions of the blind.  They went on to say that &ldquo;in <Col N="1765" /> the operation of the system there should be such adjustment as would ensure for every worker a reasonable minimum wage, subject to proper safeguards for the maintenance of efficiency.  The minimum wage may be subject to variation according to locality&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The basis which is taken in paragraph (c) of the motion, that the minimum rates should be based on the rates paid to workers in unskilled departments of the municipality, seems to be quite arbitrary and we were given no information as to the actual earnings of workers in the blind institutions at the present time.  Figures that I have got seem to indicate that the earnings are not as low as one might have expected, having regard to the difficulty which often exists of getting high prices for the products of their work.  It happened that in 1943 &mdash;and I am sure the same is true for 1944&mdash;owing to a special demand for baskets and so on, the remuneration improved somewhat.  So far as I know, no complaint was made to the Government Department that the rates of pay were inadequate and that an effort should be made to improve them.  As I say, I have not sufficient knowledge about the dispute, but I understand that, under the schemes promoted by the local authorities for the welfare of the blind for the augmentation of wages of outdoor workers in institutions, the agency must observe certain recognised standards.  If there is a particular trade in question, the standards of remuneration in that trade and the standards of hours of work, bonus, and holidays and so on, must apply.  In no case may the hours of labour exceed 48 per week, and so on. There is then a certain schedule laid down of payments according to the circumstances of the worker and, as I have said, owing to the emergency conditions, I think that the total remuneration has been somewhat better than formerly.  In any case, I think the House would have to be sure that there was definite injustice, that everything possible was not being done to treat the workers fairly, before they could accept the contention in paragraph (c).  As Deputy Cogan said the fact is that we all want to see these <Col N="1766" /> workers in blind or other institutions treated fairly.  We want to see them get justice.  If it can be proved that the present scheme is not giving them justice, then it ought to be revised and reconsidered.</P>
    <P>I have given the house an authoritative statement on the matter from a body in another country.  I have seen the returns of remuneration for the year 1943 and, as I say, they are somewhat better than might have been expected and than was generally the case heretofore.  If I were to quote them, on the other hand, it might be suggested that these wages were an indication&mdash;which they are not&mdash;of what blind workers can always expect to earn.  They have been somewhat better than usual.  At any rate, I think we have not had sufficient examination of the matter. That there is injustice has not been demonstrated to us in such a way that we can accept the suggestion in paragraph (c).  No other speaker referred to that except Deputy Larkin.  He admitted that, as he described it, the hiatus had been got over and that apparently the conditions were as his organisation would prefer them to be. In these circumstances, I think, if that is the situation, the matter ought to be allowed to rest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard with a good deal of interest what the Minister has had to say on this subject, but I am not at all satisfied that, despite what has been done by the State and the local authorities, anything like adequate treatment has been meted out to the blind.  If you compare the expenditure on pensions and upon the welfare of the blind in England, which at the present time is £4,500,000 per annum for a blind population of 74,000 odd, with our figures, which are infinitesimal beside these, I think it will be agreed that we have not approached this problem properly at all.  From the most recent figures I can get I find that the local authorities have spent £40,346 on assistance to blind persons in their homes and £7,177 on assistance to blind persons in institutions&mdash;that was for the year 1942-43&mdash;while the State advanced for <Col N="1767" /> the welfare of the blind only £7,841 2s. 2d.  I think these figures prove conclusively that adequate State assistance in the matter of welfare treatment for the blind has not up to date been provided.</P>
      <P>I feel that the problem will have to be tackled on three bases.  First of all, there is the problem of the education and training of the youth who have had the misfortune to suffer from blindness from birth.  Secondly, there is the problem of keeping in some employable state those people who, in middle life or approaching old age, have had the misfortune to become blind.  Thirdly, there is the problem of the provision of adequate allowances for those who, in their old age, are blind.</P>
      <P>On the matter of education and training, I am inclined to agree with the Minister that the problem is not as acute as it is in the other categories. I do not think that children form any considerable proportion of the 7,000 blind population.  Generally speaking, blindness is an incidence of old age.  I venture to suggest that the figures, when ascertained, will disclose a large percentage of blind persons in the old age group.  Nevertheless, we cannot escape the fact that in Northern Ireland considerable assistance is given by the State by way of remission of salary to home teachers.  If that were done here, it would be of great benefit to the blind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the matter of providing schools or workshops for the training of the blind, a very difficult problem will arise.  It is very doubtful that we can tackle this question on a purely county or county borough basis.  The population of blind persons in any of these local areas is insufficient to enable us to set up schools and workshops in each area and, if the problem is to be tackled at all, it will have to be done on a regional basis.  At the present time the tendency is for blind persons to migrate to those places where they get the best treatment, namely, the cities, particularly Dublin.  We could perhaps correct that tendency by some system of regional planning, two or three counties, say, to participate in <Col N="1768" /> setting up a workshop for the blind, the same two or three counties to set up a school for the blind.  I think if it were tackled on those lines, it would not be so expensive as at first sight it may appear.</P>
    <P>At present there are only something more than 300 blind persons in institutions. It will have to be ascertained in due course whether it is that blind persons are reluctant to leave their homes to go into institutions or that parents are reluctant to part with their children and place them in institutions.</P>
    <P>Up to the present the approach to the problem of providing for blind persons has been solely from the point of view of giving a mere sufficiency to enable them to keep body and soul together and the more serious aspect of the problem has been neglected. The cost of living for the average blind person is undoubtedly higher than it is for the average person who has the gift of sight.  A blind housewife cannot do the work of the home.  If she has not a member of her family to assist her, she must have a maid.  The blind tradesman, even if he can make goods as well as the tradesman who has the gift of sight, will experience difficulty in selling them and in that matter must have assistance.  The blind professional man or businessman who requires a car must have somebody to drive it. In any class in society, it can be shown conclusively that, from the point of view of bare existence, the blind person is at a considerable disadvantage. For that reason, the approach to this problem should be from the point of view of keeping the blind person in constant employment, enabling him, as a citizen, to contribute his fair share to public life and to the welfare of the country.  If the problem is approached in that way, all means tests or anything of that nature, at present imposed under existing legislation, must be abolished.  I would commend that point of view to the Minister when he comes to tackle this problem more closely, as he appears to be about to do.</P>
    <P>On the matter of education, training and keeping blind persons in employment, personally, I would prefer a continuation of the present system of <Col N="1769" /> voluntary aid rather than State administration. I believe blind persons take more kindly to the voluntary system than to State-aided institutions.  For that reason I should like to see more financial assistance given to such a body as the National Council for the Blind.  They are handicapped by lack of funds at all times.  They rarely have sufficient funds to meet the demands that are made upon them, not only for the education and training of the blind, but for the provision of amenities which the blind so much require, such as radio sets.  I dare say that in time there will be other mechanical inventions to help blind persons to earn their living.  I would, therefore, appeal to the Minister to consider giving more liberally from State funds to such bodies as the Council for the Blind, to the local authorities and local voluntary associations working in conjunction with local authorities.</P>
    <P>In view of the figures I have quoted, I think the House will be satisfied that inadequate assistance is given at the moment.  So far as I have been able to ascertain, the problem has been thrown entirely on local authorities and the State is confining itself to giving small grants to certain institutions that cater for the blind.</P>
    <P>In the matter of education there is a good deal of leeway to be made up. The problem there will be to devise a system which would be economic, having regard to the small population of blind schoolchildren to be catered for.  We, on this side of the House, are in wholehearted sympathy with the motion and intend to support it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain features of the speech made by the Minister for Education in this debate are very welcome.  One could see, underlying the Minister's statement, a good deal of sympathy with the principle of the motion and the result of a good deal of effort to become intimately acquainted with the problem.  It is, however, extremely disappointing to learn that there is no accurate record in this country of the extent of the problem or the number of people who are blind.  I feel that the Minister realises that it is an immediate duty, through the local authorities, acting <Col N="1770" /> on behalf of the State, or in some way, to get an exact picture of the problem as it exists in the country.  I do not know whether or not I misunderstood the Minister in regard to the number of blind children in rural areas. Perhaps he was referring to some particular rural area when he mentioned that there were only six blind children there.  The number in rural areas generally may not be very large, but certainly it is not as small as that.  Taking my own county alone, the number of blind children in the rural areas would considerably exceed that figure.  It has been stated here that the number of people concerned in all aspects of this motion will be 7,000.  The motion, as the House is aware, falls under three headings: one, compulsory education for blind children: two, technical training; and three, suitable allowances for the people concerned.  The Minister is, of course, aware of the extraordinary results that were achieved in Great Britain following the last war in the matter of educating and training blind men, and it is a fact that in all countries where the people afflicted with a malady of this kind have means, or are supported by people who have means, the most amazing results have been achieved.  I realise that it is impossible to get satisfactory results to that extent in all cases, and I realise, too, that even the most enthusiastic advocate of schemes of this kind will come up against difficulties.  There is, of course, here and there, a reluctance to come forward for training of this nature, and I think the Minister would do a very great service by initiating some propaganda campaign, such as talks, whether on the radio or otherwise, to the people concerned, with a view to encouraging more co-operation in the training or education of children and younger people who are blind.  The advantage of being comparatively independent so far as earning their own living is concerned would be a very great one for them.  If the benefits were impressed in their true light on the people concerned, I feel that the Minister would get almost complete co-operation in any scheme of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the fact that there <Col N="1771" /> are 7,000 people of all ages and descriptions who would be concerned in those proposals, I suggest to the House that there is a very strong case for giving them a special place in our social code.  That should be done not alone because of the comparatively small number involved but because of the special disabilities and difficulties under which they suffer.  There is no more pathetic person in this or in any other country than the person deprived of the gift of sight, and he certainly ought to have a special claim on the country and on the national purse. The Minister seems to be friendly and sympathetic to the principle of doing something for those unfortunate people.  When he examines the question more closely from the point of view of seeing what is actually happening in regard to assistance for blind people for whom the question of training or education cannot arise by reason of their age, or limitations in other respects, I think he will find quite a number of things that are not creditable.  I have one notable case of the kind in mind.  In the constituency that I represent, there lives, near Courtmacsherry, a comparatively young man who became blind in early life.  He was in receipt of a blind pension. In the last two or three years, his son joined the British Navy, and as a consequence of his son's enlistment in the navy an allowance of 10/-was made to that blind man.  In addition to that 10/- a week, his son made arrangements with some neighbour to send him 6/- each week for the purpose of cleaning his father's house, cleaning his clothes, and keeping him in a decent and proper condition. Because of the fact that that man received 10/- allowance in respect of his son, and of the fact that he had the benefit of an allowance given to a neighbour for the purpose of helping him, his blind pension was withdrawn and, in addition, his allowance from the local authority was stopped&mdash;that allowance, of course, being conditional on the receipt of a blind pension. That is one of the hardest cases I have come across.  I do not think the Minister or any member of the Government <Col N="1772" /> or any progressive citizen in this country would desire that there should be even one case of that kind here, and I think there ought to be examination of the whole question with a view to obviating such cases.  They are a disgrace to our social code.  I say that with all respect.  I realise that the Minister, in his approach to this matter, has given at least a certain amount of encouragement in regard to the educational and technical side of things, and I hope that the matter will receive some closer attention in the near future.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take up any more of the time of the House, because other motions in which we are concerned are coming on later.  I will wind up as I began by asking the House and the Minister to realise that the blind people of this country who are unable to support themselves ought to get a special place in our social code.  I do not believe any citizen or any section of the people would grudge any benefit we can give them.  There are difficulties in the way of discovering how best to frame an educational or training system for them, but there are no difficulties in the way of giving people who have no other means some allowance to make them feel that they are not entirely forgotten, as many of them do feel in present circumstances. I think this matter should be approached from all sides of the House in a very frank way, with a desire for co-operation.  I urge the Minister to give further consideration to this matter, and to consult a few other members of the Government with a view to making sure that one of the first steps to emphasise the desire of the State to do something for the blind will be a relaxation of the means test associated with blind pensions, apart from the other aspects of the case.  I feel sure that the Minister is genuinely interested in the matter. There was a very positive ring of sincerity about many of the statements that he made, and I urge him to do something for which he would always be remembered with affection in this country&mdash;to do something further towards removing the hardships that stand in the way of the blind.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the mover of this motion, and I also congratulate the Minister on the kindly way in which he has received it. During my short time in the House, I have never heard of any motion being received with greater sympathy.  I know a few people afflicted with blindness who are very keen on music. There is plenty of money in bands in this country at the moment, and I think there might be a future in that direction for some of those blind people who are musically inclined. There is just one other matter I would like to mention.  A well known Deputy of this House told us some time ago that his postage bill for one week was £2 1s. 8d.  When the penny post was in operation, he would have been able to post 500 letters for that amount.  I mention that fact because the penny post was introduced by a British postmaster-general, Mr. Fawcett, who suffered from blindness.  If the penny post were reintroduced now the Deputy could make a saving of 22/9 per week.  Mr. Fawcett was an outstanding man; he established the penny post and he is remembered to-day as one of the most famous post-masters-general under the British Government.  The blind generally are very clever and statistics show that their mental powers are very highly developed.  If one happens to be in any doubt or difficulty and goes to a blind person for advice, one feels better for the inspiration he gives.  I am very friendly with a number of them and I always feel the better for having a chat with them.  I have only to thank the mover of this motion for bringing it forward and to thank the Minister for the kind way in which he has received it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely wish to say one or two words in connection with the motion.  I am sure there must be general sympathy in all parts of the House with a proposal to relieve to the utmost of our resources the pitiful position of blind persons in this country.  Like Deputy Murphy, I think there was a ring of sincerity and a desire to help in the speech made by the Minister this evening.  I can only <Col N="1774" /> hope that no time will be lost in implementing the good intentions expressed in that speech and that steps will be taken to push forward such educational and social legislation as is necessary for the purpose of improving the lot of our sightless citizens to-day.  As I see it, the problem falls into two main categories.  There is first the case of the young, or the fairly young, blind person to whom it is possible to afford some kind of vocational training, who may be instructed in the arts or crafts, who may be taught commercial subjects, who may be taught music or who may be able to secure a type of training which would fit that person for some type of commercial employment.  Anybody who examines the position of sightless people in this country to-day must realise that there are practically no facilities available for persons who would be capable of undergoing that training.  Such facilities as are there, meagre though they are acknowledged to be, have in fact not been improved upon for many years past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other countries throughout the world, the problem of educating the blind has been taken in hand very seriously, and in certain countries very vigorously, notably in Great Britain, New Zealand, and the United States.   Here we seem to be content with a fragmentary type of vocational training for certain types of blind persons, and that type of training is not being reinforced by any very vigorous action on the part of the State.  There are approximately 7,000 sightless persons in this State.  I think the number of persons undergoing training will be found on examination to be less than 100.  If, therefore, there is a situation in which, out of approximately 7,000 sightless citizens, no more than about 100 are undergoing training in establishments suitable for training purposes, we can see the immense problem which has yet to be dealt with, and we can realise how scanty is the system of training at present provided.  I am sure the Government and the Minister must realise that if this problem of helping the blind person is to be tackled effectively, it can only be done by developing maximum training facilities and giving to <Col N="1775" /> the sightless citizen the utmost assistance that is possible to provide, to enable him to take his place as an ordinary citizen in any sphere of employment which he may choose to enter.  If any satisfactory progress is to be made in that connection, it must be obvious to the Minister and to the Government that steps must be taken substantially to improve our present training facilities.</P>
    <P>If that is to be done, then the State must step in and take a hand in this matter of providing additional training facilities.  It may ultimately be desirable to allow these training facilities to be administered by local authorities as a matter of decentralising control but, in the main, the system must obviously be inspired by the central authority.  It must sketch broadly the plan of vocational training for the blind and it must take steps to ensure that adequate educational facilities are provided for these unfortunate people.  That is one aspect, the basic aspect of the problem, because many of these sightless persons if they were taken in hand in time might be given a course of training which would enable them to take part in the normal life of the community and at the same time place them in a position in which they would not be dependent on State aid or aid from local authorities.</P>
    <P>Then we have got the other problem, the problem of the aged man and woman to whom it is not possible to impart training because of advanced years, certainly not to impart a training which is likely to yield them a return capable of maintaining them.  In that case the obvious course of action is to evolve a scheme of pensions for such blind persons in order to sustain them in something like tolerable decency. I do not think there is any spectacle that evokes so spontaneously the sympathy of the ordinary man and woman as the effort of a sightless person to help himself, even the effort to find his way through the streets of the city.  I think there would be widespread approval for any scheme to provide pensions for sightless persons which will give these people at least sufficient to <Col N="1776" /> sustain them and which will help in some way to compensate for what is a dual loss, the loss of sight and the loss of ability to earn the wherewithal to maintain themselves according to a decent standard.  Our standards in that respect are appallingly low.  If we were to set out deliberately to provide a fiendishly low standard of living for blind persons, we probably could not have achieved greater success than we have done by the present system.  The total the State allows to a destitute blind person is 10/- a week.  One has only to go into a grocer's shop to realise what one will get for 10/- nowadays. Yet that 10/- is supposed to sustain a blind person for seven days a week, to provide a blind person with three meals each day of these seven. In some counties the pension is supplemented by an allowance from the local authority.  For instance, in the County Kildare there is an allowance of 10/- a week, supplemented by a grant of 4/- from the local authority; but, in the long run, it simply means that a sightless person has 14/- a week on which to live, and everybody knows that the aged and sightless people are not capable of supplementing their income by methods such as might be available to other persons who might have low rates of pension, perhaps, but who could, in one way or another, be able to supplement that pension by some type of activity.</P>
    <P>Recently I came across the case of a woman of 63 years, sightless, who is receiving a pension of 10/- a week and an allowance from the local authority of 4/-.  The total income of that woman was 14/-, but she was so blind that she was obliged to keep a daughter, aged about 25 years, at home in order to prevent her from falling in her house or being burned.  There you had two persons, one aged about 25 years, and the other aged 63 years, being compelled to live on 14/- a week. That was the maximum we could provide for two persons, one sightless and the other compelled to remain at home to look after her afflicted mother. When the case was brought to my notice I endeavoured to ensure that that poor person would get the supplementary allowance of 2/6 which may <Col N="1777" /> be paid to old age pensioners or blind persons.  I was informed that the magnificent conception of Christianity that prevailed was such that these two people living on 14/- a week could not get the supplementary allowance of 2/6.</P>
    <P>I hardly imagine the Minister responsible would desire to deprive a sightless person, in the circumstances that I have described, of the supplementary allowance of 2/6 but, nevertheless, that unfortunate person cannot get that supplementary allowance.  The refusal to grant the allowance really crystallises the stony-heartedness which on occasions the State displays towards persons placed in that unfortunate position.</P>
    <P>If only that poor woman could emigrate to New Zealand she would be very much better off.  The New Zealand Government, with a sightless problem no less than ours, is able to provide a sightless man with 32/6 a week.  If that man is married he gets 10/6 for his wife and 10/6 for each child.  If a sightless man lived in New Zealand and had a wife and four children the State would give him a pension of £4 5s. a week to enable him to keep himself and his wife and family.  If that man were living in Kildare he would get 14/- a week to keep himself, his wife and his four children. It may be that our standards of productivity are not up to those of New Zealand; it may be that our sense of Christianity is not up to the New Zealand standard, although Heaven knows we talk enough about it here. The cold fact is that while in New Zealand a blind man in the position I have described would get £4 5s. a week we would fob the poor man off with 14/-.  That is an example of our generosity, that is the yardstick of our Christianity, when we are dealing with blind people in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech indicated some sympathy with the problem, some desire to deal with the development of the educational side.  I hope there is also some desire to improve the economic lot of persons suffering from blindness, persons who are not capable of being absorbed into training schemes.  The object of the motion is <Col N="1778" /> to focus public attention on this problem, to focus the attention of the Legislature on a matter that cries out for remedy.  I hope that as a result of the discussion we have had it will not be long until the Government come to the House, where they can be assured of the sympathy of all Parties, with proposals not merely to develop the technical training of blind persons, but to provide them with adequate means of sustenance and in that way to alleviate the plight which is particularly theirs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support this motion.  If there is any class in this country to whom the sympathy of every person goes out it is to the blind.  I very much fear that in this State we have not, at any time, under any Government, done as much as we ought to have done for these afflicted people.  To my mind, any money spent on those unfortunate people would be well spent.  Almost every Deputy in the House, at one time or another, has come across appalling cases of blind persons unable to do for themselves what persons gifted with sight are able to do&mdash;unable to provide themselves even with the bare necessities of life. It ought to be the object of every Deputy and of the Government, even at this late stage, to set about remedying this unfortunate state of affairs. I suggest it should be part of our post-war legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any money we spend on the blind will be well spent and there is the further point that, even if a person did desire to do it, it would not be possible for anyone to cash in, as it were, on the provision that the State will make for the assistance of the blind, because their affliction is so apparent that it would be impossible to get around it, as has been done in relation to other measures of relief. We are all aware that as regards other forms of State assistance, such as old age pensions or outdoor relief, occasionally someone not absolutely necessitous will take advantage of the provisions made by the State.  That will happen time and again, no matter what provision is made to prevent it; but in the case of provision <Col N="1779" /> for the blind it will be practically impossible for anyone to take a mean advantage.  The affliction is so apparent that it would be extremely difficult for any person to make a case if that person was not genuinely suffering from blindness.</P>
    <P>I would like to see in this country legislation that would provide, as Deputy Norton argued&mdash;unfortunately, I was not here for most of his speech &mdash;for the education of the youthful blind.  There should be provision made so that a blind child could get something akin to the education given to the child with perfect sight.  Further, he should be sent to some form of technical school to get education in the various trades in which the blind can engage and so become eventually an asset to, rather than a liability on, the State.  Anybody who takes an interest in the blind and has visited St. Dunstan's Hospital where blinded soldiers are educated will be surprised by the rapidity with which blind persons with previous education can imbibe the technical teaching given there. One can see hundreds and hundreds of blinded soldiers from the last war, who were inmates of St. Dunstan's, rapidly learning various trades and becoming useful citizens, able to earn their own livings in one direction or another.</P>
    <P>What was possible in the case of these rather mature persons would be much more easily achieved in the case of blind children, if they are taken at an early age and given the care which one would expect them to get in a civilised State.  I am rather afraid that in this State that is not the case, or at least, has not been the case hitherto.  I believe that, with the goodwill of all parties in the State, a system of education can be provided for the blind, which will give them, if not an equal advantage, at least something akin to the facilities which those who are not so afflicted enjoy in fitting them for the battle of life.</P>
    <P>There will, of course, be, as Deputy Norton said, a certain number of the blind for whom it will be impossible to provide in that way.  There will be cases of children who, apart from being <Col N="1780" /> blind, have other physical defects.  It would be almost impossible to provide for these children in that way, but where there is a will, there is a way, and it should certainly be possible to make provision for even the worst cases one can visualise.  I saw about a month ago a blind child of six or seven years in a very poor cottage. The child had been born blind and with practically all the physical defects one could envisage a human being having.  That child is still in that cottage.  I have seen that child outside the door of the cottage&mdash;rather a pitiable sight&mdash;and no proper provision made for it, except, I must say, the loving care of the father and mother.</P>
    <P>There should be some place to which such a child could be sent.  I will be told that there is such a place, that there are charitable institutions to which such a child can be sent, but these are in the nature of the old workhouses, and no decent father or mother wants to send a child to such an institution. There ought to be institutions of a character which everybody could look up to and to which these children could be sent.  The number would be very small and the provision would be easily arranged, but, for the great bulk of the blind, great advances on anything hitherto attempted will have to be made.</P>
    <P>This is a matter on which one finds it particularly hard to speak if one has the sympathetic outlook, which, I am sure, everybody has.  I feel it rather difficult to speak on the subject because the blind appeal more to me than any other afflicted section; but I think it lamentable that old people who become blind at the end of their days should be very ill-provided for in this country.  I have made efforts to get pensions for blind people at various times, and I must say I have always been met in a very sympathetic way by the officials, but I always felt that the amount which can legally be granted was totally inadequate to provide any sort of sustenance, not to speak of comfort, for the people for whom I appealed.</P>
    <P>I hope the motion will have the effect of arousing public opinion <Col N="1781" /> generally, and I venture to say that whatever legislation in this respect the Government bring forward will have general backing throughout the country.  The number of blind people is not great, and making provision for them would not be such a big matter as making provision for any other section of the physically affected, or any other section of people, such as out-of-works.  If courageous legislation were brought forward, it would be found that many of the blind young people would well repay the amount spent on their early education and that a good number of them would in a few years be self-supporting and a credit to the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion. If there is one section of the community to whom the Government should pay special attention, it is the section with whom this motion deals. The number of blind persons in the country is comparatively small.  I understand that it is about 7,000 or 8,000, and to deal with them, as the motion asks they should be dealt with, would cost a very small sum.  There are many children in various parts of rural Ireland whose parents look upon them as being in a hopeless condition, and who unfortunately make no effort at all to secure that they receive some kind of education.  One part of this motion seeks to induce the Government to bring in compulsory education which we believe is absolutely necessary for these people to enable them to keep themselves in future life.  There is, so far as I know, no provision by which the State is enabled to go in to a family and look after a blind child.  This is unfortunate, because, in many cases throughout the country, children who are sightless, if given the opportunity, would show themselves to be in a position to earn their own livelihoods. We often come across cases of children who have been reared without any effort being made to secure proper education for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They grow to manhood or womanhood, as the case may be, and end up in an institution.  I suggest to the Government that that is not as it <Col N="1782" /> should be.  With regard to blind adults, I do not think the Government should have any hesitation in accepting the part of the resolution which asks for a more adequate allowance for these people.  These people are absolutely helpless, and, as Deputy Norton pointed out a few moments ago, the allowances they receive, between the Government and the local authorities, are not sufficient to keep them in any kind of decent comfort. Deputy Norton mentioned 14/- a week as the amount given to such a person in his constituency, but I know of cases of blind people in other parts of the country who do not receive anything like that amount of money. I know of cases where they are dependent upon about 10/- a week.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether, however, from the question of the amount of the allowance given to blind persons, I want to complain about the length of time that elapses between the submission of a claim for a pension on behalf of a blind person and the time when the Government makes up its mind as to whether or not that person is entitled to a pension.  Anybody who has been on a pensions committee in any part of Ireland, outside Dublin, at any rate, knows that invariably, when a pension claim is submitted, the pensions officer always decides against it. Of course, it is apparent to everybody, including, in my opinion, the pensions officer himself, that the person concerned is entitled to the pension&mdash;it is certainly apparent to the pensions committees, in the majority of cases, at any rate&mdash;but when the pensions officer decides against that person's claim, the claim is then sent on to the Department of Local Government and Public Health, and I want to complain about the length of time that elapses before the Department determines whether or not the person concerned is entitled to a pension.  I have known of cases where almost 12 months elapsed before a decision was given as to whether the people concerned should get a pension or not.  I suggest that that is a very callous way to treat a blind pensioner.  As a matter of fact, I have known of a case where the medical officer of health <Col N="1783" /> decided that the person concerned could not follow any avocation and was entirely helpless and yet the pensions officer or the Department of Local Government declared against that decision.  I have known of case in my own constituency, County Wexford, where a doctor, who was also an oculist, and who had acquired vast experience, so far as sight was concerned, in Switzerland, and yet his decisions were turned down because of the red tape of whatever Department is responsible for the issuing of pensions to the blind.</P>
    <P>Apart from what is contained in this motion, I would ask the Minister to try to prevent, so far as he can, what I might describe as procrastination in dealing with those claims.  I believe that if the Government were to set themselves to the task of securing that proper education was imparted to blind people, through whatever medium was necessary, we would not have the helplessness and pauperism that is associated with these people at the present time.  I understand that the Minister, within the last hour or two, has expressed himself as being sympathetic, but, of course, I should like to say that we require a little more than sympathy in this matter.  We require that something should be done urgently; and we hope that the Minister is in a position to tell us that something will be done in the near future and that, at least, a thorough investigation will be made into this matter.  We hope that in the near future he will be in a position to introduce legislation here to implement what we are striving to have done in this resolution.  I believe that if the Minister were to bring in such a Bill or Order as is necessary to implement this, he would have the sympathy of the whole House, because almost every member of this House has been at some time or another a member of a local authority or of a pensions committee, and, therefore, they are all familiar with the hardships and, I might say, the humiliation, that these people have to go through in order to secure a blind pension.  Again, I would suggest to the Minister that there should not be so much delay, in the future, in the <Col N="1784" /> granting of these pensions as there has been in the past, and that the claims of these people will be dealt with in a proper manner.</P>

I am quite aware that it is not within the Minister's province to deal with that matter, but I do hope that, when the investigations to which he referred take place, due advertence will be had to this matter of the means test.  I am satisfied that the Minister will get sufficient proof of the justice of the case that has been made here to-day, but I sincerely hope that due regard will be had to the question of the means test.  In view of the fact that we are promised some amelioration at an early date of the conditions under which blind persons are suffering, I do not intend, Sir, to press the motion to a division.</P>

      <P>I move the following motion, standing in my name and that of Deputy Murphy:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Being of opinion that the existing scales of pensions applicable to widows and orphans are totally inadequate, having regard to the prevailing prices of commodities, Dáil Eireann is of opinion that widows' pensions should be increased to 25/-per week, and that in the case of widows having dependent children there should be paid to them, in respect of the oldest of such children, an allowance of 10/- per week, <Col N="1785" /> and in respect of the subsequent children 5/- per week until they reach the age of 16 years, or in the case of children suffering from infirmity rendering them unfit for gainful employment, during the continuance of such infirmity; and the Dáil is further of opinion that any income not exceeding £52 per annum enjoyed by a widow should not be taken into account when computing the net income of applicants for pensions under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts; and the Dáil further requests the Government to introduce the necessary legislative proposals for the purpose of giving effect to these views.</P>
    <P>According to our Constitution&mdash;that Constitution about which we hear so much from time to time, and much more outside this House than inside it &mdash;the right is accorded, on paper, at any rate, to food, clothing and shelter for every section of our citizens; and Article 41, I think, of that Constitution expresses the pious opinion that the proper place for the married woman is in the home.  If the proper place for a married woman, who is fortunate enough to have her husband in gainful employment, is the home, surely, then, the proper place of the woman who loses her husband&mdash;the widow who has the responsibility of looking after a number of orphans&mdash; is in the home.  I make that point at this stage, because, under the existing miserable rates of pensions provided for widows, and especially for widows who have orphans to look after, it is practically impossible for those widows, in the majority of cases, to remain at home.  The majority of them, and especially those who live in cities or towns, are forced, under existing circumstances, and by reason of the miserably low allowance of pensions provided, to go out and seek work, to the disadvantage, very seriously, in after-life, of the orphans. These orphans have a claim upon the mother, and it is the duty of the mother, if she can afford to do so, to remain at home and see to the proper upbringing of her children so as to make them fit, as far as they can be <Col N="1786" /> made fit by home training, for the difficult battle of life.</P>
    <P>Now, the rates of pension proposed in this motion have been regarded by the Minister and his colleagues as excessive and beyond the capacity of the people of this country to pay.  We, certainly, are not prepared to admit that, especially in view of the fact that it is the duty and responsibility of the Government of every country to provide a decent means of subsistence for every section of its citizens and, particularly, for those who are unable to look after themselves. It is not pretended that the rates proposed in this motion provide economic security for widows and orphans. They merely propose to raise the existing miserable rates of pension slightly above what is known as the &ldquo;poverty standard.&rdquo;  I think that it is right and proper on an occasion of this kind to summarise the most up-to-date information, so far as it can be secured by a private Deputy, so as to give members of the House an accurate view of the present position.</P>
    <P>The latest figures made available to me were furnished by the Minister for Finance on the 29th February, 1944. On that occasion I asked the Minister for Local Government if he would state in respect of the last year for which information was available (a) the total number of (1) contributory and (2) non-contributory pensions paid under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts, and (3) the number of beneficiaries in each case; (b) the number of pensions paid under each rate of benefit of 1/- per week and over, distinguishing between contributory and non-contributory pensions; (c) the number of such beneficiaries who received food vouchers and the total cost of such vouchers, and (d) the total sum paid in pensions in the case of (1) contributory and (2) non-contributory beneficiaries. The figures gave a very good view of the position prevailing at that time. The reply stated that figures as to the numbers of pensions paid in any year were not available, but figures were available showing the number of persons in respect of whom pensions were payable as at the last day of each month.  Figures were then given <Col N="1787" /> relating to the financial year ending 31st March, 1943.  These are the latest figures in my possession.  If the Minister has more up-to-date information &mdash;and I am sure he has&mdash;I trust he will give it to the House.  The contributory pensions payable in that year numbered 8,031 and the non-contributory pensions 27,711.  The total number of beneficiaries was 58,434.  I do not want to go into the figures in detail. I merely want to summarise them in a way in which they will be properly understood.</P>
    <P>From the tabular statement furnished to me, it would appear that, out of the total number of non-contributory pensioners, 26,080 were then in receipt of as low a pension as 10/- a week.  Only 1,631 were receiving pensions, in the non-contributory section, of 10/- and over.  I quote the figures in that summarised fashion to give Deputies a view of the position prevailing on the 31st March, 1943.  The Minister will hardly suggest that these figures go any distance towards showing that the reasonable needs of widows and orphans are being met. Out of the 26,080 persons in receipt of pensions of 10/- a week and under, about 13,000 were receiving pensions of 5/- a week and under.  I do not think a member of a Government would stand up in any of the few democratic parliaments left and say that he felt proud of that position, especially with the cost of living at its present high figure.</P>
    <P>It will be argued, of course, by the Minister that, in addition to the pensions paid on different scales ranging from 6d. per week to 21/6 per week, a certain number of these pensioners are getting food vouchers of a certain cash value.  I ascertained from the Minister, in reply to a question on that matter, that, of 58,434 persons then in receipt of pensions of varying amounts, only 23,227 were getting food vouchers.  It will also be argued that, in addition to the food vouchers, the Government recently made it possible, with the co-operation of the local authorities, for certain sections of these pensioners to get what are known as supplementary allowances. <Col N="1788" /> I have no figures to show the number of pensioners who are in receipt of supplementary allowances and I should be much obliged to the Minister or to the Parliamentary Secretary, if it is he who will reply, if he would give us the latest information on that aspect of the widows' and orphans' pensions scheme.  It is unfortunate that widows who desire to obtain these allowances have to go to the poor law authorities and prove to their satisfaction, which it is not easy to do, that they are entitled to them.</P>
    <P>According to the figures supplied to me on the occasion I mentioned, the total cost of the scheme for the payment of pensions up to that period was £731,147.  According to the figures furnished to me on that occasion, I think it is only right and proper to point out that the average pension paid under the contributory scheme for the year ending on the 31st March, 1943, was at the very low rate of 6/9 per beneficiary and under the non-contributory scheme at the much lower rate of 4/- per beneficiary.  Is there any Deputy or person in the country who believes in the provision of widows' and orphans' pensions who will stand up here or on a public platform outside and attempt to justify these low allowances, especially with the cost of living as it is to-day?</P>
    <P>We all have a share of responsibility as well as the Government for the legislation passed in this House.  I am sure no one would take the risk of standing up to defend the payment of such miserable allowances to the poor and the needy, especially to those who have no other means or income.  I wonder if Deputies who were not members of the House when the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act was passed would look at the tabular statement that was furnished to me in the House on the 29th February last, and ask themselves what in the name of goodness is the use of providing pensions at the rate of 6d., 1/-, 1/6 and 2/-, and, if you like, up to 5/- per week under existing circumstances?  We have people under the non-contributory section getting the princely sum of 6d. per week.  We have 301 getting 1/- per week, 33 getting 1/6 per week, 591 <Col N="1789" /> getting 2/- per week, 387 getting 2/6 per week, 1,336 getting 3/- per week, 1,511 getting 4/- per week and 101 getting 4/6 per week.  We have the big number of 12,675 in receipt of 5/- per week.  I should like to ask what does it cost the taxpayers to administer this miserable means test for the purpose of keeping down pensions to the people residing in the rural areas under this non-contributory scheme to figures of that kind.  What is the use of 6d. per week, or, if you like, 5/- per week to a widow who has probably to pay that much in rent if she lives in a village or a town?  Compare these figures with the pensions that are being paid by other countries in the Commonwealth, that is if this country still claims to be a member of the Commonwealth. In Great Britain you have a contributory scheme that provides if not princely, at least decent pensions for those who qualify.  In addition to the provision of pensions for those who are engaged in insurable occupations in Great Britain, you have a supplementary scheme in existence which is based on family needs.  That scheme is also in operation in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Under it a widow, with three children, is entitled to a pension of 52/6 per week.  The pension is based on family needs, on the sum that she has to pay in rent for her room or her house and to meet other charges. Under that supplementary scheme, children aged between 11 years and 16 years receive 9/- per week each.  A widow can receive for herself up to 20/- a week under that supplementary scheme.  A widow here in our part of the country, if she is able to give satisfactory proof to the home assistance officer, will get 2/6.  Under the supplementary scheme in Great Britain and Northern Ireland children between 11 and 16 years of age get 9/- a week each; children between eight and 11 years, 7/6 each per week, and for each child under eight years, 6/- per week.  Then there is an amount not stipulated&mdash;it is at the discretion of the assistance officer for the area&mdash;to meet the net rent payable so far as it is a reasonable rent.  That is not a fixed figure. I cannot imagine widows and orphans who reside in that part of this country <Col N="1790" /> being over-anxious to wipe out the Border if, when it is wiped out, they are going to be transferred into our non-contributory widows' and orphans' pensions scheme which would give them a maximum of 21/6 per week and a minimum as low as 6d. per week.</P>
    <P>We have heard a good deal about New Zealand and of the financial system there as well as of the social security plan that was pushed through by the Government of that country in 1938.  I listened a couple of years ago, about the time that Mr. Walter Nash, the Minister for Finance there, was on a visit to this country, to a speech of very doubtful wisdom that was delivered in this House by the present Minister for Local Government and Public Health criticising the financial system in that country, ridiculing the whole social security system there and prophesying&mdash;his prophecy did not turn out to be correct&mdash;that the country would be bankrupt in a couple of years.  I understand that the Minister for Local Government subsequently expressed regret, and rightly so, for having used the language that he did on that occasion.  In speaking on matters of this kind one is entitled to take the case of New Zealand in order to justify the claims contained in the motion and to point to what has been done in other countries.  Under the social security plan put into operation in New Zealand by Mr. Walter Nash, a widow with dependent children gets 30/- a week with 10/6 per week for each child up to 16 years of age or until 18 years of age if a child is still at school.  Widows with no dependent children are given 25/- a week and in addition can have a personal income up to £1 per week.</P>
    <P>It is interesting in connection with this matter&mdash;I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is well posted on matters of this kind&mdash;to quote from a document issued by Mr. Walter Nash inside the last three months.  In drawing a comparison in regard to the purchasing power of money in New Zealand and in Great Britain he made this statement&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It may be said here that the purchasing power of the £ in New Zealand <Col N="1791" /> is fully equal to what it would be in Great Britain&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to have that statement put on record.  Let us now compare the increase in the cost of living, since the outbreak of the war, in Great Britain, in this country and in New Zealand.  According to the latest official returns the cost of living has increased here by 71 per cent. over pre-war; in Great Britain the increase is only 27 per cent. while in New Zealand it is even lower&mdash;13½ per cent.  The purchasing power of money in these countries, according to the returns published in the Trade Journal for December 1, shows that workers, even with the advantage of wage increases, can in this country only purchase £70 worth of essential commodities compared to £100 pre-war, while in Great Britain they can purchase £124 worth of food or other essential commodities and the comparable figure for New Zealand is £123 worth.  If the Parliamentary Secretary has any doubt about these figures, they will be found in the latest edition of the journal issued by the International Labour Office associated with the League of Nations &mdash; the League of Nations that was, if you like.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that we will have a real League of Nations and not a league of notíons in the post-war period.  I have endeavoured briefly to summarise the position as I saw it on paper, here, in Great Britain and in New Zealand; and I have endeavoured to make as good a case as possible for the improvement in pension rates asked for in the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made here on many occasions, by me and by other Deputies, to the necessity for abolishing this miserable means test.  I would like to hear the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;or whatever colleague of his speaks for the Government, in reply to this motion&mdash;justify the continuance of this means test in the case of widows' and orphans' pensions and to tell the House&mdash;as he can, if he wishes&mdash;the cost of administering the means test. <Col N="1792" /> Why have we a means test applied to widows and orphans when there is no means test applied&mdash;and very properly so&mdash;in the case of children's allowances? If it is possible for the children of millionaires, if we have any, or wealthy people in this country, to qualify under our own Act for the payment of children's allowances, why is not the same principle applied under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act?</P>
    <P>This means test is costing us far too much.  In the case of small allowances, which it should be the right of these poor people to get in a Christian country, the means test should be wiped out and with it the high cost the taxpayers must bear for carrying on that farce.  We know perfectly well what happens and the way this means test is carried out in rural areas.  The investigation officers, who are paid very high salaries and have fairly heavy travelling expenses, go around and hold a sort of third degree inquiry into the method of living of these poor people, who are practically penniless. If they see a few hens knocking around, they want to find out how many dozen eggs those hens produced inside a fixed period; and, in some cases which have come under my notice, I have seen them assess the value of those eggs, which are sold in some cases by the owners of the hens, not at the price that would be received normally by the owner but at the retail price that a person who bought in a local shop would have to pay.  The whole thing is a farce, a costly farce, and it is about time it was wiped out, particularly in connection with the claims of widows and orphans and old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>Is it or is it not the right of the aged, when they come to a certain age, after service rendered to the country, to get these State allowances, without any third degree inquiry as to their domestic circumstances?  Surely it ought to be the right of widows, left without their bread-winners, to get this State allowance?  For goodness' sake, let us fix a reasonable allowance and cut out the means test and the farce associated with it for so many years. Some people think there should be <Col N="1793" /> some means test.  In the case of New Zealand, it is possible for a widow to have personal property up to the value of £500 and a weekly income up to £1 per week and, at the same time, qualify for a pension at the rate of 30/-, if with orphans, and at the rate of 25/- per week if without orphans. Look at the difference between the amounts allocated in New Zealand and in Northern Ireland, for which I have quoted the figures, and here in this country.  In New Zealand, where the cost of living is lower to-day than it is here, children get an allowance of 10/6 a week.  Here in the cities the scheme is 7/6 a week for the widow, against 30/- in New Zealand; 3/6 for the first dependent child and 1/6 in cities like Dublin and Cork for each other child.  Is that not an insult to people with intelligence and a Christian outlook?  One shilling and sixpence per week: where could any widow provide for them out of that?  Would she get enough milk for a child for 1/6 a week? In urban areas where the cost of living is nearly as high as in the city, the rate is 6/- a week for a widow, 2/6 for the first dependent child and 1/&mdash;a miserable 1/ &mdash;for each other child.  In the rural area, it is 5/- for a widow, 2/- for the first dependent child and again 1/- for each other child.  It is about time those figures were wiped off the Statute Book of a House that claims to be a democratic Assembly in a country that claims to have a Catholic and Christian Government.</P>
    <P>I could go on elaborating and quoting figures to justify the amendment of the existing legislation and the improvement of the miserable rates.  I will confine myself to one or two other cases which must be obvious to those who have studied the conditions of widows and orphans.  Take the case of a widow with five dependent children, living in Dublin.  As far as I can find out, she would be entitled to 17/- a week, plus food vouchers and any other supplementary allowances that might be made available. It is true that she also comes under the Children's Allowance Act, and in that case there would be an additional allowance of 7/6, bringing <Col N="1794" /> the maximum cash payment up to 24/6 a week.  Out of that sum, the widow has to provide for herself and five children, for clothes and fuel; and she has to provide the greater part of the food needed in a household consisting of six persons.  Can that be done in the City of Dublin by any widow&mdash;even the most thrifty widow&mdash; on a maximum cash allowance of 24/6 a week?  We all know perfectly well that in the most miserable tenement districts of this city you will not get a room for less than 10/- a week&mdash; is that an excessive figure to name; I do not think it is&mdash;and there is 14/6 in cash left to that widow to provide clothes and fuel and the greater part of the food consumed by the family for the whole week.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary or his colleagues attempting to justify that figure under existing circumstances?</P>
    <P>The same kind of case occurs in a town like Clonmel.  The same widow would have 12/6, plus food vouchers and 7/6 for three children who come under the Children's Allowance Act, making a total of £1 per week.  Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Morrissey know more about rents in Clonmel than I do, but at a guess I would say the average rent would be about 7/6 a week.  What is left for the widow and five children to purchase clothes and fuel?  These are some of the things that must be apparent to those who have studied the administration of this measure, under which these miserably low allowances are provided.  In my opinion, the allowances should be increased without further delay.</P>
    <P>Of course, I will be asked immediately where the money is to be found.  Naturally, I will be asked that question by the same Minister, probably, who boasts from time to time that this is one of the few small creditor countries in the world.  We have increased our deposits in the banks in the last six years by the respectable sum of £120,000,000.  What is the use of boasting about being a creditor country if we cannot provide a decent level of existence for those who have lost their breadwinners and who are either unable to provide for themselves or must go out to work and <Col N="1795" /> leave their children at home unattended, with all the consequences of that in later life?  What is money meant for?  What is the use of boasting about a Christian Constitution? There is no use in talking of what is only on paper if you do not implement it by providing food, clothes and shelter for those in need of it.</P>
    <P>We talk about the increase in our bank deposits.  There is plenty of money to be found if there is willingness on the part of those who have the power to provide it.  When we were confronted at the commencement of the emergency with a possible attack from outside upon the people of this State, every leader of every Party and every Deputy came together and quickly made up their minds that there was no limit to the money which could be found to defend this country against a possible attack from outside.  Here is an attack on the very existence of large numbers of our people&mdash;widows and children, people unable to look after themselves.  We provided millions for increasing the number of our Defence Forces, for the establishment of A.R.P. and everything else associated with the defence of this country. There is no limit to the amount which bankers and moneylenders were prepared to give for that purpose.  Who is it that is refusing a decent existence to the widows and orphans?  Is it the Parliamentary Secretary, or is it his boss, the Minister for Local Government? Is it the Minister for Finance? Surely it is not the average Deputy of any Party.  If a proposal of this kind were left to a free vote of the House, I have no hesitation in saying that the overwhelming majority of those who sit behind the Parliamentary Secretary and on every side of the House would find whatever money is needed to give decent pensions to widows and orphans.</P>
    <P>We should be ashamed to call this a Catholic and Christian country and the Government a Catholic and Christian Government; I am not emphasising the word &ldquo;Catholic&rdquo; for any particular purpose, but it is the common boast of those who speak at social functions.  I have heard members <Col N="1796" /> of the Government at Vincent de Paul meetings talk about the Constitution and the rights provided under the Constitution for the people. We hear a lot about it during elections.</P>
    <P>Let us have the Constitution which is there on paper in lovely language put into practice and, by doing so, make it possible for the majority of the widows who have to go out to work to maintain their children to remain at home and look after the well-being of their children and give them a training which will fit them for the difficult battle of life which lies in front of children who have lost their breadwinners.  I appeal to the sense of decency of members of the House. If they cannot see their way to accept the reasonable proposals made in this motion, they should, at any rate, increase the present miserable amounts provided under the contributory and non-contributory sections of the Widows' and Orphans' Pension Act and wipe out the miserable means test which is applied in connection with the non-contributory section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. I should like to remind the House again of what has already been pointed out by the proposer that the motion proposes three or four specific things.  It proposes to increase the allowance for widows, with or without dependents, to 25/- per week.  In the case of dependents, it proposes an allowance of 10/- for the eldest child and 5/- for each of the other children until they attain the age of 16 years. It proposes that applicants for pensions should not suffer from the decision that will follow the presentation of their case by reason of the fact that they possess means amounting to 20/- per week, and also that for that purpose any children suffering from any physical or mental infirmity should be included.  Let me take that aspect of the motion first and ask: can there be the least objection to a proposal of that kind?  Widows are amongst the most deserving sections of our people and are in a very helpless position owing to widowhood and the responsibility of dependent children. That position is considerably accentuated if any of the children are <Col N="1797" /> suffering from physical or mental infirmity that would prevent them following any employment.  That is one of the aspects of the present legislation dealing with widows' and orphans' pensions that calls out for immediate action.</P>
      <P>The mover of the motion has given the House an idea of the scope of this demand and the number of people concerned.  I have some figures which could be usefully added to supplement the figures given by Deputy Davin. In reply to a question asked by me on the 3rd October last, I was informed that on the 31st August, 1944, the number of persons in receipt of contributory widows' pensions was 9,952; of non-contributory pensions, 25,220; and that the weekly value thereof was £6,685 2s. 0d. and £7,460 6s. 0d. respectively.  Analysing the figures, the fact is revealed that the average weekly rate of contributory pensions paid is 13/5 and of non-contributory pensions 5/11 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that include children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear on that, but I think so.  That is the average weekly pension and I take it the pension is what all concerned receive. I put a further question to the Minister on the same day with a view to getting information in regard to certain aspects of the present administration of the Act.  I asked the Minister for Local Government if he would state the number of non-contributory pensions in respect of (a) widows, (b) orphans, and (c) widows and orphans jointly, payable at weekly rates of 1/-, 2/-, 3/-, 4/-, 5/-, 6/-, 7/-, 8/-, 9/-, 10/-, and over 10/- and the information I got is as follows: Rate of pension: 1/-, 306 widows; 2/-, 467 widows; 3/-, 1,232 widows; 4/-, 1,280 widows; 5/-, 12,032 widows; 6/-, 886 widows; 7/-, 1,479 widows; 8/-, 917 widows; 9/-, 631 widows; 10/-, 323 widows; over 10/-, 1,365 widows.  In regard to orphans who are segregated in this particular case, I presume by orphans are meant children both of whose parents are dead.  The particulars as to orphans' pensions were as follows: 2/-, 85; 3/-, 50; 4/-, 112; 5/-, 77; 6/-, <Col N="1798" /> 31; 7/-, 7; 8/-, 30; 9/-, 3; 10/-, 14; over 10/-, 21; a total of 430.  I should have said that the total number of widows benefiting by pensions at rates from 1/- to 10/- and over is 20,918. According to this table, 75 per cent. of widows' pensions are payable at the rate of 5/- per week or less.</P>
      <P>I consider that there is, on the face of it, an excellent case for doing something to improve this position.  I want to be quite frank with the House and with the Parliamentary Secretary.  If it is claimed that the rates asked for in this motion cannot be granted immediately, but that the matter will be kept in mind as a proposal for attainment as soon as possible, at least the responsibility is on the House and on the Parliamentary Secretary, as the member of the Government responsible for this particular form of social legislation, to make a beginning in the immediate future and to provide for the present a very substantial instalment of what is asked for in the motion.  Since this motion was tabled, the position has improved slightly. Widows in the county boroughs and urban areas, and even in the rural districts, are getting certain supplementary allowances, but such allowances merely touch the fringe of the problem. I think the Parliamentary Secretary would admit that that is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the House earnestly to consider the question of the means test associated with widows' and orphans' pensions.  It is considerably more rigid in the case of non-contributory pensions than in respect of old age pensions.  I think it is admitted that, so far as the Act goes, the administration of the Act by the officials in the Department of Local Government is humane and considerate.  I think it right to say that.  Generally speaking, I have not a great deal of fault to find with the method of investigation. There are exceptions, as Deputy Davin has said, but, generally speaking, the method of investigation of the cases is fair.  I should like to repeat that the attitude of the officials dealing with the Act, from the Controller down to the most junior official, is one of sympathy, humanity and kindness.  So <Col N="1799" /> far as I can judge, both by correspondence and personal interview, every possible assistance is given to the applicants or those representing them. But the officials must administer the law as they find it and, unquestionably, the law is very defective and lags very much behind in regard to this particular service.</P>
    <P>Clearly the question will arise&mdash;and we will be asked what suggestions we have on this side of the House for providing means to deal with this particular matter.  There are two classes involved.  Persons who benefit by way of contributory pensions are treated considerably better than those who receive non - contributory pensions. The case in regard to recipients of non-contributory pensions is as urgent as it could possibly be.  It may be that one of the approaches to this question, from a financial point of view, would be to create in this country an all-embracing scheme of insurance.  In order to help the most deserving and the least supported section of widows, those who benefit by non-contributory pensions, it may be that the general question of contributions to national health insurance would have to be reviewed, taking this aspect into account.  It may be that, in a short time, we will inevitably find ourselves in agreement with the conclusions of a very prominent person in this country who recently stated that the approach to the whole question of social security in this country should be along the lines of bringing 90 per cent. of the people within a scheme and providing a means by which the people concerned would be helped to a better degree of social security.  The Exchequer would be helped to provide for those who have come within the scheme since the Act was passed in 1935 and who are still almost where they were in 1935. That is a suggestion that, I think, is worthy of consideration.  However long the matter may be delayed, however discussion of it may be avoided, I think we will be driven to some sweeping reform of that kind in the future and perhaps in the very near future.</P>
    <P>In England, public opinion has been very much concerned with what has <Col N="1800" /> been described as the Beveridge plan. I am not suggesting that we could attain standards of the kind foreshadowed in that plan.  I admit that we would not have the resources to face a responsibility of that kind, but I do think the Parliamentary Secretary, who is a very keen student of economic matters and, I am sure, of the whole trend of world opinion in regard to social legislation and who, I feel sure, has approached keenly, and has given earnest study to, this whole question of social security and social problems, must realise that we cannot exactly stand still in this matter and that, in one way or another, we must be prepared to do much more than has been done up to the present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin has referred to New Zealand.  I think the best way to put the case to the House is to say that in New Zealand a widow without means is entitled to a pension of 30/- a week, with an allowance of 10/- for each child.  In other words, a widow with five children under 16 years of age would be entitled to £4 per week.  That is a very long distance from our position at the moment.  It is a gap that, perhaps, in our lifetime could not be entirely breached but it certainly ought to set us thinking and it certainly ought to be an incentive to us to make some beginning in this matter.</P>
    <P>I have given the House the figure of the average amount paid in widows' pensions in this country.  Some time ago a medical authority in this city, at a meeting of the Statistical Society, demonstrated that 14/- per week was necessary for the simplest form of diet for a man in this city and that 80 per cent. of that was necessary in the case of a woman.  Certainly that is a statement which cannot be ignored.  It comes from a very well-known and recognised authority.  If that is the minimum for the bare necessities of life in food for one person, then the case for the widows and orphans in the country in regard not alone to food but clothing, shelter and all the other expenses that follow in the case of young children&mdash;because we are dealing with young children where there are dependents&mdash;can be easily pictured and readily appreciated by the House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1801" /> I do not want to trespass on the time of the House at undue length.  The case has been very fully put forward by the mover of the motion.  But I do want to mention one thing before I conclude, and that is that in this House in 1929 I had the privilege of putting forward a proposal in favour of widows' and orphans' pensions, representing one of the first efforts that were made in an Irish Parliament to bring about a reform of this kind.  During the years between 1929 and 1935, I had the opportunity of joining in a campaign in support of this reform.  In this House in 1935, when the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Bill was passing through the Committee Stage, I was responsible for a number of amendments, totalling about 100, designed for the purpose of improving that Bill. As you, Sir, may recollect, a very large number of those amendments could not be moved because of the fact that they involved financial commitments, proposals in regard to which ordinary private members of this House are not allowed to formulate. But I do remember one particular incident on that occasion, and that was the concluding statement of the then Minister for Local Government, who is now Minister for Finance, Deputy O Ceallaigh.  He admitted that the measure then proposed and passing through the Committee Stage was a beginning in regard to pensions for widows and orphans.  Ten years have passed since then.  Might I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to remind the Minister for Finance&mdash;who is a very important Minister in a matter of this kind &mdash; of his statement on that occasion, and suggest to him that, after ten years' experience of that Act, and after a full examination of the very limited benefits afforded to widows and orphans under its provisions, the time has come for making one improvement on that beginning, and giving some substantial instalment of what is the due right of the widows and orphans in this country?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will be admitted that the case made for this motion, both by the mover and by the seconder, was a very good one.  I take it, however, from the number of <Col N="1802" /> files which I see in front of the Parliamentary Secretary, that the motion is not going to be accepted.  I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary or anybody else in the House will oppose the motion on the ground that the existing rates are sufficient or that the rates proposed in the motion would be more than enough.  Therefore, I assume that the reason which will be forthcoming from the Front Bench will be that the country cannot afford to pay the rate now proposed. I want to ask the House to look at this matter in the light of our experience, particularly our experience over the last eight or ten years, and to say whether that is a sound reason.  I should be inclined rather to say that this country cannot afford to allow the present rates to remain. It is known, of course, that there has been a considerable increase in disease in this country in recent years.  In particular, the increase in tuberculosis has been so marked that it has called for very special statements not only from responsible members of the Government, but from responsible people in the medical world also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will put this to the House: on the basis of the figures given here to-day by the mover of the motion and by its seconder in respect of what is allowed for a child and for the child's mother, is it any wonder that there is a marked increase in disease, and that there is particularly a marked increase in tuberculosis?  Whilst condemning children in this country to an allowance which can only mean malnutrition at its worst, which can only mean that each and everyone of those homes dependent on the miserable allowance we give them is a breeding ground for tuberculosis, is it not the sheerest humbug, if not hypocrisy, that side by side with this motion we have on the Order Paper a Bill to provide more accommodation in this country for people who are infected with tuberculosis? Whilst at one end we are refusing to give to people who are unable to provide for themselves an allowance which will enable them to sustain life, or give them an opportunity to fight disease, at the other end we are spending <Col N="1803" /> millions of pounds out of State funds and out of Sweep funds to build and maintain new hospitals.</P>
    <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister or any member of this House contend that it is possible to give a child anything approaching sufficient nourishing food on the rates that are at present allowed, even with the supplementary allowances?  I think the majority of us in this House are married.  We have children of our own; we have homes of our own to keep up; we have rents to pay, and so on.  To any member of this House, I do not care whether he is living in the city or in the town or in rural Ireland, I will put this question: &ldquo;How much per week will it cost you to give your child sufficient plain, ordinary, healthy food&rdquo;?  I suggest that, under present circumstances, the amount allowed under the existing Act would not clothe and provide boots or shoes for a child for 12 months, without spending one half-penny on food at all.  Those of us who have children of our own know that at the moment boots and shoes for children are at a very high price.  We know that, to say the least of it, the quality of those boots and shoes is not of the very best.  What is the use then in talking about trying to combat tuberculosis?  What is the use in having a committee set up in this country?  What is the use of trying to use every sort of subterfuge to get from the people money to fight tuberculosis?</P>
    <P>We have appeals made in every conceivable way to induce people to subscribe money to fight tuberculosis when, at the same time, we are condemning sections of our people to a miserable existence that must lead to under-nourishment and, of course, subsequently to disease.  I want to suggest that we are not going to get rid of tuberculosis or any of the other diseases that afflict our people, particularly children, until such time as we take steps to see that children who have no breadwinners to provide for them are provided for by the State, at least to see that they get sufficient nourishment, shelter and clothing.  I know, as the mover of the motion said, that we shall be asked where the <Col N="1804" /> money is to be got.  That very same question has been asked in this House in relation to every appeal made for better social services and many of those social services for which we were told at one time the money could not be provided, have already been put in operation.  Let me put this to the House.  Six or seven years ago the Defence Forces of this country were costing in the neighbourhood of £1,000,000 or £1,500,000.  When the war broke out, the House decided that whatever moneys were necessary to secure that as far as possible we would not be embroiled in the war, and that if we were embroiled our people would be equipped to the best advantage to meet any attack that could be made upon us, should be provided and the provision for the Army jumped from £1,000,000 or £1,500,000 to the neighbourhood of £10,000,000 a year.</P>
    <P>If anybody suggested in 1939 that £10,000,000 should be provided to see that every child in the country should get at least enough to eat, we know the cry of horror that would go up from certain individuals in this House and in the country outside.  May I suggest further that if we, like most other countries, had been unfortunate enough to be embroiled in this war, if we had been attacked, we would have to find not £1,000,000 or £10,000,000, but hundreds of millions?  In these circumstances, if we had been attacked and had to defend ourselves, these hundreds of millions would be forthcoming. Does not any reasonable person agree that it is absolutely facing the problem at the wrong end to be providing hospitals costing millions of pounds and to be making appeals to fight tuberculosis while, at the same time, we are compelling widows in this country to provide sufficient food, shelter and clothes for their children on an allowance of 1/6 per child per week?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the motion in so far as it might induce the Government to introduce the necessary legislation to amend the law relating to widows' and orphans' pensions.  I think in approaching this problem it is not sufficient merely to <Col N="1805" /> put down figures in an arbitrary fashion without inquiring into the amount required to keep a person or a family, as the case may be in the essential requirements of life.  Deputy Morrissey approached the matter from what I regard as the best angle.  We in this country are spending considerable sums to deal with disease.  We propose, as far as I can see, to spend further sums on large schemes to make the best provision that medical science can devise in order to combat tuberculosis. The Government appear to have become slightly nervous, if not panicky, recently at the remarkable rise in the incidence of that disease. Surely the increase in the incidence of that disease is confined particularly to the lowest paid or the worst-off section of the community?</P>
      <P>It is, of course, true to say that numerous families through one cause or another who are in a comparatively well-off position have amongst them members who are affected by the disease, but in the majority of cases those affected are confined to the poorer sections.  In many cases families where the breadwinner, the father or husband, has died, the children are dependent on the mother or some other guardian for a livelihood.  The situation in these families, particularly since the war, has deteriorated to such an extent that the amounts paid no longer provide the barest essentials.  I think the Government quite freely admit and realise that, but in order to ascertain what sums should be paid to these people I suggest that the actuarial investigation, which is provided for in Section 45 of the 1935 Act, should now be undertaken in order to see exactly the minimum sum required for each individual, a widow or child, as the case may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Numerous people in this country, and I presume all members of the House, particularly the Government, have given consideration to schemes that have been formulated in other countries, in particular to the scheme known as the Beveridge plan.  It is possible because of the publicity and attention which that plan has evoked that our minds are more directly brought to bear on the problem here. <Col N="1806" /> It is true that the vast plan outlined there is one suited to a country in which the income is far in excess of our income here, of a country which is at the present time producing a far greater output in practically every sphere of production.  It is possible that when our minds get to work on that plan that we forget that our income is far less, that our resources are considerably smaller than the resources available there to be devoted to the operation of that plan.  It is true, too, that the sums which we propose to spend here, which we are attempting to secure by voluntary effort on the one hand, and by taxation on the other, are increasing one year after the other in order to fight disease, particularly tuberculosis.  I seriously put it to the Government that if an actuarial inquiry has not been held, or if they have not been able to find any report on it, one should now be undertaken.  I really think that this must be portion only of a broader scheme.  Originally when the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act was introduced it was one of the pioneer movements in that connection.</P>
    <P>More recently as a result, I presume, of advances in public opinion throughout the world, and particularly throughout that portion of the world with which the people of this country are more closely associated, or more closely affected by, it is realised that social insurance, provision for the sick, the infirm, for orphans and others who are unable to provide for themselves, must be made by the State.  In order that such provision may be made by the State, money has to be found somewhere, and if taxation is unable to bear further increases&mdash;I think it has reached in this country an extremely high level&mdash;then a contributory scheme, a scheme which will embrace contributions from people other than those directly affected, must be brought into being.</P>
    <P>Recently the Government rejected a plan which was put forward.  There is no point whatever in disguising the fact that they were perfectly right in rejecting it.  The plan was put forward, based on the desirability of providing for those people, without first undertaking <Col N="1807" /> an inquiry to ascertain what financial commitments would be involved. It is possible at any time to devise a scheme, but unless that scheme is put on a basis that has some relation to the actual position, it is little better than mere day-dreaming. That particular scheme, in my opinion, started at the wrong end.  An actuarial inquiry should have been made first, and should not have been left as purely a secondary matter.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the section of the 1935 Act which provides for an actuarial inquiry is sufficient to cover all the details of a comprehensive social insurance scheme, but at any rate some provision is made there in order to ascertain, in respect of widows and orphans, what would be required.  I seriously suggest that such an inquiry should be undertaken. It is equally true that the amount which is now paid to widows and orphans was fixed at a time when the cost of living was approximately half what it is at the present time, and, while a large sum would be involved by increasing the existing benefits, I consider the Government would be well advised to make some change in the legislation.  While you will be immediately confronted with the problem of obtaining the money necessary to meet the increased charge, I think Deputy Morrissey has put his finger on the kernel of the problem.  If we are prepared to find money, if we are prepared to secure, by borrowing or taxation, the amount required to fight the increase in tuberculosis, to meet the increased expenditure which that disease involves, I believe it would be far sounder from a public health point of view, and even from an economic point of view, to spend the money in increased benefits now to widows and orphans and thereby obviate expenditure in dealing with the disease and, possibly, eventually increasing the benefits when it might be too late.  I believe that better results would be obtained if proper provision, such as I have suggested, were made in the initial stages.</P>
    <P>I think there is little further to be said on this matter.  Sufficient figures <Col N="1808" /> have been given, and the Parliamentary Secretary is fully aware of the amounts paid, and so also are practically all Deputies.  The whole question resolves itself into whether we are prepared to spend in order to prevent or whether we will wait until we have to cure.  I certainly believe, and I think the Parliamentary Secretary believes, that it is better to spend on prevention than on cure.  By increasing the benefits now we can better fight disease.  I believe that now, when the Department of Local Government is split into three sections&mdash;not literally split into three sections, although I understand in one particular respect there was a certain difference of opinion&mdash;and when there are three people responsible for looking after the affairs of that Department, we may expect some advance. I further believe that the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary are more advanced than other members of the Government in this matter and perhaps we may hope, with their co-operation, that something better than the existing benefits will be paid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support this motion, mainly because I think it is desirable that something should be done.  While supporting the motion, I would not like to see legislation introduced only for the purpose of implementing the proposals contained in the motion.  I think if legislation is to be introduced at all it must be of a much more comprehensive nature.  If the scale of allowances to widows and orphans is to be increased, there must be a stepping-up of other social services, and, if that is to be brought about, I think it will be necessary to have a very far-reaching and comprehensive insurance scheme.  There is need, therefore, for a thorough survey of the whole question of social insurance and social security; but even that alone would not be sufficient unless there was also consideration given to the economic position of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>References have been made to New Zealand, to the very generous social services provided there, but I think it is necessary to point out that in New Zealand there has been not only a <Col N="1809" /> stepping-up of the social services, but also a stepping-up of the productive capacity of the people, and that has been brought about mainly by the security which has been given to the agricultural producer in regard to prices and markets&mdash;a security which has enabled him to increase the volume of his output and thereby made it possible to provide more generous social services for the people who are unable to work or maintain themselves. Therefore, in dealing with this question it would be necessary to deal very comprehensively not only with our social position, but also with our economic position.</P>
    <P>Social services, as I understand them, may be divided into two kinds: those which result in the redistribution of the national income, in the taking of portion of the national income from one section and giving it to another, and those which add to the national income inasmuch as they add to the goods or commodities which represent the essential requirements of our people. Housing, sewerage and public amenities of that kind would, I think, come under the heading, not of social services which take from one section and give to another, but of social services which add to the general wealth of the community.</P>
    <P>The particular social service embodied in this motion aims at taking from those who can afford it a certain amount of their income and giving it to those who are in need.  There is, of course, a limit to the extent to which any community can go in regard to the redistribution of national income.  If you take too much from those you consider can afford it, it may have the effect of curtailing production.  If you take away the incentive and the means of adding to production, the result may be a cutting down of production and, in any case, even if it did not have that effect, you cannot go on steadily increasing the amount from year to year which you can give to the poorer sections of the community, while there is no increase whatever in the national income.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the fundamental matter which has to be considered in relation to this motion, and every similar <Col N="1810" /> motion which may come before the House, is the importance of adding to the national pool of goods and commodities out of which every social service must be drawn.  There is, as Deputy Morrissey pointed out, in the matter of the increase asked for here the other side of the account: the saving which will certainly be effected in regard to expenditure on public health and the treatment of diseases, and not only the saving that will be effected in that direction, but in the strengthening of our position as a community by making our people, and particularly our working people, more healthy and more happy than they are at present.</P>
    <P>These are the considerations which I think should be brought to bear upon this problem, and it is a matter of urgent importance that this whole question should be gone into very carefully by those who have control of administration here.  They should not hesitate about, or postpone, decisions on these important matters until after the war.  These problems should be tackled here and now.  The period after the war will in all probability be a period of unsettlement, a period of unrest.  It is necessary that our community should be strengthened and safeguarded by having plans carefully laid, not only for looking after those who are in need, those who are affected by poverty and distress, and those who are the victims of tragic circumstances such as are envisaged in this motion but for ensuring that the wealth of the entire community will be such as will make it possible to carry into effect the generous schemes which we all desire to see carried into effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>This resolution gives us an opportunity of discussing the widows' and orphans' pensions scheme, and, from that point of view, it is valuable, since, when the Estimates are being discussed, the particular Vote is generally passed without very much comment.  I should like to say, in the first place, that the Government has been expanding social services ever since 1932 and that <Col N="1811" /> recently we added to the national taxation a sum of about £2,250,000 in the shape of children's allowances. Therefore, any appeal to the Government for increases in social services will always be listened to with a sympathetic ear.  We do not require convincing as to the desirability of doing what we can to secure the more necessitous class of person against every sort of difficulty, every sort of adversity, which they may meet. The questions which arise are whether the particular suggestion in this resolution is a desirable one, whether we can afford it, and, above all, whether it was ever our intention under the original Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act that such sums should be paid under the scheme.  The first point I should like to make is that there are two types of widows' and orphans' pension&mdash;contributory and non-contributory. The House will remember that the basis of the original Act was a contributory scheme of widows' and orphans' pensions.  A majority of the House felt it desirable that, so far as widows were concerned, it would be a good thing if (a)  the State (b)  the employer and (c)  the employee cooperated to provide a fund out of which widows' pensions would be paid. The non-contributory scheme arose out of the fact that there is a large class of self-employed persons in the country from whom contributions cannot conveniently be collected who are not associated in an organisation with employers and employees.  It was felt that something should be done to help them, that the State should step in and pay the cost of their pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, any proposal for a drastic increase in widows' and orphans' pensions must be related to the fact that the contributory scheme is there, that so long as the House believes in the contributory principle in regard to pensions paid to widows and persons earning a wage, any non-contributory rate granted must bear some relation to the contributory rate, and that, therefore, if there is to be a big increase in widows' and orphans' pensions non-contributory rates, the first question we must ask ourselves is: <Col N="1812" /> what happens to the contributory scheme; can the employers and employees afford such an increase in the contribution as would still induce people to take part in the contributory scheme, and what, in future, is to be the relation between the contributory and non-contributory scheme?  I admit that the fact that we have certain services that at the moment are non-contributory, and other that are contributory, complicates the discussion, but for the purposes of this debate and the matter we have under discussion I must take it as being the opinion of the Government that the widows' and orphans' pensions scheme is suitable and consistent with the contributory principle, and that we must take into account that there are people in certain parts of the country, who are self-employed, and from whom the contributions cannot easily be collected. I think that that is a reasonable approach to the problem, and I think that it is important that members of this House should face the issue in regard to this matter of contributory pensions in the proper way.</P>
    <P>Now, that does not mean that we would not like to increase widows' and orphans' pensions.  It does not mean that at some time in the future we might not be able to increase widows' and orphans' pensions, but it does indicate, as I have said, that the basis of the scheme was primarily designed from the contributory point of view, although, at all times, when it was discussed, it was also related to the conditions of the non-contributory class. The Minister for Industry and Commerce, when speaking on the Children's Allowances Bill, adverted to the fact that the children's allowances scheme was a non-contributory scheme, covering everybody in the community, and he warned the House that, having regard to the national income of the country, it would be most difficult to extend social insurance in any form which would require a very largely increased State subvention. He pointed out that the addition of the children's allowances scheme to the present social services, as established by this Government and by the previous Government&mdash;although <Col N="1813" /> very largely by this Government&mdash; involved a very big increase in taxation, and he made a general statement that we would have to wait and see how far we may develop our national income and what our post-war prospects would be in connection therewith before we could increase, to any large extent, State subventions towards social services, and particularly in regard to permanent social services in the country, as distinct from the amounts we have paid out for certain services as a result of the emergency.</P>
    <P>Bearing that in mind, I should like to advert to some of the difficulties that present themselves in regard to the widows' and orphans' pensions scheme.  Some of them have been adverted to before, but I think they will bear repetition.  There are now 35,000 of these pensioners, which represent 46 per cent. of all eligible widows, and it is only ten years since the scheme was introduced.  Whether that is a large or a small percentage can be argued one way or the other, but I would say, having regard to the condition of the country, we need not feel ashamed that we have been able to pay pensions to the extent of 46 per cent. of those widows who are eligible.  Now, of those 35,000, there are, roughly speaking, 25,000 non-contributory pensioners; something like 10,500 are in receipt of children's allowances, and of the 10,000 contributory pensioners, 1,400 pensions are given to persons in agricultural employment.</P>

The 9,952 contributory widows' pensions include 10,542 children's allowances; and the 25,220 non-contributory widows' pensions include 11,953 children's allowances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might be permitted to continue.  I think, that what I have said indicates the position, and that the figure represents 46 per cent. of those who are not eligible for pensions, except for means.  Now, taking the 25,000 non-contributory pensions, of those about 20,000 have no family that can be counted for the purpose of pension; in other words, they have no dependent family.  It is interesting to realise that five-sevenths of the cost of the non-contributory pensions is given to people who have no dependent family, and we must realise that a considerable number of those people do receive some sort of support from their grown-up children. There may be some who do not, but if we are to examine this question in a reasonable way, I think we must assume that a considerable number of those widows do receive some sort of support from their dependents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, having heard the views of some members of the Opposition with <Col N="1816" /> regard to the low rates of pensions, it must be remembered that, when it is stated that a number of those people are receiving pensions at very low rates, we have to assume that many of them have alternative means, and, because they are only in receipt of 1/6 or even 6d. a week, of a pension, it must be assumed that they have alternative means of support.  It means that they have a certain quantum from other sources.  In that connection, I may say that I do not think it is reasonable to relate this matter of widows' and orphans' pensions to measures that have been introduced here and that were designed to prevent tuberculosis or to inhibit that disease in its early stages.  We are here discussing widows' and orphans' pensions and, in particular, widows' pensions, and I do not think that widows, as a class, can be held to be suffering largely from T.B., which generally sets in between the ages of 15 and 35.  Therefore, I think that for the purposes of this debate it would be better for Deputies to confine themselves merely to the question of widows' and orphans' pensions, and to discuss such problems as tuberculosis on some other occasion, such as the Budget, when it would be more proper to raise such a matter.</P>
    <P>I do not think that we shall get very far if we try to discuss the question of an increase in the pensions of widows and orphans owing to the menace of tuberculosis.  The Government, as members of the House are aware, have taken steps to deal with that problem already and are prepared to take further steps so far as it is possible to do so.  Deputy Cosgrave was rather contradictory.  He said, in the first place, that he supported the motion and then he began to ask a series of question as to whether we could afford the increase or not.  He aided the Government considerably in what he said in that he raised a query as to whether we could afford this expenditure, having regard to the taxable income of the country or whether the surplus from our production would enable us to pay for so expensive a service. He asked for an actuarial inquiry.  He related the actuarial <Col N="1817" /> inquiry to the amount that a person should be paid in order to secure an adequate livelihood.  I think that he used the term wrongly.  An actuarial inquiry in connection with widows' and orphans' pensions would be of a negative character.  It would be an inquiry as to how we were spending the money, whether wisely or otherwise, and whether the contributions made were sufficient to keep the fund in order.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan referred to the need for an increase in agricultural economic security and said that social services were very desirable in so far as they redistributed the national income&mdash; from the more wealthy to the poorer classes.  I should like to sound a note of warning there.  When we speak of the redistribution of national income by social services, we must remember that contributions to taxation must be horizontal as well as vertical.  There can be no question that taxation for redistribution of national income does not only take income from the wealthier classes and give it to the poorer classes of the community but does, in effect, bring about a compulsory saving on the part of the poorer section, who pay their share of the contributions. Therefore, in discussing an increase in widows' and orphans' pensions and the cost of such a scheme, we have to bear in mind that all contributions to taxation have a horizontal as well as a vertical effect.</P>
    <P>Let me give some more figures which will convey an idea of the extent of the scheme.  On the 31st December, 1943, 642,000 persons were insured under the widows' and orphans' pension scheme, from which figure the House will realise that the scheme had only just begun to come into operation after ten years.  Although that number have been insured, only 10,000 contributory pensions are at present being paid and it will be many years before the scheme comes into full operation.  The cost of the whole of the widows' and orphans' pensions in 1943 was £844,000, of which employers and employees contributed £242,000.  The cost of administration, about which a good deal has been said, varied between 9 per cent. and 10 per cent. of the outgoings in respect of the <Col N="1818" /> widows' and orphans' pensions and amounted to about £80,000.  I should like immediately to dispose of the argument that the means test is an administrative cost which, if removed, would have the effect of enabling pensions to be paid in other cases and that, apart from being undesirable socially, it is simply an administrative cost with which we could dispense so as to make moneys available for further pensions.  It is very hard to estimate what the effect of wholly eliminating the means test would be in connection with non-contributory pensions. It is very hard to say what reduction would take place in the administrative cost if we were to eliminate the means test.  Roughly, non-contributory pensions would rise from £1,500,000 to £2,000,000 per annum. That, related to an administrative cost of £80,000, will enable the House immediately to realise that it is not the cost of administration which is debarring certain classes of widows from receiving pensions which would otherwise be paid them.</P>
    <P>In addition to the widows' and orphans' pensions scheme, established before the emergency, there are available 2/6 food vouchers in the urban areas.  That amount is paid not only to widows but to all children of widows.  The House should bear in mind, when considering this widows' and orphans' pension scheme, that the food-voucher scheme, which applies not only to the widow but to all the children of that widow, constitutes a valuable accretion to the amount she receives.  In addition, there is a 1/6 increase for widows who do not get the food vouchers.  There are also the cheap fuel scheme and the new boot scheme, by which a large number of boots are made available at reasonable prices for children.</P>
    <P>At this stage, it would be wise if we were to relate the terms of these proposed increases to the total cost of our social services and see where we stand in regard to the estimated cost of the proposed scheme in relation to their cost.  This gives me a valuable opportunity to provide the House with some figures which serve to show the tremendous burden placed on the taxpayer by <Col N="1819" /> our social services as at present established. I propose to compare the amounts voted by the Oireachtas for social services at various periods.  In 1938&mdash;the last normal year&mdash;for social services proper, excluding such things as housing grants, Gaeltacht services, employment schemes and similar services&mdash;the Government issues amounted to £5,616,000 odd.  In the 1944-45 Budget, the cost of these services of a purely normal type had increased to £7,387,000.  That figure includes the proportion of the children's allowances paid in the current financial year.  The increase in the cost of social services directly due to the emergency amounted to £1,276,500.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The total figure, therefore, including only a proportion of the children's allowances, was £8,663,800.  That represents an increase of £3,000,000 on the 1938 figure, or 60 per cent.  If you were to include the full children's allowances and assume that they had been paid in the current financial year, the cost of social services, including emergency services, would be £9,413,000.  It is possible to calculate these figures in a different way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I could spend the next hour reading figure after figure. Most of those figures can be found in the Library.  In order to make a comparison, I have made a separate series of calculations to see how far they can be compared with other countries. Our social services, when considered in relation to our total national income, have reached a point where we can say that we are not behind other nations, and that we have nothing to be <Col N="1821" /> ashamed of.  For that purpose I have taken the social services provided by the local authorities and by the State and divided them into two classifications, services that may be described generally as income&mdash;maintenance services such as old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, etc.  The total expenditure under that heading in the last year for which we have estimated the national income&mdash;the year 1938&mdash; was £7,407,000.  The expenditure under what may be described generally as medical treatment services, from the moneys raised locally and nationally, was £3,037,000.  These two figures give a total of £10,444,000.  That sum represents expenditure on services which, according to the International Labour Office, can be considered as social services and I have compared the expenditure on them to the national income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the House will accept my statement that I have done my best to make a fair comparison and not to include services that are not indicated by the International Labour Office, and on the other hand not to exclude services which could properly be included for the basis of comparison.  If we assume, for the sake of argument, that we had passed the Children's Allowances Act in 1938 it would add another £2,250,000 to that cost.  The House may say that is unfair since the cost of living has gone up since then, and that maybe we would not have paid children's allowances at the present rate on the then cost of living. That, of course, is a matter of pure speculation.  I think myself that probably, having regard to everything, we would hardly have reduced the children's allowances from 2/6 to a lower figure.  Even though the House may be loath to indulge in my speculation, I think that we could fairly, for the purposes of the argument, assume that we would have paid the children's allowances in 1938 at the present rate. If we do that then the cost of our social services gives us the total figure of £12,700,000.  Our national income in 1938, as calculated by Professor Duncan with, perhaps, a few reservations which are generally accepted by people who claim to be statisticians, was £154,000,000.  The cost of our <Col N="1822" /> social services, therefore, amounted to 8.1 per cent. of the national income. I am not prepared to stand rigidly over that figure.  For the purposes of my argument, I do not mind very much whether in fact it was 7½ per cent., 8½ per cent. or 9 per cent.  According to the calculation that I have made, it is 8.1 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the <i>International Labour Review</i> for November, 1943, the following statement occurs:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Estimates of disbursements for income maintenance and medical cash services under the schemes of New Zealand and the U.S.S.R., now in operation and under the Beveridge Plan, the Marsh Plan (Canada) and the Wagner-Murray Bill (U.S.A.) suggest that a minimum figure of 10 per cent. of the national income must be counted on for financing a comprehensive social security plan&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I hope the House fully comprehends what that means.  According to the International Labour Office review that is what is regarded as reasonable: that you have to go up to that level. The implication there is that you cannot go very much above it, and that in fact the social security plans provided in those countries do not total more than 10 per cent. of the national income.  Now their method of calculating the national income may be different from ours, but taking the matter generally, I think it can be said that I have not tried to take undue political advantage of the House by basing my calculations on figures which have no relation to reality.  I have done my best to make a good comparison with the International Labour Office method of calculation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is based on figures for various years before the war.  Some countries took one year and other <Col N="1823" /> countries took another year.  Sir William Beveridge made a complete analysis of the pre-war national income.  He made an estimate of the post-war income and of the changes in the value of money, and applied his figures in that way as those who have read his report will recollect.  The figures I have given indicate that, although we may in the future increase our social services, the social services already established here are somewhere near the limit possible, having regard to our national income.  Those people who sometimes talk rather too glibly about applying the Beveridge scheme to this country and of including the same allowances as those which obtain in Great Britain should bear this in mind: that whether we pass the proportion recognised internationally as being the general proportion for our own good, we must at least have regard to that proportion and to what has happened elsewhere.  We must think twice before we start removing surplus income from the community which may have the most adverse repercussions on our national economy.</P>
      <P>This figure of £12,700,000, which, as I have said, includes children's allowances in 1938, amounted to nearly a quarter of the whole agricultural net income of the country in that year; it amounted to half of the estimated industrial income of the country in that year; it amounted to the whole of the rents which were estimated to have been levied by landlords on tenants in that year.  I am describing the various forms of national income. Nearly a quarter of the income, taken by itself, would be represented by these social services, with the children's allowances added as a speculation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we come to consider countries like New Zealand, we have to bear in mind that, in 1935, according to a book by Colin Clark, entitled &ldquo;Conditions of Economic Progress&rdquo;, which is a most advanced study of national incomes, the national income of New Zealand per head had already passed that of the United States and Great Britain and that was due largely to the fact that it was an undeveloped <Col N="1824" /> country, occupied by a small population, with immense national agricultural resources.  It would be utterly impossible and impracticable for us to compare the rates of social services in New Zealand, or in any country with an income three or four times that of our own, in order to produce an argument for increasing the social services in this country.  It is reckoned by one economist&mdash;Professor Shields, of the National University, in the course of a debate at the Statistical Society&mdash;that to apply the Beveridge scheme holus-bolus to this country would cost £25,000,000 a year.  His method of calculation may be one which can be variously interpreted, but whether he is under-estimating or over-estimating, it indicates the difficulty of applying other countries' rates of social services to this country.</P>
    <P>I have shown, I think, what the Government has done in establishing social services, at very heavy cost, and I would like now to proceed to a further examination in more detail of the terms of the motion.  Before we consider what these proposed new services would cost, we must see what the Government has done, since the emergency commenced, to provide for an increase in the cost of living in connection with widows and orphans.  I have prepared some figures which may be very interesting to the House, showing the percentage increases in the various services that have already been paid, under the children's allowances scheme and under the widows' and orphans' pensions scheme.</P>
    <P>The cost-of-living index has increased by 70 per cent, but there must be two reservations made in that regard.  First of all, people living in rural districts largely produce food at their own cost of production and, therefore, the cost of living, although it has increased for them in respect of clothing&mdash;very largely in connection with agricultural boots&mdash;and agricultural parts, no statistician and no farmer could claim that the cost of living increase of 70 per cent. could be said to apply to the agricultural community, since the agricultural community have to a certain degree been responsible for it.  We have paid increased <Col N="1825" /> prices for our produce, in order to attract greater production and in order to enable the farmers to overcome any difficulties.  In other words, farmers produce goods at their own cost of production and, to that extent, they are better off than people in the towns who have to pay for the goods after they are produced and after the wholesale and retail charges have been added.</P>

      <P>The increase in the urban area, the increase of 70 per cent., is subject to another modification: the number of foods bought before the war is not the number of foods bought now; and from that standpoint, although there has been; admittedly, an enormous increase in the cost of living, I do not think the Government is prepared to accept 70 per cent. as a fair estimate, without mentioning these modifying factors by which the nature of the index is altered.  Bearing that in mind, let us see the effect of the increases in widows' and orphans' pensions, by including the food voucher scheme and the children's allowances scheme.  Let us take a widow with no children, unaffected by the children's allowances schemes, but affected by the voucher scheme.  In the case of the non-agricultural contributory pension &mdash; 10/- &mdash; the increase is 25 per cent.; in the case of the non-contributory pension, in incorporated towns of 7,000 population or under, it is 49 per cent.; in the case of the maximum non-contributory pension in the urban area as distinct from the borough area, it is 44 per cent.; and in connection with the borough area it is 35 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now take as an example the case of a widow with three children.  I am not going to repeat all the categories. The increases in these cases, not counting children's allowances and counting <Col N="1826" /> only the food-voucher allowance, are 49,109,102 and 74 per cent.  Including the new children's allowances, made to a widow with three children, they are 61, 137, 125 and 92 per cent.  Deputies will have noted already that the increase has long gone past the increase in the cost-of-living index.</P>

      <P>Since the House seems to be so interested, I will be a little more detailed when I come to the next figures.  I have just a few more and do not wish to bore the House. For a widow with five children, the present rate of pension per week, for a contributory pensioner, is 27/-, including food allowances; this makes a percentage addition of 54 per cent. and, counting children's allowances, 82 per cent.  The corresponding figures for various classes of widows in that category go up to 193, 180 and 129 per cent. I need not give the figures for a widow with seven children, but if any Deputy desires those figures in detail, he can ask for them in the form of a Parliamentary Question.  The figures have been carefully prepared and illustrate the point I wish to make&mdash;that we have done our best to provide increases to widows, particularly those with dependents, which have some bearing&mdash;and a very satisfactory bearing&mdash;on the increase in the cost of living, taken at the figure of 70 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The first percentages I gave were for widows with no children.  Now, bearing these increases in mind, let us examine in detail the terms of the motion.  It is proposed that widows' pensions should be increased to 25/- per week.  In connection with dependent children, in the case of the eldest of such children the allowance should be 10/-; and in respect of subsequent children 5/- each until they reach the age of 16 years. There was no mention of what was to happen to orphans, but I presume the allowance would be the same as that for the eldest of the children.</P>
      <P>Let us bear these increases in mind and see the effects.  The first result is that, competing with the contributory scheme of insurance, the rates of which are well known to Deputies, the contribution from the employer and the employee, will be a scheme which will have the effect of practically cutting out the contributory scheme altogether.  Is it the desire of the House or anybody in the House that the contributory widows' and orphans' pension scheme should be abandoned because of a non-contributory scheme which is so much more attractive?  You will draw in quite a huge class of widows whose relatives would not be disposed to take part in the contributory scheme and it would be difficult for the Government to insist that they should pay contributions thereto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, those persons in the House who approve of a general plan of social insurance based on contributions from employers and employees and the State and who frequently advert to the necessity of extending it if at all possible, should bear in mind that, if we start giving large increases of this kind, unrelated to the general cost of other social services, unrelated to the amounts paid for other <Col N="1829" /> social services, the first result is the immediate destruction of the contributory principle.  We have had an estimate prepared in the Department of what the cost of this scheme would be per annum and the cost would amount to approximately £5,000,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It represents very nearly the whole cost of the social services in 1938.  Although we had complaints from the Opposition that the social services at that time were not adequate, I do not recall members of the Labour Party proposing an immediate all-over increase in respect of one social service, among many other social services, amounting to nearly the whole cost of the social services for that year.  The House will recall the statement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce as to the cost of the children's allowances scheme.  He said that the produce of the following taxes would be required to pay for the children's allowances scheme as at present established:&mdash;1/-in the £ on the income-tax; 1/- per lb. on tobacco; 2d. per lb. on tea; ½d. per lb. on sugar; and a penny on a pint of beer.  If you double these figures they become rather frightening, but, when doubled, the approximate cost of this proposal will be realised, assuming the law of diminishing returns would not operate when these increased taxes were imposed.  I know very well that it can always be argued that the Budget has been constantly increased in the past and that it may increase in the future and that the mere argument that social services cost money is not by itself the whole reply to a motion <Col N="1830" /> of this kind.  There are a number of issues we have to consider.  What happens when a widow with 25/- per week reaches the age of 70?  Is her pension to revert to 10/-.  In fact, when you compare these rates with other social services, almost inevitably the result would be that the whole cost of social services would not only be increased by £5,000,000, but would be trebled or quadrupled.  In fact, I can think of no better way of causing immediate and serious inflation of the currency than, first of all, raising wages in order that the contribution for the contributory scheme should be such as to keep the contributory scheme going on with the non-contributory scheme and, secondly, the raising of the other social services so as to be in line with these very extravagant and extreme proposals.</P>
      <P>I tried to give the House a picture of the social service position as a whole in this country.  I have indicated that this Government will, when it thinks fit, continue the work of improving the social services; that we have it always in our mind; that we are aware of the value of bringing security to every class in the community; that we must base our future decisions on what the national income of the country is likely to be; on the effect of collecting surplus income from the community; whether it is likely to increase employment or increase our agricultural exports or increase the production of home industry; or whether it will not do evil in one direction for the good it does in another.  I suppose any Government in office has always to make that statement when confronted with demands of this kind.  I can only assure the House that we shall continue to bear this important problem in mind.  We gave evidence that we had not stopped thinking about social services when we established children's allowances last year.  But to accept this proposal in its present form would be utterly impossible and would immediately result in the gravest financial repercussions throughout the State.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to say anything on this motion but, having heard the Parliamentary Secretary, I feel compelled to express my sympathy <Col N="1831" /> with the late Thomas Sexton when, on a famous occasion, having heard a spate of statistics from the Government side of the House, he was heard to say that there are three kinds of lies&mdash;lies, damn lies and statistics.  I followed the Parliamentary Secretary some of the way but, when he got into the wood of statistics, I must confess I got lost.  However, I did understand him to say that, assuming that children's allowances had been paid in 1938, the cost of children's allowances together with other social services in that year would have exceeded the national income from agriculture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  The Deputy misunderstood me.  I said it would amount to, approximately, one-fourth of the agricultural income. I said it was equal to the income derived from rents in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will agree that the year 1938 was hardly a fair one as a basis of comparison.  That was the year in which the economic war ended and the agricultural industry was in a very low state.  However that may be, the national income was then estimated to be £154,000,000, and, on that basis, the social services were calculated to amount to 8.1 per cent. of the national income.  In subsequent remarks the Parliamentary Secretary told us that social services of the type contemplated under the Beveridge scheme would roughly approximate to 10 per cent. of the national income.  On that basis alone, it is clear that we have not yet come within a considerable distance of 10 per cent. of the national income.  I am sure the estimated national income this year is nearer to £200,000,000, if not over £200,000,000, and that we would in this country be capable, of bearing a higher scale of expenditure for social services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not concerned with that, because I feel we are approaching this problem from the wrong angle.  The encyclicals of His Holiness the Pope have laid down that the wage-earner should be given a wage which would <Col N="1832" /> enable him to provide not only a home, food, clothing, education, and all that goes to the maintenance of family life, but also to put by savings for his old age and, as we say, for the rainy day. If the problem of social services is ever to be tackled satisfactorily, it will have to be done on a wage basis.  The wage, therefore, should be based, not on the capacity of the man to earn but on family requirements.  If a family wage were operating in this country we should be saved the necessity of finding stop-gap bounties from the State for every conceivable type of individual or family ailment.  At the moment we are endeavouring to provide old age pensions, children's allowances, maternity benefit, free milk, free boots, free everything, as far as I can see.  The tendency is towards providing some sort of allowance from the cradle to the grave.  I do not think that policy can be pursued much further with the resources at our disposal.  I subscribe to the principle laid down in the encyclicals that if you base your wage, salary, income, or whatever you may call it, on family requirements, you can, to a large extent, if not entirely, dispense with these aids which are merely tempory expedients and which are not likely to get us over our difficulties.</P>
    <P>The problem of a family wage, of course, is interlocked with a problem which, sooner or later, we must face in this country, the problem of providing full employment for our people.  I think we cannot get away from that aspect when we consider any particular problem of social service.  The problem is linked up with our international trade relations; it is linked up with the problem of finding ways and means of stepping up our national income; above all, it is linked up with the problem of enabling men to live with dignity and independence, without the necessity of forever looking to the State or the local authority for a bounty, subsidy or some miserable allowance.</P>
    <P>I think the present tendency of State aid is all wrong, that it creates a slave mind.  When the State becomes the paternal, bountiful giver of everything and anything from the cradle <Col N="1833" /> to the grave, we are compelled to look to the State for these things. Inevitably, we are driven to that under existing conditions because we will not face up to the real problem which is at the root of the evil, the problem which I have tried to outline, of finding full employment for our people on a family wage basis.</P>
    <P>I subscribe to the principle that prevention is better than cure and, for that reason, I will support the motion.  I believe it is better, in existing circumstances, to attempt to create healthy conditions for the young and to give the widow and orphan an allowance sufficient to enable the orphaned children of this community to grow up in reasonably healthy surroundings.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Cosgrave was speaking on this matter, I understood him to mean that he advocated an actuarial inquiry for the purpose of ascertaining two things&mdash;the minimum amount of wholesome healthy food which would be essential for a young person, and the capacity of this country to bear social services.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary misrepresented him in that respect.  Deputy Cosgrave was concerned not so much with an actuarial inquiry into a mere matter of widows' and orphans' pensions; it was the broader matter he had in mind.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the non-contributory widows' pension was brought to my notice recently.  It is the case of a woman who, in middle life, is cut off from pension.  When her children reach the maximum age, 14 or 16 years, as the case may be, she is automatically cut off until she reaches the age of 54.  A woman of, say, 45 years who is cut off from pension in these circumstances, generally finds it very difficult to get employment.  That case should be borne in mind if it is intended to introduce ameliorative legislation in the near future.</P>
    <P>I had not intended to take part in the debate, but we had very many figures from the Parliamentary Secretary and I felt a simple statement of the problem would have been more welcome on all sides of the House.  We <Col N="1834" /> had a forest of figures presented to us and it is very difficult to find one's way through them.  Even on the Parliamentary Secretary's figures, I would emphasise, he has made a case which shows clearly that, accepting the national income of 1938 and even accepting the allowances as at the present date, we are far from reaching the 10 per cent. which has been suggested as the minimum required in the United States and in Great Britain.</P>

      <P>I shall not be five minutes.  The reason why I interrupted the Parliamentary Secretary was that he was quoting all the people who get pensions but did not tell the House how many are getting pensions as low as 2/-.  It is a pity that the widows who represent Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are not here, so that we could have their views.  I should like to hear them speaking here for the widows outside the House, which they ought to do, but they are in the happy position of being in the Dáil and not depending on 5/- a week.  I know the case of a woman whose husband was killed, and she got a pension of 10/-.  Less than a month ago, two inspectors went around.  One of them was a very nice fellow.  Another young man came along afterwards.  With the compensation which she got, this poor widow had set up a little huckster shop.  This second inspector went to every merchant and shopkeeper to find out what that widow bought, what stocks she had, <Col N="1835" /> and how much profit she was making in the year, in spite of the fact that at the present time people who have been in the trade for years cannot get supplies. The stock which this poor woman had consisted of a few packets of woodbines, a few boxes of matches, some candles, and so on.</P>
      <P>As a result of those investigations, her pension was reduced to 4/-.  That is a widow with two children.  She gets nothing under the family allowances scheme.  Family allowances have been mentioned here, but quite a number of widows are getting nothing under that scheme.  The scheme for the provision of free boots has been mentioned, but only one pair of boots is supplied. Those are all the great social services that have been put before the House. Widows who are in receipt of 5/- a week were better off when they were getting home assistance.  They got 5/-home assistance before the widows' pension scheme ever came in.  If they have any little means at all, they do not get even 5/- widows' pension.  In the case of the old age pensioners, their employers cannot give them any more than 6/- a week&mdash;good, decent employers, who would be prepared to pay more.  The same applies in the case of a widow who is working; her employer cannot give her any more than 6/- a week.  I should like if the Minister would pay some attention to cutting down the expenses involved in sending out those inspectors to find out what means those poor widows have, instead of cutting down the amount of pension which the widows receive.  I know one widow who is getting only 2/- pension because her son went to England and sends her £1 a week.</P>

      <P>As an example of satirical humour, this resolution in the name of Deputy William Davin and <Col N="1837" /> Deputy Timothy J. Murphy is, in my view, fit to rank with the &ldquo;Modest Proposal&rdquo; of Dean Swift for the relief of Irish poverty.  It proposes, Sir, if I may say so&mdash;the metaphor may be a little unfortunate&mdash;to make the Irish people try to grow fat on their own tail, or at least to make one section of the Irish people try to grow fat on the flesh of another.  The Parliamentary Secretary has just told the House that in order to give effect to this motion we should have to raise by way of taxation a sum of £5,000,000. He said £5,000,000, but the sum is nearer to £5,250,000.  He has indicated what that would mean.  It might mean, for instance, 2/- in the £ on income-tax, which would inevitably result in a considerable increase in unemployment in the ranks of those who are engaged in domestic and personal service in this country; a considerable increase in unemployment in the ranks of those who provide us with our boots and our clothes and certain special articles of food.  He then went on to point out that to secure this amount in taxation we should have in addition to increase very considerably the cost of sugar, the cost of tea, and the cost of those beverages which make life endurable for a great many of us.  In short, Sir, whatever benefits which might be conferred on the limited class who would be beneficiaries if this resolution were to be carried into effect&mdash; and I should like to point out that it is a very limited class&mdash;the great mass of the population, including some of those who have to work hardest, some of those whose circumstances are the most distressful, those families where the wage earner gets a very modest return for his labour, those families of the small farmer and the small landowner and the agricultural labourer in this country, the poorest of our people, if they have the good fortune to have their parents still with them, would inevitably find their circumstances greatly worsened and their standard of living considerably depressed if this motion were carried&mdash; this motion which, let me emphasise again, would benefit a very small proportion of our people.  The Parliamentary Secretary, in the course of his speech, stated that the widows' and <Col N="1838" /> orphans' pensions scheme had not yet come into full operation.</P>
      <P>That is true, but it is true only in a limited way.  Within the last two or three years statistics have indicated that so far as the number of persons who are beneficiaries of this scheme under both heads&mdash;that is to say, the aggregate of those who are beneficiaries under the contributory scheme and those who are beneficiaries under the non-contributory scheme&mdash;is concerned we have reached a stable position.  It is true that as time goes on there is a transition from the non-contributory scheme to the contributory scheme.  As time goes on, a larger proportion of the people who are beneficiaries under the widows' and orphans' pensions scheme can draw pensions at the higher rate&mdash;at the rates appropriate to the contributory scheme.  But so far as the general mass is concerned, so far as the sum total of widows and orphans under both sections of the scheme is concerned, practically a stable position has been reached, a position in which we find that the total number of persons benefiting will be about 35,000 widows and about 22,000 orphans or in all, say, 57,000 women and children.  Now that is in round figures 1/50th of our population. It is important that we should bear that fraction in mind.  The total number of people benefiting under our widows' and orphans' pensions scheme represents in round figures 1/50th of the population.  In fact, it represents something less, but for the purpose of my argument it is a convenient fraction to keep in mind because it is one which we can easily remember.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the other side of the picture? The other side of the picture is that to give effect to these proposals would cost us £5,250,000.  It was calculated, I think, in the year 1938 that our national income was £158,000,000 per annum.  We made £158,000,000 per annum in what, I think, was the reasonably normal year of 1938.  It may be true that for one reason or another, because of the high prices, for instance, which our farmers are getting at the <Col N="1839" /> moment, the national income at present might be estimated at a higher figure.  We know, however, that we are living in abnormal times and that when this war is over there will inevitably come a reaction in this country and a great deal of the money which we are now spending, and a large part of which we are now borrowing, in order to meet some part of the cost of our national defence and other emergency services will have to be repaid&mdash;repaid out of taxation which, in turn, will have its reaction on national production, perhaps. There is one thing which I will not go so far as to say is reasonably certain, but which we may apprehend as a possibility, which is that in postwar years we may be looking back to 1938 as a sort of halcyon year in this country, a year when everybody was reasonably well off, and thinking that a national income of £158,000,000 could be regarded as something which in the post-war years we should be well off to have again.</P>
    <P>Let me remind Deputies of what I said.  Under this proposal the fraction of the population which would benefit would be about one-fiftieth.  To give effect to this motion would cost £5,250,000.  Our national income we shall assume is £165,000.</P>

      <P>I want him to get these figures into his head because if he gets figures like those into his head he will not be so enthusiastic about such a foolish resolution as his is. £5,250,000 is, roughly&mdash;I am taking round figures because I want to get the fraction stark and neat for the purposes of comparison&mdash;one-thirtieth of what our total national income may be expected to be.  Here we have this &ldquo;Modest Proposal&rdquo; of the modern Dean Swift to take one-thirtieth of the national income and distribute it amongst one-fiftieth of the national population.</P>
      <P>What is the natural consequence? That 49/50ths of the Irish people in consequence of this motion are going to be made poorer and that, among those who are going to be made poorer still, will be the very poorest of those households which are blessed by the fact that both parents are still alive. That is the sort of motion put down by the Labour Party.  I think it is a cynical motion.  I think it is almost as cynical as the speech made in support of it by Deputy Morrissey.</P>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey's principal argument for supporting this motion was that he was anxious to do everything possible to reduce the incidence of tuberculosis in this country.  Now, I hope, indeed I am sure, that the Deputy, though cynical, is anxious, as we all are, to do everything possible to curb the ravages of this terrible disease amongst our people.  I hope he will have an opportunity next week of supporting the Government in its efforts to do something in that regard.  I hope that when he comes to discuss our proposals&mdash;the proposals which will be shortly submitted to the House by the Parliamentary Secretary, Dr. Ward&mdash; he will remember the speech which he made on this motion.  Now, tuberculosis is not a disease which is very general among widows, and particularly among widows in the non-contributory class of 55.</P>

These are the facts I want to get home to the minds of Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The incidence of tuberculosis varies from year to year.  In one year we had 22,000 sufferers and in another year it was nearly 24,000.  I will take the present circumstances, the present cycle.  It would not be greatly wide of the mark, it would not be extravagant, to say that you would probably have 23,000 people suffering from tuberculosis, in one stage or another, in this country at the present time.  Not all of these people are in straitened circumstances. Undoubtedly, not all of them would require to be helped out of the <Col N="1842" /> Exchequer or from the public purse or, to put it in its most comprehensive form, out of the pockets of their neighbours, because nothing comes out of the Exchequer, nothing comes out of the public purse, that does not come out of the private pocket of the private individual.  And, therefore, when we propose to spend money either in providing widows' and orphans' pensions or in taking measures to combat tuberculosis, we must remember it is not our money; these millions are not our millions, these millions consist of pennies and shillings and pounds taken out of the private pockets of private individuals in this community.</P>
    <P>I said there were 23,000 persons suffering from tuberculosis.  I said not all of these were in straitened circumstances. Let us assume there are 15,000 of the 23,000 who require help in a greater or less degree, and let us see what we could do to combat tuberculosis, about which Deputy Morrissey is so much concerned, and so rightly concerned, if we had that £5,250,000.  I have to make some extempore calculations.</P>

      <P>Assuming we have 15,000 people suffering from tuberculosis, <Col N="1843" /> to be assisted, and we have £5,250,000 to assist them, that would mean that we could give to each one of the 15,000 people about whom Deputy Morrissey and, I think, Deputy Cosgrave, are so rightly concerned, approximately £340 per annum.  We could send them to South Africa, to Switzerland, outside the four corners of Ireland, and we would not have, if we were able to spend at the rate of £5,250,000 per year combating tuberculosis, many very glaring cases of the disease in our midst.  But Deputy Morrissey must realise that if he takes the £5,250,000 and spends it in the way this resolution asks, we will have so much less to spend on combating tuberculosis and, if he is really concerned about the incidence of the disease, about the mortality and the ravages of tuberculosis in this country, then what he ought to do is to say to the mover of the motion: we will let well enough alone, so far as the widows' and orphans' pensions are concerned, and we will try to find some more money out of the national income, if we can, to combat tuberculosis; but we will not, by this resolution, make it more difficult for this or any other Government to deal with tuberculosis. I think I have kept the House long enough.</P>

      <P>This motion has been under consideration for almost three hours.  A good deal of that time was taken up by the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Childers, and quite a portion of it was taken up by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  As usual, the Parliamentary Secretary's statement was made up of very academic utterances, high-brow economics, and statistics which he was either unable to explain or refused to explain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1844" /> He gave us certain figures in connection with social services which are being administered in the country and in regard to which some of us, at least, would like to have more information. He told us that the amount of money now being spent on social services is in the vicinity of £8,663,800.  I asked him did that include national health insurance.  I do not know exactly what his answer was.  I pressed for a definite reply, but I could not get a coherent statement from him.  I asked him what was the amount of money spent on national health insurance and I said then what I am going to say now, that national health insurance was never looked upon as a social service in the accepted sense, as administered by the Government.  Employers and employed contribute a large amount of money towards that service. I have never heard it spoken of or described as a social service in the sense in which we speak about social services now.</P>
    <P>He mentioned that the number of widows in receipt of widows' pensions was in the neighbourhood of 35,000 and that a great number of them were in the non-contributory class, the reason they were in that class being, he said, that a large number of them were self-employed. I venture to suggest that a large number of those in receipt of non-contributory pensions are the wives of men who were unemployed for a long time prior to their deaths. Many of them were unemployed because of the economic policy of this Government, but the Government were not content to keep these people unemployed. They must follow them into their graves and inflict hardship on the wives and children left behind by giving them a miserable pittance of 5/-or 6/- per week.</P>
    <P>It is with these people we are concerned &mdash; non-contributory pensioners who are in receipt of 5/- or 6/- per week.  Again he was pressed for particulars, but he merely dealt vaguely with statistics.  I suggest that some thing will have to be done in so far as the wives of unemployed people are concerned.  Any of us who interests himself in endeavouring to secure pensions for widows often finds that the fact that their late husbands were two <Col N="1845" /> or three stamps short means a difference between a 10/- and a 5/- pension. Because a man worked hard in the interests of his family and in the interests of the State year after year, and because he was unemployed for a few months prior to his death, his family has to live on the miserable pittance of a non-contributory pension.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary asked us to face the issue.  I submit that the Parliamentary Secretary himself did everything but face the issue.  It is the easiest thing in the world to quote statistics, which were rightly described and put in their proper category by Deputy Coogan.  The Local Government Department of this country does nothing but quote statistics.  Both the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister, in respect of every motion with which they were confronted within the last couple of years, quoted statistics and deliberately got away from the motion before the House.  What use are highbrow economics to an unfortunate widow who is trying to live on 5/-a week?  What good are highbrow economics to the widow with two or three children who has not yet reached the age of 55 and gets nothing at all? It will be poor consolation to these people to read in the Press to-morrow the statistics put before the House by the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, referring to Deputy Morrissey's statement, said that there was no relationship between T.B. and the widows and orphans.  Of course there is a decided relationship, and I now suggest that it is because of the malnutrition amongst orphans in this country that there is so much T.B.  The Minister again dealt with the matter of T.B. and quoted the number of people suffering from the disease in the country.  He told us that this proposal of the Labour Party would cost £5,250,000, and he emphasised that on four different occasions. He then told us that if, instead of increasing the pensions of these people, that amount were divided between those suffering from T.B., they would get £340 each.  That unfortunately has been the policy in this country over a number of years&mdash;palliatives all the time, and failure to make an effort to <Col N="1846" /> get at the root of any of our social evils.</P>
    <P>Anybody could make a statement of that kind, which is on all fours with the statement he made in answer to the proposals put forward in the Bill which the House discussed which sought to enable labourers to purchase their cottages, when he said that if the Bill were passed, we would be making a present of 10,000 houses to the agricultural labourers.  That kind of talk gets us nowhere.  I ask the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to face the issue.  They are the people who have deliberately evaded the issue in the motion.  If they want to cure T.B., they will need to do something to see that the children of widows get proper nourishment, which is the only way to cure this disease.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary gave other statistics.  He said that the increases given to recipients of widows' and orphans' pensions since the beginning of the emergency ranged from 35 to 202 per cent.  He admitted that the cost of living had increased by 70 per cent.  I pressed him to say how these percentages were made up.  I can imagine that if a widow were in receipt of 1/- or 2/- per week, or of 6d. as in some cases, it would be easy enough to show a 202 per cent. increase, but that was trotted out here in all sincerity to show that there has been an increase in the maximum pensions given to widows and orphans. That is the kind of claptrap we hear from Government Benches, while these people are starving all over the country.  When pressed for an answer, he would not give one.  The Minister was very much concerned about the people who are not widows, about the working man and the working woman, who would have to contribute towards the cost of the increase we suggest. The Government or the Fianna Fáil Party were not so concerned when the Minister for Industry and Commerce pledged this House to the putting up of £20,000,000 to be handed over to one man to run the railways of this country a few weeks ago; but when it is a question of people who have been left without their breadwinners, when it is a question of starving children and starving widows, when it is a question of <Col N="1847" /> taking the proper steps to prevent the spread of tuberculosis, these people get nothing but figures and statistics.</P>
    <P>I should like to see in print the statistics put forward by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I do not suggest that he is telling lies, but I certainly would question the accuracy of his figures.  One is very doubtful of their accuracy when one remembers that, when pressed, he refused to give the information we asked for.  Nobody interrupted him unreasonably&mdash;any interruptions that were made were made <Col N="1848" /> to elicit proper information.  Deputy Morrissey and I were the two people who interrupted him and we did so in all good humour, being anxious to get the figures he quoted&mdash;figures placed in his hands by officials and which, in my opinion, he had not studied himself.  If that is the treatment that this Government is going to mete out to the poor of this country, then the sooner the poor take cognisance of it the better.</P>
