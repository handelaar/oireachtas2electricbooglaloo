      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state if it is proposed to close down the local employment office at Portlaoighise; and, if so, for what reasons; and if he is aware that great inconvenience will be caused to workers by the proposed removal of this office from Portlaoighise, which is the most central town for such office.</P>

      <P>The branch employment office at Portlaoighise has been closed down as from the 12th March and the work done there has been entrusted to neighbouring local offices. The small number of applicants resident at Portlaoighise that have been attending the branch office at that centre will be dealt with by post and will receive through the local post office payments due to them.  Should the circumstances alter materially consideration will be given to the reopening of the office.</P>

      <P>An <Col N="1536" /> election of members of the Roscommon County Council will be held this year, in common with other local elections, within the period 23rd June to 1st July, unless there should be a poll for the Presidential election.  If this should happen, it will be necessary, with the authority of the Oireachtas, to make arrangements so that both the Presidential election and the local elections will be held on the same date close to, but not necessarily within, the period I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>The position is as set out in reply to a similar question asked on this subject by Deputy Norton on 3rd October, 1944.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Old Age Pensions Claims.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether his attention was directed to the circular letter recently addressed to Deputies by the Parliamentary Secretary on the subject of personal representations to and interviews with officials of his Department concerning the determination of claims to old age pensions; whether he is aware that this practice was reintroduced, after a brief previous suspension, on the formation of the Government in 1932; and, if so, whether he will state further the grounds on which it is now again discontinued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister prescribed the procedure now in operation regulating the making of representations to officials of his Department by Deputies and Senators in regard to old age pensions appeals.  This procedure does not suspend or prohibit personal representations by Deputies or Senators, but ensures that such representations <Col N="1537" /> will be dealt with in a way which will not prejudice the interests of appellants as a whole.  The grounds on which the practice hitherto in force has been discontinued are briefly that it led to delay in dealing with appeals generally and that those appeals in which members of the Oireachtas were interested were dealt with out of their chronological order. The practice thus led to undue delay, and consequent injustice, where other appellants were concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Parliamentary Secretary realise that substantially the same reasons were given by a previous Administration for the introduction of a practice which now, apparently, has the benediction of the present Government?  Does he not know that his own Government in 1932 realised that there was no substantial foundation for the action taken by the previous Administration?  Bearing in mind the fact that Deputies are public representatives with responsibilities to the people, will he not reconsider the matter with a view to ensuring that public representatives&mdash;there is a very limited number of them in this country and in this House&mdash;should have the right of audience with the deciding officers?  The question as to when the appeal, which is the subject of that representation, is decided can, of course, be a matter quite outside the ambit of the procedure for regulating interviews.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing to add to the reply, but I think that, if the Deputy will read very carefully the notice issued to Deputies and Senators, he will see that there were good reasons for making the change in the procedure.  It is proposed to leave the procedure as it is at the moment and to watch events.</P>

      <P>May I say that I am not one of those who abused the privileges of that office?  But does not the Parliamentary Secretary realise that this circular, which was issued with the authority of the Minister over the Parliamentary Secretary's signature, is more like a code <Col N="1538" /> regulating the conduct of recalcitrant children in a penitentiary than one for governing the conduct of Deputies in their representations to a public Department?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state when it is proposed to proceed with the construction of a bridge over the River Suck at Correen Ford, Ballinasloe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The construction of bridges is not undertaken by my Department. Such a work is the duty of the appropriate road authority in so far as it falls within its statutory powers.  In December last resolutions were adopted by the Roscommon and Galway County Councils in identical terms approving of the payment of a sum not exceeding £200 towards the cost of erecting a new bridge over the <Col N="1539" /> River Suck at Correen Ford, assuming apparently that the balance of the cost would be allotted from Government funds.  It is estimated that a good high-level bridge would cost at least £10,000.  The bridge, if built, would not connect up the public road systems of Galway and Roscommon, and could not be erected by either county council unless about two miles of reconstructed new road of general public utility were also to be made. The proposed bridge is intended to facilitate directly 19 farmers on the Roscommon side of the River Suck who own about 100 acres of meadow on the Galway side, and also some other farmers resident on the Galway side who cut turf in County Roscommon. As its importance would be of purely local character, its construction would not be warranted on the grounds of public utility.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy's question relates to officers of the Reserve of Officers called out on permanent service during the emergency, including officers granted temporary commissions.  If that assumption is correct, I would refer the Deputy to my undertaking in this House last week, on the occasion of the debate on the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Bill, 1945, that the Government's resettlement proposals in regard to the Defence Forces <Col N="1541" /> would be made known to the Defence Conference at the earliest possible moment.  I do not propose to make any statement in the interval as to the details of those proposals, which have been the subject of discussion with the Army authorities.  I do not, therefore, consider that the advisory committee suggested by the Deputy would serve any useful purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say, first of all, that I hope that laudable intention may be implemented, but if it is not, in the event of it being decided to continue to invite tenders, will the Minister bear in mind the possibility that one small group of people may collar this 280,000 lbs. weight of biscuits, with all the possibilities of abuse that may arise from that?  If it is not possible to pass them on to some charitable organisation for charitable purposes, will the Minister consider endeavouring to recirculate the biscuits through the trade, so that the ordinary small shopkeeper in the country may get a quota for sale to persons who at present have extreme difficulty in getting biscuits?

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is prepared to explain to the House his reasons for stopping short at the point at which he proposes to stop in this section?  The cost of living now stands at 295 and the Minister proposes that it shall be considered to stop at 210, from the point of view of local authorities' employees who are entitled to a bonus.  When the Minister introduced the Estimate that dealt with the Civil Service last year, he was challenged on the general grounds on which he was standing then.  The Minister has had time to think over it since and now, when he comes to deal with the employees of local authorities, I suggest the House is entitled to ask for a review of the reasons that make him halt at 110, when the actual increase in the cost of living has been 195.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know really whether this does arise on the section or not.  This is a one-clause Bill and the House yesterday debated the principle of the Bill, which is contained in Section 2.  I should have thought that no further explanation was necessary, unless it is to be given on the assumption that the House is going to stultify itself and reverse the decision it took yesterday.  The position is quite clear. As the House is aware, the standstill principle was applied to members of the Civil Service and to certain officers of local authorities earlier than it was applied generally to wage earners and employees.  For that reason, it has now been decided to permit those officers to advance to the point which their salaries would have reached if, instead of applying the standstill principle to them in July, 1940, its application had been deferred until the <Col N="1544" /> first Emergency Powers Order was made.  That is all that is contained in the Bill and that is the philosophy behind it&mdash;to treat all alike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, I think, is taking advantage of the willingness of Deputies to assist him in getting his business through the House.  Normally, the Second Reading of this Bill having been taken yesterday, the Committee Stage would not be taken until next week, and persons, whether members of the House or otherwise, interested in the details of the measure, would have a week in which to consider the Bill and to propose amendments.  The principle adopted yesterday when the Second Reading was passed was nothing more than that the employees of local authorities, whose payments were based upon the basic salary and bonus, were entitled to an increase. What we are considering to-day is the extent to which that increase should go and, if the House did not succumb so quickly to the Minister's entreaty to allow the Committee Stage to be taken to-day, we would be in the position of discussing an amendment to make the increase 50 or even 75, so as to bring it up to 195.</P>
      <P>When the Minister takes into consideration the types of people who have been working at so many different classes of public work under local authorities, whether they are agricultural instructresses, agricultural instructors, horticultural instructors; officials dealing with housing or any other aspect of the relief schemes that have been so increased during the emergency, and when he considers the services rendered by these people, I am sure he will agree they are entitled to some reasonable explanation of why they are being offered this particular figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was pointed out to the Minister, when he was dealing with the Civil Service, that in the case of a person whose income was £300 a year, made up of a basic salary of £200 with £120 bonus, that person was suffering a loss of £89 under present circumstances. The point that I think requires some sympathetic discussion now is whether <Col N="1545" /> the figure of 25 should not be increased to meet, at any rate, half the difference in the cost of living that exists between the 185, on which the payment is at present, and the 295 representing the actual cost of living.  If the persons concerned were given an opportunity to show, on the nature and they increased extent of the work they are doing, the difficulties they are meeting arising out of transport and other difficulties, due largely to the emergency, and again, the difficulties they experience in maintaining their families with the increased cost of living, a very strong case could be made for increasing the 25 substantially.</P>
    <P>With regard to the employees of local authorities, a strong case could be made for ante-dating the application of this measure to the 1st January, 1944, instead of 1st January, 1945.  The Minister has admitted a mistake was made when the stablising process was applied to civil servants' salaries and the salaries of officers of local authorities a year before it was applied to anybody else.  When the Minister is reduced to admitting a mistake of that kind, he can easily find out how much it saved to the State.  He told us the increase given under the last emergency bonus proposals to the Civil Service would cost £500,000 a year.  I do not know whether the Minister saved £500,000 or more in stabilising the wages of employees of local authorities and civil servants a year before anybody else.  Whether he saved that amount or more, at any rate there was a substantial saving, and it was at the expense of the people for whom he is now attempting to do something small.  As regards the disabilities they have suffered for so many years arising out of the mistake the Minister says was made, he is afforded an opportunity of rectifying the position in this Bill.  If the House did not facilitate the Minister in the way in which it has done, we would on another occasion be dealing with an amendment to make 1st January, 1945, in this section, read 1st January, 1944.</P>

      <P>I do not want to prolong this debate unduly.  I think there is no person more grateful for any consideration that the House extends <Col N="1546" /> than I am, when I am charged with the conduct of measures here.  But I must say I am surprised at the suggestion that I am being facilitated by the House in any way in connection with this Bill.  I might have been facilitated, and it might have been to the advantage of, those who will benefit under the Bill if I had got all the stages of the measure yesterday and were able to take it in the Seanad to-day, in which case the Bill might become law within a week.  But, in view of the fact that when I requested it, that facility was refused me, I am taking the Committee Stage to-day.  In view of the remarks of the Deputy, it may well be we shall have to postpone the remaining stages until after this week.  I do not think the Deputy's criticism is well founded.  The only people who are being prejudiced by the action of the Leader of the Opposition yesterday in refusing to give me the Committee and the remaining stages of the Bill are those who will benefit under it.</P>
      <P>As to the point made by the Deputy that if it had not been for the fact that I am taking the Committee Stage to-day they might have put down an amendment providing for the payment of a bonus calculated with reference to a higher figure, that will be news to the ratepayers with whose interests the Party opposite and some of the other Parties in this House profess to be concerned.  The Deputy told us a concession given to the Civil Service in this connection has meant an appreciable burden on the State.  This Bill will mean, I suppose, some increase in the burden on the ratepayers, but it is only putting certain officers of local authorities in the same position as officers paid upon the same basis in the Civil Service.  We do not propose to go further. The Deputy's suggestion to go further would substantially increase the burden on the ratepayers.  I understood, and I have gathered it from the speeches of Deputies opposite, that they think the local authorities and the ratepayers are already carrying a heavier burden than they can bear.</P>

The Deputy knows as well as I do, that it is doubtful whether an amendment of that sort would be in order, but he is just playing to the gallery.  He feels he will get a certain measure of support from the general body of officers and servants of the local authorities.  He can talk about putting down an amendment, knowing very well that the amendment may not be accepted.  On the other hand, if I were to bring in a Bill in the comprehensive terms suggested by the Deputy, I would probably be told that I was putting an undue burden on the ratepayers.  I think we ought to get rid of that nonsense.</P>

      <P>It is hard to think, when one listens to the Minister speaking on matters affecting the welfare of State officials and their families, that this is an institution that the Irish nation for many generations fought very hard and made very big sacrifices to set up in order that they might have a deliberative Assembly here that would discuss matters and, arising out of their discussions, shape their decisions and enshrine them in legislation.  The Minister is asked to say why, having admitted that he wronged a particular class of public officials, he does not make a certain amount of restitution for that wrong when dealing with this measure, and to explain with some kind of reasoning <Col N="1548" /> why, when the cost of living has risen by 195 points, he proposes to compensate officials to the extent of only 110.  If this Assembly is what we are led to believe it is intended to be, we ought not to have to listen to either suggestion or innuendo by the Minister but to a certain amount of facts and figures and a certain amount of reasoning.</P>
      <P>The Minister threatens me with the ratepayers.  The ratepayers want to do their duty and want to do their work properly, and while the additional couple of million pounds which the policy of the Minister and his followers put on their backs may create a burden for them, it does not affect their consciences or their realisation that they owe a duty to the officials who do public work, nor does it affect the readiness and the desire of the people who may be ratepayers to see that when men and women devote themselves to carrying on public work they are adequately recompensed and put in a position in which they can not only look after the health, education and welfare of themselves and their families, but can do their work cheerfully and with free minds, unafraid of finding want in their homes when they go there after discharging their public duties.  The Minister takes up the attitude that he wants this Bill, but tells us that we have no power to interfere with it.  I do not want to go into that now, but the Minister would be discussing an amendment to increase the figure of 25 and to change the year from 1945 to 1944 if we were not responding to the Government's appeal to let the business go through.</P>

      <P>The position of the whole mass of the people as affected by the present high cost of living is continuously under review by the Government, but it is certainly not the practice of the Government to give special consideration to any section of the population, except the very poor. Normally, I suppose, at this time of the year, when we are trying to determine what our expenditure in the future is to be, the position of the poor and those people dependent upon public assistance of one kind or another does come under review, but I certainly think it would be unfair if I were to allow the House to harbour the delusion that the Government feel bound to give special consideration to any particular class of the population, and particularly those who, whatever else may be their circumstances, happen to be in very secure positions.</P>

      <P>It is not a good principle to take so many powers from local authorities as to curtail to a large extent the interest they would have in the performance of their duties, and especially when already in the Bill, in Section 3, there is a fairly clear and definite line laid down in respect of the duties which visiting committees are required to carry out in relation to the district mental hospitals which they may be appointed to visit.  It is set down that they will visit the hospital from time to time, receive complaints from the patients and report on abuses, on repairs and on any other matter on which they have authority to report.  All that is left, in so far as prescribing the powers and duties of a visiting committee, is the prescribing of the time and place of meetings and the manner in which the committees shall visit the district hospitals and carry out their duties. It could be quite safely left to the committee of a mental hospital to make these regulations, subject, as set down in amendment No. 165, to subsequent confirmation by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy has become somewhat confused as between the terminology of the existing law and the terminology used in the Bill. His amendment refers to a mental hospital committee and the intention is to substitute, as the rule-making authority, a mental hospital committee. The only committee of a mental hospital that will exist when the Bill becomes law is the visiting committee, and, clearly, the Deputy had not in mind that a visiting committee should be given power to make these rules.  Where a mental hospital authority is concerned with one county <Col N="1551" /> only, the county council will be the mental hospital authority.  Where there is more than one county interested in the institution, the institution will be governed by a joint board.  Apart from that, the phraseology in sub-section (7) is exactly the same as that in sub-section (5) of Section 34 of the County Management Act, so that the Minister already has the statutory power which this sub-section proposes to give him.  What we are doing in this Bill is, we are incorporating the power which the Minister has in sub-section (5) of Section 34 of the County Management Act in this Bill, and deleting it from the County Management Act.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary was quite correct in the point he made about the terminology of the amendment.  I am sure he will pardon my mistake when he remembers the number of drafting amendments that he has found it necessary to move to the Bill as introduced. So far as the amendment is concerned, the fact that this power is in the 1940 Act does not make it any more acceptable to me.  I do not see any reason why we should not make our position clear in relation to the feeling that we have, even though the existing statutory law does give this power to the Minister.  I think it is a bad thing, and that something should be done to correct it.</P>

      <P>I would point out to the Deputy that the sub-section is permissive. The Minister may make regulations. He will not do so unless it should be necessary.  Notwithstanding the fact that the Minister has this statutory power already, he has not made such regulations because he has not found it necessary to do so.  In this sub-section we are merely empowering the Minister if, in certain eventualities, he considers it necessary to make regulations. In the ordinary course of things the mental hospital authority will make its own regulations.  They will not have statutory effect, but such regulations have worked well in the past and probably will work well in the future.  I <Col N="1552" /> think that is the spirit in which we should approach this matter.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (4), before paragraph (b), to insert the following new paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(b) shall prescribe the accommodation (including sleeping accommodation) food and other services and the attendance to which the persons admitted as paying patients shall be entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of proposing the inclusion of this new sub-section is that we are here dealing with a new field into which mental hospital authorities are entering, namely, the provision of accommodation for paying patients.  It is laid down that regulations shall be made in relation to an institution which will contain certain provisions in regard to the payment to be made by persons admitted as paying patients and also that no person shall be admitted unless there is available at the time of admission accommodation not required for persons receivable as chargeable patients.  In so far as the mental hospital authorities would be entering into a formal contract inasmuch as they would be receiving payment in respect of the accommodation and service to be given to this new type of patient, I feel there should be certain protection afforded to patients in regard to what they will receive in return for the payment <Col N="1556" /> they will make.  While I accept that it would be wrong to suggest that mental hospital authorities would attempt in any way to take advantage of the patients in so far as not giving them adequate and proper accommodation, food and services, in return for the fees they would pay, nevertheless, it is proper that ordinary simple safeguards should be put in, indicating the minimum accommodation, food, etc., that should be provided for such type of patients, in order to ensure, in the first place, that patients or those acting for them will be clear as to what they are entitled to and, secondly, that mental hospital authorities will not be placed in an invidious position by reason of complaint that the particular accommodation, food, etc., were not up to the standard the patient was entitled to in relation to the payment being made.  Also, on general grounds, I think it is far better to have the position clearly defined in cases like this rather than to act upon the assumption that nothing wrong is going to take place.  In recent days we read a good deal in the daily Press about a very lamentable happening in another country where regulations were taken to be satisfactory but, because of a loop-hole, a very grievous tragedy occurred.  No tragedy can occur in this particular case but it could give rise to a certain degree of dissatisfaction and friction if there were differences of opinion as between the mental hospital authority and those who were making payments in respect of particular patients.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention behind the Deputy's amendment is in itself praiseworthy, and I have no criticism to offer on that score, but I do not think it is practicable or necessary.  Patients have, within the framework of the measure before the House, ample protection. We have a visiting committee, which will visit the institution at regular intervals, as often as may be necessary.  If any patient has any complaint, there will be no difficulty in establishing contact with a member of the visiting committee and securing investigation of the complaint, even before the next ordinary meeting would take place.  We have the mental hospital <Col N="1557" /> authority as the next court of appeal.  We have the county manager superimposed on that.  We then have the inspector of mental hospitals who periodically visits these institutions and inquires into the care and treatment of every patient in each one of these institutions and, finally, we have provision for appeal to the Minister by anybody who feels aggrieved in any particular regard.  I think that is a very complete machine in so far as protection of the individual patient is concerned.</P>
      <P>We cannot prescribe food standards in advance.  We must leave the matter of nutritional standards to be determined by the medical superintendent. He will be responsible for the proper care and treatment of patients.  The matter of nutrition may be a very important element in the question of treatment.  We will have to give him unlimited discretion, again with all the safeguards I have already referred to.  In the same way, we cannot determine accommodation in advance because in this particular type of institution the accommodation will have to be related to the form of mental disturbance from which the patient may be suffering.  One patient may require restraint, may have to be accommodated in a padded cell, and so on.  I need not develop that; the Deputy will appreciate it right away. The idea the Deputy has in mind is quite a sound one, but I think we have taken all reasonable precautions.</P>

      <P>I would not be altogether prepared to accept either the visiting committee or the mental hospital authority as being sufficient safeguard because, in this case, there can be a conflict of interests between the cost of maintenance of the institution and the contribution made on behalf of paying patients.  Under sub-section (1), certain regulations are to be framed by the mental hospital authority governing the admission of persons as paying patients and their accommodation, and these regulations shall be submitted to the Minister.  If the Parliamentary Secretary would say that in considering such regulations the Minister would have regard to the <Col N="1558" /> matter I have referred to, I think that would be satisfactory.</P>

      <P>In the case of mental hospitals there does seem to be in the minds of many people a certain prejudice.  I am aware that even where responsible and influential members of joint committees of mental hospitals have assured relatives that the patients in whom they were interested were being treated with the utmost consideration and kindness, there was still the greatest difficulty in convincing them that their conception of life in these institutions was not in accordance with the actual fact. It is because of that atmosphere very often surrounding a mental hospital that I think it is essential that every precaution should be taken to ensure that the good name of the hospital will be protected in every way in relation to the standard of treatment and accommodation of patients, so that there will not be any sense of dissatisfaction in the minds of relatives.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In this part of the Bill we are coming to one of the most important sections <Col N="1560" /> of the whole approach which the Parliamentary Secretary has developed for the treatment of mental disease.  It is most essential that we should in every way possible make provision for the most satisfactory treatment being given to any persons who are patients in private institutions.  I am speaking now with a certain personal feeling in this matter, because some years ago we had a somewhat unhappy experience and we had to draw the matter to the attention of the inspector of mental hospitals, but he found that his powers and authority were very circumscribed. I think it is not sufficient to ensure that, in a general way, private mental institutions shall be run in a proper and orderly manner, subject to certain control by the Minister in relation to the patients as such and to the general accommodation available in relation to the number of persons it is proposed to cater for, but that it is equally important that the staffs of such private institutions should also be regarded from the point of view of their qualifications and from the point of view of having a sufficiency of staff to care for the number of persons the institution proposes to cater for.</P>
    <P>I have in mind an instance in the past where, to my own personal knowledge, as many as 28 patients were left in the care of a man and a boy in the open grounds of an institution of this character.  It is to see if the Parliamentary Secretary has given thought to this particular aspect of the matter that I have set down the amendments in my name, that is, that in sub-section (2) of Section 107, in addition to entering in the register of a private institution the number of persons of unsound mind, both male and female, to be taken care of in the institution, there should also be a record of the staff that normally will be employed in that institution to care for the number of persons it is proposed to cater for from the viewpoint, first of all, of the qualified members of the staff and, secondly, of the unqualified members.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that there is a certain difficulty in this country as in certain <Col N="1561" /> private institutions, I understand, there are not teaching hospitals and certain of them do not wish to undertake that responsibility.  We often have had cases where the staff catering for the female patients have been qualified and have been receiving teaching, whereas on the male side the ordinary attendants have been unqualified except for such experience as they might pick up during the course of their work.  That is possibly a difficulty that has to be considered. At the same time, I think that due regard should be had by the Parliamentary Secretary, when considering granting to these institutions the privilege of catering for these people, not only to the medical staff as such that will have care of patients but, what is in many ways more important, to the number of qualified men and women who will have to give daily and continuous service to those patients in these private institutions.  A further purpose I have in moving my amendment is that, in addition to the registration of the number of patients, there should also be a record of the number of the staff, both qualified and unqualified, who will normally be employed in the institution in relation to the number of persons the institution proposes to take in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the amendment is a reasonable one.  I do not know how many private or charitable institutions there are in this country catering for mentally deficient persons; but, from time to time, we have heard complaints that the patients in these institutions do not get the attention to which they are entitled.  Now that these institutions are to be registered under this Bill, it seems to me that the Parliamentary Secretary should also take steps to see that the staffs of these institutions are qualified to carry out the duty they purport to carry out. It is inevitable, of course, that the proprietors of the institutions should try to run them on the most economical lines possible, and that they will ensage unqualified persons rather than qualified persons for reasons of economy.  But, if it appears only right, proper and just that an institution of that kind should be staffed by persons <Col N="1562" /> who are competent to take care of and treat mentally deficient patients, whatever regulations the Parliamentary Secretary proposes to make under the section or other sections should apply not only to the medical staff, but to the nursing staffs as well, of these institutions.</P>

      <P>Once again we are in harmony so far as the intention of the amendment is concerned, but I do not think it is necessary.  Section 107 (2) sets out that there shall be entered on the register certain particulars.  Deputy Larkin wishes to include in the particulars to be entered the number of qualified and unqualified persons having care or charge of patients in the normal course of their employment.  I suggest to the Deputy that, if it is considered desirable to have such information recorded, the Minister has power already in sub-section (2), which states, &ldquo;and such (if any) other particulars as may be prescribed&rdquo;.  The Minister can prescribe any particulars he considers may be necessary under sub-section (2) as drafted, and I can assure the House that the Minister will satisfy himself&mdash;&mdash;</P>

One of the difficulties is that you must read a number of sections together in order to get a comprehensive view of the matter.  The particular point raised now can be dealt with within the framework of sub-section (2) of Section 107.</P>

      <P>There is a series of amendments here over the name of Deputy Larkin, in which he deals with the unsuitability of staff, food, etc., as good grounds for refusal of registration.  I think the whole matter might be best debated on amendment No. 183.  Amendment No. 182 simply prepares the way.  This arises in amendments Nos. 182 to 187, 199 to 206 for different institutions, and 214.  The debate might take the whole point in amendment No. 183 as to these grounds for rejection or refusal of registration.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 183:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before paragraph (e), line 25, to insert the following two new paragraphs:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(e) that the Minister is satisfied that the person or persons of unsound mind to be taken care of in the institution will not receive adequate and proper food, care and attention;</P>
      <P>(f) that the Minister is satisfied (i) that the staff of the institution is not sufficiently qualified to have charge of persons of unsound mind, (ii) that the staff is insufficient in numbers or qualifications properly to care for and have charge of the number of persons of unsound mind which the institution proposes to admit, (iii) that the conditions of service for the staff are not satisfactory or are not of such character as to ensure the employment of properly qualified persons to care for or have charge of persons of unsound mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is, in a certain way, to amplify the intention in amendment No. 181.  I am not <Col N="1564" /> altogether satisfied that what the Parliamentary Secretary said in regard to amendment No. 181 will cover the position I have tried to deal with under amendment No. 183.  In section 114, the grounds for refusing an application for registration of a private institution are set down in paragraphs (a) to (f).  While they cover a fairly wide range of causes which would justify the Minister in refusing registration, there is no definite and specific reference to the question of adequate and proper food, care and attention.  Paragraph (a) deals with the suitability of the applicant, (b) deals with the suitability of the person in charge, (c) ensures that the person in charge will reside in the institution, (d) covers the premises, staff or equipment from the point of view of suitability, (e) deals with the patients being under the observation of a registered medical practitioner, and (f) with the furnishing of documents to the Minister within a reasonable time.  It may be argued that the Minister has certain general powers to give consideration to the provision of adequate and proper food, care and attention, but this matter is so very important, where we are dealing with private institutions, that the Parliamentary Secretary should be prepared to go further and accept the definite statutory obligation to give consideration to these very important factors.</P>
    <P>Private institutions are in a very peculiar position in relation to the treatment of these persons.  In certain cases it is quite possible to establish a very lucrative business out of the treatment of persons suffering from mental disease because of certain factors dealing with the sensitivity of the relatives and even of the persons themselves.  The private institutions are often able to afford a certain secrecy and provide confidential treatment of such persons.  It is well known that it has been the practice of private institutions, not merely to charge fairly substantial fees in the normal way for treatment of patients but to have a system of additional fees for certain additional food luxuries which, added together, very often bring the total fee <Col N="1565" /> to quite a substantial figure.  I am not convinced that there is any equitable relationship between the additional fees charged and the additional food provided.  In that direction, I think it would be to the benefit of the patient and also to the good name of proper institutions that there should be some control and certain standards laid down in this respect.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in regard to the new paragraph (f), which, I submit, should be inserted, where we deal with the question of the staff under (d), the Minister has power to refuse the application if he finds that the staff, among other things, is unsuitable, having regard to their duties.  I think we should go somewhat further.  It is not merely sufficient in any institution to have a qualified staff; it is also essential to have a staff that is carrying on its duties under reasonable conditions, both in regard to number and in regard to conditions of employment.  I feel the Parliamentary Secretary would not object if I say that both he himself and the responsible Minister feel that that is something to be aimed at. The very fact that they have given assistance to general nurses employed in various institutions through the country to lay the basis of a pensions scheme shows that they are awake to that factor.  It is even more important when dealing with staff engaged in the care of the mentally afflicted people.</P>
    <P>On the first day on which we dealt with this Bill in Committee, the Parliamentary Secretary explained at some length the efforts he is making to bring about an improvement of the conditions and salary of certain mental hospital staffs throughout the country. I am sure he was actuated not only by a feeling of the inequitability of the conditions of employment but also by the recognition that it is essential and important that they should be afforded as good conditions as possible so as to relieve them of the ordinary stress and strain.  The difficult conditions under which they carry out their duties impose a strain on them and, if we take that view in regard to employment in public institutions, where they undoubtedly enjoy a far greater measure of benevolent protection, as they come under the supervision and control of <Col N="1566" /> elected representatives in a general way, and have the county manager, and, eventually, the Minister himself to intercede on their behalf, it is even more important that some power be taken by the Minister to afford protection to the staffs of private institutions in regard to their conditions of work.  Therefore, in this paragraph it is suggested that the Minister should also require to be satisfied that, first of all, the staff is sufficiently qualified.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has already dealt with the point that it is sufficient in numbers to care for the number of persons of unsound mind. It is most important that the conditions of service of the staff should be satisfactory or of such a character as to secure the employment of persons qualified to take care of those of unsound mind.  It may be one thing for the Minister to have power, under an earlier section, to require certain numbers and also to be in a position to say whether the staff in general is suitable, having regard to the number of patients to be cared for; but it is quite another thing to consider that, if the conditions in the institution are not sufficiently attractive to bring qualified persons into that employment, all the provisions we have embodied in the Bill go for nought. We are then left with the position that an institution which normally could cater for these persons will not be able to accept responsibility or provide proper staff there to carry out the work.  I do not think there should be any great difficulty, not in prescribing exact and detailed conditions of employment but in setting up certain minimum conditions, say, in relation to hours and minimum scales of salary.</P>
    <P>I have in mind one particular case of a man who is performing what we would regard as the duty of a charge attendant in a public institution.  In addition to that, he is giving mental therapy to the patients.  In this case they are child patients, and therefore it is more difficult.  He has had long service, and at the time I was speaking to him his actual cash salary was less than £40 a year.  If we take in the value of his emoluments&mdash;food and living accommodation; I do not think <Col N="1567" /> he receives any uniform&mdash;we would find it very hard to add to that cash salary sufficient to give him even the salary of an ordinary boy working in an outside institution.  I think steps should be taken to stop that practice, and see that these men and women who take up employment in these private institutions shall be at least afforded minimum conditions in order to ensure that they can carry out their work in the proper atmosphere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Deputy Larkin's amendment, the Minister would have to take into consideration quite a number of things that appear to me to be extraneous to the Bill.  It is not proposed to embody in this Bill any section or sub-section that would put a statutory obligation on the Minister to enter into the question of conditions of employment.</P>
      <P>I concede that, owing to the type of ailment these private institutions will be dealing with, special protection is necessary in order to ensure that the patients will be properly cared for, but when we are asked to interfere in a private institution to the extent of determining hours of service and rates of remuneration, I submit that a Bill like this is not the proper place to deal with that, if it ought to be dealt with at all.  We have not interfered in that respect in the management of any voluntary hospital.  The whole scheme of things envisages a new approach to mental disease, and we look upon voluntary mental hospitals as being voluntary hospitals established for the treatment of a particular type of ailment but, nevertheless, voluntary hospitals, and I rather think that the principle of interfering, as Deputy Larkin suggests, in the management of voluntary hospitals, would raise a storm that I would prefer somebody else would take the brunt of than that it should be directed at me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as it is reasonable to do so, I think we have afforded ample protection in Section 114, which sets out the grounds for refusal of registration to private institutions.  First, the Minister must be satisfied the applicant is a fit and proper person.  I think a <Col N="1568" /> reasonable Minister, with a share of administrative experience and worldly wisdom to guide him, would examine very carefully the credentials of anyone who sought to have his institution registered for the care and treatment of this particular type of patient.  The Minister must be satisfied that the person proposing to take charge of the institution is a fit and proper person.  As regards the grounds upon which he can refuse re-registration or a renewal of registration of a private institution, he has to be satisfied as to the premises, the staff, the equipment, the qualifications and suitability of the medical practitioner who is in charge of it.  I do not think we can reasonably be asked to go any further than that.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have already stated, we cannot enter into the question of diet.  The Minister cannot satisfy himself in advance.  He is asked, under Deputy Larkin's amendment, to satisfy himself in advance that proper food will be given to the patients.  When the question of reregistration comes along, if the Minister has reason to think that the patients have not been properly looked after in the matter of nutrition, as in every other respect, he can refuse registration and I think the owner of the institution or the resident medical superintendent who would conduct an institution in such a way that the patients were not properly nourished and looked after would be deemed by the Minister not to be a fit and proper person to be in charge of such an institution.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies will appreciate the importance of this point, that, so far as staffs in such an institution are concerned, we cannot determine in advance the numerical strength of the staffs, trained or otherwise, because the strength of the professional or the untrained personnel will depend on the number of patients in the different categories that have to be catered for and that number will naturally vary from time to time.  At one time there may be a number of patients who are violent and dangerous to themselves and to other people and they will require much more attention and many more attendants than a corresponding <Col N="1569" /> number of a different type of patient. These are some of the difficulties that we have endeavoured to envisage and I think the acceptance of Deputy Larkin's amendment would rather add to the difficulties than tend towards providing a more satisfactory solution. I think the framework of the Bill will reasonably safeguard what the Deputy wishes to safeguard by his amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that it would be a mistake to impose too many restrictions and regulations on persons in charge of private institutions catering for mental patients.  Nevertheless, there are certain vitally important regulations from both the human and national standpoint that should be imposed on institutions of that kind.  I agree also with the Parliamentary Secretary, and I confess I am sorry to have to disagree with Deputy Larkin, that there are certain things that we cannot enter into in legislation of this kind.  For instance, we cannot regulate the hours of duty or the conditions of pay, but we should ensure, at all events, that there is adequate medical supervision, an adequate food supply and an adequate staff to cater for the wants of these unfortunate people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two of the most common complaints in regard to these private institutions is, first of all, an inadequate food supply and, secondly, inadequate attendance. Sometimes the attendants are not qualified to discharge the duties for which they are responsible.  I want to be assured in relation to certain matters.  I want to give the proprietors of these institutions the greatest latitude, but I would like to be assured that in the essential things the patients are adequately safeguarded. I should like to be assured, first of all, so far as it is possible, under the regulations which will be made when this Bill becomes law, that the patients in the institutions will be sure of an adequate food supply. Secondly, it is necessary that these institutions should have adequate medical supervision, and, thirdly, that the patients will have qualified people to attend to their needs.  These are the <Col N="1570" /> three essential things that concern us in legislation of this kind, and as long as we have an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that these things are fully provided for in the Bill, I am quite satisfied to allow this section to go through.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out the difficulties of dealing with the question of diet, I cannot see in these sections any reference to any form of protection for the patients in respect of adequate food.  I agree that it is not possible in a detailed way to prescribe the diet of persons under medical attention, but we should give these patients some general form of protection.  We are dealing here with patients mentally afflicted.  In the ordinary institution, if patients do not receive food in proportion to the payment they make, they are mentally capable of making a complaint, either to the medical authorities in the hospital or to their relatives, but a patient in a mental hospital frequently cannot be aware of the type of food he or she is being given, not to speak of having any knowledge of its adequacy.  When we realise that an additional fee of two guineas has been known to be charged for the provision of one rasher per morning to a patient, we appreciate the abuses which can develop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not expect the Parliamentary Secretary to prescribe in detail the number of slices of bread, the number of potatoes or the number of eggs which should be provided, but surely he can take power, which he has not got under these three sections, whereby his inspector, when making his inspection of these private institutions, will satisfy himself that the food provided for the patients is adequate and of a proper kind.  I do not know whether he has the power at present&mdash; I do not see anything in the Bill which indicates that he has &mdash; but it is necessary that he should have it.  It could be put in a general way &mdash; that the inspector, in the course of his inspections, would have regard to the matter of food, not from the point of view of its nutritional value but from the point of view of its being the proper kind, <Col N="1571" /> properly cooked, of an adequate nature and at least commensurate with the payments being made and that, if he finds an unsatisfactory condition, he would report it to the Minister and it would be considered when the application for renewal came up.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second portion of the amendment, dealing with conditions of employment, I can appreciate that the Parliamentary Secretary is somewhat chary of interfering with the voluntary hospitals in relation to the conditions of employment of their staffs, but it is time somebody interfered with them.  Probably he feels the task is rather too big for him, but I do not altogether accept the point of view that, as a matter of principle, we should not interfere.  There was no such reluctance on the part of the Government when they brought in the wages standstill Order and interfered with everybody in the country in relation to wages.</P>

      <P>The submission I make is that we are dealing with a particular, and, if you like, a peculiar, class of people.  Many of them, because of the nature of their affliction, are completely incapable of protecting themselves.  They are utterly dependent on those in whose care they are, and, if we have a situation in which patients are to be subject to the care and protection of men and women who are not receiving fair and proper treatment in the matter of the conditions of their employment, we can and will have an unhappy state of affairs.  Where such people are in receipt of salaries so low as to leave them continuously in a condition of financial embarrassment, we leave the door open to many peculiar abuses and where we have members of a staff working intolerable hours&mdash;many of them have worked up <Col N="1572" /> to 80 hours per week&mdash;kept on continuous night duty or left in continuous charge of the very bad type of patients, which imposes a mental and physical strain, we are not fostering a condition which will be to the best advantage of the patients.</P>
      <P>It is one thing to prescribe the actual hours of duty and rates of salary which may, I agree, be a very difficult matter, but it is a far more simple thing to say that, in general, persons employed in these institutions shall not work more than a certain number of hours per week, not from the point of view of conditions of employment but from the point of view of avoiding the imposition of an intolerable strain so that they will be capable of carrying out their duties; and, secondly, shall not be paid less than a certain figure if they are adult men or women.  I have already quoted the case of a man, 40 years of age, in receipt of about 30/- or 35/- a week, taking his cash salary and the value of his food and lodging together, and performing the duty of a charge attendant, giving treatment in mental therapy and performing several other additional duties.  In return for that, he was paid a salary less than that which many messenger boys in the city receive.  I think we are losing the opportunity provided by the Bill of dealing with an intolerable state of affairs such as that and one which requires control and correction on the basis of fixing minimum conditions.</P>

      <P>Take, for instance, Section 127.  It says:&mdash;</P>

      <Col N="1573" /> (a) governing the carrying on of private institutions;</P>
    <P>(b) prescribing the medical staffs to be employed in connection with such institutions&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and so on.  The section also provides penalties for, non-observance.  Section 226 then sets out the duties of the inspector of mental hospitals when making inspection, and I think that, when Deputies consider that comprehensive section, they will agree that there is a statutory duty on the inspector to inquire into almost every conceivable contingency which could arise in a private mental institution. Paragraph (c) of the section sets out that he shall inquire whether the dietary of the patients is satisfactory. Paragraph (e) says he shall inquire into the facilities given to patients to attend religious services, and paragraph (f) as to whether any system of coercion, restraint or seclusion is in operation.  Under paragraph (h), he shall inquire as to staffing arrangements; and, finally, in case we have missed anything, there is paragraph (n), under which the inspector shall make such other inquiries in relation to the institution and the patients and the staff and see such other persons as he thinks proper.  When all these provisions are related and a comprehensive understanding of them secured, the House will, I think, agree that the position has been fairly well met.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is quite correct in drawing attention to the powers given to the inspector, but may I point out that, under these three sections, 114, 115 and 116, we are dealing with certain statutory provisions, and I take it that if the Minister refuses the registration of a private institution, the authorities of that institution would be entitled to question, by the ordinary process of law, whether the Minister had acted in accordance with the statutory grounds provided in the sections.</P>

      <P>I am afraid we are merely beating the air.  If the inspector of mental hospitals reports abuses under any of the headings I <Col N="1574" /> have mentioned, the Minister has a statutory right to determine that the person in charge of that institution is not a fit and proper person to be in charge of such an institution, and that ends the matter.  He will not renew registration.</P>

I would ask them to remember that, for the first time, these institutions are coming under the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  That will constitute a radical change.  I can assure the House that so far as I am concerned, and I am sure I can speak for my successor&mdash;though it may be a very long time before he arrives&mdash;we intend to keep a very close eye on these institutions.  We intend to insist that they shall be properly run, and that the patients under their care will be properly looked after.</P>

Sometimes the medical officer in charge of a private <Col N="1576" /> institution might, because of his specialised knowledge, be useful to the lay members of the governing body.

What he has in mind, I think, is that these institutions should be free to carry out small alterations without having to go to the Minister. The difficulty, from our point of view, is that we register them in the knowledge that certain accommodation is provided for patients: that there is a certain area of floor space per patient, etc.  The taking down of a partition, say, between two rooms, although the work might not cost more than a £5 note, might make a radical alteration from our point of view.

Apart from that, the argument I put before the House earlier to-day applies with special force here.  We can determine with a reasonable degree of accuracy the medical staff that would be required in an institution.  We cannot determine the nursing staff because the nursing staff will depend not only on the number of patients but on the type of mental disorder from which the patients are suffering.</P>

      <P>On the question as to prescribing the number of the nursing staff, I know from experience that while there may be a variation in the number of patients in a particular institution from one period to another, and even a variation in the type of patient being treated, there is no great variation in the number of staff employed.  Any sudden demand that has to be met is generally met by the employment of temporary staff. I have seen figures going back over a long number of years which show very little, if any, variation in the number of the basic staff in the institution. It is the basic staff that I would be concerned with to see that within that basic staff there would be sufficient qualified persons, just as the Parliamentary Secretary would be concerned to see that there would be sufficient qualified medical staff.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy O'Sullivan, I move amendment No. 218:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 61, line 29, to delete the words &ldquo;twenty-four&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;six&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The section provides that, where application is made for a recommendation for a reception, the authorised medical officer shall within 24 hours after receipt of the application visit and examine the person.  We feel that there is no good case to be made for allowing a period of 24 hours to elapse between the time the authorised medical officer receives the application and the time when he visits and examines the person.  We are dealing here with the case of a medical practitioner. I am quite sure that if any of us were ill and sent for a doctor we would expect him normally to arrive sooner than 24 hours, except in very exceptional circumstances.  In this particular case, where we are dealing with persons suffering possibly from mental trouble, it is even more necessary that the visit and examination should take place as speedily as possible.  There may be very good reasons for that.  Certainly the whole weight of the argument is against any undue delay.  Accordingly, it is proposed in the amendment to substitute a period of six hours for 24 hours and, in a consequential amendment, to make provision whereby, if the authorised medical officer finds that within such a stipulated period of six hours he cannot make the necessary visit, he can arrange with the medical officer for the neighbouring dispensary district to act for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole purpose of the section I think is to secure that, following upon an application being made for a recommendation for a reception order, within the shortest possible time the person shall be examined and, if found to be suitable for such a recommendation, that forthwith the machinery shall start to operate.  This is especially necessary in a case where a person may be suffering from such a form of mental disease that he may be a danger to himself or others or, <Col N="1583" /> although he may not be dangerous, because of the conditions in the family, his continued presence in the household may impose a very exceptional strain upon those who may have to care for him.</P>
    <P>Unless there is a very strong argument for such an unusually long period of 24 hours in a case like this, I cannot see why a shorter period should not be substituted.  Normally, we would all agree that, if a medical practitioner is asked to call in the early hours of the day, he would normally call at least during the afternoon of that day.  There may be exceptions, where there is an epidemic or an unusual number of illnesses, and he is not able to call.  He also uses his own judgment in cases where his knowledge of the family or of the person sending for him enables him to decide that he can conveniently and safely postpone the particular visit, as the matter would not be serious.  However, in a case like this, it is clear that, until the person is examined, there will be no clear idea as to his actual mental state.  Very often they will be complete strangers to the medical officer, so it is essential that the visit take place within the normal period that might be expected in the case of an ordinary medical practitioner and not at the end of a period very much in excess of that in which we expect to receive service from a doctor in the ordinary round of his duties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that it will be obligatory on the medical officer to visit and examine the person within 24 hours, or are we to interpret the section as meaning that he is to visit the patient and keep him under observation for a period of 24 hours before finally reporting on the case?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand why 24 hours was put in, rather than 12 hours or ten hours, or six hours as suggested by Deputy O'Sullivan.  I admit that a reasonable time must elapse, as the medical officer might <Col N="1584" /> have other cases to attend.  The particular case may be a very urgent one, but I do not see that there can be much objection to the 24 hours and I think it would be inadvisable to limit it to the six hours suggested in the amendment.  If it can be done in a shorter period than 24 hours, it would be advisable, in the circumstances, but I would not quarrel with it as it stands. I assume that in the 24 hours the visit will have been made and the patient examined, and that the doctor will report on the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The main point is that referred to by Deputy Roddy &mdash; why 24 hours was fixed for the patient to be left there without anyone attending to him.  The idea of the amendment was to ensure that the medical examination would take place within the shortest possible time. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would indicate to us that there is no suggestion that the medical officer shall have a full period of 24 hours, for trivial reasons, to ignore the fact that the patient needs attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case, it seems that that period of time is necessary. The doctor may like to have the patient under observation for some time and might not be able to make up his mind immediately.  It would not be fair to rush him into making a decision in a short period as, in certain circumstances, one can understand that the doctor may want this period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I will be able to satisfy Deputy O'Sullivan that the amendment is unnecessary.  It is well to remember that we are dealing in this particular section with the examination and recommendation of chargeable patients.  Under this Bill, chargeable patients are in the same category as public assistance patients under the Public Assistance Acts.  The dispensary medical officer has already statutory obligations in relation to that class of patient, in the matter of prompt attendance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think Deputy O'Sullivan would ask the House to assume that the dispensary medical officer will not <Col N="1585" /> act up to the traditions of his profession and, if the case appears to be urgent, that he will not attend and examine him within even a much shorter time than six hours.  The section provides that he will be under a statutory obligation to attend within 24 hours, but that does not at all mean that the medical officer will wait until the expiration of 24 hours before attending the patient.</P>
    <P>Speaking with considerable experience gained in the field on this matter, I can say that the House may assume that, in at least nine cases out of ten, the doctor has been in attendance on this particular patient over a long period.  Rarely does mental disorder just come as a bolt from the blue.  There is usually a period of considerable anxiety, while palliative remedies are being tried and both the relatives and the doctor are hoping for the best, before they finally decide that the patient must be put under control in an institution.  In that way, it will rarely come as a complete surprise to the doctor that he is required to examine and requisition the reception of such a patient.  Assuming the exceptional case that may crop up, that there is a considerable degree of urgency and that the doctor is not available, such a contingency is fairly well covered already in Section 5 of the Bill.  Section 5 defines the authorised medical officer.  It sets out that if the person ordinarily resides in a dispensary district for which there is more than one medical officer, a certain procedure is to be followed.  Sub-section (1) (a) says&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;in case none of those medical officers is available or all of them are disqualified in relation to the person, or some are not available and the remainder are disqualified in relation to the person, the nearest available of the medical officers of dispensary districts who are not disqualified in relation to the person.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That means, in somewhat more simple language, that in case of urgency, if the dispensary doctor of the district is not available and if his deputy is not available, one may go to the nearest dispensary doctor.  I <Col N="1586" /> think that meets every possible consideration that may arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  What we had in mind was the question of the distressing circumstances that may surround, not alone the patient but the patient's relatives.  We were keen that the shortest possible time should elapse between the incident and the examination of the patient by the medical officer.  I am quite prepared to accept the explanation given.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 223:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (4) to insert the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4)  Where a recommendation for reception has been made under the preceding sub-section of this section and a relative of the person so recommended for reception is not satisfied that such recommendation should have been made, such relative may by notice to the authorised medical officer have such person further examined by another medical practitioner (selected by such relative) and if upon examination the last-mentioned medical practitioner certifies that the person in respect of whom the recommendation was made is not in his opinion of unsound mind, then such person shall be examined by the resident medical superintendent of the district mental hospital and if the said resident medical superintendent shall certify that such person is of unsound mind, the person aforesaid shall forthwith be admitted to the district mental hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this section we are dealing with a case where a member of the Gárda Síochána desires to have a person examined because he believes he is of unsound mind.  There is a certain procedure set out whereby he applies to <Col N="1588" /> the authorised medical officer for a recommendation and, if the recommendation is made, the person will be examined subsequently by the resident medical superintendent.  We are dealing with a procedure here which I feel might be open to certain abuse and I believe it is necessary to afford some protection against the unusual case that might arise.</P>
    <P>First of all, we have a member of the Gárda Síochána making application. That application is somewhat different from the application envisaged under Section 158, where a husband or wife or the appropriate assistance officer, at the request of the husband or wife or any other person, may make application.  Where the application is not made by the husband, wife or relative, I understand there has to be some indication given as to why the application is made by some other person. Where we are dealing with an application made by a member of the Gárda Síochána, we have an unusual set of circumstances.  The application is made by a uniformed officer who has no previous knowledge of or contact with the individual, and his opinion as to a person suffering from unsound mind may be based on fortuitous circumstances that have come to his knowledge in the immediate period.</P>
    <P>I do not want to suggest&mdash;it was suggested earlier&mdash;that there is not, in a general way, adequate machinery, or that the machinery may not be adequately utilised; but because we are dealing with mental diseases, we should be careful to see we do not create circumstances which add to the possibility of the person being regarded as of unsound mind rather than safeguarding him from that calamity.  Let us take the type of person who may be erratic or peculiar in his behaviour and who has the misfortune to come within the purview of the Gárda Síochána, a member of which feels the individual should be examined.  He applies to the authorised medical officer who examines the person and who again has no previous knowledge of that person's life and habits and previous history.  On the basis of his examination he may decide <Col N="1589" /> that a recommendation should be made.</P>
    <P>I feel that the relatives of the person examined should be afforded an opportunity, where they believe there is real ground for thinking that the person is not mentally unsound, of having independent medical testimony and having the person examined by a medical practitioner of their own selection.  The final court of appeal in the amendment is the resident medical superintendent.  Without casting any aspersion on the Gárda Síochána or on the authorised medical officer, I consider it would be comforting to the relatives of persons who might find themselves dealt with under this section to know that, if they desire, they can call in the family doctor to make the necessary examination.</P>
    <P>I agree that, in normal circumstances, if this section goes through without amendment, the authorised medical officer will probably, in nine cases out of ten, take no exception, nor would the Gárda Síochána, to the family doctor being called in.  At the same time, I feel there should be as many safeguards in a Bill of this kind as we can possibly provide.  I cannot see any reason why we should not make the provision envisaged in the amendment, providing machinery whereby relatives may call in doctors who, to their knowledge, have some acquaintance with the family history of the individual concerned, and in that way satisfy themselves that the person should be brought under supervision and control and that he or she has not been the victim of circumstances of a purely temporary character.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke (County Dublin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I shall have to differ from Deputy Larkin's opinion on that particular point.  All through the discussion on this Bill it has been intelligently pointed out that ailment of the mind should be looked upon in the same way as a bodily ailment.  The only point on which I differ from Deputy Larkin is that there is a certain suspicion there that the resident medical superintendent, on the one <Col N="1590" /> hand, and the medical officer who will recommend an individual, on the other hand, will not do the job sufficiently. I am not saying that was implied, but that was my impression.  Take any man suffering from a bodily complaint. The medical practitioner will recommend him to a specialist; whether he suspects it is a case for operation or otherwise, he will send the man to a specialist, to some noted surgeon. The same applies to a man suffering from mental disease.  There is no man better able to diagnose that disease than a qualified resident medical superintendent.</P>
      <P>In my own experience I came across a case where a man was about to be committed by the Guards and the medical officer and it was suggested that before committing him they should ask the opinion of a resident medical superintendent who happened to be adjacent.  The resident medical superintendent expressed the opinion that the man was not a case for a mental hospital.  I believe that any man suffering from mental trouble is definitely protected by this particular section.  He may be recommended by a dispensary doctor to an institution, but if the resident medical superintendent is not satisfied that the man is suffering from mental disorder, he will not take him into the institution, no matter who sends him there.</P>
      <P>These men are men of honour, integrity and experience; they are specialists in that particular disease. I should like the public generally to look upon mental disease as an ordinary complaint and that it is as natural for the mind to be sick as the body.</P>

      <P>I am afraid Deputy Burke was not listening to what I said.  I accepted the resident medical superintendent as the final court of appeal, but may I point out that what I am concerned with is the position which can quite easily arise? A man or woman is involved in a street scene or is guilty of erratic conduct. The person concerned is taken in charge by a member of the Gárda Síochána, who has no knowledge of the individual.  Because of the nature <Col N="1591" /> of the conduct, the Guard feels that the person is of unsound mind and he arranges to have an examination, not by a specialist but by an ordinary medical practitioner.</P>

      <P>Some of them are very ordinary.  However, all medical practitioners are not specialists in mental diseases, and it is a question of having the patient examined by a medical practitioner who very possibly has never had any previous contact with the patient.  The Parliamentary Secretary made the point earlier, when we were dealing with the time at which a person should be examined, that, in nine cases out of ten, the dispensary doctor would have had previous contact with the patient, because mental diseases do not come quite suddenly but are a gradual process of mental deterioration.  Various remedies are tried for a period and finally a decision has to be made.  But here is a different type of case&mdash;a complete stranger brought in for examination, of whom the doctor has no previous knowledge.  He has no knowledge of the family history and possibly no knowledge of what led to the particular conduct.  All he knows is that he is required by the Guards to examine the individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a layman; Deputy Burke is a specialist in his particular profession with long experience; and the Parliamentary Secretary is a medical man; but both will agree with me that one of the most important factors in considering a case of possible mental illness is to know the history of the individual and his family history.  It is especially very helpful to know what went before the particular outbreak <Col N="1592" /> that gives rise to anxiety&mdash;the particular delusions, mental aberrations, physical actions and so on.  None of those is known in a case of this type, and it is only when the person comes to be removed to an institution that he will be examined by a mental expert.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke says that, in the ordinary course, if a person goes to a doctor and the doctor is not quite satisfied as to the condition, he will advise the person to go to a specialist. I am suggesting that a relative of a person who finds himself in this situation should be entitled to bring in a specialist before the person is brought into the atmosphere of an institution. It is no exaggerated view to believe that in certain cases a person may be suffering from temporary excitement, or other form of mental exaltation, and if he remains in a normal atmosphere, will recover, but bring that person into the atmosphere in which he finds himself suspected of suffering from mental disease and he crosses the border.  So long as we are dealing with the Bill which has for its object a reducing of the incidence of mental disease, why should we not see that all safeguards are put into the Bill to prevent anything of this nature occurring?</P>
    <P>In so far as relatives are concerned, they at least would prefer to have someone near and dear to them examined by a family doctor or specialist before being taken into the atmosphere of an institution.  I am not for a moment suggesting that the atmosphere of a mental institution as it appears to the minds of many people is justified in any way.  I have the highest regard for them, like Deputy Burke, but we are dealing with people who possibly may not have the same knowledge as Deputy Burke and I have.  They are the people for whom we must have regard and not those who may have a deeper insight into the attitude of both the medical and nursing staffs of these institutions towards their patients.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Larkin's arguments are rather far-fetched.  I consider it necessary to have some <Col N="1593" /> such section as this in the Bill&mdash;not that the powers in the section are likely to be exercised very often.  It is, however, quite conceivable that in an extreme case, where a person was perhaps a danger to himself or likely to take his own life, it would be necessary to have him removed promptly to the Gárda Síochána barracks.  It is only right that some such power should be conferred on somebody.  In this case, the power is given to the Gárda Síochána and I think it ridicuculous to assume, as Deputy Larkin assumes, that the Guards are likely to abuse that power.  I am quite certain it is one form of duty which the Guards dislike, and it is most unlikely that they will ever exercise their authority under the section except in very extreme cases.  I heard of one such case of an unfortunate person who had to be forcibly removed to the Gárda barracks for his own protection. When the Guards do act in this matter, they are likely to act with the co-operation and knowledge of the other members of the household.  If, as Deputy Larkin suggests, any members of the family circle object to the action of the Guards in such a matter, I think there is some provision in the later sections whereby any medical officer can be called in to examine the person concerned and to certify that he either is a fit subject for a mental institution or is not suffering from any form of mental disease.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Larkin has been so completely answered by Deputies Burke and Roddy that it is scarcely necessary for me to reply at all. Deputy Larkin seems to enjoy himself in debates such as this.  I do not intend to suggest that in any offensive way, but he conveys the impression that he just delights in arguing. I do not think there is any Deputy who can compete with him in theorising.  It is easy enough for anybody to build up the theoretical case, but we have to satisfy ourselves here on the basis of commonsense and the things that are likely to occur in the ordinary course of the operation of a measure such as this, rather than on theoretical possibilities which are very unlikely to arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1594" /> Deputy Larkin may reply to me, and could waste another ten or 15 minutes in telling me that it is the exceptional case we ought to be particularly careful about.  The section as it stands does adequately provide for the exceptional case, but it is only in the exceptional case that the Gárda will come into the picture at all under its terms.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that under the law at the present time an information has to be sworn.  The unfortunate patient is placed under arrest, he is brought before two peace commissioners, the dispensary doctor is called in and the patient is committed.  There is no machinery under the present law for obtaining any expert opinion until the patient has been actually committed to and institution.  We are, at any rate, providing that a patient will not be received until the resident medical superintendent, who is an expert in mental disease, is satisfied that the patient should be so received.  In the ordinary course of things, and within the framework of this Bill, the Gárdaí will not come into the matter at all. The reception of the patient will be arranged for between the family doctor and the resident medical superintendent. As Deputies are aware, provision is made in the Bill that, where necessary and expedient, the mental hospital authority will even send out attendants for the purpose of assisting in the removal of a patient.  There is the type of case where a person may suddenly become disordered in mind and may wander away from home.  The relatives may not know where he is Such a person may be detained by the Gárdaí for his own protection, or for the protection of the public.  That is a necessary and essential provision.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin suggests that, in such circumstances, it is not sufficient to call in the dispensary doctor to determine whether a recommendation should be made for the reception of such a patient.  I do not see any reason why that particular type of patient should have the advantage of being examined by a second doctor. Deputy Larkin talked about relatives having the right to call in a second doctor.  If the relatives are available the Gárdaí will not be concerned about <Col N="1595" /> the reception of the patient.  If the relatives are available and ask a doctor to arrange for the reception of the patient, and if the patient is not entitled to free medical care and attention under the Public Assistance Act, then the dispensary doctor does not come into the matter at all, so that the relatives can get, if they wish, not only one doctor but two doctors to secure the reception of the patient. That is all provided for in the Bill. We are only dealing here with the chargeable patient, with the public assistance type of case.  I do not think anybody would seriously suggest that there will be any conspiracy between the Gárdaí and the dispensary doctor to get someone put under detention in a mental hospital but if it were possible to envisage such a thing, the position is fully and adequately safeguarded by the fact that the resident medical superintendent has to be satisfied that the patient is a suitable one for reception before he receives the patient.</P>

      <P>Before Section 185, but in Part XIV, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>185.&mdash;(1)  Where the chief medical officer of an approved institution becomes of opinion that a person detained in the institution under a temporary chargeable patient reception order or a temporary private patient reception order will not have recovered on the expiration of the period during which, pursuant to paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 182 of this Act, he may be detained the person in charge of the institution may request the Minister to extend the said period and thereupon the Minister, if he so thinks fit, may by order extend the said period, by a further period not exceeding six months or by a series of orders extend it by further periods none of which shall exceed six months and the aggregate of which shall not exceed eighteen months.</P>

    <P>This is a new section providing for the extension of the period during which a temporary patient may be detained if he is not expected to recover within the period of six months provided in the Bill.  I mentioned this point earlier in the discussion today, that it may be found, at the expiration of the period of six months, <Col N="1604" /> that while a patient is not permanently disordered in mind, a further period of detention as a temporary patient would be desirable.

    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  A mental hospital authority may make and carry out an arrangement <Col N="1607" /> for the boarding-out in a private dwelling (whether within or outside their mental hospital district) of any person detained as a chargeable patient in their district mental hospital or any other institution maintained by them.</P>
    <P>(2)  A mental hospital authority may, with the consent of the applicant for the relevant reception order, make and carry out an arrangement for the boarding-out in a private dwelling (whether within or outside their mental hospital district) of any person detained as a private patient in their district mental hospital or any other institution maintained by them.</P>
    <P>(3)  A person detained in a district mental hospital or other institution maintained by a mental hospital authority shall not be boarded-out under this section save where the following conditions are complied with:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that the boarding-out of the person is recommended by the resident medical superintendent of such hospital.</P>
    <P>(b)  that the person is certified by the resident medical superintendent not to require treatment in an institution and not be dangerous to himself or others,</P>
    <P>(c)  that the mental hospital authority are satisfied that the person will be comfortably housed, sufficiently fed and clothed, and otherwise suitably provided for,</P>
    <P>(d)  that the mental hospital authority are satisfied that the person in charge of the proposed dwelling is trustworthy and will carry out the directions given to him in relation to the person boarded-out,</P>
    <P>(e)  that no other person is boarded-out under this section in the same dwelling.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as drafted, provided for the boarding out of charitable patients. It is now proposed to make provision for the boarding out of private patients, and this and other amendments <Col N="1608" /> embody the necessary reconstruction in order to provide for the possible boarding out of private patients as well as charitable patients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke (County Dublin)</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the inspection of dwellings where patients are boarded out, I think that will throw a lot of work on the Inspector of Mental Hospitals, and some provision should be put into the Bill in order to give him assistance.  The Inspector of Mental Hospitals, as he is situated at present, has a good deal of work to do in going around the mental hospitals.  The boarding out of patients is a fine idea because it will bring patients in touch with home life and take them away from life in an institution.  It is a step which has to be taken cautiously here because we have not advanced so far as they have on the Continent in that regard.  Strict supervision, however, will be needed.  In my opinion, the suitability of the dwelling and everything else will have to be taken into consideration, and local inspectors appointed to see that the patients get proper treatment and are not made slaves of in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy examines Section 201 and relates the amendment I have submitted to the House to that section as drafted, I think he will find that we have made a very comprehensive effort, at any rate, to afford the widest possible protection to the patient boarded out.  If the Deputy can indicate to me, either now or on the Report Stage, how we can further improve the section I shall be very glad to consider his recommendations. But we certainly have provided here very comprehensive machinery, at any rate, so far as it is humanly possible, to safeguard the patient particularly, because we are not so very much concerned in this particular section with anybody other than the patient who, in certain circumstances, may be boarded out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Inspector of Mental Hospitals, of course, will not be bound to inspect all these dwellings or homes in which people may be boarded out.  Periodical inspections by the resident medical superintendent or a medical officer on the staff of the mental institution will <Col N="1609" /> have to be carried out; but I am sure Deputy Burke would not level any criticism at us on that score.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (5) (n) says that the Inspector of Mental Hospitals may at any time inspect the dwelling and the person in charge of the dwelling shall give to the inspector all reasonable facilities.  It is well to have the power vested in the Inspector of Mental Hospitals, in order to give him a statutory right to inspect.  From time to time we might hear complaints that everything was not as it should be in the home and, for the protection of the mental hospital authorities and their staffs and for the protection of the patients, it is well to have the necessary statutory power to send out the Inspector of Mental Hospitals in cases where we receive any complaint, in order that we may have first-hand information as to the actual conditions which obtain.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy would look at these three amendments, he will see that 264, 265, and 266 could be resubmitted on Report and all would be to Section 202 and redrafted <i>mutatis mutandis</i> for Report.  It might be done now, but it is not a satisfactory procedure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Junior) Mr. Larkin (Junior)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that. This is just a point of explanation. Deputy Burke has raised the question of the very strict supervision of residences where persons may be boarded out.  In that connection, might I ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he would not consider that the shorter period of three months in the case of public assistance officers, and 12 months in the case of the resident medical superintendent, should be put in as the limit in regard to visits?  Three months is a fairly considerable period.  I am not so concerned about the position of the resident medical superintendent as, if there were short periodical visits by <Col N="1610" /> the public assistance officer, he could inform the resident medical superintendent or the Inspector of Mental Hospitals, if he found a fault.  In regard to the duties of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals, would there not be a possibility of utilising the members of visiting committees who are prepared to interest themselves in the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my own. However, I am prepared to discuss that with the Deputy.  I have no objection to the principle of that amendment, which is quite a good one, but the amendment would have to be drafted in a different form.  There are such points as the number of members of the committee who should go, whether in groups of two or four, and such matters.  I quite agree with the principle.  If we can interest members of the visiting committee to go round periodically and see how these people are getting on, they can take any complaints and bring them to the proper quarter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I will probably circulate for the Report Stage an amendment that will satisfy the Deputy.  On the point of three months, 12 months or one month, I find myself in much the same position as I found myself in in regard to the 24 hours within which the medical officer should visit and examine a patient.  It must be done within a certain period, but it does not follow that it is not to be done, if necessary, very much more often. Again, the number of visits that might be necessary will depend very largely on the type of patient that is boarded out.  There may be a type of patient that it would not be necessary to see for a period of six months, while there may be another type that it would be necessary to see every month.  I am <Col N="1611" /> afraid we cannot make a hard and fast rule that will work satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>The section provides that notices setting forth the right of a patient to have letters forwarded should be kept posted in prominent positions in a mental institution.  It is considered that to adopt that as a <Col N="1627" /> uniform practice might have a bad effect on certain patients.  There are many of these patients &mdash; I am sure Deputy Burke will bear me out &mdash; who have a mania for writing letters, and if certain patients are encouraged in the idea that they are going to get well of their mental derangement by writing letters to the Minister, they will spend nearly all their time writing letters.

      <P>The board shall consist of as many members as are necessary to give adequate representation to each section of racing interests including the public.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will accept this amendment, and that it is not his intention to interfere with racing in any way.  The membership of the board has been fixed at 11.  I trust the Minister will change his mind about that. My desire is that all those people who are competent to judge what is for the good of the racing industry should get representation.  If necessary, the membership might be increased to 14 or 15. People who attend race meetings, bookmakers, owners and trainers, ought to be represented.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment.  Under the Bill, six of the 11 members will be governors, in other words, representatives of the Turf Club and of the National Hunt Steeplechase Committee.  The nomination of the remaining five is in the hands of the Minister.  They may be representative of those who are interested in the industry, such as bookmakers, owners and trainers.  I think it would be wise for the Minister to accept the amendment and give representation, say, to a trade union, and to the jockeys and stable-boys.  All interests should get fair representation.  Even though the intention be that the governors should have a majority on the board, the Minister might accept the amendment and enlarge its membership, still giving the governors a majority.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to accept the amendment because I do not see how it would work.  Some Deputies did suggest an increase in the membership of the board.  If the Dáil felt strongly about that, the suggestion might be considered.  In my opinion, if you want to get a reasonable working body, 11 is quite enough to have on the board.  If you increase the membership to 12, 15 <Col N="1636" /> or 16, or even up to 20, then you will get a body that will argue and not work.  I think that a board of 11 members will provide a business like body.  If the amendment were accepted there is no limit to the number that might be put on the board. If you were to try to operate the amendment, the board might find itself in the position that every time it met there might be two, three or even ten more representatives to be added to it.  I hope Deputy Mrs. Redmond will not get vexed with me for saying that I do not think the amendment is a sensible one.  It is not reasonable and would not work.</P>

I think the Minister would be well advised to consider it.  We could settle the number here.  Perhaps he could suggest a number himself, but I would ask him to extend it so as to have a sufficient number to give representation to those interested in the industry.

      <P>I want to direct the Minister's attention to the principle of providing a democratic way of selecting the board.  Many people have expressed concern that this is an autocratic method.  The Minister will select certain individuals.  There are certain definite interests concerned, and it is suggested that the Minister should empower those people either to put up a panel from which he would select, or to elect a number to the board.  I do not know whether or not the Minister has gone into that matter.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister that it would be unwieldy if you were to have a number greater than 11.  I think 11 or 12 would be sufficient to do the work.  If you want the work done efficiently, you must avoid too much discussion and delay. A small board would be more efficient than a big, cumbersome, unwieldy one. It is on the principle that I move the amendment.  The Minister might inform the House as to why he has not put into the Bill a democratic method of election, a method empowering the governing bodies either to put up a panel or to elect a definite number.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with any business body that I have been acquainted with in piloting legislation through the House, the boards have been nominated in this way.  In that connection I have always put it to the House, and I think it has been invariably agreed, that this system should be adopted.  There is one exception that I have in mind, the board of the Central Bank.  In that case, for one class of representatives, we had a panel system, and looking back on it I think there is something derogatory about the panel system.  It imposes on the Minister an invidious choice.  If there is a panel of five or six, and if he has to select one or two, he is, perhaps, held to be reflecting on the other people on the panel.</P>
      <P>I had this proposition of a panel in connection with this board fully considered and I have discussed it with a number of people who know this matter of racing better than I do. Opinions swayed, and eventually it was decided that this was the better method.  They trust the Minister.  I have already told the House that I am not an authority on this subject, that I would have to be advised and will look for advice where I can get it from people who know this business of racing, and try to get an efficient board, a board that will be businesslike and representative.  There will be some clash of opinion as to whether the board will be representative if you have only 13 on it.  I do not think the people who would be dissatisfied with 13 would be satisfied with 15 or 17. There would be still somebody claiming that their particular section of the industry was not represented.  I think this is not what one would call a democratic way of electing the board but, at any rate, those who nominate them&mdash;the Dáil and the Oireachtas&mdash; are elected democratically and are giving authority in a democratic way to our spokesman, so to speak, to select this board.  If the House is not satisfied with the board, then they can be vocal as often as they wish in regard to it when suitable occasions arise.</P>

      <P>I think the board can do a lot of very useful work if it is comprised of the right people, people who are honestly and sincerely interested in their work.  I think it is possible to get a board of that type. The Minister has professed ignorance of racing.  We all appreciate that he does not know anything about it.  At the same time, he has not told us where he is going to get information about the personnel he will select.  If he is going to select a number of individuals from the governing bodies, it may be argued that those who would be in a position to pick the best material would be the bodies themselves. I do not want to press the point too far.  There is possibly something to be said for the other point of view, but representations have been made to our Party from a number of people that it is objectionable, and we have often argued in this House that this system of constituting a board is objectionable.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hughes forgets that six members of the board will be members of the Turf Club or of the National Hunt Steeplechase Committee.  Surely he is satisfied that these members know enough about racing.  I am not concerned about these six members.  I am interested in the other five.  The other five members whom it is left to the Minister to nominate will represent the racing public, the small owner, the bookmaker and the other racing interests.  Deputy Hughes must not have read the Bill, if he does not know that the members of the Turf Club and the N.H.S.C. will get a majority on the board right away.  They are all racing men, so that he need not have any worries about that.  My anxiety is that the other interests should be represented there.  I think a board of 11 is too small.  If the Minister extended it to 17, it would <Col N="1641" /> give far more representation to the racing public, the bookmakers, the small owners and the small trainers, who are not members of the Turf Club or of the N.H.S.C.</P>

There is only one point I should like to make. The Minister said that he got information as well as he could from those around Dublin who could give him advice. I know the Minister did get all the advice he could.  I am, however, primarily interested in the people in the provinces.  I do not want any more than the Minister's assurance that, so far as he is able&mdash;and I expect he has a good deal of power under the Bill&mdash; he will see that some representative of racegoers and owners in the southern and western provinces will be included on the board.  As I said on the Second Reading, I think the Bill is quite a good Bill in many ways, but I foresee that there might be a tendency for the benefits to be conferred by the Bill to go to the metropolitan racecourses as against the small racecourses down the country.  I, therefore, want an assurance from the Minister that the south and west will be represented on the board.</P>

      <P>It has been pointed out to me by members of racecourse executives that the phraseology of the section as it stands is rather vague and that it might mean that a person connected with an executive or management of a racecourse who would not necessarily have practical experience might be appointed. In order to meet that situation, I have put down this amendment which does not alter the Minister's power but will ensure that only those who have practical experience of the management and running of racecourses will be nominated.  Some of these racecourse executives were afraid that people who have long experience might be passed over in favour, say, of a person who, while connected with the management, would not have actual practical experience.  For that reason I move the amendment.</P>

I assure the Deputy and the House that my mind is running in the same direction and, if I am satisfied that it is necessary, I will put in the amendment.</P>

      <P>A great many people have expressed concern to me that this board may operate to the advantage of the bigger owners and breeders and the bigger racecourses and to the detriment of the others.  Appreciating the fact that the industry is comprised to a very great extent of the small owners and breeders, we want to ensure that they are adequately represented on the board.

A number of representations have been made to me with regard to various interests connected with racing, such as the small breeders, etc.  I hope to get the small breeders represented, but then someone will raise the question with reference to a person appointed: is he a small breeder or a large breeder?  There will be differences of opinion.  I understand that all who are recognised as breeders, small and large, are members of the Bloodstock Breeders' Association.</P>

I am prepared to hear anything any of these bodies have to say when this Bill goes through, as I presume it will go through.  I will certainly try to secure that the interests of the bloodstock breeders are looked after, but I do not want to be tied down by conditions of this kind being put in the Bill, because I might find myself tied hand and foot, and I do not think that would be helpful. The interest that Deputies Hughes and Bennett and Deputy Redmond have at heart is, I think, the interest of the smaller breeders, and I have those at heart, too.  I do not think I need say anything more than that.</P>

There are only 11 altogether and there may be amongst the six who are representing the two bodies that have had control of racing so far some who are small breeders or owners.  There may be some representation to be found amongst the five the Minister has the liberty to nominate. I will do my best to see that the small owners and breeders are represented without, as Deputy Norton says, being tied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to tie the Minister at all.  I raise this because of the views expressed outside by the people who are anxious about their future.  They feel that the big man has advantages over the smaller man and that possibly a board may be constituted which will give him greater advantages still.  They point out, in connection with the Emergency Control Board set up to deal with racing during the emergency, that there were races confined to the South of Ireland prior to that board coming into existence. Those races were confined to horses the <i>bona fide</i> property of <Col N="1645" /> owners residing in the South of Ireland, but the emergency board widened that to horses trained in the South of Ireland.  It is suggested that horses were sent down from the Curragh and the metropolitan area for training, in order to qualify and capture races down there which, in the ordinary way, would have fallen to some southern horses.  They feel that that sort of thing may be carried into the Racing Board, to their detriment.</P>
      <P>We are very anxious to secure that the big breeder as well as the small breeder will be preserved to the industry.  Both are essential.  It may fall to the lot of the big breeder and owner to establish and continue the name of the Irish racehorse abroad. We cannot do without the big man, but we must also look after the small man's interest.  I put down the amendment in order to satisfy these people that their interests will definitely be represented on the board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

      <P>I do not think we should start accepting amendments of this kind with regard to various interests in order to provide specially for the small breeders and the large breeders.  They are both necessary to the welfare of the industry, as Deputy Hughes has very properly stated.  If we start selecting people for representation in that way, it will be an argument for increasing the number of members of the board.  I think it is generally accepted that 11 is a business-like number.  I know that Deputy Redmond and Deputy Fogarty do not accept that, but I think it is a business-like number and my difficulty is to try, as far as is humanly possible, to have all these interests, large and small, represented, while keeping the number to 11.  I may not succeed but I will do my best.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2), line 45, to delete the words &ldquo;The Minister&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;The board elected by public ballot&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I put this amendment down in the hope the Minister might accept it.  I believe it is the general wish of the people interested in racing that they should have a say in the nomination of the members on this board.  I quite understand that the present Minister is sympathetic and is most anxious to help racing in every possible way.  He is a most reasonable man, but he must think, as people outside are thinking, of somebody who may follow him and who may not be so reasonable.  For that reason, I put down this amendment, proposing to give the racing public a chance to elect their own men on the board which controls their money.  I suggest that it be done through a ballot, to be held at some of the principal racing meetings.  For instance, at Punchestown, for the steeplechase people, it could easily be done.</P>
      <P>Then, at the Curragh meeting in June, it could be done for the flat races.  An extra sheet of paper could be attached to the card, in the same way as a free forecast.  The people who are interested sufficiently will have nothing to do but think of what they are about and put down those whom they have in mind.  They will be selecting people who have a definite and practical knowledge of racing.  I hope the Minister will consider it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (6) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(6) A person appointed to be a member of the board, under subsections (2), (3) or (5) of this section, as being in the opinion of the Minister representative of or connected with bookmaking, shall be so appointed by the Minister from a list of persons submitted to him by a joint committee of all bodies or associations representing licensed bookmakers.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will accept this amendment.  Here is a case where you have a class, group or association in the industry, in order to have representation on this board.  All I ask is that the person to be appointed by the Minister shall be so appointed from a list of persons submitted to the Minister by a joint committee of all bodies or associations representing licensed bookmakers.  In connection with a previous amendment, the Minister pointed out that he did not like the idea of selecting one from a number, as it implied rejection of the others.  I would be prepared to withdraw this amendment, if the Minister would agree to introduce one himself on the next Stage, stating that he would accept the nominee of the association, if he does not want to reject others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought it best there should be a list sent to him, and that he should have the right to veto all, or at least take one.  The bookmakers are in a different position.  They may think it wise to have a nominee as between the two big bookmakers' associations to represent both, as there are two big classes affected by the Bill&mdash;the bookmaker who goes to races only and makes a book there and has no office, and the others who have offices and also go to race meetings.  They are affected differently by this Bill.  They themselves would be better able to <Col N="1648" /> select the persons who would be agreeable to both sides.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is a big principle involved.  The bookmakers themselves would feel more secure and more pleased if they could select a representative from a list of even twenty nominees.  If the Minister is left to select the representative of the bookmakers, there will be constant friction and criticism of the bookmaker he may pick.  I do not know who his advisers are on the whole Bill, but I am prepared to venture the guess that his Department will probably be the channel through which the advice will come.  In the profession, they think they themselves should be the people who should select a number of names. I do not think anybody would like to be the person who would select a particular bookmaker to represent the lot.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say he is prepared to select whoever they may elect as their chairman from time to time. However, I would beg him to consider the amendment submitted now in my name and in that of Deputy Breen.  In view of the particular class of business and the interests involved, we suggest that the bookmakers' associations be permitted to select and submit a list of names&mdash;the Minister can specify the number&mdash;from which we would select one to represent the profession.</P>

Five members are to be nominated on this board, and the Minister has not disclosed from what section the five members will come.  He has not given us any indication in that respect, but I think it would be safe to say that only one will be a bookmaker.</P>

None of them, from my knowledge, is too anxious to be on this board, because the members of the board will be more or less a cock-shot for all <Col N="1649" /> complaints as regards bookmakers. The only person who should be appointed is some bookmaker who might be independent.  As regards asking both associations to agree on a certain nominee, I think you will only create strife, and for that reason I say, with all due responsibility, knowing the bookmakers and speaking as chairman of the ring bookmakers, that it should be left to the Minister to nominate the person who will represent the interests of the bookmakers generally. There are inside and outside bookmakers.  There need be no doubt that the Minister will get sufficient information to enable him to make up his mind as to the person he should appoint, a person who will look after the interests of the bookmakers.  I do not know whether the bookmakers' interests have been consulted about this amendment, but it is an amendment that I would not consider wise.</P>

My own opinion, so far as the bookmakers' interests are concerned, is that it would be bad to have a wrangle amongst them as to what person should be appointed as representative on the board.  I think that should be left to the Minister's discretion.  He will find out through his own channels who is the best person to be put there to look after the interests of the bookmakers.  I think this is a very bad amendment, because you will get outside and inside bookmakers to select one representative on the board and that will cause trouble. If some bookmaker is refused a course permit and another bookmaker secures <Col N="1651" /> one, they will all jump on this fellow who will be appointed.</P>

I believe you would be more likely to get disagreement among bookmakers as to the suitability of a person to represent them than you would among any other class of the community.  Deputy Briscoe suggests putting them all into the ring and letting them have one of those fracas that Deputy Fogarty apparently contemplates, and finally one fellow will come out with the flag in his hand.  Deputy Briscoe suggests that that man should be appointed by the Minister, or the Minister might make a selection in another way.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fogarty, with his close, practical knowledge of the business, says it would be a rather hazardous occupation for the person who would be selected, and he is afraid the individual bookmaker will not approach this job with anything but trepidation as to his ultimate fate.  I do not think that Deputy Fogarty's fears in that respect are a reason for denying bookmakers, as a class, a voice in the selection of their representative.  If the bookmaking fraternity could be induced to approach the selection of a representative with due prudence and caution and with a determination not to inflict physical injury on one another, I believe agreement could be secured as to the person who would represent the bookmakers on the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt they ought to have representation on the board.  They are <Col N="1652" /> closely associated with racing.  They fulfil a very useful part in respect of racing, where they conform to a reasonable standard of commercial conduct and financial honesty, and I would like to make sure that they get representation on the board.  Deputy Fogarty contemplates a position in which the Minister will make a selection.  There are people who might not consider that a fair method.  This Minister, or some other Minister, may have some particular brand of bookmaker who may not easily be turned down and some pressure may be brought to bear upon him to appoint a particular man.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Minister ought to accept Deputy Briscoe's amendment. It may be that some of the proceedings at the selection of the bookmakers' representative would not be the most cordial, if we are to accept Deputy Fogarty's version of the standard of conduct in selecting a representative. Frankly, I have a much higher opinion of bookmakers than Deputy Fogarty appears to have.  I think they can be relied on quietly and calmly to select a representative of their interests on the board, and the Minister ought to consent to give the bookmakers, who are apprehensive as to the provisions of the Bill and their ultimate effect on them, the right to select a representative on the board.  Deputy Fogarty thinks that man may stand in fear of molestation.  I do not think so at all. History tells us that there was once a David and a Goliath, and this bookmakers' representative might be more than a match for all the others on the board.  I am sure that bookmakers could produce some worthy gladiator who would go to the meetings of the board determined to do justice to bookmakers and make sure that these folk on the board, many of whom Deputy Fogarty dislikes as a class, would be compelled to respect the rights of bookmakers.</P>

      <P>I must protest against Deputy Norton's suggestion.  I said that it would not be in the interests of bookmakers.  I never said there would be any fight or argument. I think Deputy Norton is exaggerating, because he wants to put me in the position of having said that bookmakers <Col N="1653" /> cannot conduct themselves. What I said was that it would be in the best interests of the bookmakers that their representative on the board should be selected by the Minister and not by the bookmakers but, in view of what Deputy Briscoe has said, that they are prepared to meet and to elect a representative, I withdraw.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to accept the amendment.  I think I have already told the House, when representations were made here and amendments put down seeking to tie me to a certain method of selection, that I preferred not to be tied.  I discussed and thought over the panel system before the Bill was finally drafted.  When it was in its embryo stage, there was the idea amongst some sections of a panel for various interests, but after thinking over it and having doubts of one kind or another about the system, I decided&mdash;I do not know whether I can use the phrase &ldquo;in my wisdom&rdquo;&mdash;that probably the best system would be to put on the Minister the responsibility of seeing that, within the limits of the numbers allowed, he would get a good representative board, and to make him bear that responsibility and any criticism that might follow the nominations made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite prepared to hear any representations or to receive any documentary representations which any organised body connected with racing wishes to make to me before the nominations are made.  Naturally, I include bookmakers in that.  I am prepared to hear any body of representative people with proper spokesmen who have anything to say to me as to the people they think would best suit their <Col N="1654" /> interests, and I will consider sympathetically anything they say or write to me in that regard.  I shall do my best to get a representative person, within the limits of the number, for each of the sections which seeks representation and that should naturally find representation on that board, but, after due consideration, I have not adopted the panel system and I do not propose to adopt it for bookmakers when I have refused to adopt it in all other cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, of course, is aware that there are over 500 licensed bookmakers in the country. He has gone a certain distance by assuring the House that, before making his selection, he will have regard to representations made by the interests concerned.  Would he be prepared to go so far as this&mdash;his opposition to the amendment is based more on his objection to the panel system than to the amendment itself&mdash;that, in whatever selection he makes, not only will he have regard to representations made to him, but he will ensure that the representative selected will be a member of either of the recognised bookmakers' associations, because there are bookmakers who are not members of these associations, and it would be quite unfair inadvertently to select such a person to represent all bookmakers?  If he can go so far, the bookmakers as a whole can take the opportunity between now and the nominating period to make representations as to a number of persons or any particular person whom they would be glad to see selected.  If he agrees to do that I am prepared to withdraw the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BridgetMRedmond" hpid="Mrs. Redmond Mrs. Redmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (4), lines 39 and 40, to delete in each case the word &ldquo;three&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;five&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I believe this is a reasonable amendment. We have heard references to unreasonableness, but I hope this amendment will commend itself by its reasonableness to the Minister.  It is laid down that for the first meeting of the board the quorum shall be seven, and for subsequent meetings the quorum need be only three.  The sub-section says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...such number (not less than three) as the board may from time to time fix or, if no quorum is for the time being so fixed, three&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When we think of the large sums of money that this board will have at its disposal, and of the very many other important matters concerning racing that will come before it, I really think that we should insist on five members forming a quorum, and not three as proposed in the Bill.  This board will have very important functions to discharge, and at least five should form a quorum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the amendment.  Apart from what Deputy Mrs. Redmond has stated, we must remember that the majority on this board will represent a certain interest, so that any three of them could meet and decide anything they wished.  For that reason you might as well have no board at all.  I would be better pleased if Deputy Mrs. Redmond had proposed that seven instead of five should form a quorum.</P>

      <P>I also support the amendment.  Surely, it cannot be said that three members out of a board of 11 represent anything.  This board is being given very important and serious work to do.  Under the Bill any three of them could form a board meeting and carry out some petty idea of their own.  This board will be dealing with <Col N="1657" /> thousands of pounds.  Therefore, I suggest that a quorum of three is ridiculous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be in favour of ensuring that you would always have a proper attendance at the board meetings.  The personnel of the board may be drawn from all over the country.  At many of the meetings it may be that there will be only routine business to be transacted.  Therefore, it might be difficult to get a quorum of five or six.  I am quite sure that every member of the board will take his work seriously and will certainly attend when important business is to be done. But if there is only routine business to be transacted&mdash;the passing of ordinary payments not involving large sums &mdash;it would be unreasonable to insist on a quorum of five or six.  This provision in the Bill should be left somewhat elastic so that the board may decide for itself as to what the quorum should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The board will have discretion to fix the quorum for its meetings.  I cannot imagine it fixing the quorum as low as three.  I do not think that the members of this board will take such a small view of their responsibilities as to fix a quorum of three.  Therefore, I think the amendment is reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The board will have very large sums of money to deal with, and their job is going to be a very responsible one.  Deputy Hughes talked about the board passing a few accounts.  In fact, they could delegate power to officials to make monthly payments.  What Deputy Mrs. Redmond is trying to ensure is that at no time can a small minority of this board agree that certain things be put over on the other interests concerned by <Col N="1658" /> three members holding a meeting.  We in this House know what snap divisions are.  We know that on a Friday morning a small number of Deputies who want to put something over can call for a snap division five minutes after the House meets.</P>
      <P>As I have said, this board will have very important operations to carry out, and I think that not only should the Minister accept the amendment, but should consider whether he would not insist on a quorum of six or seven. Who knows where the board is going to hold its meetings?  The board is not prevented from calling a special meeting at any place it likes.  It may fix centres throughout the country for them where race meetings are being held, so that it would be difficult for some members to attend.  The Minister should take strong precautions to ensure that this board is going to understand its responsibilities.  A quorum of five or six for the meetings will help in that direction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielBreen" hpid="Mr. Breen Mr. Breen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Breen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in possession now. I said that meetings of the board may be held at which only routine business such as the passing of monthly payments is to be transacted.  I also said that if the personnel of the board is drawn from all parts of the country it may be difficult to get a quorum.  There is no provision in the Bill for the appointment of a sub-committee.  Deputy Briscoe talked about the board delegating power to officials.  I am not sure that they could do that.  I do not think it would be reasonable to fix the quorum at five or six for every meeting. It is true, of course, that when important matters are to come before the board, and when large financial <Col N="1659" /> commitments are to be entered into, that the board should insist on a good attendance.  My point was that that would not be the situation at every board meeting.  A small quorum should be sufficient for ordinary routine business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielBreen" hpid="Mr. Breen Mr. Breen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Breen</NameTxt>
      <P>But this board will be always dealing with large sums of money.  At a race meeting they may have a turnover of £20,000 or £30,000. At that meeting they will have to take off the 10 per cent. from the Tote and the levy from the bookmakers.  Therefore; I say that a quorum of three would be ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one other point that I would like to refer to, though it is not likely to arise in the case of a board composed as this one is likely to be.  With the exception of the annual and one or two other meetings, a meeting of the board may be called at any time.  The Bill does not say who is going to call the meeting. It might be possible that the secretary or some member of the board would call a hole-in-the-corner meeting, composed of three members, and come to some very serious decision.  I have said that that is not likely to occur, but my point is that there is nothing to prevent it under the Bill.  Certainly, under the Bill, it is not inconceivable that it might happen.  I think the Minister might accept Deputy Mrs. Redmond's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BridgetMRedmond" hpid="Mrs. Redmond Mrs. Redmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will accept the amendment because, as has been stated, the section as it stands leaves it open to three to slip something across, if I may say so.  As Deputy Bennett said, it will be possible to have a hole-and-corner meeting.  In any case, it could happen that, through accident, one or another might not be able to attend.  It should not be allowed to fall down to three.  Something very important might arise on that particular day.  In view of the importance of the racing industry, and as this Bill is intended to foster that industry, I would urge the Minister again to consider the matter and to accept the amendment.</P>

Included in that is a full account of their receipts, expenditure and a detailed report.  I hope we will get that from the board, but, as to putting down the names of officers, their duties, responsibilities and remuneration, I do not think we ought to put that in the legislation, anyhow.</P>

I hope that stud farm will be run on a satisfactory scale and that it will have a considerable influence on our breeding stock.  I should like whatever work will be done by the Racing Board and the directors of the Tully stud to go hand in hand. I think it would be necessary in order to co-ordinate their activities that these schemes should be submitted to the two Ministers.</P>

    <P>I put down this amendment in the interests of the small breeders.  I was wondering whether the small breeder got the full value of his animal at all times.  Bearing in mind that agents sometimes come to this country to buy horses and dispose of them abroad <Col N="1665" /> and the methods which we have of selling bloodstock here, I was wondering whether this board could improve on our methods by advertising and by providing subsidies as well as by having a sales organisation which might be helpful in the disposal of animals abroad.

I want to delete this paragraph because this Bill is really dealing with racing, and the question of breeding and of the national stud is a different matter altogether and will come up in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I have supported this Bill generally, although there are some parts of it which might be better.  On the whole, however, it is a Bill which has not received much opposition.  I appeal to the Minister not to blemish a fairly good Bill by insisting on retaining paragraph (vii).  I think I am as representative of the small breeders in this country as any other Deputy. I have lived all my life in a horse-breeding area and have bred and sold a number of horses.  Speaking for the small breeders, I say that we do not want anything in this Bill to help us to breed or sell our horses.  We have learned all that is to be known about the selling of horses.  We known all the ins and outs of the trade.  We are suspicious <Col N="1666" /> of this paragraph.  I say that as a breeder myself and as a representative of a large number of small breeders.  We do not yet know what the composition of the board will be. We do not know from what section of the people the board will get information either about the breeding or selling of horses.  We cannot conceive of any member of the board being able to tell us our business in that respect. We desire that things should be left as they are so far as the breeding, selling and exporting of horses are concerned. We in this country have made a name for our horses.  The Bill is really introduced for the improving of racing and the Irish horse will get the advertisement he deserves by engaging in better racing than he has formerly. Some people expressed the view to me that the Bill opens up the possibility of foreign horses coming in here to race.  Some of us hope they will.  If they do, we will probably be able to beat the foreign horses and thus get the Irish horse the best advertisement he can get anywhere.</P>
      <P>The Racing Board should help us so far as it can in that way, but any possible interference with the manner in which we are to breed horses or in which we are to sell or export them will be regarded as offensive by a great many people interested in the breeding and selling of horses.  We have all tried to meet the Minister on this Bill.  I have not been active in opposing any section of it, but I do feel that the retention of paragraph (vii) would open up possibilities that would be considered very vexatious.</P>

      <P>If we want to advertise&mdash;and I hope we shall advertise in every racing paper in the world&mdash;we shall have to do it under this paragraph. As well as that, we hope to have the Bill with reference to the National Stud introduced, and if we want to subsidise the National Stud we can only do it under this paragraph. If we delete the paragraph, I do not see any other provision in the Bill by which we can subsidise the National Stud out of this fund.  This Bill is designed to help horse breeding generally, and that is an important aspect of the work of the board.  If <Col N="1667" /> the paragraph is deleted, we remove any means of providing for the National Stud out of this fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand what is at the back of the minds of Deputy Bennett and Deputy Mrs. Redmond.  We want to use all the powers we have to help breeders, small and large, and the vast majority of our breeders are small breeders.  There is no power under this section or any other section to interfere with the small breeder in the breeding or the selling of his horse.  No power is sought here to control that in any way.  He is free to sell his horse or not sell it as he pleases, and to sell it in any way he pleases.</P>
      <P>So far as this section or any other section is concerned, we do not propose to interfere.  Therefore, I do not see what danger the Deputies see in the matter.  I am quite unconscious of any effort being made in the Bill to restrict the present freedom of action of the small breeder.</P>
      <P>There is a suggestion that the small breeder or the large breeder may be wiped out or that they are not to be helped out of this fund.  I think it is fundamental to the Bill that we must use the funds to help breeding in Ireland and to help to export our horses.  We must endeavour to increase the trade abroad and the more the small breeder or the large breeder sells the better for both.  The section is there in order to make our export trade in horses as successful an industry as possible.  We must do everything, possible, when the war is over, to revive the good trade that existed, and expand and develop it, not alone in European countries but much further afield.</P>

      <P>The Minister says he can see no possibility of anything apt to injure the breeding or selling of horses.  He is very innocent.  I am not so innocent and I can see the possibility. I do not know who will advise the board or how they propose to develop the export of horses.  I have not the least idea as to what they think about it.  For instance, they might decide to have a central selling board <Col N="1668" /> or set up a committee to control the export of horses.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;any purposes, approved by the Minister, conductive to the improvement of the breeding of horses or to the development of the export trade in horses.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is power there to develop the export trade in horses.  They may say: &ldquo;We can develop the export trade in horses.  We cannot have it carried on in the haphazard way it has been carried on.  The breeders of this country lost money on every horse they sold. Let us set up a board to sell horses for them, a board that will be composed of men who know the horses. We will sell the horses for them and make the trade for them.&rdquo;  I am rather suspicious when we start to interfere with the legitimate private trade, either in horses or in anything else.  I have experience of that, for instance, in the Department's scheme of buying stallions.  Some of us know a horse and know we can buy a better horse for less money than through the combined body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>When you encroach on the business of private individuals, whether in regard to horses or cattle, either as breeders or sellers, it is dangerous.  There is a possibility here that it may develop into that.  I do not know how the section would be taken, but I can see that it offers loopholes for doing almost anything, with the approval of the Minister; and the Minister, being the innocent man he is and, as he admits, a man with very little experience of racing, would be open to representations made by certain people, when probably the people I talk about a good deal now would not be there to give any hint to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been engaged in this business of breeding horses, and mixing with <Col N="1669" /> the people who breed them, all my life and I never found any of them who had any difficulty in doing their own business successfully.  So far as financial assistance is concerned, I do not know what financial assistance is going to come out of this Bill to the ordinary breeder.  Whatever money the board may have, even if divided up amongst the breeders, would not matter tuppence, so far as the value of their horses is concerned.  If there is any money to spare I want it to be used under this Racing Bill, which is for the improvement and development of racing, to help the people who pay the tax, to reduce the tax instead of making money out of it.  There will be another time to talk about breeding horses, when the National Stud Bill is introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say to the Deputy what I have said already, that the control of the export of horses would require legislation.  There is no proposition here to control the export of horses, either in this section or any other section.  The board is not given any power to control or any monopoly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister interpret the words &ldquo;any purposes conducive to the development of the export trade?&rdquo; I can see a lot of possibilities.  Various people would have ideas as to the best way to develop the export trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Ceallaigh Mr. O'Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy were converted to that to-morrow and thought it was a good thing to control the export in order to improve horse breeding and the export trade in horses, he would have to go to some Minister&mdash;the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;and <Col N="1670" /> get special legislation passed to control the export trade in horses.  If we wanted some board to have a monopoly or power to regulate it, we would have to pass legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so at all. We have one scheme in operation already and, perhaps, the Minister is not aware of it.  It has been necessary for some people who sell horses at present to get a permit to sell them.  That, I understand, is under an Emergency Powers Order, and unless you were a member of a certain body you could not get the permit.  Probably that is to prevent difficulty at the present time in the emergency, and there is good reason for it, so that the Minister may have a quick way of issuing the permits.  That would be possible in normal times and a particular body might be elected to issue permits for exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to reiterate what the Minister said concerning this section.  There is a certain amount of opinion amongst people who do not realise the position correctly&mdash;and I do not include Deputy Bennett now&mdash;that when this Bill goes through, the rights of owners of horses or of those who conduct racecourses will be adversely affected.</P>
      <P>The Minister has properly pointed out that, unless legislation is passed by this House, nothing whatever can be done to prevent the ordinary normal channels of trade operating.  This section is the only section which permits the Bill to operate its Title, which is &ldquo;An Act to provide for the Improvement and Development of Horse Breeding and Horse Racing&rdquo;.  If we are to have the National Stud functioning, some close relation should be established between the Racing Board and the National Stud.  The only section, in fact the only paragraph, in the Bill to assist horse racing and horse breeding is this paragraph (vii) of sub-section (1) (c) of Section 15, which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Any purposes, approved by the Minister, conducive to the improvement of the breeding of horses or to the development of the export trade in horses&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1671" /> I certainly fail to see anything there which may interfere with or hinder in any way the existing channels of trade or the normal methods which breeders, owners and others who buy or export horses have used up to the present.</P>
    <P>I gather that Deputy Bennett is afraid some interference may take place with the ordinary facilities which have existed or with the ordinary usages of trade.  So far as I can see, there is nothing whatever to fear in the section.  The section is the only link between breeding and racing, if we are to establish successfully a national stud, with sires at reasonable fees.  Under this sub-section, provision is made whereby the board might allow sires at reduced fees or subsidies sires to make them available at reduced fees to small breeders.  I believe that was designed to make first-class sires available at lower fees, which the small breeder might be able to afford. As the Bill stands, a subsidy can be paid to the owner of a stallion, or to the National Stud, as the case may be, and a reduction in the ordinary fee would then be available.  I believe it is the operative section in relation to breeding.  This Bill sets out to deal with the improvement of horse breeding and horse racing and the better control of racecourses and it is not designed solely for racehorse owners or the racing executives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BridgetMRedmond" hpid="Mrs. Redmond Mrs. Redmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister does not find this amendment acceptable.  I honestly have great fears, and I am not alone in that position, because Deputy Bennett and many others here realise that it can happen that this board will have certain very wide powers and can take to themselves anything that they may think they have a better knowledge of than the ordinary man conducting his own business.  They can say, for instance, that they know better how to get good clients abroad and have better opportunities than any man who is working up a connection for himself over a period of years.  I am not in agreement with the possibility that this board should take over the conduct of affairs from private people.  They may <Col N="1672" /> not do it now, but I think that there is some cause for anxiety in relation to the development of the export trade in horses.  There are agents at present carrying on the business and, no doubt, they will be very glad to expand their activities after the war.  In that connection, they will do all they possibly can, and why should they not?</P>
      <P>I suggest it is really going too far to give the board these powers.  We are, as it were, handing to them and reminding them there is another section in which they can interfere if they think fit.  It has been my fear all the time, since this Bill was introduced, that it could lead to a monopoly, and we do not agree with monopolies.  Lots of people interested in horse breeding have approached me, some of them no later than last Sunday&mdash;I met several people in County Waterford&mdash;and they told me they were very apprehensive with regard to large exports of all types of horses.  They wanted to know did it mean that this board would take over full control.  The Bill can give them the power to do it, and, for that reason, I thought it was only right to put down the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the National Stud is concerned, we all realise how effective it could be and what a benefit it will be for the country, but I am not quite in agreement that the racing community should contribute to it.  I regard it as a separate entity.  We know that the breeder has to depend on the racehorse owner.  As I said before, racing is simply the shop window for the breeder.  I think the question of the National Stud should be left until another Bill is introduced and the money should go to it as a separate entity and as a national matter, possibly with some subsidy from the Government but the money to be contributed to it should not be taken from the racing community.  Under this Bill, we are asking the racing public to contribute.  We are handing the money over to something from which the ordinary man attending a race meeting cannot benefit.  The public generally do not gain any benefit by the National Stud.  The average man does not feel that he will be getting value for the <Col N="1673" /> money he contributes by way of tax. For that reason, I think it would be well to leave the National Stud alone until another Bill is introduced.</P>

      <P>I do not know that I can do or say anything more to assure those who have fears that this body, under this Bill, if it is passed&mdash; under sub-section (vii) of this section in particular&mdash;will set up a monopoly to control the export trade in horses. There is no power in this section to do that and separate legislation would have to be introduced if a monopoly were to set up.  There is no such power here.  I would like to see the people, whoever they are&mdash;I do not know who they are&mdash;who have charge of the export trade, develop and expand and make a great success of their trade after the war and there is no intention under this Bill that the Racing Board should interfere with their freedom of action in the matter of an export trade.</P>

      <P>The difficulty that has arisen in connection with this measure is due largely to the fears of independent horse agents who have, through their own initiative and business acumen, developed a trade for horses abroad.  These people have fears that this board will have such influence with the Minister that they will be able to come to him with a scheme for his approval.</P>

      <P>But the Minister has power to approve the payment of a grant or loan for any purpose conducive to the development of the export <Col N="1674" /> trade.  It is quite conceivable that the board will go to the Minister with a scheme and say that, through the instrumentality of the board, they could develop a better export trade in horses, that they could, perhaps, get a better price for the breeder of horses through such a national board or central sales organisation and it is quite possible the board could convince the Minister of that.  I am not saying that it is possible under the Bill, but I am putting that point of view, and I think it is the point of view that Deputy Redmond has in mind.  The Minister has made it clear that there is no such intention.  I do not think there is such a power under the Bill, but in case there is, I think the Minister should give an assurance to the Deputies concerned that, so far as he is concerned, he will not approve any scheme which will enable that to be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 15:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) (c), to add at the end of sub-paragraph (vii), line 51, the following words: &ldquo;provided that, the total annual amount of any grants and loans made for such purpose shall not exceed twenty per cent. of the gross annual income of the board&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I think the discussion on the last amendment has, to a certain extent, proved conclusively that what my amendment seeks will be acceptable. Deputy Cosgrave, when arguing on the amendment submitted by Deputy Redmond, indicated that the main purpose of the Bill is to develop horse breeding and the export of horses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is aware that there are a number of purposes behind the Bill. Deputy Redmond, I think, sees, unless she and I have taken quite a wrong view of the Bill, that it is supposed to have other purposes, such as increasing stakes and prizes for horse racing at authorised racecourses.  It is also supposed to bring some benefit in the shape of a reduction of entrance fees and similar charges and to provide funds to subsidise the carriage of horses competing at race meetings, as well as the improvement of amenities at racecourses.  In view of what we have heard on the previous amendment, I should like the Minister to agree that, of whatever amount of money is collected, 20 per cent., and no more, shall be devoted for the purpose set out in paragraph (vii) (c) of Section 15.  I do not know whether what Deputy Cosgrave said will happen, that the board will regard this as mainly a horse-breeding Bill, but, if it does, it will mean a very serious imposition on the public.  There will be unlimited expenditure on this item with no benefit <Col N="1676" /> at all to the race-going or racing public.</P>
    <P>I do not see how there can be any serious objection, in view of the discussion on the previous amendment, to limiting expenditure to this amount. Had the other amendment been carried, my amendment would not be necessary, but I feel that it should be limited, so that the benefits which are supposed to accrue to racecourses and the racing public will not be relegated to a secondary position, and horse-breeders of a certain type given first consideration.  I hope the Minister will agree to limit expenditure on that purpose set out in Section 15 to 20 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have, and this House will have control.  The Minister has specific control and the House will have control over the whole matter year by year when it sees the report <Col N="1677" /> of how the money has been used. There is nothing to prevent Deputies raising these matters if they are dissatisfied, if they think that too much money has been spent on beautifying racecourses in and around Dublin while those in Limerick, Cork or somewhere else have been ignored and neglected, of that too much of the money has been spent in support of bloodstock improvement and horse breeding, or if they feel that the stakes at race meetings are too high.  There will probably be no complaint in that direction, but these criticisms can be made when the report is laid on the Table and, probably, as a result of being laid on the Table, published in the newspapers, as would naturally follow.  The House will be fully informed as to the expenditure of the money and the Minister will be open to question on these matters.  I hope this board will be a businesslike board which will have the interests of all these matters close to their hearts&mdash;the improvement and development of horse breeding, horse racing and the better control of racecourses. All these matters are very closely intertwined, interlocked and related and the improvement of one will, I hope, help the other.</P>
      <P>The improvement of racecourses will bring, I expect, larger crowds.  If the amenities there are so improved as to make them more attractive, they will draw larger crowds and in the same way if horse breeding is improved, as I hope it will be, when the war is over naturally, and this body gets working and has a considerable sum of money at its disposal, racing generally will be improved.  I hope the board will be able, despite what Deputy Bennett said earlier, materially to help the breeders of horses, particularly those who need help and who have good bloodstock from which they can raise good racing horses and perhaps hunters as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be wrong, in starting this board on its career of usefulness and service to the racing industry, if I may so describe it, to hamper them or tie them down in any way. The wise thing to do, until we see how they work at any rate, is to leave them for some years complete discretion <Col N="1678" /> to use the moneys available in the best possible way in the interests of the three great services set out in the Bill&mdash;the development of horse breeding, horse racing, and the better control of racehorses.  I think this would be an unwise amendment to accept.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>All I want to say is that if one re-reads the Second Reading speeches, and particularly the Minister's speech, one gets quite a different view of the purposes of the Bill from what they now appear to be as a result of the discussion on this and the previous amendment.  I do not want to delay the House further, but I want to say that several important people in the world in recent years have always said when making a prophecy that they never make prophecies. I am now going to make a prophecy&mdash;and I should like the Minister to keep it in mind&mdash;that when this Bill has been operating for two or three years, a great deal of the time of the House will be taken up with trying to remedy all the dislocations and grievances that will arise.  There will be grave disappointments and racing will suffer, because if expenditure on this particular item is not limited where it is not wanted by the breeders&mdash;except by a certain section, and, as Deputy Bennett said, for a very mysterious reason&mdash;it will be found that the racing public who have to pay the piper in this case will stop paying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to correct the misapprehension under which Deputy Briscoe is labouring as a result of the interpretation he has put on my remarks.  I quoted from the Long Title of the Bill which sets out the purposes which this Bill seeks to achieve, namely, the development of horse breeding, horse racing and the better control of racecourses and for these and other purposes to establish a board.  By no stretch of either imagination or words can that be taken to mean that the funds derived from the levy proposed to be enforced under the Bill are to be specifically disbursed to breeders, or that only breeders will secure benefit from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1679" /> If Deputy Briscoe or any other Deputy is of the opinion that the Bill will do the damage he appears to think it will do, I invite him to vote against it, but not to try to have it both ways. If they believe the Bill will operate detrimentally, let them show their opposition in a real way.  If not, let them not endeavour to misinterpret the section or the Long Title of the Bill, because the result of that misinterpretation, or of the misuse of words in that connection, will be that public opinion outside will interpret the Bill in a wrong way.</P>
    <P>This Bill reminds me of the agitation, started by certain lorry owners, in connection with the Transport Bill, who imagined that every lorry was going to be put off the road unless it was run by the Transport Company. But when the Transport Bill was circulated it was found that there was no such provision in it concerning lorries. The same applies here.  If Deputies imagine that there are certain provisions in this Bill, then they should specifically state them, or else allow the sections to stand as they are.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2), line 12, to delete the words &ldquo;one hundred&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;fifty&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I think this is a reasonable amendment and is worthy of consideration by the Minister.  The proposal is that for offences committed by a bookmaker under this section the maximum penalty shall be £50 instead of £100.  A fine of £50 is a substantial one and should be sufficient.  I am sure none of us want to break the bookmakers. We seem to have run amok so far as money is concerned.  Some people talk so glibly now in thousands that they may not regard a fine of £100 as a very heavy one.  I hope that is not the view of the Minister or of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to accept the amendment, and I hope the Deputy will not think me too unreasonable. I think it is necessary to have a substantial penalty for offences of the kind that we are dealing with here.  I hope there will not be any occasion to put the section into operation.  In all probability there will not, but we cannot be too sure.  We must take measures to assure the board that <Col N="1681" /> where offences are committed they will be able to impose sufficiently heavy sanctions against people who decide to make up their minds that they will not obey the law.  It is unlikely, I think, that any district justice would, for a first offence, impose the maximum penalty of £100.  If we are to judge by what has happened in other cases, the fine imposed may be a very modest one.  I would ask the House to support me in regard to this provision so as to indicate to all concerned&mdash;to the courts as well as to others&mdash;that the House regards this as a very serious offence.  We want all concerned to realise that we would regard any breach of the law under this or the other sections to which these amendments refer, as deserving of a heavy sanction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble about a section of this kind is that, while the Minister for Supplies was given very extensive powers under the Emergency Powers Act to deal with a very serious situation we know, from our experience of the last six years, how those powers have been used.  I read of a case which came before the courts a short time ago where a woman down the country was charging 7/6 an ounce for tea, and she was fined 5/-.  I read of another case where an old lady in Leixlip was fined £20, although the excess charges in her case only amounted to 10½.  It is that kind of thing that makes me very sceptical about giving these powers to the Minister. Where grave offences are committed not only should heavy penalties be imposed, but there should be imprisonment.  The opinions of district justices seem to vary a good deal in these cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them seem to have got the million mentality, and think nothing of clapping on heavy penalties for some petty offences.  I know, of course, that the Minister for Supplies is not responsible, under the powers that we gave him, for the imposition of penalties, but in some cases the powers given have been outrageously abused.  Where really serious <Col N="1682" /> offences are committed, I would be prepared to go to the extent of making provision for a period of imprisonment as distinct from a fine.  That might help to put a curb on this bump of big money that seems to be manifesting itself in this country.  They talk of planking down £100 as if it were a hundred halfpence.  Some of the newly appointed district justices may not be used to this.  They may say to themselves:&mdash;&ldquo;The Dáil has said that I can impose a fine of £100; very well, I will clap it on and give this fellow a rap across the knuckles.&rdquo;  I think there is a good deal to be said for Deputy Mrs. Redmond's amendment. Where, however, a serious offence has been committed, I think that, in addition to a maximum penalty, there should be a period of imprisonment.  The powers already given by the House under the Emergency Powers legislation have been grossly abused in some cases and not applied strictly enough in others.</P>

      <P>My remarks will apply to all these amendments.  I understand what Deputy Mrs. Redmond has in mind.  She suggests that when the bookmaker is granted a licence, he should be accepted.  The Government gives him a licence on payment of a certain fee.  Under the Bill the board is given power to say to the bookmaker: &ldquo;Even though you have a licence from the Government, you cannot come in on this racecourse <Col N="1684" /> and bet.&rdquo;  There are such things as &ldquo;mushroom&rdquo; bookmakers, and there are people who bet on certain days. The board might be correct in making a decision not to grant licences to certain bookmakers who, say, go to Fairyhouse, Punchestown, Galway and Listowel and other holiday meetings when they are going to meet the holiday crowd and, perhaps, the &ldquo;mug&rdquo;.  A certain amount could be argued in favour of that, in the interests of the genuine bookmaker who goes all the year round to every race meeting.</P>

There is a good deal to be said for that and that the board should be given a certain amount of discretion but, at the same time, there should be some appeal from that board because, perhaps, some member of the board might have a grievance against a bookmaker or the bookmaker might have a grievance in respect of the pitch he was allotted in the particular enclosure, or he might be asserting his rights there.  The board of governors in that case may assert their rights and they may say: &ldquo;This fellow is giving us a lot of trouble; we will revoke his licence.&rdquo; The board, in its absolute discretion, may at any time suspend for such time as it thinks fit or revoke a course betting permit.  In other words, if some bookmaker who has been betting for years tells some member of the board what he thinks of him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the board refuses or revokes a course-betting permit, there should be some appeal to the Minister.  There should be some appeal, outside the board, anyway, to which the bookmaker can bring any grievance he may have.  In another section of the Bill it is laid down that nothing in the section will be done without the concurrence of the Minister. A great deal has been said by Deputy Hughes, Deputy Cosgrave and other Deputies about the export of horses and in regard to the ways in which money will be used in connection with that matter.  They want all kinds of assurances that nothing will be done without the sanction of the Minister.  The Minister told them that when this Bill is passed they will forget all about it.  I want to know whether or not the Minister will agree to an amendment to establish an appeal in the case of a bookmaker who holds a licence from the Government to bet on any course in this country being refused a permit by the board.  Is there any redress for that bookmaker? I have not seen any amendment on the sheet which would solve that problem, but I think there should be some redress.</P>

      <P>To go to the District Court?  That would involve delay.  When there is an objection to a decision on the course it is dealt with by the stewards within 15 minutes of the objection being lodged.  In this Bill there should be some method, without referring it to a district justice, to have the matter dealt with.  Something might happen and the matter might not be raised in time to allow the bookmaker to attend the meetings at Fairyhouse.  Punchestown, Leopards-town. All these meetings might be over before the grievance would be dealt with.  If the board object to a bookmaker holding a course-betting permit, there should be some way of dealing with it at least within 24 hours. I have read the amendments and I <Col N="1686" /> have not seen one that would cover the matter.  I cannot suggest an amendment, but I do think that it is unreasonable to give the board absolute authority to say to any bookmaker who holds a Government licence: &ldquo;We are not going to allow you to bet here to-day.&rdquo;  I would suggest to the Minister to consider if there is a possible way out.  I would ask him to see that if the board are going to prevent the bookmaker from betting they will give him sufficient notice, and that they will give him an opportunity of having his case heard.  One of the amendments was:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a decision of the board is reversed by a Justice of the District Court, under the immediately preceding sub-section the board shall forthwith grant or restore (as the case may require) a course-betting permit to the licensed bookmaker concerned.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The other amendment was:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where the board, by virtue of sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) of this section refuses to grant to any licensed bookmaker a course-betting permit or suspends or revokes any such permit, the licensed bookmaker concerned may appeal to a Justice of the District Court against the decision of the board and the said Justice shall either confirm or reverse the said decision and the determination of the appeal by the said Justice shall be final and conclusive.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>On the Adjournment, Deputy Keyes has given notice to raise the subject matter of question 21 on yesterday's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I addressed the following question to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will state the <Col N="1688" /> reason for the removal from his position as temporary postman at Ballyhahill, County Limerick, of John Quinlivan, a man having a family of six children, and his replacement by a man having no family.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I got the following reply from the Minister:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When the vacancy arose, Mr. Quinlivan was employed in a purely temporary capacity pending the selection of a candidate.  This gave him no claim to the appointment, and the temporary character of his employment was made clear to him.  He was subsequently displaced in favour of a more suitable applicant.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's question is misleading. I appointed Mr. Regan because I regarded him as the most suitable for the work, and he is not without dependents.  It is also wrong to imply that Mr. Quinlivan will suffer financially as a result of the appointment.</P>
    <P>I suggest that there was nothing misleading in the question.  It was a bare statement of the facts as I knew them. I will give the Minister an opportunity of pointing out to me in what way my question was misleading.  I still assert that it was a bare statement of the facts of what happened. Furthermore, there was no implication in that question of mine as to Mr. Quinlivan's position being worsened or otherwise.  I did not advert to that at all.  Any implication in the matter was an implication by the Minister, who says in effect that Mr. Quinlivan will be at least as well off unemployed as if he were working for the Minister. The only implication I can draw from the Minister's reply is that, being registered at the labour exchange, and as he has six children, Mr. Quinlivan would be entitled to get as much in unemployment assistance as he would get for working for the Minister in the important but badly-paid position of a rural postman.  I did not make any of these suggestions.  I asked the Minister to state the grounds upon which this man was removed from the position to which he had been sent by the labour exchange two months ago on <Col N="1689" /> the retirement of the former rural postman.</P>
    <P>The position of Mr. Quinlivan is that he has a wife and six children solely dependent on his earnings or on unemployment assistance.  He carried out the work of a rural postman during the Christmas rush for several years past and was conversant with the work.  No complaint was ever made as to the way he carried out his duties.  He is a member of the L.S.F. and, at the general elections in 1943 and 1944, he acted in the capacity of a Civic Guard at a polling booth, showing that he is a man of reliable character.  The labour exchange, which I understand is the medium for supplying workers to private employers, public authorities and Government Departments in accordance with the amount of unemployment assistance being drawn, which is related directly to the family responsibilities, sent this man to take up the position of rural postman at Ballyhahill some two months ago.  A week or two ago an order came from the Minister's Department that he must be dismissed and the job given to another man.  If that other man had bigger family responsibilities, I would not have asked the question.  But, on inquiry, I find that this other man, who had come from a neighbouring village or town some short time ago to Ballyhahill, was married only in January last, and, therefore, has no family commitments. He was lucky enough to marry a lady who is employed, as she is caretaker of the local church.  The situation I am putting to the Minister is that Mr. Quinlivan, who has a wife and six children and has to go back to the labour exchange to draw unemployment assistance, is a more deserving case than a man who was married only two months ago and whose wife is employed.  That man was sent to a job on the Clonleharde bog road and worked there for a couple of weeks.  He left that employment to take up another job with a creamery manager with whom he had been working for the best part of last year and was working when he was given this job.  I want to know if the Minister is <Col N="1690" /> entitled to ignore or override the decision of the labour exchange set up by the Department of Industry and Commerce to hold the scales evenly as between one citizen and another.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister entitled to employ a man who is not actually signing at the exchange?  I suggest that he is not so entitled, if he has any regard to the responsibility of his position.  If public authorities and Departments of State can override and ignore the functions of the labour exchange, how can we expect respect for that institution from private citizens?</P>
    <P>That is a statement in extension of a very simple question, in which I have been accused of being misleading and of making implications.  The Minister has told me that Mr. Quinlivan was suffering no financial loss.  If he in his reply tells the House that he is employing a temporary postman at a remuneration less than that which the man would draw as an unemployed man, there is then a reflection on the Minister administering such a Department. If he were conscious of his duty, he would not remain there without taking steps&mdash;and he would have the support of everyone in the House in doing so&mdash;to get out of that situation and see that he employs people in responsible work at a wage higher than the amount they would get when unemployed and on the dole.</P>
    <P>Finally, I know there is one exception to the rule in the labour exchanges as to giving preference in regard to work.  That exception is in the case of keymen in particular jobs of an intricate character.  In that case, when such a keyman is required, he may be picked out and employed, though he may not be the highest on the labour exchange relief list.  I want to know if the Minister will advance that he has taken this man as being a keyman to carry letters around Ballyhahill. That suggestion will not bear the light of investigation, as Mr. Regan was an inexperienced man and Mr. Quinlivan was experienced, so there is very little left in the way of reason for the appointment. Would the Minister be prepared to admit the suggestion, <Col N="1691" /> which is general in the locality, that Mr. Regan was appointed by the Minister to this menial post for the very good reason that he was a sound Fianna Fáil man and the other man had not that qualification?  There is that general feeling in the locality and there are certain circumstances locally to justify that feeling but the Minister now has an opportunity to repudiate or accept the statement.  If it is to be a dogma of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that he is entitled to appoint a man to carry letters in rural areas, when a vacancy occurs, only when there is proof of loyal service to the Fianna Fáil organisation, then we ought to be told that and not have men wasting their time in making applications for such posts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Little) Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Little)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Little)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is rather unfortunate to have to discuss the various merits of two very excellent persons in a place like Ballyhahill and compare their qualifications or qualities, and what their politics are. It comes as a surprise to me that the Deputy claims Mr. Quinlivan as a supporter of his Party rather than of ours, as I happen to have a letter from Mr. Quinlivan in which he himself says that he is a Fianna Fáil man.  So, apparently, politics does not count in this case.  I am sure that Mr. Quinlivan is an excellent person; he is a member of the L.S.F. and quite a good man in his own way.  However, the other man has also qualities of a kind which, to some extent, are taken into consideration. Mr. Regan was a very active member of the L.D.F. and has a fine record as an Old I.R.A. man, and he also has dependents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason why I said the Deputy's question was misleading was that it suggested I was taking the bread and butter out of the mouths of a man and his children and giving it to a man who had no dependents at all.  That is not a fact.  I have it on the file here that Mr. Regan has elderly parents who, apparently, have no means of livelihood, or very slight means, and obviously he must be helping to support them.  As well as that, he was <Col N="1692" /> married recently.  Mr. Quinlivan happens to have the benefit of the Children's Allowances Act, and in unemployment assistance he gets a considerable sum, so that I do not feel that I was depriving him of anything at all. I did quite the contrary, as a matter of fact by giving the job to Mr. Regan, whose recommendations to me were such that I felt he was a very admirable and suitable person.  He happens to live immediately beside the post office and is available for carrying telegrams, which is often of grave inconvenience if a postman lives far away.  The other man does not live very far away, about a mile off, but when balancing up in a case like that on the nicer points, one has to make a choice.  When I saw that no injury was being done to Mr. Quinlivan, I felt I could exercise my discretion.</P>
    <P>It is absurd to say that another Department is going to make appointments in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  It is my responsibility to make the appointments, and I am not bound by any other Department.  I am guided by them and I get the full facts.  The position was filled in a purely acting or momentary capacity, until the appointment was made by me. The automatic operation is to put in a man who has certain financial commitments from the point of view of the labour exchange.  The man goes in in that automatic way, but that is only for the moment as a stop-gap, until the Department has reported to the Minister on all the facts and the Minister makes his own decision.  It would be a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> if the Minister in one Department were to make appointments in another Department and carry out its functions.  I do not think the Deputy has really much grounds to go on.  There always will be a certain difference of opinion as to the merits of one man or another for a position like that.  I have the letter here to show that there is no politics in it of any kind.  Having given careful consideration to both claims, I have chosen the man who has shown himself to have the most character from a public-spirited point of view and from the point of view of <Col N="1693" /> being physically closer to the work and, therefore, most suitable under the circumstances.</P>
