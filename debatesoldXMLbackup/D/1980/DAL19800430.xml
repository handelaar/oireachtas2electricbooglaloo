      <P>Yes.  If that is considered desirable I would be prepared to enter into discussions as to when might be the most appropriate time to have a statement on the Lebanon.  There was a fairly full exploration of the situation at Question Time yesterday but if something further is required I would be prepared to have the Whips discuss it.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Taoiseach's reply.  The Taoiseach indicated on two consecutive weeks that <Col N="200" /> he was anxious that the House be kept fully informed.  There is a meeting of Foreign Ministers next Friday and it might be beneficial to have it after that meeting.  The Taoiseach referred to discussions on the subject in the House at Question Time but there are aspects of the situation in the Lebanon, particularly our recognition of the PLO, which, in my opinion have not been justified to the House and to the country.</P>

      <P>I accept that.  I am grateful to the Deputy for taking the point that probably it would be more advantageous to have it after Friday's meeting.  I appreciate that while a statement from me would be discharging my obligation to keep the House fully informed, nevertheless Deputies might wish to discuss certain aspects of the matter. Perhaps through the Whips we could work out some process by which this could be done.</P>

    <Title>Land Bond Bill, 1980: Committee Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is extending the amount of money that can be paid out in land bonds for the purchase of land.  We object strenuously to the idea that land be bought by means of bonds.  If people have some other kind of property taken compulsorily from them, for instance under the compulsory purchase provisions of local authorities, or by any other means, they are paid cash for the property taken.  I see no reason in equity why people whose land is taken from them for agricultural purposes should be paid less than the cash value or less than would be paid to them if the land were taken for some other purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although land bonds are nominally worth the same as the figure settled in <Col N="201" /> cash terms, invariably because they are not capable of being redeemed immediately at face value, because the redemption date is unsettled and because they bear an interest that is less than the market rate, the bonds are worth considerably less than their face value.  In some cases they can be as low as 80 per cent of their face value when they are paid over.  If a person is paid £10,000 in land bonds, all he might receive is £8,000 if he wishes to sell the bonds immediately.</P>
    <P>The land bond system means taking land compulsorily from people and paying them less than what it is worth.  I would argue that this is contrary to proper constitutional practice.  There is a strong case for arguing that land bonds in themselves are unconstitutional in that they are discriminatory.  I have said already that if land is taken compulsorily for a purpose such as local authority housing the person will be paid the cash value and certainly he will be paid in cash at an arbitrated price, whereas under the land bond system, not only is the price subject to arbitration and possibly fixed independently of what the land could be sold for, but they are paid in bonds which are less in value.  I argue that that is discrimination between one class of people and another in respect of a transaction which is identical as to purpose&mdash;acquisition by a public authority of land.</P>
    <P>The recent trend of Supreme Court decisions seems to indicate that that sort of discrimination has been found to be unconstitutional.  As I understand it, this was the nub of the Supreme Court decision in the case for taxation of married women.  It was considered that the taxation provisions did not give equivalence between amounts allowed to working wives and working husbands and that there was discrimination on sex grounds. It seems equally that where the Government are acquiring land compulsorily and paying some people in cash and others in bonds and discriminating as to which will get cash and which bonds this is purely an arbitrary administrative decision and is in fact discrimination and <Col N="202" /> probably contrary to the Constitution.  I believe this case could be tested.</P>
    <P>Whether it is constitutional or not it seems to me to be morally wrong to adopt the approach that people asked to give up something compulsorily are not treated in the same way as other people who might be so asked.  No.  Government should identify itself with such a practice. We strongly urge that there is need for the Land Commission to buy land because at present the acquisition programme has been sadly reduced and the Land Commission are not able to intervene even when land at the moment is available at quite good value because land values have fallen and they could do a considerable amount of useful work in the interests of small farmers in dividing land coming on the market.  Unfortunately, they have not money to do the job.  We say the money should be made available to them but in cash, not bonds so that land can be bought for cash.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister let us know what the redemption date will be for the new issue of bonds under the powers conferred in this section?  Up to now I understand that not only were people given bonds instead of cash but were given bonds or security bearing a certain interest rate usually less than the market rate and therefore the bonds were worth less than their face value but also the date when these bonds would be redeemed by the State was unfixed.  In the case of other loans which the State floats such as a National Loan, I understand the Government always fix redemption dates or a range of dates such as 1982-1984 and within that period they would say the Government would redeem the loan.  In the case of land bonds I understand no redemption date is fixed and the Government can leave the security bearing this nominal&mdash;often derisory&mdash;rate of interest indefinitely and do not have to enter into any undertaking as to when they will redeen the bond.  That seems highly inequitable.  It is again an instance of discrimination. In paying people by land bonds not only is the State insisting that people who are having their land taken <Col N="203" /> from them give the State a forced loan to enable the State to pay for the land but also, distinct from the practice in the case of other State loans, the State does not say when it redeems the loan in the case of land bonds.  This is adding a further injustice to one that is already serious.  We are totally opposed to the concept of land bonds and therefore we reject this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>This section seeks to increase the amount of money that may be paid out in land bonds for land acquired by the Land Commission. There are two sides to the story.  I am against land bonds for two separate and, one might say, opposing reasons.  As the previous speaker said, it is unfair to the person selling the land that he cannot get cash.  This, I believe, ensures that much land which would otherwise be available to the Land Commission is not readily available.  There is little doubt that people are terrifed of having the Land Commission enter their lands in any circumstances because they know they will be paid by bonds.  Perhaps the experience of bonds may not have been too bad in later years but the traditional belief is that bonds are worth about 80 per cent of their face value.  That is one side of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other side is that the smallholders to whom the land is given are agriculturalists anxious to be farmers and in the last few years they find that a rent of £300 or £400 is required if they are to get this land.  It is not economic for them to accept land on those terms. The Land Commission and the Minister must be well aware that in several cases people who would be normally able to work this land have had to refuse it because of the high rates of interest.  I contend interest-free money should be available for the most important thing in agriculture, land restructuring.  Land prices have been dropping more because of shortage of cash made available by banks than anything else and the drop is, I think, slight because the number of sales taking place is very small.  I believe money should be available interest-free <Col N="204" /> because there is no use talking about bringing a small farmer with 20 acres up to 40, 45 or 50 acres if he is to be asked to pay £300 per acre over a period of 20 years.  This is not practicable.  If you put a farmer into that position and he has to build up a structure to work his farm there can be no profit in the land in those circumstances.  We have looked aghast at prices paid for conacre but I do not think that even in the case of the best land in my area, and it is as good as any in Ireland, has the conacre price gone much over £200.  This is in the case of big farmers with large acreages who can work the land at no extra cost.  The normal small farmer who has to build up a method of working the land cannot possibly pay £300 or £400 per acre. Many people who could benefit from the redistribution of land by the Land Commission have been refusing to take the land because it would be uneconomic for them.</P>
    <P>Land bonds have proved to be a failure on both sides of the fence, from the side of the person selling the land because he has been led to believe over the years that because of the value of the land bonds in the open market he is going to lose out and the man on the other side of the fence is not in a position to pay the kind of rents being demanded to service the land bonds.  Any Government who mean to restructure lands will have to get other means to finance this at interest-free rates, otherwise we will not do the job that we set out to do and it cannot be done.  Enough money is coming to the agricultural community from EEC funds and otherwise to ensure that it can.  If we cannot ensure land restruturing which to most people is the most important factor in agriculture, by providing the money required at a very low interest rate or free of interest, we are not being serious about land restruturing. If we are not serious about this let us say so now because land bonds do not solve the problem or take it from either side of the fence.  The Minister, his officials and the commissioners will agree that the kind of money they have to look for now to service the land bonds and to do whatever fencing and so forth <Col N="205" /> is to be done on the farm is too much to pay for the small man who takes the land.  They know full well that the people who would normally get this land are refusing it and in some cases the Land Commission are being forced to sell to people who should not get land at all under the Act.</P>
    <P>Let us be serious and honest about this.  It has been a failure.  I understand well the case being made for the people who are trying to sell.  Nobody wants to sell land that is tied up in bonds which may be saleable only at far below their par value.  On the other hand, no ordinary farmer can afford to pay £300 to £400 per acre for land and make a living for himself and his family from it.  This matter of restructuring the land and putting our people back on to it is most important.  I went through all that on Second Stage and I do not wish to repeat what I said.  However, agriculture is the most important industry in the country and the most important national wealth we have.  If we are as serious about land restructure as we claim we are, money should be made available at a very low rate of interest so that land could be distributed to people who would be willing, able and expert enough to work it and to make the repayments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand the attitude of the Opposition towards this Bill.  On the one hand, they accuse the Government of running down the activities of the Land Commission and not providing the money to keep the organisation moving to pay for the purchase of additional land, and here we find they are opposed totally to this measure which is providing an extra £25 million in land bonds to enable the Land Commission to pay for land that they are in the process of acquiring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many ways I would have sympathy for some of the points raised by the speakers, but we are all sensible enough to realise that if it were not for land bonds the activities of the Land Commission would have dried up long ago. <Col N="206" /> Since land bonds were introduced in 1923 successive Governments have adopted this system and, as I said in my Second Reading speech, 1.35 million acres of land have been acquired by the Land Commission and distributed to deserving small farmers over those years, and that land has been paid for under the land bonds system.  It has been paid for by land bonds.  It is obvious that if it were not for the land bonds the Land Commission would not have carried out the restructuring they have carried out over those years.  The only alternative to a land bond system would be a massive cash provision which would have to be funded by increased taxation and further borrowing, and that is not acceptable at this time.</P>
    <P>Much criticism has been made of land bonds, much of it unjustifiable.  The important thing to remember is that the interest rate on land bonds is guaranteed by the State and the ultimate redemption at per of the bonds is also guaranted by the State.  Deputy Bruton asked when the redemption date would be.  There is no fixed redemption date.  The Minister for Finance has the option to redeem all outstanding bonds.  He has not exercised this option for the earlier bonds but after 1984 he will have the option of redeeming all later bonds.  Deputy Bruton also mentioned that there is an arbitrary decision as to whether a person may be paid in cash or bonds.  Under the Land Act, 1923 there is a statutory provision that purchase prices in compulsory acquisition cases must be paid for in bonds, so there is no option in those cases only to pay for the land in bonds.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see, unless this £25 million extra that we are seeking under this Bill is provided the Land Commission will be unable to function at this time.  Last year lands acquired for land bonds amounted to about 10,000 acres out of the total of some 24,000 acres from all sources which came into the hands of the Land Commission in 1979. Therefore, it is absolutely essential that this money be provided at this time to enable the Land Commission to continue the purchasing and so on of lands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I would like to join with other speakers in saying that we disapprove entirely of land bonds as a method of paying for land which is taken from owners by compulsory measures.  As we know, land bonds do not maintain their value.  They fall in value very considerably, particularly in an inflationary period.  Land bonds introduced in the 1973-77 period bore interest of up to 16 per cent which stood very well until this Government returned to office.  Not alone did they maintain their value but they went up to £109 and £110 in the hands of people who got them in exchange for lands.  On this Government returning to office and on a rapid increase in inflation, the 16 per cent land bonds which were standing at about £109 and £110 have fallen below par. Land bonds that were introduced since this Government came to office at smaller rates of interest have fallen dramatically.  I am concerned about land bonds as a method of paying for land being entirely unsatisfactory and I am also concerned about the land policy and the activities of the Land Commission since this Government returned to office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I wish to know for what purpose the £25 million worth of land bonds will be used and I want to know whether the nominal value is enough to do the job.  I wish to establish also that the Land Commission have come to a standstill and that there is a vacuum.  So far as the acquisition of land is concerned, the Land Commission have come to a a standstill and this additional £25 million of land bonds is really wanted for a tidying up operation, a close down sale.  Will the Minister confirm that the purpose of section 1 of the Bill is to extend the powers of the Minister for Finance to create an additional £25 million worth of land bonds?  How much of that £25 million is already committed for the payment for lands already acquired <Col N="208" /> by the Land Commission?  The Minister of State told us that 10,000 acres of land were acquired by the Land Commission last year.  Will the Minister tell us when the proceedings in respect of this 10,000 acres commenced?  When were section 40 notices served in respect of the 10,000 acres and how many of these acres did the Land Commission decide to acquire last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister also tell me the average price per acre being paid by the Land Commission for land at the moment and the average price per acre paid for land in 1979?  If one were to look back at the performance of the Land Commission and listen to the Minister of State one would think that the Land Commission had invested gigantic amounts of money in land structures. That is not the case.  The Minister told us in his Second Reading speech that since 1934 £80 million worth of land bonds were created.  In almost 50 years that represents about £1½ million a year. That £80 million worth of land bonds were not given as presents to the farming community, they were issued on the basis that the people who got the land would repay them.  How many people in 1979 have refused allotments of land because the rents were excessive?  I am concerned about the plight of the small farmers who are suffering in the vacuum that exists in the Land Commission.  On a couple of occasions we were promised some sort of protective Act by Deputy Gibbons, when he was in office as Minister, for the small uneconomic farmer who wanted more land so as to protect him from the speculator, the hobby farmer and the man who has already enough land.  There is no sign of that Bill now.  In the meantime the Minister has admitted that the Land Commission are virtually at a standstill as far as the acquisition of land is concerned. The £25 million the Minister is talking about, if land is being paid for at the rate of £3,000 an acre, will only acquire 8,000 acres of land, whereas the normal intake of land in the Land Commission in any year is 30,000, 34,000 or 35,000 acres.  That means that this is a proposal to acquire about 8,000 acres, <Col N="209" /> which represents about three months' normal work for the Land Commission. The Land Commission are grinding to a halt and so far as money can be got to buy land it is being bought over the head of the small uneconomic farmer who is crying out for land and who is certified by the local advisory authorities as requiring more land.  The land is disappearing out of the reach of that man since this Government came back to power because this Government accept the theory of the Department of Finance that the Land Commission have been over the years engaging in some sort of social welfare operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The amount of money provided here for land bonds is totally inadequate.  I would much prefer to see money being provided.  The thinking of the Government is shown in the amount of land bonds being provided.  I want the Minister to spell out how many acres this £25 million will buy at current average prices.  I suggest about 8,000 acres but the Minister has the records and will be able to give accurate figures. I suggest that these bonds will be used in a tidying-up operation in paying for land which is on hand.  The Minister has said from time to time in the Dáil that the Land Commission have 70,000 acres on hand.  I suggest that this is about two year's work in division.  I would ask the Minister of State to explain or break down that 70,000 acres and tell us how much of it is being held awaiting the acquisition of other land or awaiting rearrangement operations so that a better job can be made in rearranging holdings in an area.  If he has the number of staff he should have, is he in a position to divide all that land now?  Of course he is not.  Some of the land will have to remain on hand anyway until other land is acquired or other arrangements are made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="210" /> The naked truth is that the Land Commission are doing nothing in regard to the acquisition of land and are not being let do anything.  Certainly this £25 million will not enable them to do anything.  This Government are showing complete disregard for the small farmer and throwing him to the wolves.  It is bad social policy and the worst of economic policy.  It is bad social policy because it is driving people from rural Ireland and bad economic policy because it is not getting the most out of the land.</P>
    <P>I have posed quite a number of questions to the Minister which, to someone who does not know the workings of the Land Commission, might be thought difficult to answer, but the Minister has the information for which I have asked at the tips of his fingers in his brief.  If the information is not in his brief he can certainly get it without any trouble and I should be glad to receive it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission already have on hand almost 64,000 acres and are in the process of acquiring a further 40,000 acres.  As we know, the acquisition of land is not an end in itself. It is merely the intermediate stage in the transfer of land to needy small farmers. The accumulation of a large pool of land in the hands of the Land Commission and delay in its allotment have meant that a very extensive area is continually unavailable for planned agricultural development by the very people for whom it was acquired in the first place.</P>
      <P>It was with this in mind that the Government decided that for the present the emphasis must be on the re-allocation of land.  This does not mean that acquisition proceedings are not being instituted by the Land Commission. Despite the emphasis which is being placed on allotment, new proceedings are being instituted and will continue to be instituted where circumstances indicate that this course is called for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding this amount of land which £25 million will purchase, it is estimated that the amount will be adequate to pay for such land as the Land Commission with their present staff resources will be <Col N="211" /> in a position to acquire in the next two years.  That is a fair assessment of the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Would the Minister give the number of acres?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be impossible for me to put a figure on the number of acres because prices fluctuate from time to time.  The average price for land in 1979 was £890 and we estimate that the £25 million for which we are asking under this Bill will be adequate to allow the Land Commission to proceed with acquisition for the next two years at least.</P>
      <P>We know, too, that the number of section 40 notices has been reduced considerably because the Government have directed their attention to the re-allocation of land.  The issuing of section 40 notices does not in all cases mean the institution of proceedings because they are simply notices that the Land Commission intend to inspect the land to ascertain its suitability for the purposes of the Land Acts.  To enable that inspection to be carried out a notice operates to prohibit the sale of the land for a period of three months, which may be extended for a further period of three months.  This does not mean that in all cases acquisition proceedings are carried on.  The number of section 40 notices have been reduced because the resources of the Land Commission are being applied to the re-allocation of land, which at this stage is very important.  At the end of this two-year period, during which I believe the Land Commission will have sufficient finance to enable them to proceed with their activities, we will have the new land policy in operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my disapproval of the continuation of the land bonds scheme and I would draw the attention of the House to the selling price of land bonds on the Dublin Stock Exchange. These figures may fluctuate marginally but, nevertheless, they are accurate figures at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that land bonds were issued in 1956 at 5¾ per cent and <Col N="212" /> farmers selling those land bonds today get £50.25 for a £100 bond.  That is a disgrace.  The 1967 land bonds were issued at 7½ per cent and the price they are making on the Dublin Stock Exchange today is £53.75.  That is also a disgrace.  The 1975 bonds were issued at 16 per cent and they are now selling at £98.75.  In 1976 there was an issue at 15 per cent and they are now being quoted at £93.50.  I have demonstrated how land bonds can fall in price.</P>
    <P>In 1942 a poor innocent farmer had his land taken from him by the Land Commission, or perhaps he decided to sell his farm to them.  He was paid in 3½ per cent land bonds.  He would now have great difficulty in disposing of them. Each year land bonds go into a Government draw, in other words, a lottery. That is ludicrous in the extreme.  It is perpetuating a fraud on the people of Ireland who want to sell their land to the Land Commission.  I oppose this Bill vehemently because it is totally wrong and it is absolutely unfair to people who decide to sell their land to the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I know honest people who fell in for farms and lived all their lives here.  They decided to retire and sell their land to the Land Commission.  In the majority of instances they were paid in land bonds. Their standard of living fell rapidly because they were paid in land bonds at 7½ per cent or 8½ per cent.  They could not dispose of the bonds freely because of the price quoted on the stock exchange. The Minister is young and active. He has been Minister for a relatively short time.  I wish him well.  I would ask him if necessary to have a confrontation with his Government and call upon them to abandon the land bonds scheme because it is wrong and unjust.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage of the Land Bond Bill as reported at column 1165 of the Official Report of 15 April 1980 the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I am, of course, aware that some Deputies on both sides of the House are on record as advocating that the system of payment of purchase <Col N="213" /> moneys in land bonds should be discontinued altogether.  This is a view with which I have some sympathy, since land bonds&mdash;especially the earlier issues&mdash;have not always fared too well on the stock market.  In times of inflation this is the fate of fixed interest securities in general. </P>
    <P>That is the understatement of the week of 15 April.  For stock worth £100 you get only £50 or £55 in certain instances. That is not faring too well.  This causes me considerable worry.  The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>However, being realistic, we cannot lose sight of the fact that the alternative to bonds would be a massive cash provision which would have to be funded by way of increased taxation or by further borrowing. </P>
    <P>The Minister, the Government and the Land Commission are charging farmers on the basis of working out the exact price in money terms and not in land bond terms.  If the Land Commission buy a farm from Mr. X and decide to allot it in that locality, they pay Mr. X in land bonds, but the farmers to whom it is allotted are charged a rental worked out on the cash market value.  They are discriminating against the farming community from whom the land is acquired and the farmers who receive the land in allotments.</P>
    <P>I do not think this House has the right or the authority to say: &ldquo;We will acquire your land compulsorily but we will not give you £ for £ the value of the farm.&rdquo; That is wrong and unjust.  It is almost fraudulent.  A farmer who sold his land to the Land Commission ten years ago and was paid in land bonds can find that their value is down to £60, £70 or £80. In other words, if he sells his bonds to a Government stockbroker he can lose around £30 per £100.  We cannot and should not allow such a system to continue. Looking at the value of land bonds quoted on the Dublin Stock Exchange, I feel honestly that the Minister must remedy that situation.  He said that instead of the land bonds there would have <Col N="214" /> to be a massive cash provision.  I do not think he has the right to take land from somebody and not pay the market value.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I have information on the up-to-date quotations and prices for land bonds on the stock exchange.  It is important to draw the attention of the House to the situation as it exists this morning in regard to land bonds.  The Minister should ask the Government to thoroughly examine this matter.  I appreciate that we have been through a period of high inflation, running between 15 per cent and 20 per cent, but the Minister is paying people in bonds which are at a fixed interest rate during that time of high inflation.  The day those bonds are issued and hit the stock exchange they are less than par.  We cannot, and should not, perpetuate such a system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in favour of the retention of the Land Commission&mdash;in fact, I believe it should be extended&mdash;but the system of payment by bonds should be replaced by <Col N="215" /> a direct cash payment.  The Land Commission have a golden opportunity to do good work because land prices have fallen.  If people were approached to sell land for cash as distinct from land bonds I am confident many of them would be willing to deal with the Land Commission. However, if the system of payment by land bonds continues people will become more antagonistic towards the Land Commission.  We should not allow that to happen.  The Land Commission have done a lot of good work and I would be against abolishing it, but while the present system of payment by land bonds continues I have grave reservations about its future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but as a result of the information we received from the Minister this morning we must sort out certain details.  I have always opposed the system of payment by land bonds and I will continue to do so in an attempt to bring to the notice of the Government the need to change that system.  The continuation of that system is a sure way to winding down the entire operations of the Land Commission. People have serious objections to that system and yet we must try to get land to be divided among our small farmers. People are prepared to sell their land privately in order not to have anything to do with land bonds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This morning the Minister of State informed the House that about 40,000 acres are being acquired at present.  At present land prices I should like to know how it is proposed to acquire that land with only £25,000 of land bonds available for that purpose.  It is not physically possible to do so.  The <Col N="216" /> Minister told us that he is buying land at an average price of £890 per acre.  I am not saying that the Minister has given us incorrect information, but he must be referring to land he purchased two years ago.  When did he acquire that land?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The average price for land was much lower two years ago than it is today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>It may have been.  But the Minister, if he is acquiring it at £890 per acre, is not paying the market value, which is between £1,400 and £2,000 per acre.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to point out that if the Government are anxious to carry out a proper land policy they cannot continue to buy land at this price. In fact, they will not get land for £1,000 per acre.  The Land Commission are not instituting new proceedings as far as land acquisition is concerned.  It is possible that the Minister is referring to land in the west of Ireland or in Kerry, but he certainly is not referring to land in my constituency.  The Land Commission have refused to purchase land in Wexford. I should like to know the number of people who refused to pay the type of rent the Land Commission were asking last year.  Deputy Bermingham told the House that the Land Commission were <Col N="217" /> asking a rent of £300 per acre although I understand that they are asking £100 to £135 per acre.  I should like to know the approximate price the Minister intends to pay per acre for the 40,000 acres he will be acquiring this year.  How many people have refused to accept land offered to them by the Land Commission in the last 12 months?  What is the approximate price the Minister expects to pay for land in the latter half of this year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already told Deputy Fitzpatrick that I do not have that information readily available but I can get it for the Deputy if he wishes. The price for land during the coming year will be fixed by the Appeal Tribunal and it is not possible for me to say at this stage what the price will be.  I can only give the Deputy the average price paid for land over the last couple of years.  I was referring to possessions taken last year but the price for the land could have been fixed one year or two years in advance of that.  I have given the average price aid by the Land Commission over the last three years.  We are all aware that the Land Commission do not always purchase the best type of agricultural land and therefore they would not be paying the highest price for it.  A lot of land would be in the west where it would not command as high a price as it does in Deputy D'Arcy's constituency, which is very fertile.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>There is.  They deal with farmers who have been asked to pay a rent of approximately £168 per acre annually. I have written the Minister a detailed letter setting out the position in regard to most of these cases.  Some of these people gave up land.  I do not know the exact price paid by you for one farm in question.  I am talking about an estate near my home.  I do not know whether the owner was paid in land bonds or in cash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is getting into the habit of saying &ldquo;you paid&rdquo;.  When he says &ldquo;you&rdquo; he is talking to the Chair, and it is the Chair who will appear in the Official Report. The Chair cannot give much away.  The Chair does not pay anything for land. Would the Deputy please address the Minister through the Chair?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not certain how that estate was paid for, whether in cash or land bonds.  If it was paid for in land bonds the owner would not have received even par value.  In other words, <Col N="219" /> if he were to sell his land bonds to the Government now he would not receive £ for £.  Had he been paid in cash he would have known what he was getting, but in land bonds he would not.  These farmers have been asked to pay approximately £168 per acre.</P>
      <P>The Minister said here this morning that in 1979 they paid £890 per statute acre and he went on to say that in 1977 they were paying even less than that, something in the region of £750 per acre. These farmers will not be able to pay the Minister in land bonds.  They will have to pay in hard-earned cash, and they are finding it difficult to do so at present. Therefore the Minister is having the best of both worlds.  It seems to me to be strange that the Minister is paying only £890 per acre while charging farmers a rent of £168 per acre annually.</P>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to another matter concerning me regarding compulsory acquisition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Most lands acquired compulsorily are paid for in land bonds. What concerns me is that the Land Commission compulsorily acquire only when there is some agitation in an area. The Land Commission should be able to have areas surveyed and know whether or not there are suitable applicants in that area who can be provided with land. If the Land Commission see a farm for sale they should decide to go in and purchase it.  They should do so for commonsense, logical reasons, because there are suitable applicants in the area, and not, as they do in so many instances, jump in at the last minute when they see walls being painted, fences being pulled down and so on.  I believe the Land Commission should act more from a commonsense, practical viewpoint, rather than being coerced or pushed.  On occasion I have met officials, when there has been a farm for sale which the Land Commission might be interested in purchasing, and have been told in so <Col N="220" /> many words: there is no pressure there; a few meetings should be got going and a few letters flying.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an awful lot of money, paper money only in this instance. I am contending that the Land Commission should have surveys carried out and their policy prepared so that they would know in any given area who are suitable applicants for land rather than acting in consequence of agitation. At that stage it is the person selling the farm who suffers most, because he may have had a prospective buyer who would pay in cash.  But he will be left in a situation in which he may not even receive its full market value; and, even if he does appear to receive the market value, it will be in land bonds only.  This is totally wrong and I hope the Minister will have the situation remedied at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>But surely the Minister has said that these bonds are to be issued straight away, presumably because they are needed to meet commitments that have been entered into already.  If we are being asked to give authority to the Government to issue these, the Minister should at least be able to tell us the rate of interest in relation to them.  I could understand him not being able to tell us the rate in respect of prospective series, the date of issue of which cannot yet be envisaged but in respect of those that are earmarked one would have expected the Minister to know the rate of interest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that the rate will not be less than that in respect of bonds already in existence, that is.  16½ per cent, but the final decision would be a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect that it will follow the same pattern as that of all previous issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Under existing legislation has the Minister the authority to issue a new form of bond which would be subject to a variable interest rate depending, for instance, on some index such as the minimum Central Bank re-discount rate. Part of the problem with these <Col N="222" /> bonds&mdash;the reason that they have fallen below par&mdash;is that while other rates of interest have increased, interest on the bonds has remained static.</P>
      <P>Equally, if other interest rates fell and the rate of the bonds remained static, those people who were lucky enough to have been paid in bonds at that time would have the advantage of receiving windfall profits to which they had no particular right.  One would have thought that the appropriate and more fair way of dealing with the matter would be to link the rate of interest on any issue of bonds to the current Central Bank re-discount rate and to vary the rate on each issue on all outstanding bonds at adjusting intervals and in line with some settled rate of interest.  Would the Minister be prepared to consider such a course of action and, if not, why not? Regardless of the answer to that question, has he power to do so under existing legislation or would such action require amending legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not consider the suggestions being made by the Deputy. In the first place, I would not have power under existing legislation to do as he suggests and, secondly, the Minister for Finance is responsible for fixing the interest rates.  If Deputy Bruton's suggestion were to be adopted, all kinds of problems would be created regarding the fixing of the annuities for the people to whom the land would be allotted because the annuities are based on the interest rate operating on the series of bonds at the time of issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Land Commission could solve that problem by saying that they will fix the annuities at a particular rate and that they will meet whatever difference there may be.  They have the State behind them.  Consequently, they have the resources to meet any divergencies that might occur.  Of course, interest rates could fall, in which case the Land Commission would do relatively well out of any such transaction, but there is no reason for their not being prepared to take the risk.  However, should they consider such a risk to be <Col N="223" /> too great, it is hardly fair to ask individuals who have had their land taken away from them to take the risk on interest rate movements.  If it is unacceptable to the Land Commission to meet the difference between the fixed annuity to the person who is allocated the land and the variable rate of interest on the market, it is even more unfair to ask somebody from whom the land has been taken to take that risk.  The fact that this has been the case in the past is not much of an argument for continuing it.  The question is simply one of political will, of deciding to make the change.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister be more specific as to what change in the legislation would be necessary to empower him to make the change?  I understand he has the power to fix rates and that all that is at issue is whether he has the power then to vary rates.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister tell us, too, what is the likely redemption date for the £8 million worth of bonds to be issued immediately? Up to now there has not been any fixed redemption date in this regard but this situation is totally inequitable.</P>
      <P>Regarding outstanding bond issues, how many have been redeemed?  When were they redeemed and when were they issued?  In other words, I am trying to find out what is the average life of a bond.  We should set an absolute limit and say that no series of bonds should be redeemed later than ten years after the date of issue.  The Minister should not be given the freedom to redeem bonds whenever it suits him to do so.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that basically the predecessors of those land bonds were introduced in the nineteenth century for the purpose of buying out landlords who had not only thousands of acres but in some cases <Col N="225" /> millions of acres?  Therefore, a system that was introduced by the British administration for the purpose of buying out these people is being used now to buy out small farmers because they are old or because for some other reason they are not able to work their land.  It is a totally archaic system.  There is no point in saying that what was good enough for the landlords in the nineteenth century is good enough for the small farmer in the twentieth century. I would remind the Minister that most of the land being bought is being bought from constituents of his in the west who are small farmers.  Many people have the idea that this practice is in defence of the large farmers in the eastern counties who are having to sell their land compulsorily but the amount of land being bought in this way in the eastern counties is very little.</P>
      <P>Most of the people who are having land taken from them by means of land bonds at the moment are small farmers in the west.  These people are the victims of a system which was designed originally for the purchase of lands from landlords, from Lord Lansdowne, from Lord Palmerstown and from the various earls and dukes who had land here.  Exactly the same system that was used to buy land from them, who could well afford to be paid land bonds, is now being used to buy land from small farmers in Glenamaddy and small farmers in different parts of the west.  Could anything be more ridiculous?  The Minister comes in here to defend a system for appropriating land from landlords in the nineteenth century as a means of buying land from small farmers who are down on their luck in the twentieth century.  It is absurd.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not tangle with the Chair over that.  I would just like to ask the Minister a question now.  He said that 26 years was the average redemption period.  I asked why a fixed date had not been decided upon, why there was not a definite period within which these bonds could be redeemed.  All he could say was that it had not been the practice. But the Government has the power to redeem them at any time.  The Government can fix a date when issuing them if they wish to do so.  The fact that the Government are not required by the Act to do so does not mean that they do not have the power to do so.  I feel very strongly that there should be a limit of ten years set on these bonds because then people would know that if they were issued these bonds they could get paid at par within no more than ten years.  But the Minister says that it has never been the practice.  That is no excuse.  This is a sovereign Government elected to change things and if they want to do so they can do it.  The fact that it was not done previously by various governments of different political colours is irrelevant.  I am quite sure that it is administratively possible to settle a redemption date at no more than ten years from the date of issue.  Why would the Minister not be prepared to do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Committee Stage debate on this Bill provides one of the rare opportunities for finding out exactly what the Land Commission are doing and how they are going to spend the money which this House is asked to <Col N="227" /> vote.  I am convinced beyond yea or nay that the Land Commission, in so far as the acquisition of land is concerned, are coming to a halt; they are not doing anything.  The Minister explains now and again that the emphasis is now and allocation of land.  We all know that over the years the Land Commission did not confine themselves to one operation, only.  It was a two-pronged operation, acquiring land on the one hand and allocating land on the other.  We know perfectly well that if they confined their activities to the allocation of land without acquiring any it would not be long before the Commission was wound up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleagues are making the case, with which I agree in principle, that the system of land bonds is unfair and unjust. But the Land Commission must remain and must continue to work because, unless the Land Commission remain and operate, the small farmer will be beaten out of rural Ireland.  I remember the time when people could not be beaten into land; they did not want to hear about it; they were moving out of land and moving out of rural Ireland. Now every smart alec in the country who can get his hands on money, wherever he gets it from, wants to buy land and he wants to buy it at the expense of the uneconomic farmer who is certified as requiring more land.  I do not envy the Minister of State his job and I know that if I was talking to him as an individual I would be pushing an open door.  I know that he could make a better case than I can make because he represents a constituency that is even more involved in this than mine.  One does not like badgering a Minister who has to defend a policy which cannot be defended. But I want to find out from him how many acres of land the Land Commission acquired in 1979.  I do not want to know how many acres a price was fixed on or how many appeals were disposed of.  I want to know how many acres they acquired from the beginning, how many decisions were taken for the first time to <Col N="228" /> acquire land and how many acres were involved.</P>
    <P>Another thing which I am amazed to hear from the Minister is that the average price paid for land by the Land Commission in 1979&mdash;with land bonds presumably or maybe with cash&mdash;was £899.  We all know that the Forestry Division of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry must be paying nearly that at present for land if they are getting any at all.  Could the Minister give us a breakdown of that land?  Could he give us an average&mdash;and averages can be very wrong because there could be a couple of thousand of acres of mountain or swamp and a lot of that could have been bought with the intention of passing it on to the Forestry Division of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.</P>
    <P>As long as I get an opportunity I am going to urge the Minister for Agriculture to ensure that the Land Commission continue to operate until we have another system to protect the small farmer, because that is what we are supposed to be voting on this Bill for today. It is supposed to enable the Land Commission to acquire land on behalf of the small farmer.  Of course this is sham.  It is silly because the Minister tells us that this is enough for two years.  That must mean that he intends to buy land at £1,000 an acre.  Even if he bought it at that price he would only get 25,000 acres for £25 million and for two years that would be 12,500 acres per year which is only a fraction of what the Land Commission were at.  The farmers want more protection now instead of less because the Agricultural Credit Corporation will not give the small farmers money to buy land and neither will the banks.  They simply see land passing out of their reach and that is not fair.  It is not good business for the country and it is not good business socially or economically for the country.</P>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister&mdash;and he must have these figures&mdash;how many acres of land it was decided to acquire in 1979.  How many notices were published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>? When the Land Commission decide to acquire land they publish notices in <i>Iris <Col N="229" /> Oifigiúil</i> saying that in default of an appeal for objection these lands will vest on such a date.  There is no mystery about it.  It should be easy to tell me how many acres of land were covered last year by notices in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  If there is an objection it is heard by the lay commissioners and they may go to court. That is the figure I want.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell me how many notices were served in 1979. We know that some of the notices are not followed up and that some section 40 notices are served to give the Land Commission authority to inspect, consider and decide.  We know that only 22 were served between May and October 1979. How many were served during the entire year?  I am making this kind of contribution to highlight the disgraceful action of the Government in abandoning small farmers to the wolves.  The former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Gibbons, promised us a Land Bill almost as soon as he came into the House.  In months gone by we were told that such a Bill would be coming any day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand why the Fine Gael Party have become so concerned all of a sudden with the issue of the new land bonds.  They were a feature of their land policy during their term of office.  In the last Coalition Government there were no less than 11 series of land bonds issued during that time but we heard none of the opposition that we hear today.  If we go back to a further period of that Government, they issued land bonds as low as 4 per cent.</P>
      <P>We have heard a lot of criticism of the activities and lack of activities of the Land Commission.  When I try to provide £25 million to enable them to finance their acquisition programme.  I am opposed by Fine Gael Deputies.  I cannot understand this new attitude to the Bill.  As I said previously, cash would possibly be a simpler operation; but if we were to pay in cash a massive injection would be needed to finance the activities of the Land Commission.  There is no way any Government could do that on the same scale as they have been doing under the land bonds.  If we do not have land bonds we have nothing unless we take away money made available for other social services, housing, roads and so on. No Government could contemplate this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Land Bonds are not altogether what Opposition speakers are trying to make them out to be.  The interest rates are guaranteed and redemption at par is guaranteed after a period of years.  They are not the white elephant the Opposition paint them to be.  As regards the <Col N="232" /> redemption date, no redemption date has been fixed.  The Act of 1934 did not specify the redemption date.  The Government will have the option to redeem later series after 1984.

      <P>The Coalition Government provided more money for land purchases by cash than had ever been provided before.  The bonds issued during that period were at a higher interest rate than ever before.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick said earlier, for some time the rate of interest was so generous that they were above par.  That cannot be said of any bonds ever issued by a Fianna Fáil administration.  While the Coalition did not abolish land bonds, they issued bonds in such a way that they did not have any of the detrimental effects which bonds issued by Fianna Fáil had.  In trying to rake up history as a justification for his inaction, the Minister is raking up something which is not to his party's credit.</P>
      <P>He said that the Government are puzzled by the Fine Gael attitude, because we are opposing them in providing money to buy land under this legislation. Money is precisely what the Government are not providing under this Bill. This legislation is not providing a single penny.  All it is doing is saying that the Government will be empowered to take a forced loan from other people to finance their activities.  That is what land bonds are&mdash;a forced loan levied on people selling land.  The Government are not providing largesse to anyone.  We are not opposing them in providing largesse but we are opposing them in instituting a system of forced loans on people in an unfortunate position who are forced to sell their land.</P>

      <Col N="234" /> I would like clarification on the provisions of the 1934 Act.  The Minister seemed to claim that he was precluded by law from redeeming before 1984 any bonds issued in 1934.  Would he confirm that this is so?  Is it his intention to redeem all outstanding bonds in 1984, or only some?  In 1984 how will he decide which bonds to redeem?  It seems that the inevitable result will be some sort of capricious choosing of some bonds rather than others.  This would be unfair. We are advocating a far fairer system&mdash;fixed term bonds&mdash;because from the date the bond is issued people will know when it will be redeemed.</P>
    <P>A flexible redemption date means that the Government will redeem the bonds when their face value has depreciated to such an extent that they are no longer worth anything in cash terms because of inflation.  In an era of inflation there is temptation for a Government to put off the redemption date in the hope that inflation will reduce, in real terms, the amount they will have to pay.  The corollary of not having a fixed redemption date is that the redemption date will be very far in the future if inflation continues. But if prices suddenly started to fall, as they did between 1929 and 1933, the Government will suddenly start to redeem all their bonds.  By giving the Government freedom to decide when to redeem the bonds, the Government have the advantage.  That is unfair.  In my view there should be a fixed date.</P>

      <P>When asked about land bonds the Minister said the scheme had <Col N="235" /> been perpetuated when we were in Government.  It must be realised that when we were in Government land bonds, for the first time ever, were above par, they were selling at 102 and 103. There were at least three bond issues under the Coalition and the interest rates were 14¾ per cent, 15 per cent and 16 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>We just discovered that there will be another issue in the near future but the Minister is not able to tell the interest rates because, he says, it is not his responsibility.  He says it is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance.  I want to convey to the House and the country my views on this and hope that the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Lands will recognise the situation.  I hope the bonds will be issued at the current rate of interest taking inflation into account.  This is essential if we are to maintain any semblance of respect for land bonds&mdash;and they have very little.</P>

      <P>What did the Minister mean when he said that land bonds are redeemed after 26 years?  Is it not true there are 1943 3½ per cent land bonds still extant unredeemed?  Tenant farmers are not making anything.  They pay the par value for the land and their annuities include the interest on the capital outlay over 25-year or 30-year periods.  In other words, the Land Commission do not make donations to tenant farmers who pay in full the capital value of the land and the interest.  Land prices have dropped considerably and in this situation I suggest that instead of paying for land in bonds the Minister should urge the Government to consider payment in cash.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a serious matter as far as I and other rural Deputies are concerned.  Small farmers who sell land to the Land Commission suffer considerably, <Col N="237" /> and now that land prices have dropped the Minister should initiate a more dynamic approach and get the Land Commission to pay in cash.  In that way he would be doing an enormous amount or work for agriculture in Ireland and for thousands of small farmers who at the moment are suffering from the bank credit squeeze and from the limits on advances being imposed by the ACC.  If he took the initiative I have suggested, the Minister would be leaving his indelible mark on Irish agriculture. At the moment because of the method of payment for land, small farmers are terrified when they see a Land Commission inspector making an appearance. Farmers who got paid in 1979 land bonds will get only £84 per £100 on the stock exchange.  Let the Minister grasp the nettle and pay for land in cash.</P>

      <P>On the Second Stage of the Bill I criticised its retrospective nature and pointed out that the Bill seeks to validate schemes which as far as I know were drawn up years ago.  Section (2) (a) provides that schemes which may be drawn up shall have retrospective effect. My understanding is that this Bill in effect has been in operation for years and that what we are being asked to do now is to validate pensions that have been in payment for quite a while, to validate and give legal effect to lump sums, gratuities in lieu of pensions that have been paid.  Could the Minister say how many schemes this Bill will validate, if any, and how many such schemes we are dealing with, how long they have been in operation and if he will give particulars of them?</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I have no objection to new schemes having been drawn up and people getting pensions who were entitled to get them.  What I am trying to find out &mdash;and I propose to keep at it gently until I get the information I am seeking&mdash;is the principle involved, the principle of retrospection, doing things on the assumption that the Dáil will rubber stamp them.  I agree that this may have begun during the Inter-Party Government's time.  I understand it began as a result of a working party.  I believe that a working party reported shortly before Deputy Tully left office as Minister for Local Government.  It should have been obvious from my remarks on Second Stage that I would be seeking this sort of information.  I fully appreciate that all the old schemes under the various Acts which are being repealed will be brought in under this scheme.  But I think that certain schemes were drawn up and certain pensions and lump sums paid that could not be drawn up or paid under the previous Acts; that schemes were drawn up and pensions and gratuities paid in anticipation of this measure.  How many schemes were drawn up and how many payments were made?</P>

Four or five extra were actually brought into the new scheme.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i>
        <Col N="244" /> It is very hard to debate the Committee Stage of a Bill like this without giving the impression that one is being obstructive.  I am not, nor do I want to be unhelpful, but when the Government bring in a Bill which is obviously validating and making legal things that have been done perhaps several years ago, I think the Minister should have a brief which would enable him to tell the House that the Bill is necessary in order to give legal effect to schemes and payments that have been negotiated.  He should tell us when they were negotiated and the amount of money involved.  I believe this goes back several years.  The whole principle of the running of Departments comes in.  For years back, I imagine that the local government auditor must have found pensions and lump sums being paid by several local authorities without authority to pay them.  I want to know in such cases does the local government auditor surcharge somebody or does he go to these local authorities armed with an authority from the Minister to pass these payments in anticipation of legislation which is to be passed.  I raise this very deliberately and I want an answer.  I am surprised that the Minister has not been briefed on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to withhold information and I also accept that the Deputy is not being awkward, but in all schemes that were brought in or amended improvements were made especially in the widows and orphans pension scheme.  These schemes were all updated.  I have had no complaints about this being done but there was welcome for it as a step in the right direction. There were two options: you could wait until the Bill went through the House and not give the benefits or backdate the benefits as we have done and we are now about to put the legislation into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot have it every way.  As I said earlier, I am not responsible for the way business is conducted, be it in the Seanad or here.  As far as I know from the documentation that I have there have been no complaints on any of this.  These <Col N="245" /> improvements have been worked out very satisfactorily, by the working party and others who were concerned in this.  I am glad to be able to say that we were able to bring in these improvements immediately the working party and others decided that these were the new amounts that we were able to make.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> When changes are made in that way the authority of this House should be sought immediately for those changes.  I do not believe that the delay is all attributable to the delay which took place in the Seanad and here after this Bill was introduced.  This Bill was not introduced in the Seanad until 14 November 1979 and the Seanad is not the most overworked arm of the Oireachtas as far as I know.  I am complaining that as far back as 1971 authority to make changes was assumed in the Department of Local Government.  It is true that the National Coalition were in power since then and I will not be put off my argument on that account.  The authority of the Oireachtas should be sought where it is necessary to seek it and if a complicated Bill is necessary and enough research has to be put into it, then interim authority should be given.  I assume that since 1971, which is the date given to me by the Minister, claims have been made or things have been done which were irregular, in anticipation of authority from this House and the Seanad.  I assume that since then the local government auditors have visited various local authorities and have seen that these claims were made.  Did they OK them or did they draw the attention of the public bodies to the fact that these payments were being made irregularly?  Are the local government auditors told in such terms that we will be seeking statutory authority for these things and that everything will be OK later on?  I would like that clarified because it is important and this is the only opportunity that a Member of the Oireachtas gets of raising these things.  In a nutshell, I want to know were things done from 1971 up to <Col N="248" /> 1977 which needed legislation?  How did the local government auditor get over it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The improvements in the scheme were backdated to 1971 and the money has been paid to all categories that come under the Act under the usual regulations.  It was approved by the Government and then the usual circular letter went out to the various authorities involved in the schemes.  These payments have been authorised and paid.  In relation to the local government auditor, he raised no objection that I or my Department know of.</P>
      <P>I recall a superannuation and pensions Bill being moved by Deputy Fitzpatrick, when he was in office, for the Minister for Finance in June 1976.  All these regulations have been backdated ten years and the improvements have been granted retrospective to those who are entitled to them.  Deputy Fitzpatrick asked why the payments were made before this legislation came before the House.  A lot of work went into the drafting of this Bill and it was decided to make these payments in that way so as not to hold up those who were entitled to the benefits.  There have been no complaints. People were well pleased with the improvements especially the widows and orphans.  These schemes have been backdated approximately ten years.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The fact that I might have moved a similar Bill for the Minister for Finance in 1976 does not worry me in the slightest.  We had not as many Ministers of State as we have now and Ministers still had to go to Europe.  I stood in on several occasions for the Minister for Finance but that does not affect my argument in the slightest.  The authority of the Dáil and of local authorities is being gradually downgraded and this is the sort of thing that gives rise to that.  These pensions <Col N="249" /> should have been regularised and the Government are to blame for the fact that they were not.  The Minister tells me that the Government approved this.  As far as I know the Government have not the authority to approve it.  The Government are not God Almighty&mdash;the Government derive their authority from this House which in turn derives authority from the people.  What would happen if there was a change of government since these regulations were authorised?</P>
      <P>What would happen if the Government in power now did not agree with this and if a majority of Deputies in the House did not agree to pass this Bill.  I am concerned that the local government auditor apparently took this sort of thing for granted, apparently closed his eyes to it and considered that just because a circular came from the Custom House that everything was all right.  I do not agree with that and it is time people woke up to what is happening.  We know that this is happening here because it is necessary to bring a Bill into the House and because somebody raised the matter but it is an insult to parliament, to authority in general, and is something that should be discontinued.  I am convinced that if a situation arises where a Minister wants authority to give legal effect to pensions or grants or something like that he will get it in the House but it should not be assumed that he will get it and certainly not assumed that he will get it for ten years.</P>

Such regulations will require to be made in the period between the passing of the Bill and the total repeal of the existing enactments being provided for in section 11. This total repeal will be effected with a consolidated scheme replacing the existing enactments as made under section 2.  The regulations may only be made in the interval before the consolidated scheme is made and they are in effect a transitional device in conjunction with the initial schemes which will be made under section 2 to provide statutory authority for the improvements in superannuation conditions already introduced with Government approval in anticipation of amending legislation. Similar arrangements were provided for in the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1976 in relation to civil service pensions.</P>

The date by which the Committee will have to make their response to the invitation to attend the Moscow Games is 24 May and, in the meantime, as the Taoiseach <Col N="253" /> also pointed out, the Committee will no doubt take account of the continuing developments in the situation including the extent to which the established character of the games as a major world sports occasion and as a symbol of peaceful competition between nations is likely to be maintained and upheld.</P>

      <P>The Government have repeatedly condemned the apartheid system in South Africa and are deeply concerned about the systematic abuse of human rights which it entails.  The Government have made known on a number of occasions their concern in particular at the ruthless repression of those such as Nelson Mandela who oppose the apartheid system.  Recently on 19 October 1979, the Day of Solidarity with South African Political Prisoners. Ireland made a statement on behalf of the nine to the United Nations General Assembly which called on the South African Government to release immediately and unconditionally all political prisoners.  In the absence of diplomatic relations with South Africa protests by Ireland directly to the South African Government are not likely to be effective.  We have, however, been associated with our partners in the nine on a number of occasions in direct approaches to the South African Government seeking the release of political prisoners in South Africa and I am sure the nine will take similar action as appropriate in the future.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Foreign Ministers of the nine member states of the European Community, meeting in Luxembourg on 22 April, expressed concern that the continued holding of the US hostages, which is a serious breach of international law, could endanger international peace and security.  They accordingly decided to put into effect without delay the following measures, to the extent that they are not already in force: (i) reduction in embassy staff in Tehran; (ii) a reduction in the number of diplomats accredited by the Government of Iran in their countries; (iii) the reintroduction, where not already in force, of a visa system for Iranian nationals travelling to member countries of the nine; (iv) the withholding of permission for the sale or export of arms or defence-related equipment to Iran.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Foreign Ministers of the nine also decided to seek immediate legislation where necessary in their national parliaments to impose sanctions against Iran in accordance with the Security Council Resolution on Iran of 10 January 1980, which was vetoed by the Soviet Union, and in accordance with the rules of international law.  They believe that these legislative processes should be completed by 17 May, the date of the Foreign Ministers meeting in Naples.  If by that time there has not been any <Col N="259" /> decisive progress leading to the release of the hostages, they will proceed to the common application of the sanctions.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in an earlier reply on 21 February 1980, the size of the Soviet Embassy in Dublin and of the Irish Embassy in Moscow was agreed by the two Governments at the outset.  It is permissible for both Embassies to augment their staff through local recruitment if they so desire.

There appears to be some difference of opinion between the trade and the diplomatic sides.  It does not have anything to do with me.  In fact, at present they are two short of their full staff by their own decision. Unfortunately, their newly appointed Ambassador is not too well and has not been able to come here.  The First Secretary is acting in his place.  They had an information counsellor who has not been replaced since his departure at the end of 1978.

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is possibly referring to decisions of the European Commission in January 1980 which had the effect of temporarily suspending the fixing of export refunds for the exportation of butter and butter oils to most East European countries and of subsequently suspending the export refund for bulk butter to these countries.  This has effectively prevented the export of such butter to these countries, but exports of butter in packet from is still possible.</P>
      <P>The Commission, which is the responsible authority for the market management, has indicated that normal trade flows will be resumed as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he has specific proposals to make at the forthcoming nuclear non-proliferation treaty discussions in Geneva, Switzerland and, if so, if he will outline same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take questions Nos. 17, 18 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>The goal of general and complete disarmament under effective international control was set out by the United Nations as the desired objective in the disarmament field as early as 1961.  Ireland fully supports this objective.  Nonetheless if we are ever to achieve this goal we must, not simply talk about it, but set out a practical programme on how it can be achieved and encourage realistic measures which will bring it about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With this in mind Ireland together with five other countries proposed a comprehensive programme on disarmament to the United Nations on 1 December 1970.  In the course of his detailed statement on disarmament at the United Nations Special Session on Disarmament in 1978 the former Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, reiterated Ireland's commitment to general and complete disarmament and towards that end proposed a ten-point programme of concrete disarmament measures.  A specific programme of action was agreed at the special session. The UN Disarmament Commission elaborated that programme last May and the Committee on Disarmament has begun work on negotiating the elements of a programme of general and complete <Col N="267" /> disarmament in time for the Second Special Session on Disarmament which will be held in 1982.  While general and complete disarmament remains our goal we must recognise that negotiations should continue on arms control and more limited disarmament measures.</P>
    <P>At the forthcoming Second Review Conference of the Treaty on the non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons the Irish delegation will work for the strengthening and strict implementation of the provisions of the Treaty.  The non-Proliferation Treaty has been successful as an instrument for limiting the spread of nuclear weapons.  However, we are seriously concerned that the increasing technological capacity of many countries could place the nuclear weapons option within the reach of more and more countries.  The prospect of a continuing arms race between the nuclear powers adds to these concerns.  We believe it is particularly important that the forthcoming review conference should reduce these concerns, help arrest the dangerous trends in the arms race and achieve the following concrete results:</P>
    <P> (i)  a more determined effort by the nuclear powers to fulfil their treaty obligations particularly the solemn obligation contained in Article VI of the treaty on nuclear disarmament;</P>
    <P>(ii)  the conclusion of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and, in the absence of this, an immediate moratorium on all nuclear weapons testing;</P>
    <P>(iii)  full guarantees by the nuclear weapon states that they will never use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon states; and</P>
    <P>(iv)  greater control over the transfer of sensitive technology by means of strict and effective implementation of IAEA safeguards.  </P>
    <P>I understand the Deputy's point in relation to the imposition of time limits for the achievement of general and complete disarmament.  However, I think that in the present circumstances such a <Col N="268" /> proposal would have little prospect of meeting with success.  In addition negotiations on time limits could delay the urgent task of achieving agreement on substantive and practical disarmament measures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the former Taoiseach's fine speech on the whole question of nuclear disarmament to the United Nations.  Might I ask the Minister firstly: did our changed attitude to the question of non-proliferation, our decision to vote against the non-proliferation treaty represent an alteration in our attitude to trying to make sure that there will be an end to the whole question of nuclear armament?  Our position used to be completely unequivocal, that we were opposed to the use of nuclear weapons and wished that they be completely abolished.  Has our position changed in any way as a result of the softening of our attitude to the non-proliferation treaty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that there is no softening of our attitude to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.  At the forthcoming second review conference to which I have referred we will be working for the strengthening and strict implementation of the provisions of the treaty.  Proposals are made from time to time at the UN which are not realistic. We have a reputation for being a realistic country and when we put forward proposals or support proposals they are realistic.  There is no point in proposing or supporting what might be termed pious resolutions.  Progress can be made only on the basis of supporting resolutions that will be passed and that have the prospect of being implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always considered the word &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; to be one of the most dangerous words in a politician's vocabulary because it can mean anything.  Would the Minister agree that <Col N="269" /> we are in a unique position in that there is no question of our ever having bombs or using them, to set a target such as a five-year limit which would give the opportunity of working towards some sort of limit rather than having merely the SALT agreement which is limited to two countries and does not encompass France, Britain or China and also&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concern in this area.  It is a matter of concern for all of us but, having studied the matter in detail, we have concluded that the best way to approach it is to strengthen the existing non-proliferation agreement and to ensure that there is strict implementation and monitoring of it in order to ensure its enforcement. There is a prospect of getting agreement among the nations on that aspect but I agree in principle with what the Deputy says.</P>

      <P>Yes, and I include in that the nuclear nations.  I agree that in theory the imposition of a time limit would be the ideal but from the soundings we have made our information is that such a proposal would have little prospect of meeting with success. That is the reality of the situation on the ground.  We are going ahead and supporting disarmament proposals which we consider will get the backing of all of the UN.  This is a proposal that could have the effect of reducing armaments and of ensuring the continuation of the development towards curbing the proliferation of nuclear weapons.</P>

      <P>In reply to a question on 25 March, to which I would refer the Deputy, I said that the Secretary General had prepared a model programme to assist Governments in developing their local programmes for Disarmament Week which begin each year on 24 October and is devoted to fostering the objectives of disarmament.  The Secretary General's report was submitted to the 1979 session of the General Assembly which concluded last December.  It is at present being studied in my Department.</P>
      <P>However, I should add that disarmament documents published by the United Nations are made available by my Department and indeed those relating to last year's session of the General Assembly have been sent to individuals and representatives of groups who requested them.  It has been our practice also to publish important statements made by Irish representatives at the United Nations and at other arms control and disarmament conferences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>At its Special Session on Disarmament in 1978 the United Nations General Assembly agreed to set up a new deliberative body on disarmament&mdash;The United Nations Disarmament Commission.  It also agreed to restructure the existing Committee on Disarmament as a negotiating forum.</P>
      <P>The deliberative body&mdash;that is the UN Disarmament Commission&mdash;includes all member states of the United Nations.  It meets annually in New York for four to six weeks to discuss policy guidelines on disarmament.</P>
      <P>The negotiating body&mdash;that is the Committee on Disarmament&mdash;has a more limited membership of 40 states. These include the five permanent members of the Security Council who are also the five nuclear weapons states, and virtually all other militarily significant states.</P>
      <P>This committee is not formally speaking an agency of the United Nations but it reports annually to the UN General Assembly and the Assembly in turn refers particular issues to it.  In this way all member states of the UN in the course of annual debates in the General Assembly can comment on the work of the committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The freezing and gradual reduction of military budgets as a way of bringing about disarmament has frequently been proposed at the United Nations.  Ireland has had a particular interest in this idea and we included it in a comprehensive programme on disarmament which we and certain other member states proposed at the United Nations in 1970.</P>
      <P>In his speech at the UN Special Session on Disarmament in 1978 the former Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, put forward a related idea.  He suggested that the General Assembly might consider adopting as a voluntary target a percentage limit on military expenditure&mdash;expressed perhaps as a percentage of GNP&mdash;which states would be encouraged to observe.  His proposal, with other proposals at the Special Session, was forwarded to the Committee on Disarmament for further consideration.</P>
      <P>The final document agreed by consensus at the Special Session, did state that the gradual reduction of military budgets on a mutually agreed basis would contribute to curbing the arms race.  It was agreed that the General Assembly should continue to consider what practical steps could be taken in this area.  These efforts have, however, not resulted in any commitment by the major military powers to freeze or reduce their military budgets.</P>
      <P>There have been a number of resolutions at the General Assembly on this matter over the years, including a resolution by Sweden proposing a standardised method of measuring and comparing military budgets, which Ireland has co-sponsored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most recently at the 1979 Session of the General Assembly we co-sponsored a resolution, tabled by Romania, which <Col N="274" /> made the proposal to freeze and reduce military budgets a priority item on the agenda for the next meeting of the United Nations Disarmament Commission which takes place in New York in May.</P>
    <P>In face of the recent deterioration in the international climate there is a tendency on the part of great powers to increase rather than reduce their military expenditure.  Nevertheless we will continue to do what we can to encourage the idea of a reduction of military budgets as a step towards general disarmament under effective international control.</P>

      <P>Is there not a pharasaical note in the Minister's criticism of the great powers when in fact the Republic of Ireland, one of the small powers, has increased its military budget in spite of what Deputy Jack Lynch called the rhetoric of disarmament?  The only real increase in budgetary spending here this year has been on military spending.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the positive steps taken within the framework of the Anglo-Irish economic consultations established following the former Taoiseach's meeting with the former British Prime Minister in September 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the length of the detailed reply to the Deputy in this case, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report a statement setting out the information requested.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>The meeting at which the former Taoiseach, who was accompanied by the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, met the former British Prime Minister on 28 September 1977 agreed that it would be of mutual advantage to improve practical co-operation between this country and the UK on economic matters.  It was decided that officials of the two Governments would meet to review the arrangements and opportunities for economic co-operation with particular reference to Northern Ireland.  It was anticipated that they would review current and proposed cross-Border studies and identify subjects and areas for further examination, with EEC assistance where appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 17 November 1977, in a follow-up to the meeting of the Prime Ministers in September 1977, a meeting was held in London of a steering group of officials on Anglo-Irish economic co-operation. At this meeting it was agreed that a sub-group to deal with North-South matters would be set up to review existing cross-Border contacts with a view to identifying and filling gaps; it would also follow up those cross-Border studies that were already in train and would review proposals for future studies to identify those which would be of practical benefit.  This meeting also decided that the respective Departments dealing with energy matters in London and Dublin should be invited to identify those areas of common interest on which discussions or working contacts were already in being and to suggest any further areas <Col N="278" /> which might benefit from similar discussions. In the area of transport the meeting agreed that the respective Departments dealing with transport matters in London and Dublin should be invited to identify those areas of common interest where working contacts existed or discussions were in progress, and to suggest any further areas which might benefit from similar discussion.  The British and Irish Customs authorities were also invited to report on existing co-operation and to identify any possibilities for simplifying customs procedures with particular reference to the land border.  Finally, it was agreed that there should be consultation on the need for future informal meetings of officials to discuss medium and long-term economic trends and planning by the relevant Departments in Belfast, London and Dublin.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the contacts between the various Irish and British Government Departments under the general direction of the Anglo-Irish Steering Group was discussed at a meeting of the steering group which was held in Dublin on 28 February 1978.  Full details of the report of the meeting of this group and of the studies carried out by officials in the context of the various areas identified originally by the steering group are available in &ldquo;Reports on Economic Co-operation&rdquo; which was produced by the two Governments in June 1978 and a copy of which is available in the Dáil Library.</P>
    <P>Since June 1978 numerous further meetings have taken place of the various sub-groups dealing with North-South, energy, customs and excise, transport and economic planning matters and these activities have been co-ordinated and reviewed by two meetings of the Anglo-Irish Steering Group in December 1978 and recently in March 1980.</P>
    <P>The meetings of the Steering Group have expressed general satisfaction with the progress in the various identified areas.  It would not be possible to go into full details of all the issues that have arisen and have been discussed but the following general information under the <Col N="279" /> various headings may be helpful to the Deputy to supplement the information already publicly available in the &ldquo;Reports on Economic Co-operation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>North-South matters</P>
    <P>An important area considered in this context has been the question of cross-Border studies.  As the Deputy will be aware, a study of communications in the Derry-Donegal area has been completed since the end of 1977 and officials from Dublin and Belfast have been monitoring the progress being made on the implementation of the accepted recommendations in this report.  Last April a detailed review of progress was prepared and a further progress report was given to Deputies last November in reply to a question put down on the subject.  Officials from Belfast and Dublin are currently working on another progress report which I hope will be completed later this month.  Also, the Deputy will be aware of the comprehensive study being carried out by consultants employed by the Irish and British Governments and the EEC to examine the question of land resources, development and tourism in the Erne catchment area.  The consultants employed for this task are at present completing their final report and I expect that there will be a public launching of the report sometime towards the middle of May.</P>
    <P>In the eastern region, officials from Departments in Dublin with their counterparts in Belfast have now completed their examination of existing co-operation in various aspects of infrastructure, planning and development in the Newry-Dundalk area under the headings of industrial development and training, roads, ports, water supply, tourism, exectricity, customs, telecommunications, planning, drainage and fisheries.  The production of this latter report has been delayed due to a number of circumstances, but I am pleased to say that it has now been completed and it will be publicly launched in Dundalk on Thursday, 17 April 1980.  A copy of this report will, of course, be available shortly in the Dáil Library.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="280" /> In the Irish Sea a joint study by the two Governments with EEC assistance has also been completed in the Mourne fishery area.  This report will be very useful to the fishery managers concerned in the future management of the Mourne herring stock.  In addition to these studies a wide variety of other matters of mutual interest have been discussed, including for example the question of a public transport system in the Derry-Donegal area and the possibility of establishing an air link between Dublin and Derry.  In the area of cross-Border drainage, the Deputy will be aware that in February 1979 the Council of Agriculture Ministers of the EEC approved a drainage programme for catchment areas on both sides of the Border. The council agreed to support the programme up to a maximum contribution of about £5 million and the schemes chosen for arterial drainage, following consultations between Dublin and Belfast, were the Finn-Lackey, which is a tributary of the River Erne, and the Ulster Blackwater.  There have also been discussions in the context of the draft regulation at present being examined within the Community under the non quota section of the European Regional Development Fund.  Border areas both here and in Northern Ireland are included in these measures.  In our case the amount of money involved will be 16 million units of account and in the case of Northern Ireland the amount involved is eight million units of account.  The proposals for Irish Border areas North and South involve a programme of activities in Border counties in the fields of tourism and artisan activities.</P>
    <P>Reviews have also taken place on the extensive range of contacts between various Government Departments and agencies both here and in Belfast and there is general satisfaction at the wide range of contacts and co-operation that exists.</P>
    <P>Energy matters</P>
    <P>Given the vital importance of energy matters, it is inevitable that this question should be the subject of continuing discussions within the context of the <Col N="281" /> Anglo-Irish economic co-operation framework with the authorities both in Belfast and London.  A wide range of aspects in the field of energy have arisen and have been discussed, including questions relating to nuclear energy, alternative energy sources and possibilities of an Irish Sea interconnection.</P>
    <P>Customs and Excise</P>
    <P>The meeting of the Anglo-Irish Steering Group have also reviewed the progress on the co-operation that has taken place between the two customs authorities in the field of customs and excise. In furtherance of the mandate given at the steering group meeting in London in November 1977, customs officials from both here and Britain have recently completed an examination of customs requirements in relation to traffic between the two countries.  This study took as its starting point the cross-Border customs procedures and documentation.  The implementation in due course of recommendations arising from this stage of the review by the customs authorities should facilitate speedier completion of formalities and movements of goods across the Border. An initial simplification of documentation commenced from the beginning of April this year with the introduction of an aligned set of just two folios comprising, respectively, customs manifest at exportation and customs report at importation.</P>
    <P>Transport</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that a significant development in this context has been the completion of an agreement on road transport between here and the UK which was jointly signed, in our case by the Minister for Transport, in Dublin on 9 April 1980.  The sub-group which deals with the question of transport has also discussed a wide variety of other transport matters of mutual interest. Tourism has also been dealt with within this sub-group.  Practical examples of developments in this field have been joint production of a tourism brochure entitled &ldquo;From the Mournes to the Boyne&rdquo;<Col N="282" /> which involved the co-operation of the two tourist boards in conjunction with the Newry and Mourne District Council and the East Border Region Committee. In the North-West, a group called the North-West Tourism Group was announced in 1979.  The establishment of this group was a direct result of a recommendation contained in the EEC study on cross-Border communications which underlined the need to develop a co-ordinated approach to tourism in the Donegal-Derry cross-Border area.  The function of the group, whose members are drawn from Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, is to identify the tourism development and promotional needs of the North-West area and to make recommendations to the appropriate authorities.</P>
    <P>The report by officials on the Newry-Dundalk area, which I referred to earlier and which is shortly to be launched, contains specific recommendations for co-operation and joint examination by the tourist authorities North and South of the tourism resources and potential of this area.</P>
    <P>Economic Planning</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Steering Group has continued to monitor the contacts that have taken place between the various Departments in Dublin, Belfast and London in the general sphere of financial and planning matters.</P>
    <P>I trust that the foregoing information will give a broad outline of the positive steps that have been taken and are being taken within the framework of the Anglo-Irish economic consultations established in September 1977.  The structures for consultation and co-operation as outlined in the &ldquo;Reports on Economic Co-operation&rdquo; continue to operate and every opportunity is taken to ensure that the maximum amount of co-operation and co-ordination takes place in areas of mutual interest.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy's question refers to employment in manufacturing industry.  The number of new, first-time jobs created in manufacturing industry in IDA-assisted projects in the three-year period 1977-1979 is estimated at 42,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no information as to the proportion of these new jobs provided by <Col N="284" /> foreign-owned or foreign-controlled companies.  However, the pattern of recent IDA job approvals suggests that about 60 per cent of new job approvals are in foreign-owned enterprises; and, if this percentage is applied to the 42,000 new jobs created since 1977, it would suggest that about 25,000 of these are in foreign-owned firms, representing about 11.4 per cent of total manufacturing employment at end 1978.</P>

      <P>I would not accept that. The present policies have served us very well.  The situation is that there is now need for a comprehensive review of all our policies in the industrial sector in the light of circumstances today.  The review is just not looking at foreign-owned industry. I would refer the Deputy to the remainder of the Taoiseach's speech when he said that such a review would <Col N="286" /> include the type of industries we should have, the application of science and technology, the extent of our reliance on foreign-owned industry, the level of research and development, taxation, financial incentives, manpower and employment programmes.  That is what the survey is looking at and not just one single aspect of it.  As regards investment by the public sector the Deputy gave a few examples, one of them being the timber industry.  As regards that industry, while my tendencies would be to agree with the Deputy that we should be doing more, I regret that the experience we have had over the last few years is bringing me rapidly to the conclusion that we are going up a cul-de-sac when approaching it in that manner.</P>

    <P>The Registrar of Friendly Societies is independent in law in the discharge of his functions and I am not, therefore, in a position to comment on his detailed activities. In general terms the Building Societies Act, 1976 confers powers on <Col N="290" /> the registrar, in his capacity as Registrar of Building Societies, in relation to limits on investments in specified classes of security after consultation with the Minister for the Environment, the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for the Environment and the Central Bank, may prescribe the investments in which a society may invest funds surplus to those immediately required for the purpose of the society.</P>
    <P>Because of his independence in law it is a matter for the registrar alone to determine what amount of time he should devote to any one of his varied activities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This short Bill proposes to extend for a further period of three years the provisions of the Prisons Act, 1972 relating to military custody.</P>
      <P>The need for military custody first arose in May 1972 following a serious riot in Mountjoy Prison.  Because of the destruction caused in the riot, some 180 prisoners had to be removed from the prison immediately.  It was not possible to accommodate all of them in the other civil prisons and places of detention, and 40 of them had to be transferred to the Curragh Military Detention Barracks. Those transferred required a high degree of security.  Military custody has been used since then to isolate out of the civil prisons (a) persons requiring a high degree of security who could not be accommodated in Portlaoise Prison or elsewhere and (b) persons who promoted or actively engaged in seriously disruptive activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In November 1973 there was a general rearrangement in the use of <Col N="301" /> prisons for adult male prisoners which saw Portlaoise Prison set apart for prisoners who were charged with or convicted of subversive type offences.  It was the only civil prison in the State capable of providing the minimum security necessary for its new population.  It has accommodated virtually all prisoners of this type and at present holds 156 of them.  The accommodation there is divided for the different groupings of prisoners and, in general, the groups do not mix.  A small number of prisoners who do not belong to any of these groups and who cannot, therefore, be fitted in there, have to be accommodated elsewhere.  The only place in which they can be held with adequate security is the Curragh Military Detention Barracks.</P>
    <P>The conversion of Portlaoise Prison for the accommodation of subversive type prisoners has created problems for the other civilian prisons because they now have to accommodate the prisoner population which Portlaoise, as a convict prison, formerly held.  The burden falls mainly on Mountjoy Prison.  There has been a steady build-up there of long-term prisoners serving sentences for serious offences.  It is essential, if Mountjoy is to continue to hold this population in safety, that a small number of seriously disruptive prisoners should be kept out of it.  The only place available for them is the Curragh Military Detention Barracks.</P>
    <P>The value of the extra custodial facilities available at the Curragh has been amply proved over the last number of years.  Between 1973 and 1977 relative peace was maintained in Mountjoy Prison largely, it is thought, because it was possible to keep out of it the small number of prisoners capable of and willing to foment disorder.  They were kept out by being transferred to the Curragh. Serious riots occured in the prison in 1977 and again in 1979.  The restoration of peace and order was possible only because the Curragh was available for the ring leaders.  I have no doubt at all that the maintenance of peace and order in the civil prisons continues to depend <Col N="302" /> on the availability of the Curragh.  This, of course, suits neither the troublemakers among those transferred nor their active sympathisers outside who are, apparently, committed to undermining the prison system.  They have been carrying on a campaign over the past few months to have military custody abandoned.  I would urge those who support the campaign to be wary of the motives of those who are behind it.</P>
    <P>There are two places designated for military custody&mdash;the Curragh Military Detention Barracks and the Curragh Military Hospital.  The detention barracks at present accommodates 27 prisoners most of them prisoners who had to be transferred out of the civil prisons because of their potential to foment disorder.  Military custody in the hospital is used mainly for prisoners from Portlaoise Prison who require inpatient hospital or specialist medical attention and for whom a secure environment is needed.</P>
    <P>I have said before and I repeat that I want to see an end to military custody.  It would, however, be quite irresponsible of me and a danger to the maintenance of the prison system as a whole to end military custody without providing an alternative.  The only feasible alternative is the provision of a new high-security civil prison to take the population now accommodated in military custody.  I decided that such a person should be provided and I obtained Government approval for so doing.</P>
    <P>At this point I should like to refer to the debate in 1977 on the last extension of the Act.  My predecessor said at the time that the problem could be solved by building a special high security prison unit capable of housing up to 30 high-risk prisoners.  Preliminary planning work had started on this unit and it was intended to build it in the Portlaoise Prison complex.  For security reasons it had been found impossible to commence the work.  The site for the special unit had to be given over to accommodate military personnel stationed in the prison.  There was no other suitable location in the civil prison system for this <Col N="303" /> special unit and none of the existing buildings would suit.</P>
    <P>I understand that, at the time, the security authorities were opposed to any building operations in the Portlaoise Prison Complex, including the farm, because of the risks to the maintenance of security.  Whatever the reasons for not proceeding with the special unit at the time, the position now is that a site for the new prison has been selected on the farm, the money is available for it and the security authorities no longer have objections to building operations.  The new project is more ambitious than what had been intended in my predecessor's time.  It will be a self-contained, autonomous prison with ample and humane accommodation for about 120. The population will comprise the sort of person at present in the Curragh plus a number of long-term prisoners in the other prisons.  The removal of these difficult prisoners from the other civil prisons will make for better management of the remaining prisoners for the benefit of both staff and prisoners.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, when the last extension of the Act was being debated I said that I was not opposing the Bill but I questioned the need for it in view of the existence of what I had been led to believe was a new high security prison in the Curragh.  My view was that perhaps this high security prison could be operated under civilian control.  In fact, it turned out that this was not a high-security prison at all.  I had been refused permission to see it so that there was no way I could assess its status at the time.</P>
    <P>The proposed new high security prison on the Portlaoise farm is a complex undertaking.  It requires attention to design, layout, fittings and finishes unparalleled in any other building project. It is being build on a site which, of itself, is demanding.  It will take some years to complete.  I have asked for an extension of military custody for three years.  I do not expect the new prison to be ready in that time, but I think the House should have the opportunity to review the position at the end of that period and decide <Col N="304" /> then if military custody needs to continue for a further period.</P>
    <P>Work on the site at Portlaoise Prison commenced on 28 April 1980.  The first stage of the development includes overall site preparation, development involving drainage, replacement of obsolete prison staff housing fronting the main Dublin/Cork road, and the provision of parking facilities to cope with official vehicles, staff cars and visitors cars and relieve local traffic congestion.  Residential accommodation for 60 single staff is also being provided.  The expenditure on the project during 1980 will be £600,000 and expenditure in 1981 is estimated at £4 million.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay a tribute to the Defence Forces for their co-operation in holding civilian prisoners.  It is an unwelcome task for them especially now because of their many other commitments. It involves the diversion of large numbers of scarce personnel.  The Curragh Military Detention Barracks has many deficiencies which makes the management of prisoners there a difficult task.  I would like to be able to relieve the Defence Forces of the task altogether but, as I have said already, there is no alternative at the present time and it must continue.</P>
    <P>The reasons for the introduction of military custody in 1972, and the extensions of the Acts in 1974 and 1977 during the term of the National Coalition, remain valid.  I am satisfied that a further extension for three years is required in order to maintain a viable prison system and I, therefore, commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Prisons Bill, 1980 on the grounds that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> (a)  The continuing existence of the Curragh Military Detention Centre, in which civilian prisoners <Col N="305" /> are subject to military control, is unnecessary and inappropriate; and</P>
    <P>(b)  a form of custody originally designed as a short-term expedient should not be allowed to continue in existence after the factors which brought about its establishment have ceased to operate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that we are opposing this Bill not in response to any pressure group, inside or outside this House, but on our own initiative.  This is a responsible amendment put down by the Labour Party.  I represent my party because I have some knowledge of the Curragh Prison, possibly more than most people, since I have been a member of the visiting committee to that prison for a number of years.  It is agreed that the Curragh is not a suitable place for long-term prisoners.</P>
    <P>The original Act was introduced in 1972, before I came to the House, to meet an emergency situation.  A riot had taken place in Mountjoy during which the prison was wrecked.  At that time an undertaking was given by the Minister for Justice of a Fianna Fáil Government that the use of the Curragh for civilian detention would be ended as soon as the necessary repairs had been completed in Mountjoy.  That undertaking was given in the House to the late Deputy Thornley, a member of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>The idea of military custody for civilian prisoners is wrong and completely unacceptable to the Irish people. If this kind of prison was operated in Northern Ireland all of us would be shouting against a military State.  As I have said, the Act was passed here on the understanding that it would meet an emergency situation in 1972.  At that time those who wrecked Mountjoy Prison were people with political beliefs, generally speaking, members of the Provos.  At the moment there are only one or two of those in the Curragh claiming to be political.</P>
    <P>Since the original Act was passed the situation has changed completely.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="306" /> Mountjoy Prison, I am sure, has been repaired.  The continued existence of the Curragh detention centre has been condemned by the visiting committee, of which I am a member.  I will quote the final paragraph of their most recent report under the heading &ldquo;General&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>The military detention barracks at the Curragh is unsuitable for long-term prisoners.  Long-term confinement in such an enclosed area must have a tension-creating effect on prisoners.  Prisoners transferred to the military detention barracks appear to be those who do not fit into the ordinary prison system.  The visual impact on seeing this structure must have a traumatic effect on the minds of children who visit their parents. </P>
    <P>It is stated clearly in that report and in all the reports.  I have seen since this place of detention was established that it is not a fit place for long-term prisoners. It was built before the foundation of the State for short-term prisoners guilty of military misdemeanours, members of the Defence Forces of various establishments.</P>
    <P>Here is an important point.  The report which I have quoted was signed by all the members of the visiting committee up to the end of 1979.  They include: Mr. Andy Mahon, chairman, a member of Fianna Fáil; myself; Mr. P. J. Fitzpatrick whose politics I do not know; Deputy McCreevy, a member of Fianna Fáil; Mr. Simon Hughes, a well known Fianna Fáil man; Mr. William Callaghan, a Fianna Fáil urban district councillor; Mr. James O'Loughlin, a Fianna Fáil county councillor; Mr. Terry Boylan, a Fianna Fáil county councillor; Mr. Terry Gillece, a Fianna Fáil urban district councillor; Mr. John O'Neill, a Fianna Fáil county councillor; Deputy Patrick Power, Minister for Fisheries and Forestry; Mr. Austin Groome, a Fianna Fáil county councillor. They are the people who have said that the Curragh is not a fit place in which to keep prisoners.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister serious when he says that 27 to 30 prisoners could not be <Col N="307" /> found a place in our prison system?  We were able to accommodate them until the riots in Mountjoy.  The Minister has said he is anxious to close the prison at the Curragh.  I suggest that the high risk prisoners in Portlaoise are far more dangerous from the point of view of security than those at the Curragh.  Some of those in the Curragh may be hardened criminals but I suggest they should be kept in some other place.  The entire area available at the Curragh is too small for the accommodation of long-term prisoners.  The numbers involved are small by comparison with other prisons. People called long-term prisoners serve six or seven years.  It seems to me that prisoners who have been troublesome in other prisons are sent to the Curragh and treated like forgotten people.</P>
    <P>That is a pity.  If they were part of a larger prison unit there would be more opportunities to train them, to improve their skills.  There are people in the Curragh who have had psychiatric complaints but the kind of service necessary to rehabilitate them is not there.</P>
    <P>Since the passing of the Prisons Act in 1972 we have built many new prison sections, for instance, the one in Arbour Hill.  Why is this not being used? Military personnel will always do whatever they are asked to do and a great tribute is due to them for always doing what they are asked to do by the State.  These military men will never grumble or make any bones about it but they did not join the Defence Forces to become prison warders.</P>

      <P>Military detention in the Curragh has continued now for seven years, or very nearly eight.  At the time, it was termed a temporary measure until repairs were carried out to Mountjoy Prison.  Eight years is a long time. Repairs have been carried out to Mountjoy and new prisons have been built, one in Arbour Hill.  Trained civilians are operating the prison system, not military police.  The military police are doing pretty well under the circumstances but <Col N="308" /> the Minister has agreed, in his opening statement that there is a strain on them, working in buildings that are 200 years old and do not lend themselves to the kind of operation for which they are being used now.</P>
      <P>I want to make a point about the relationship which always existed around the Curragh between the Army and the civilian population.  Down through the years there were areas of recreation in the Curragh which were used by civilians.  I am not saying that this has been stopped completely, but I am saying that restrictions which were not there before had to be imposed because of this prison.  There are barriers put up and ordinary people who used the facilities in the Curragh and got a drink in the various canteens now find that they must be scrutinised if they go in there.  This is bringing about a strained situation between the local population and the Army, which is a very serious matter.  That is, of course, of local interest only and not of political interest.</P>
      <P>I accept that there must be a high security prison, but Portlaoise is a high security prison.  Can these people not be accommodated there?  I understand that some political prisoners have been transferred from Portlaoise within the last year or so who, the authorities tell us, they may not be able to protect from other prisoners in Portlaoise.  If that is the reason for their transfer to the Curragh, this is very serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Long-term prisoners who can expect to serve sentences of around six or seven years must serve them in the conditions prevailing at the Curragh.  They deserve better treatment than that from a humane and Christian society.  I do not wish to become emotional about this question.  The authorities in the Curragh are doing their very best in trying circumstances. They are trained with military discipline, which is fundamentally different from the discipline accepted by civilians.  The Minister and everyone else knows that.  They are trained to look after prisoners who may be in military detention for a very short period, invariably days.  Here, however, they are dealing, over the years with people <Col N="309" /> on very long sentences, having been told that it was a temporary thing.  We fear that it will become a permanent feature of our society.  The previous Minister told us that when Mountjoy was repaired and fixed up this military detention in the Curragh would end and all sorts of things were to be done.  We are the only democratic country in Europe which has military detention for civilian prisoners.  When there was internment in the North of Ireland we were very quick to denounce it.  If military detention of civilian prisoners was in force in the North of Ireland, I know that the Minister and all of us would say that it was a terrible thing and should not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand how, with the new accommodation available now we cannot say that these 27 people cannot be transferred to our normal prison system, even if we have to have a special area in that prison system for them.  This military detention is becoming a regular feature and something has to be done. There is need for a high security prison and if Mountjoy was wrecked the prisoners had to be put somewhere, so the Curragh was used at that time for a specific purpose.  All the prisoners in the period of which the Minister speaks could be classed as political.  I am not trying to give them a status by saying that but they were political, or Provo people who wrecked Mountjoy.  Practically none of the people now in the Curragh prison are in that category. They are the normal run of criminals who are in jail for long terms.  We are being unfair to them.  We are preventing their reform by putting them in a place like the Curragh.  I feel very strongly about this.  I have seen these prisoners, visited them and talked to them.  If they are sick, they have to be transferred from the military detention area which is a good distance away from the hospital and the hospital has to be barricaded for certain sections of people who are prisoners and need hospitalisation.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, because we have adequate accommodation, to make <Col N="310" /> spaces available for these people some of whom are unfortunates in society.  The system has broken down for some and they have become habitual criminals. Surely a Christian society must treat the long-term prisoners particularly, better than that?  I seriously ask the Minister to transfer all these people into the normal prison system within six months, even if we have to make sections of some prison available for them.  Eight years is a long time for a temporary measure which was to finish when Mountjoy was repaired.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister serious in his statement that he is anxious to do away with that system?  If we are to justify our arguments about civil rights in other areas and other countries about which we have been hearing a lot over the last two days, and if we are interested in proving to the world our concern about civil rights in Northern Ireland and other areas remote from here, we should now have the opportunity to do this for our own prisoners, who indeed have committed misdeeds and have been convicted in our courts, but who surely in a Christian society are entitled to their rights.  We should show to the world now that we are serious about military detention.  In all fairness, if this kind of system were prevailing in Northern Ireland would the Minister think it was just and right, or would his party, or anybody else.  not say that that was a military junta?  We cannot expect the world to take us seriously if people can say that we have civilian prisoners in military custody on the Curragh and we are running a military state and yet we want to talk to people about civil rights and justice for their prisoners.</P>
    <P>I do not want to become emotional and I could easily be carried away and go on and on about this, but that does not serve any purpose.  I come in here on behalf of the Labour Party because I know a little more about conditions in the Curragh than most of them do.  I did not come in here at the behest of any inside or outside pressure group.  We oppose this Bill because we think that is the just and right thing to do.  This matter <Col N="311" /> has gone on long enough and each year has given ample opportunity to the authorities to provide proper accommodation within the prison service.  At this time we should not have to continue to keep civilians who have no claim to political status, and who do not want to claim it in military custody.  I have met some of them and I know that this situation is a strain on our society and on our way of life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill which has been presented to us is unwelcome and I am sure that for many Deputies more senior than I there is a certain aura of <i>déja vu</i> about it.  I listened carefully to the Minister when he introduced the measure and I could not find in it any new evidence to indicate that the extension he seeks is warranted on the grounds that he put forward.  Obviously, it is a desire of all parties and individuals in this House to facilitate the Minister for Justice and the Government in so far as it is possible to deal with crime in the community, but even if one allows that legislation should be the primary element in an assault on such social symptoms, many of us feel that perhaps that is not the approach.  In the Minister's speech all we got were vague and general promises, pious aspirations and hopes, which were even qualified, that at the end of three years this legislation, which was introduced as a temporary and emergency measure, might be allowed to lapse.  That is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear&mdash;it hardly needs clarification but it should be said in case there is any attempt to distort&mdash;that my party, and I am sure all parties in the House, will not be slow to assist with any genuine measure designed truly to combat crime and get to the root of the problem.  Therefore, a temperate approach, which I have no doubt all parties and speakers on this Bill will adopt, will reflect a concern about what is happening in the community. However, under no circumstances will we be stampeded now or in any measure in the future, near or far, by virtue of any kind of hysteria or any emotional campaign <Col N="312" /> outside this House, into accepting measures which would be repressive fundamentally and which would strike at individual freedoms.  Therefore, I commend the Minister on the speech he made on 24 April subsequent to the meeting of the bodies representing the Garda where he struck a defiant note in saying that there should be caution with regard to any demand for measures which would appear to offer instant solutions but which would do nothing more than create problems more serious than we have already.</P>
    <P>The reasons advanced in 1972 for the introduction of this Bill were of an administrative nature dealing almost exclusively with the accommodation problem arising out of the riot in Mountjoy. Although the argument was then made by the Opposition that there did not appear to be a need to designate anywhere as a military prison and that the designation of part of the Curragh as a civilian prison would be adequate if the problem was merely one of accommodation, the reality is that the Government persisted in seeking a power which many observers thought was beyond what was essentially necessary and which was introduced into legislation and parliamentary debate in recent times.  Military imprisonment for civilian prisoners is still with us and shows no sign of being phased out.</P>
    <P>There are a number of disturbing elements about this, some of which were outlined by Deputy Bermingham.  Before I go on to them I want to say that the Minister's predecessor, now Senator Cooney, most understandably felt obliged, in the wake of unprecedented difficulties which the high security prison in Portlaoise has experiencing, to make innovative efforts designed to allow us to be rid of the Prisons Act, 1972.  These proposals which the previous Minister for Justice intended to introduce could not be introduced, and looking back at the history of that time, the bombings and so on, one could see and understand the difficulty.  I pay tribute to the Ministers at that time who courageously confronted a challenge different from the <Col N="313" /> one with which we are confronted now. Although not immediately politically popular they took a very difficult and courageous stand.  Sometimes we are too reluctant to say that of people whose very lives are put on the line in the cause of public service.</P>
    <P>All Members of the House who spoke on this legislation desired that it should be terminated at the first available opportunity. In recent times, I am not aware of the kind of security tensions, the breakouts of violence or the great difficulties within our prison system which would inhibit the present Minister for Justice from bringing about the necessary construction and improvement works to build the security dimension to the prison system which all agree is necessary and which will allow us to rid ourselves once and for all of this distasteful and fundamentally repugnant principle of military imprisonment for civilian prisoners.</P>
    <P>The Government have had ample opportunity to plan.  If the Minister was able to show evidence that there was brick upon brick at this stage, and that such a wing or prison was in its latter stages of development, it would be easier to co-operate with him.  Unfortunately many of the expressions used in the Minister's speech are identical to what we have heard on at least three previous occasions and show no reason to be inspired with any hope that things will be different in future.  What is needed now is a sharp jolt of opposition to the measures introduced by the Government so that they will realise that the pleasing and helpful co-operation so often extended in this regard is no longer available on the basis of the same tired platitudes we have had on previous occasions.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was introduced by the Minister for Justice, Deputy Des O'Malley in 1972, no one had any doubt about where he stood in relation to combating crime but it is perfectly clear from what he said that he found nothing but regret in the necessity to introduce that Bill.  At column 77 of the Official Report of 23 May, 1972, referring to the main <Col N="314" /> provision of the Bill Deputy O'Malley said:</P>
    <P>the main provision of which is to authorise prisoners to be transferred to military custody in certain exceptional circumstances. </P>
    <P>The then Minister went on to outline the circumstances, to develop his point further by referring to the inability of Mountjoy to cope with the accommodation difficulty imposed subsequent to the riot, and he clearly expressed his distaste for the measure and indicated that</P>
    <P>subsection (8) provides that the Minister for Defence, in making regulations about such places, shall have regard to the desirability of ensuring that the conditions of custody are not less favourable than those applicable in prisons. </P>
    <P>To this the Minister's predecessor, now Senator Cooney, on behalf of the Fine Gael party spelt out our attitude which is now as it was then when he said at column 85 of the same report.</P>
    <P>The idea of military custody is something that causes apprehension to people living in a democracy.  It is something we should keep at arms length so far as possible; it is something we should keep at arms length unless there is a situation of revolution and utter chaos.  We are certainly not in that situation at the moment.  It is reprehensible on the part of the Government to bring in this piece of legislation with this emotive power without indicating that it is entirely a temporary measure, I expect the Minister to give full and detailed reasons why the powers under the 1877 Act have not been used. </P>
    <P>Our party at that time sought through the same speaker to ascerain</P>
    <P>an unequovical assurance from the Minister that he is not availing of the emergency created in Mountjoy to introduce a type of backdoor internment. </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="315" /> All of the speakers clearly understood when that Bill was debated, and all of those who sought its introduction clearly implied that the measure was essentially in relation to the refurbishing of Mountjoy. This has long been done but the politicians in this House appear to lack the self-assurance, the courage or the wisdom to be able to divest themselves of powers that are not desirable in a democracy, that are not essentially in the public interest and which if an emergency arose they would undoubtedly get as they did on previous occasions by coming to this House and seeking them.</P>
    <P>It is not unreasonable to refer to the possibility that we might not always have benign Ministers.  Also, this profoundly offends against the concept of representational politics which is that politicians should not seek to exceed their authority by seeking powers which are not truly theirs.  We should, in this debate declare ourselves opposed to the principle of this Bill and unequivocal in our desire to see it repealed at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>Speaker after speaker in that debate of 1972 from both sides of the House dealt with this matter in a responsible fashion underlying the temporary nature of the Bill.  My colleaue Deputy Mark Clinton said at column 99 of that report:</P>
    <P>I am sure that every Deputy would like to rest assured that this situation would arise only in crisis circumstances and that it would exist only for the shortest possible time that would be necessary to meet such a situation. </P>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey now Leader of the Labour Party said at column 106:</P>
    <P>The sole reason we are asked to pass this Bill is lack of accommodation because of the riot in Mountjoy. </P>
    <P>Then Deputy Tom O'Higgins, now Chief Justice said at column 118:</P>
    <P>We are entitled to demand that a time limit be put on the legislation. </P>
    <P>Deputy Dick Barry of my party said at column 140.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="316" /> We on this side will be very insistent in looking for very firm guarantees from the Minister that if this Bill is passed the time limit will be as short as possible and that the Bill will only remain on the Statute Book for the minimum period necessary to carry out repairs to Mountjoy Prison and no more. </P>
    <P>As reported at column 143 Deputy M. O'Leary said there should be a time limit on this Bill.  Deputy FitzGerald, now leader of my own party said, as reported at column 159:</P>
    <P>We approach this Bill with considerable suspicion ... we have the duty as a vigilant Opposition concerned with individual liberty to ensure that the measures the Government take in pursuance of their duty and in response to our pressures go no further than is necessitated by the situation. </P>
    <P>As reported at column 162 he said:</P>
    <P>The Bill itself introduced as an emergency measure, drafted hastily and with defects in it ... is a measure which one could justify as an <i>ad hoc</i> measure to meet an emergency if it were to be confined to that emergency. </P>
    <P>As reported at column 173 Deputy Paudge Brennan said:</P>
    <P>... I would like to think that this piece of legislation will be in existence for as short time as possible. </P>
    <P>I could go on.  I hope I have established clearly and beyond doubt that the full understanding of every Member of this House when that Bill was introduced, with the reluctant but patriotic co-operation of almost all members of all parties&mdash;with some individual exceptions&mdash;was that it would be a temporary measure, and that its need was created by expediency in relation to accommodation and no more.</P>
    <P>In the Curragh military prison, as I understand it, there are approximately 28 inmates.  Time was when they were largely what were termed subversives.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="317" /> Now I understand that is not the case.  I further understand that most of them are receiving drugs of some kind or another. They are under what might be called some sort of medical care.  I do not know what it is that drives men and women in darkness, isolation and alienation into crime.  I do not know what kind of demented, tortured feelings possess them on those occasions, but I do know they are still human beings.  They still demand our attention, our respect and compassion. It is our job to respond to their needs, no matter in what odious light we see their crimes.</P>
    <P>We must try to help them out of that darkness.  It is difficult now because many voices are raised demanding no more of a response than larger cells, bigger keys, longer silences, greater incarcerations and more repressive legislation. I will not be a party to that.  I agree with a previous United States Attorney General, Ramsey Clarke, who said in a quotation which sums up my views on this matter that no activity of a people so exposes their humanity, their character, their capacity for charity in its most generous dimension as the treatment they accord persons convicted of crimes.</P>
    <P>However, I am angered by the undeniable fact that there is extreme and widespread concern in our community and society at the failure, predominantly of the the Government but of all of us, to deal with crime in our community.  If the challenge were to be tackled and dealt with, it would be easier for rational and level-headed debate to pre-occupy us in this context.  Unfortunately, the atmosphere being engendered by the inability of the Minister and the Government to deal with crime can facilitate a slipshod and lazy approach to the details of the Bill, and to putting on to the Statute Book and retaining thereon legislation which is an anathema to a freedom loving people and to democrats. Therefore, it is very relevant that we should underline the importance of the Government getting down to the job of tackling crime in our community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it is easier for us to retaliate by way of a measure which might be seen in some nebulous fashion in the public mind as helpful in this regard.  The Bill will not be so helpful, and will do nothing but a disservice.  I stress that it is not on any aspect of military detention or military custody, <i>per se</i>, that our inability to co-operate fully with the Government in this regard is based.  I have no doubt that the soldiers and the military police involved are doing a good job.  The Army are called upon to do many jobs for which they were not particularly designed.  All of us owe them a debt of gratitude and any condemnation we have of the measure is in no way to be taken as reflecting on the excellent manner in which they carry out this work.  There is a fundamental principle involved here which is embodied in the Act of 1972, section 2 (3):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="319" /> If and whenever, at a time when this section is in operation, the Minister is of opinion that prison accommodation or prison staff is insufficient to provide secure and reasonable conditions of custody for all persons then in custody in prison or for whom prison accommodation is required or is insufficient to provide such conditions without serious detriment to the maintenance in prisons of the normal arrangements for the rehabilitative treatment and welfare of prisoners he may, in writing&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a) certify that he is so of opinion, and</P>
    <P>(b) direct the transfer to military custody of such of the persons aforesaid as are specified by him...  </P>
    <P>It seems to me that the Prisons Bill, 1980, which seeks to extend this power until 1983, continues to underline a power which is excessive and which is no longer justified, certainly on the initial grounds put forward.  It would be wrong of me not to say that when the Bills came before the House in 1974 and in 1977, the then Minister for Justice rightly pointed out the difficulties he was experiencing in accomplishing the ideals he set before himself.  He indicated that the initial problems relating to Mountjoy Prison had already been dealt with.  He went on to deal with the need to build a high security prison or unit capable of housing up to 30 high-risk prisoners, to be located in Portlaoise Prison.  This plan, which was embarked upon in good faith, came to naught because of the subsequent extremely serious difficulties encountered by the Minister and the Government at that time.</P>
    <P>The Opposition at that time pointed out the odium that had been heaped on their heads in 1972.  I do not blame them for that, although the circumstances had changed.  When the Bill came before the House in 1977, it was indicated that the picture had not changed radically, that the intentions of the then Government had not been implemented because of extraordinary <Col N="320" /> and unique security difficulties in Portlaoise, during a period of unusual difficulty.  The House accepted in 1977 that there would be once more, hopefully for the last time, an extension of this provision.  During that time, it is fair to say, new reasons were advanced as justifying the extension of the measure above and beyond those given for introducing it.  On that general principle it is important that we should bear in mind the importance of not rushing into a situation where we introduce legislation in a manner which would subsequently be retained on the Statute Book and justified retrospectively by virtue of other reasons.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate in 1977 the then Minister, now Senator Cooney, stated, at column 1180 of the Official Report of 19 May 1977:</P>
    <P>military custody for civilian prisoners is not something which I like and if there were a reasonable alternative I would gladly accept it. </P>
    <P>He pointed to the undoubtedly real situation of a small number of disruptive prisoners and the difficulty of building the security unit he wanted and which caused his request for a further extension to be accepted by the Dáil.  The then Opposition spokesman, Deputy Gerry Collins, made an interesting reply to this debate.  In general, I am not one who looks through the files seeking incriminating and selective evidence, but he accused the Minister&mdash;at column 1183 of that Official Report&mdash;of not coming clean, not giving the necessary information for the debate to be of value. He said, about the Minister:</P>
    <P>He knows that this prison is completed; it is an expensive high security prison in the Curragh Camp. </P>
    <P>Deputy Collins was referring to the creation of a unit in the Curragh Camp which would be designated as a civilian prison.  There is no doubt that more accommodation was necessary, but the essential problem was the principal of its military designation.  If the Minister for <Col N="321" /> Justice felt in 1977 that a situation could be dealt with adequately by the development in the Curragh we are not seeing any evidence that that is the case today. I cannot help but feel that the similarity of the language from the beginning of this debate in 1972 shows a tired administration today who are utilising, with great respect to them, the arguments outlined by a Department that is largely locked into time.</P>
    <P>There is nothing of a visionary nature in the Minister's speech.  There is not any reference to prison reform or to the need to ensure that there would not have to be an extension of these powers the next time.  On the contrary, the Minister made it clear that he did not believe that three years would be enough.  We must all do better than the charade we have had since 1972.  There are good men and women on all sides of the House concerned with the welfare of our people and no side has the monopoly of it.  There are good people on all sides of the House concerned with individual liberty and freedom and the two are not in any way to be juxtaposed or depicted as being opposed to each other.  They are both sides of one coin and responsible politicians have a duty to take care of both.  It is not unreasonable to ask the Minister for clear evidence that within 12 months of today's date he will undertake to repeal this measure.</P>
    <P>I mention the period 12 months because it is a time with historical precedent in the Mountjoy case.  It is a sufficient amount of time to allow the Minister to do works which, presumably, if his words carry any weight or have any meaning, are already in train.  That will convince the House that the Minister is genuine and sincere about his basic repugnance of the idea of military incarceration of civilian prisoners.</P>
    <P>If the 12 month amendment is accepted by the Government, then an advance will have been made.  We would have a positive and unequivocal guarantee and that would be in the interest of parliamentary co-operation, to put it mildly.  It would facilitate many Members <Col N="322" /> of the House in ensuring that they play their full and active role in getting rid of this measure at the earliest possible date, which ostensibly is the intent and design of all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>One element which has not been referred to on previous occasions and which may be a very important one is the constitutional issue&mdash;I believe this is possibly unconstitutional.  The discharge of justice through the courts allows a prisoner to be sentenced in the normal way.  However, the clear understanding of the Judiciary and the explicit exhortation of the Constitution is that such sentences should be carried out in conditions which the Judiciary fully comprehend at that time.  Otherwise, it has no meaning and we are dealing with a situation where judges impose a time of incarceration to be served in conditions dictated by others outside their control. Clearly, that is unconstitutional.  There is a precedent for such an action.  On an occasion a defendant was convicted and sentenced to two years in prison with a condition that the sentence would be reviewed after 12 months, the second year to be waived if the prison officers involved gave a favourable report.  The defendant contested this issue on constitutional grounds and won the case by virtue of the fact that it appeared that the prison officers were vested with judicial powers.  There is an analogy in this case. If the Minister is the person who designates, who goes to a civilian prison&mdash;whatever about the desires of the Minister in 1972; conditions are different now&mdash;the reality is that the condition of incarceration is no longer established by the courts, but by the Minister.  I consider that to be grounds for a constitutional action.  It is also another reason why we no longer need this Bill on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the provision operates in this regard is also fundamentally regrettable and adds to the arguments for getting rid of it.  The 1972 Act states that the Minister for Defence will make regulations in relation to the places and the manner generally in which persons in military custody pursuant to that <Col N="323" /> Act shall be kept in custody.  In his contribution to that debate the Minister indicated that the conditions in the military prison would be parallel to those in civilian prisons, but that is not the case. There are a number distinctions, which include the fact that in a civilian penal system there is separate accommodation for remand and convicted prisoners but such facilities do not exist at the Curragh.  A pre-release system for those about to embark on the transition back to normal life, which includes work and the finding of employment outside, is part of the civilian prison system; but there is no parole in the Curragh, that underlines the fact that the assignment of people to the Curragh is a sentence which when applied by the Minister is not what was envisaged by the courts.</P>
    <P>A third difference is the question of the training for the staff involved.  The training of prison officers is increasingly a matter of the application of up-to-date skills.  The military police and the forces involved in the Curragh are not equipped in that direction, though their qualifications in other areas are undoubtedly of the highest order.  They seek no particular qualification, nor should they be forced into that situation.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, there is a provision that there should be a minimum period of six hours work provided in the civilian prison situation for prisoners in so far as that is possible.  But it is perfectly clear that does not and cannot operate in the context of the Curragh arrangement. Also the medical facilities available are different and are deficient in relation to people in the Curragh.  This is a little unfortunate in view of the serious reports one gets about the incidence of prescription of sedative type drugs in the Curragh.  Accordingly, if there is to be medical attention at all, if it is to be different as between prisons, it should certainly not be the case that the Curragh arrangement should be detrimentally affected&mdash;also because of the repeated assertions that people in the Curragh prison are people who &ldquo;do not fit into the normal prison system&rdquo;, by which I have managed to ascertain they mean <Col N="324" /> that they are probably psychiatric cases, in some cases psychopaths and, in others, people with a mental imbalance of one kind or another, or are just difficult prisoners.  Certainly there is no basis for a difference in the medical arrangements.  The cost of an affidavit in a civilian prison and in the Curragh is different, I understand, eleven times the cost.</P>
    <P>I wish to point out, without going into too much detail, that there is a difference between the two types of prison, a difference which affords grounds for a constitutional action and which breaks the spirit of the Act and the promise of the Minister when introducing it.  That is a matter for concern and regret and I hope will add to our joint attempt to rid the Statute Book of this legislation.</P>
    <P>In 1972, when the Minister was defending the Bill, saying it would be open to scrutiny and so on, he referred extensively, as Ministers are wont to do, to the very good work which most visiting committees undertake.  He pointed out that there was to be a visiting committee to be appointed to the Curragh military encampment, a military prison, and that they would act, as it were, as watchdog in this regard.  It seems to me that one cannot really have it both ways.  If in introducing a Bill one wants to utilise as a safeguard the argument that a visiting committee is to be there, one cannot very well then ignore their recommendations when they choose to make them.</P>
    <P>The difference between prisons is once again underlined by the fact that, even though an annual report on prisons and places of detention is published, it does not include any reference at all to the Curragh, merely because we are told that the Minister for Defence is the appropriate Minister in relation to the Curragh.  But it underlines the fact that there is a very basic difference above and beyond mere questions of accommodation in relation to the two types of prison.</P>
    <P>What, then, do the visiting committee say about the Curragh and how well it <Col N="325" /> has worked?  Visiting committees have rarely been known for what might be called an excess of reformist zeal.  They are people who have a very difficult job, who are basically, I think, almost friendless. Any recommendations they choose to make would probably be interpreted by members of the staff, who in the vast majority of cases do a very good job in extraordinarily difficult positions, as perhaps a little bit of do-goodery by people who are part-timers and amateurs.  I honestly believe that the Department of Justice probably see the recommendations of visiting committees as being unhelpful if they are too demanding.  I am not sure who feels befriended by visiting committees or <i>vice versa.</i>  Even the inmates of such institutions often have some scorn for such committees.  However, I know from personal experience that the majority of these committees get down very seriously to a difficult job, and take it seriously.  Therefore, I think their recommendations should be taken seriously.</P>
    <P>The Annual Report of the Visiting Committee for the Military Detention Barracks, Curragh Camp, County Kildare, for the period ending 31 December 1972, which I think was the first such report, indicated a commitment by the visiting committee to get down to the job of familiarising themselves with the structure of the place, interviewing inmates and so on.  Therefore, their findings in the following year would be of interest.  In their annual report for the period ending 31 December 1973, published in January 1974, they say:</P>
    <P>It is the opinion of the Committee that the Military Detention Barracks is not at all suitable for prisoners serving long sentences.  The type of prisoner admitted to the prison raises difficulties regarding the provision and maintenance of gainful labour or employment. </P>
    <P>Deputy Bermingham has already outlined the signatories to these reports and I shall not repeat them except to say, without any sense of malice, they represent <Col N="326" /> people from all shades of party and political opinion, included among them Deputy Bermingham himself, the present Minister for Forestry and Fisheries, Deputy Power, and others who are extremely concerned about the situation and who have called repeatedly, in effect, for the closure of this institution.</P>
    <P>In their annual report for the period ending 31 December 1974, published in January 1975, they say again:</P>
    <P>It is the opinion of the Committee that the Military Detention Barracks is not at all suitable for prisoners serving long sentences.  The type of prisoners admitted to the prison raises difficulties regarding the provision and maintenance of gainful labour and employment. </P>
    <P>An almost exact repetition of what they said previously.  On 15 January 1975, in an observation on the annual report for the period ending 31 December 1974. Mr. Terry Boylan&mdash;somebody with whom I am sure the Minister is familiar&mdash;said in a letter to the Minister about the report:</P>
    <P>...the complete area for the detention of prisoners is not at all suitable and is putting undue strain on the Army personnel in charge. </P>
    <P>In January 1976, introducing their annual report for the period ending 31 December 1975, the committee said:</P>
    <P>It is the opinion of the Committee that the Military Detention Barracks is not at all suitable for prisoners serving long sentences. </P>
    <P>Mr. Terry Boylan, in a further letter to the Minister for Defence in January 1977, said <i>inter alia:</i></P>
    <P>I am adamant, in connection with the Committee's recommendation, that prisoners requiring treatment for a mental condition should not be in the Curragh. </P>
    <P>That is a clear indication that the Curragh was open to being used as an area for incarceration of people who might have mental conditions.  Mr. Boylan added further:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="327" /> The present building used for holding prisoners is not suitable for the incarceration of social delinquents. An extra mental and physical strain is placed on military personnel and prisoners. </P>
    <P>In January 1977, introducing their report for the year ended 31 December 1976, the committee said:</P>
    <P>The Committee wishes again to draw attention to previous reports in which it stated that the Military Detention Barracks is not at all suitable for prisoners serving long sentences.... There is a lack of facilities for the rehabilitative training of prisoners in military custody. ...Due to the fact that there are no psychiatric facilities in the prison, treatment is limited to medication.  This situation is unsatisfactory.  The Committee strongly recommends that prisoners requiring psychiatric treatment should not be transferred to military custody in the future. </P>
    <P>Again, all the signatories are involved.</P>
    <P>In January 1978, introducing their report for the period ending 31 December 1977, the committee say:</P>
    <P>There is a lack of facilities for the rehabilitation and training of prisoners in military custody. </P>
    <P>The committee give the population at that time as being between 22 and 27, something in excess of two dozen, which apparently has remained consistent, all presumably incorrigible or unable to be dealt with in some other way than by the existence of a military prison.</P>
    <P>In January 1979, in introducing to the Minister for Defence, their report for the year ending 31 December 1978, the committee say&mdash;and I do not think the Minister should be surprised any longer&mdash;:</P>
    <P>The Military Detention Barracks is unsuitable for long term prisoners. Long term confinement in such an enclosed area must have a tension creating effect on prisoners.  Prisoners <Col N="328" /> transferred to the Military Detention Barracks appear to be those who do not fit into the ordinary prison system. More suitable facilities and better conditions would be provided in a section of one of the larger prisons set aside for the confinement of this particular type of prisoner. </P>
    <P>Then in January of this year the visiting committee introduced their report for the year ending 31 December 1979.  Incidentally, subsequent to January 1977 the visiting committee had been largely replaced.  I do not wish by saying that to imply that the people who replaced those who had served on it were anything but of the highest calibre.  But just to illustrate that it was not a small group of people who got something into their heads and kept repeating it, a largely new committee said that the military arrangements in the Curragh for long term prisoners were not satisfactory and that the whole of the long-term arrangements must have a tension creating effect on prisoners, maintaining that the prisoners transferred to the Military Detention Barracks appeared to be those who do not fit into the ordinary prison system.</P>
    <P>I should like to add one small note regarding the visiting committee report but it is a comment which unfortunately is applicable generally.  In the public interest I urge the Minister to ensure that the reports of this committee are made available freely so that it is not necessary for anyone who wishes to read them to have to wring them from the Department of Justice, often by way of threat of court action.  The people have a right to these reports and there should not be any need to browbeat the Department into their publication as has been the case on too many occasions in the past.</P>
    <P>The visiting committee have on many occasions condemned unequivocably some of the fundamental aspects of the institution but they had some good remarks to make about it also.  Our grounds for seeking the early cessation of this whole section relating to such detention in the military prison is not <Col N="329" /> because of the physical condition of the prison which perhaps is no better or no worse than any other prison.  Neither are we seeking this change on the ground particularly of the difference in the staff at that prison compared with the staff at other prisons.  Our case is on the basis that essentially there is no need for a military prison and that the designation of any place as a civilian prison would cope adequately with the accommodation difficulties, if such exist and it is difficult to believe that there are such difficulties having regard to the fact that during the term of office of the previous Government a number of new prisions and institutions came on stream.  These include Arbour Hill and Shelton Abbey where, obviously, the burgeoning prison population could be accommodated adequately.</P>
    <P>However, the high security risk element of the new arrangements must be dealt with.  We must be honest and realise that Portlaoise is a high-security prison which, apart from one or two minor problems, has been successful, more or less, in regard to containing the overall problem.  It was not considered necessary to open a military prison at Portlaiose to accommodate prisoners who were to be kept under close scrutiny and in a high security prison.  Therefore, why should it have been considered necessary to do so in the case we are talking about?  If the Minister were to say that the military prison would be closed down within 12 months, we would be happy but failing that we can only conclude that the easy way out is being taken.</P>
    <P>Let us remember that in three years time the problem may not be the Minister's but may be the problem of the people on this side of the House.  That is why I wish to make clear our desire and our intention in this regard.  I have a certain sympathy with the Minister.  His colleague, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, felt obliged to introduce such detention and this line was followed by Senator Cooney when he was Minister and at a time which was much tougher than the time we are experiencing <Col N="330" /> now.  He did so with courage and in the face of substantial condemnation but always acting with the interest of this country foremost, though that is something that can be said of all of us.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister be willing to indicate that he will be able, unequivocably, to remove within 12 months the designation &ldquo;military prison&rdquo;?  If that guarantee is forthcoming there should be some room for discussion but otherwise he will not find us sympathetic or supportive in the measure before the House today.</P>
    <P>There are other difficulties involved in this question.  There are the difficulties of the long-term prisoner.  One cannot help but get the impression that the people confined in this prison are basically people who for one reason or another have proved themselves as being incapable of being contained in other prisons. Perhaps they are people who for reasons of personal safety had to be moved from other prisons or perhaps in some cases some psychological or other disorder necessitated their being sent to the military prison because of normal prison routine not being appropriate for them and who in the long-term may be consigned to some kind of a dustbin situation for unfortunate wrecks of human beings, some of whom may have committed appalling crimes which none of us should be hesitant in condemning or facing up to, but if we subscribe genuinely to the basic rehabilitative concept of prison we must admit that the arrangements in the Curragh military prison <i>vis-à-vis</i> the long-term prisoner are such as to militate against any hope of such prisoners being rehabilitated.  These arrangements are not comparable with those which apply in the civilian prisons and which in their own way are limited enough.  Instead of going backwards in time we should be trying to advance the frontiers of progress in this area to ascertain if there is some way of genuinely tackling crime and of creating a rehabilitative process.  There are suggestions from many people about dealing with long-term prisoners.  In an article in the publication <i>Fortnight</i>, on 20 January <Col N="331" /> 1978, Trevor West writing on the problem of the lng-term prisoner said his contention is that there should be a formal judicial process removing the onus from the Minister for Justice and providing for an automatic review of each long-term prison sentence at, say, the half-way stage.  There are many people who are anxious to facilitate the rapid rehabilitation of prisoners to full and normal living while at the same time not putting at risk public order or public well-being but in the present situation that kind of sentiment is impossible of being put into effect.  One cannot but get the impression that the Curragh represents a situation of out of sight, out of mind, but perhaps I am not being fair in saying that.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to refer specifically to this question of medication, as it is termed in the report of the visiting committee.  It would not only be worrying but it would be scandalous if it were to be the case that large numbers of people in any institution were to be held in some sort of subjugation by way of the substantial administration of drugs. Therefore, I should like the Minister to tell us how many of the prison population are on drugs, what they are and for what purpose are they being administered. If the Minister finds himself unable to refer to these matters I shall conclude that the situation in this regard is not what it should be and that the medication is open to the accusation of being misapplied.</P>
    <P>In an article on the drugging of prisoners which appeared in the <i>Spectator</i> on 17 December 1977, Anthony Clare had the following to say:</P>
    <P>More and more psychiatric patients are finding their way into prison and they receive there, for the most part, little more than the most basic of psychiatric treatment. </P>
    <P>That is the same as what the visiting committee said and it is a very worrying feature of the whole situation.</P>
    <P>Obviously, any discussion of possible reform in that context is pointless and would possibly not be relevant to the <Col N="332" /> Bill.  I can only say that it is regrettable that we cannot have a debate on any institution without looking back over our shoulder to such an event, for instance, as a dramatic outbreak of inmates when we should be concentrating on reform and on the future generally in this regard.</P>
    <P>I cannot but conclude that the Government consider it useful to have on the Statute Book a provision which allows the Minister to designate at any time and in any place any prisoner to military incarceration which is of a high security nature and which involves a much more punitive element than that which the Minister and his colleagues as well as all of us in this party have referred to repeatedly as being proper in relation to penal procedure and correction generally.</P>
    <P>I wonder is that what this Bill is really about, the desire of the Government not to relinquish any of the power they presently have.  I have some sympathy with that view.  I can see that their problem is that they are faced with an appalling crime situation.  I would only ask them to consider very seriously the basic affront, constitutionally and to the individual, that is contained in that attitude and to look carefully at whether or not this measure means one iota of progress in the area of improvement of public order and so on.  I do not believe it does.</P>
    <P>In the face of the human challenge that we are talking about, which is about people and at the same time is about combating crime and balancing one against the other, we can do a lot better than this fairly jaded response of the Minister when he talks about transferring persons requiring a high degree of security who could not be accommodated in Portlaoise Prison or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Minister said also that a small number of prisoners who do not belong to any of these groups and who cannot therefore be fitted in there have to be accommodated elsewhere and that the only place in which they can be held with adequate security is the Curragh military <Col N="333" /> detention barracks.  There is clearly a process of selectivity operating here, a process which says that some people are appropriately to be incarcerated in the Curragh military barracks.  The Government seem to be very arbitrary and very selective and very subjective and it is in the interests of this House that they put it openly in writing so that we know precisely what kind of institution we are dealing with.  Is it simply a case, for example, of a difficult prisoner unit?  Incidentally, that could mean that a person who is perfectly correct in pursuing certain rights could be adjudged difficult&mdash;and I do not suggest for a minute that I have the slightest evidence to indicate that this has happened and I am sure it does not happen and I hope it does not happen&mdash;and could, by order of the Minister, be transferred to a prison in which his propensities for being difficult would be somewhat curtailed.  We need, therefore, in the context of what the Minister said today, not assurances but the open publication of the criteria on which prisoners are selected there.  On the one hand he talks about a high degree of security.  On the other hand he talks about people not belonging to other groups, although I was not aware that any Minister in the State ever accepted what we might call groupings of prisoners as if they had a particular affiliation to each other.  Perhaps the Minister simply means various categories of people.  He says further:</P>
    <P>It is essential, if Mountjoy is to continue to hold this population in safety, that a small number of seriously disruptive prisoners should be kept out of it. </P>
    <P>We would agree with him there.  That is not, of course, grounds for the continued designation of the Curragh as a military prison.  It is only grounds for building the right kind of institution.  The Minister talks also about the restoration of peace and order being possible only because the Curragh was available for the ringleaders.  He says: <Col N="334" /> I have no doubt at all that the maintenance of peace and order in the civil prisons continues to depend on the availability of the Curragh.</P>
    <P>I do not trust the Minister's judgment in this regard and I do not trust the party opposite either.  It is not 12 to 13 years since, out of the blue and for no reason that any one of us at the time could put a finger on, not a suggestion but a statement was made that if certain things occurred internment would be introduced. Our party in 1972&mdash;and this was repeated in the context of the latter of the debates in 1974 and 1977&mdash;wished to make it clear that they would be willing to facilitate and co-operate with any Government definitely concerned about certain issues but that we were not interested in introducing internment by the back door.  I am not suggesting that that is what is involved here but when the Minister talks like this, when he talks about the ringleaders and the maintenance of peace and order in the civil prisons depending on the availability of the Curragh, he is getting very close to this because he has already stated that his purpose is to build a high security prison.</P>
    <P>If there was a high security prison tomorrow what is to disabuse us all of the notion that the Minister still believes that he would have no doubt that the maintenance of peace and order in the civil prisons would continue to depend on the availability of the Curragh.  In other words he does not accept that military prisons will go, ever.  Otherwise he would have said that the maintenance of peace and order in the civil prisons continues to depend on the availability of the Curragh or a high security civil prison at the earliest opportunity.  That is not there and the thinking is not there and that is what worries me about this.</P>
    <P>The Minister also makes reference to troublemakers and active sympathisers who are apparently carrying on a campaign. I am not sure what this is intended to refer to but I do not think it is helpful. It is also unfortunate when people in this House will point fingers at people outside who are exercising their fundamental <Col N="335" /> basic right to point out what they consider to be wrongs or injustices and it is a fairly snide remark which ill becomes the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks also about the detention barracks and the Curragh military hospital.  He said:</P>
    <P>The detention barracks at present accommodates 27 prisoners most of them prisoners who had to be transferred out of the civil prisons because of their potential to foment disorder. </P>
    <P>I am not sure what kind of analysis led to that conclusion but it is fair to say that there are in some cases people who clearly have for some reason or another decided to embark on a campaign of complete disruption of our prison system and there is no doubt about it.  But until we devise some other system, some other way of dealing with the matter, it will be necessary to constrain such people in a very high security, intensely guarded unit or prison in order to protect not just the public but other prisoners.  That prison should be a civil prison and any necessary co-operation which the Government need to bring about that structure, even though it would not be the order of priorities we would choose in an ideal society, will be afforded to them.  But I honestly believe that the Minister has concluded that it is a useful and good thing to have there a military prison and that he has no intention of changing it, although, in fairness to him, he does say:</P>
    <P>I want to see an end to military custody. </P>
    <P>He refers then to his predecessor, saying:</P>
    <P>My predecessor said at the time that the problem could be solved by building a special high security prison unit capable of housing up to 30 high-risk prisoners. </P>
    <P>He talks about another plan because the security authorities apparently were opposed to any building operations in Portlaoise Prison.  He says:</P>
    <P>Whatever the reasons for not <Col N="336" /> proceeding with the special unit at the time, the position now is that a site for a new prison has been selected on the farm, the money is available for it and the security authorities no longer have objections to building operations. </P>
    <P>I am not sure about that.  There are important principles there.  The Minister, on behalf of the people of this country, is the one who decides where prisons are built and how they are built.  It is the job of the Minister to take advice but it is he who is accountable and he who must accept the responsibility.  The implication here is that because objections have been withdrawn he is now agreeable to going ahead.  Perhaps I am overstating the degree to which the Minister is reliant on advice in this case.  Once again I do not like the smack of the words.  He talks about it being more ambitious than what had been intended in his predecessor's time.  He says:</P>
    <P>It would be a self-contained, autonomous prison with ample and humane accommodation. </P>
    <P>Nowhere does he say it but I presume it is a civilian prison that he is talking about.  Perhaps he would clarify that.  I do not know if we need more ambitious prisons or not.  I am sure we do but I would not like ambition to be heaped on ambition and to find in a few year's time that we had a still more ambitious plan about to be introduced and that therefore we have to justify a further extension. He admits that in the debate in 1974 and 1977 his view was that perhaps the high security prison could be operated under civilian control, establishing clearly that one does not need a military prison in order to ensure security.  That is not what is at issue in this case.  Surely it is within our power to rid our Statute books of this ignoble, repugnant principle and still maintain the highest standard of security and, dare I say it, law and order.  The Minister says:</P>
    <P>The reasons for the introduction of military custody in 1972, and the extensions of the Act in 1974 and 1977 during the term of the National Coalition, remain valid. </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="337" /> That is not true.  First of all the implication is that they are the same reasons. The reasons in 1972 were primarily accommodation if not exclusively so.  I was not around at the time so obviously I have not got a feeling for the time but my research indicated that they were dictated by extraordinary excesses of behaviour by inmates of institutions in extremely difficult times when explosives and so on were used.  They are two different reasons.  The reason for the introduction of the Bill in 1972 is no longer there.  As Deputy Bermingham has already said, surely it is within our compass to contain just over two dozen prisoners in the other places of penal servitude in the State without needing this unit in the Curragh to remain.</P>
    <P>The case has not been proved and it would be well if the Minister would reconsider his proposal which is, I believe, an almost automatic reflex on his part&mdash;a person very busy with many pressing matters who might not believe that this principle is as important as some of us believe it is.  I should like the Minister to accept the amendment we are tabling.  We want to ensure that within 12 months it will be possible for the House to conclude that there is no longer any need for a military prison in the Curragh and that it should cease at that time if not sooner.  We allow 12 months reluctantly in order to ensure every opportunity to the Minister to bring forward evidence which will show that he is genuine in his desire to end military custody.  If that is the case there might be no need to be divisive about this.  If the amendment is not acceptable there will be no&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am indicating the attitude of the party on Committee Stage and what the bottom line will be.  If such a proposal is acceptable there is room for some degree of co-operation no matter how reluctant some of us might be to that degree.  If it is not acceptable there <Col N="338" /> will be no support for the Bill because ample opportunity has been given to go beyond what is presently outlined in the Bill as an answer to this difficulty.</P>
      <P>Lest it be misconstructed&mdash;I have endeavoured to deal as responsibly as I can with these issues&mdash;I want to assure the Minister that every possible assistance and help in so far as it is of use in ensuring that the difficulties he is confronted with on a number of fronts, particularly in relation to crime, will be given to him. We have no wish to cause any more difficulties than the Minister has at present. We are very appreciative of the commendable independence of spirit contained in his speech on April 24 when he referred to the need for a rational approach to the difficulties which confront us on the crime front.  It is not any sense of being opposition for opposition sake that we put forward the sentiments we did today but purely to endeavour to bring an end to a measure which was brought in for one purpose, which purpose like the chameleon has changed since then in colour and hue and which runs the risk of embedding into legislation a measure which is not just unnecessary in logistic terms and even in security terms, by virtue of our ability to designate anywhere a high security civilian prison, but which is also a profound deprivation of certain basic rights and which is possibly unconstitutional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Opposition point of view on this Bill.  I completely reject the principle in the Bill&mdash;the use of military personnel within the civil prison system.  One of the most striking things about the Minister's speech is the difference in tone between his attitude now and that of Deputy O'Malley who nobody could say was a particularly sentimental or over-lenient individual.  He is accepted by us all as being quite a tough individual.  There is no doubt that when he moved the Bill in 1972 one got a sense in his general approach that it was a truly shocking proposal, that he regretted having to make it and that he made it only in the context of what I suppose for a Minister must be a very worrying experience&mdash;the <Col N="339" /> fact that one of the big jails had been seriously damaged as a result of a riot.</P>
      <P>There was a general sense of emergency and the Minister was responding to it with this measure for the Curragh prison military detention centre but with the greatest reluctance.  For that reason he gave us an assurance that it would be a temporary provision.  I do not get that sense of reluctance from the present Minister.  The impression one gets is that there is no sense of urgency whatever in his approach to getting rid of the military detention centre in the Curragh.  There is a great element of complacency about it.  In some ways it is inexplicable.  One of the unfortunate things about successive Governments, and not just this Minister, is that they have shown such a reluctance to allow public representatives to visit prisons and find out for themselves.  I suspect most of us could be accepted as being reasonably responsible people and could be trusted to go and look at our jails. Most people know I have been particularly interested in prisons for many years.  We would be in a better position to assess things for ourselves.</P>
      <P>From those I have spoken to in Portlaoise, jail conditions appear to have become at least bearable.  Everybody must know that there is no consolation or possible satisfaction anybody can get in prison.  After the shock of isolation from society and the rest of the community, as far as I would be concerned nothing they would do to me after that would matter very much.  Accepting the horror I would consider prison to be here and in other countries&mdash;I am excluding Scandinavian countries because they have an enlightened approach to penal systems and penology generally&mdash; segregation and isolation from society is to me the supreme penalty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One gets the impression that the Minister has made changes of some value which seem to have reduced the measure of tension which appeared to exist in Portlaoise Prison in the mid-seventies. He must get credit for that and for a certain number of&mdash;is it rhetoric <Col N="340" /> again or is he serious about it? &mdash;enlightened statements in regard to his aspirations for the prison system.  We are still left with this very serious defect in the civil prison system, the intrusion of the military detention centre in the Curragh, the method by which it is run under military discipline and the imprisonment there of a relatively small number of people, considering the size of the prison population.  Size does not matter; a single human being has as much right to our concern as 20, 30, 50 or 100 people.  We have no right to mistreat anybody.</P>
    <P>We all have a special responsibility to be concerned about people like prisoners, people for whom there is not much tolerance in society.  I take the socialist attitude to prisoners or so-called criminals.  The social origins of criminality are now generally accepted. To me, the idea of punishing somebody for having been born in Summerhill in overcrowded conditions and having a difficult upbringing is irrational and indefensible.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The restoration of peace and order was possible only because the Curragh was available for the ring leaders.  I have no doubt at all that the maintenance of peace and order in the civil prisons continues to depend on the availability of the Curragh.  This, of course, suits neither the troublemakers among those transferred nor their active sympathisers outside who are, apparently, committed to undermining the prison system. They have been carrying on a campaign over the past few months to have military custody abandoned.  I would urge those who support the campaign to be wary of the motives of those who are behind it. </P>
    <P>That kind of innuendo can be accepted as being directed to any of us who objects to the principle of military control of a civil prison.  Is Deputy Keating, who expressed on behalf of his party his repugnance at the idea, attempting to undermine the prison system?  Anybody who listened to his speech must know <Col N="341" /> that is not true.  Deputy Bermingham, who, on behalf of his party rejected the idea of military custody for civilian prisoners, cannot be regarded as a man who wishes to undermine the prison system.  Yet Deputy Bermingham made the sacrifice&mdash;as a politician it was important for him to be on the visiting committee&mdash;and chose to resign as a very positive protest against his acceptance of the idea of having any part in the maintenance of what he felt were indefensible conditions within a prison to which he was one of the prison visitors.</P>
    <P>The whole question of one's right to know, and then to protest, is of enormous importance because the more one sees, the more sympathy one tends to have, say, for the German people, because one of the greatest crimes we attach to them is the fact that they claim they did not know what was going on behind the walls in their dreadful prisons during Hitler's time.  I am not comparing the Curragh with Auschwitz, Buchenwald or any of those places.  The Minister and his predecessors are simply carrying out our orders.  It was accepted at Nuremburg that we cannot simply say that because our officers did certain things in our names, and we did not know they were doing them, we are innocent. We are not innocent.  We are all party to these things.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bermingham resigned from the visiting committee and was replaced by somebody who supports the Fianna Fáil Party.  Apparently there are a number of people on the visiting committee who support Fianna Fáil, but the very reassuring feature of this whole debate has been the consistency with which the rank and file of all parties, Labour, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, have protested. The protest has been right across the political spectrum.  We all want to disown this subject and to be disassociated from it.  Speaking on behalf of the people who elected us, we have said time and time again that we do not want to have military control in our prison system. The Minister has chosen to ignore these appeals to discontinue the use of this place as a prison.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="342" /> Let us examine the bona fides of everybody who has spoken about this. They are mostly establishment people, who are unquestioned in their attitude to society, who are accepted by all the social mores and conventions.  Therefore, the whole implication in page 2 of the Minister's speech is unworthy of him. There is the Prisoners' Rights Organisation led by a man called Joe Costello.  I have the greatest admiration for somebody who has never been imprisoned but who can take up this attitude of concern about injustices to people who have not got anybody else to plead their cases.  I do not see why such people should be singled out, people who help us by doing a lot of work we could not do without considerable assistance. Their conclusions are also the conclusions of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties and, as far as I can gather, the Fianna Fáil Party.  Why should they be accused of being committed to undermining the prison system?</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice are notorious for the existence of a chronic paranoia about prisoners.  As long as I have known them they have assumed that people have been trying to pull down the walls and let free the people inside and destroy the whole prison system.  They have been exceptionally conservative and unimaginative, and when they have a compliant Minister their approach to the whole prison population is undesirably punitive rather than rehabilitative.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that I do not attach any responsibility whatsoever for the condition of our jails to any other section or Department but the political head of the Department.  I have always accepted that we, the elected representatives, are responsible, that it is we who earn credit or blame.  Nobody else is responsible for conditions in our jails. One has only to look at our jails to know that they are not ordered or run as prisons are in Scandinavian countries, for instance, or in parts of the US.</P>
    <P>One then must wonder if the complaints being made are justified.  The Minister's speech is peculiarly equivocal <Col N="343" /> on this question of military custody.  In page 3 he repeats that he wants to see an end to military custody for civilians but he said that he must provide an alternative. Then one comes to what is to me the highly embarrassing question of providing a jail for 30 people.  It has taken ten years and I do not know if it has been started.  I had the privilege of being head of a Department which built accommodation for more than 8,000 hospital beds in eight years.  Many other Departments like Local Government&mdash;now Environment&mdash;Agriculture, Education, must ridicule the suggestion that any Minister or succession of Ministers faced with responsibility for building prison accommodation for 30 people, if he was serious about it or if the will was there, would take ten years to do it.  How in heaven's name could that be allowed to happen? It is difficult to believe there could be that level of incompetence in any Department.</P>
    <P>There are an extraordinary number of curious anomalies here.  One is that in two years Deputy Cooney built a 400-cell jail.  Surely even the Minister's Department must ridicule the suggestion that they could not have done it if they had wanted to do it.  Between 1974 and 1976, a jail was built at the Curragh which contained 400 cells.  Is there a jail of 400 cells?</P>

      <P>It was to be completed in 1976 at a cost of £350,000.  I shall pursue that matter later on.  I shall go back to the thirties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a failure to build such <Col N="344" /> a prison and it is now intended to commence it.  Why is it that this jail, according to Deputy O'Malley, could be built in two years&mdash;which is the reason, presumably, why he asked for a two year Bill at the time&mdash;and the Minister now says that this new jail will take rather more than three years to build?  It seems an extraordinary length of time, particularly in these days of modern industrial practices, to build what appears to be a small building.</P>
    <P>Again when Deputy O'Malley, Minister at the time, was faced with this surplus of prisoners as a result of the burning of Mountjoy Prison, he had also the problem of limited staff.  These are some of the reasons why the present Minister's position is nothing like the same as the position of the Minister when this Bill was first introduced in 1972, or even subsequently when Deputy Cooney, the then Minister, was faced with a similar position at a very much more turbulent time from the point of view of activity in this part of the country.  The present position, I understand, is that there are more prison officers than there are prisoners.  In addition to the restoration of Mountjoy Prison, Arbour Hill was opened in 1974 and Glengarriff Parade was opened in 1976.  The number of prison officers was increased to 1,100 and 400 more will be recruited by the end of 1980, in excess of the number of prisoners.  The accommodation is there, if the Minister chose to use it.  Apparently Portlaoise could take some more prisoners than at present. All that is required is a change of attitude on the part of the Minister towards the need for soldiers to look after prisoners rather than the people who are trained to do so.</P>
    <P>The number of people at present in the Curragh Prison is about 30, of whom three are political prisoners.  This prison was designed to be a tough prison, staffed by soldiers at a time when the people going there were mostly people who claimed to be members of an army. These have all been assimilated, or else liberated, but the principle of manning our civil jails with members of the <Col N="345" /> Defence Forces appears to be accepted by the Minister.  The reason for this, presumably, is that the discipline introduced by the Army is such as to contain the unfortunate people who are kept in prison.</P>
    <P>The Minister will correct me if I am wrong but is it a fact that the Curragh military detention camp is run in accordance with a very much more rigid attitude to prisoners?  We must remember, as anyone who reads an advertisement for a prison officer and for an army soldier will realise, that there is a great difference between their training and outlook. The soldier knows well that when he joins an army he will be given a gun, he will be trained how to control riots, to deal with people who are shooting at him and shoot back at them.  The whole approach of the individual who goes into an army is quite different from that of a man who goes into the prison service, particularly these days when conditions are improving.  It is very hard to understand the Minister's rationalisation for putting a soldier in charge of a prison, when he makes it quite clear in his specification for prison officers that he requires a person of certain qualities and certain attitudes, subject to certain training, of a certain background and attitude to life.  A man chooses to go into the prison service rather than go into the Army or the Garda force or any other trained profession, so why pick on the Army?  That is how the Minister wants to treat these unfortunate people who find that jail is a dreadful place and show that they think it is a dreadful place and are unable to accommodate themselves in the appalling existence of being locked away in isolation for months, and sometimes years on end, with an expectation of spending years more there.  I do not know how anybody can contemplate that dilemma for human beings and not give sympathy to them, no matter what they do.  I am not condoning what they do, but understanding why they do it.  Instead of attempting to adapt the prison to meet the needs of these people, we decide that we will use brute force.  That is really what it amounts to, is it not? <Col N="346" /> Army discipline&mdash;it does not matter which army&mdash;is tough, hard, uncompromising, authoritarian, no complaints, no excuses, punishment.  Is that not the general attitude of mind of the soldier to his job?  It is rather brutal.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be offensive to army people, but essentially, especially if they have to go to war, as we have seen in recent weeks, it becomes a particularly horrid experience.  It is a long way from the principle, which the Minister himself has articulated from time to time, of the prison officer whose overriding job is very difficult indeed, that of trying to make fellow human beings, for whom probably he has a lot of sympathy, come to terms with the intolerable conditions of isolation and exclusion from society and the general sense of guilt which must be there always.  At the same time the officer himself probably has all sorts of domestic, personal and financial worries. How can a prison officer, no matter how well-meaning, console that kind of person and how often must he bear the brunt of the prisoner's sense of frustration in what is called discipline?  The prison officer goes into the prison knowing that he will face this kind of unpleasant dilemma, or at least he is told so and attempts have been made to make him deal with it.  Having worked quite a while in mental hospitals&mdash;which are not as unpleasant as prisons but which have some of the problems with which one is faced there&mdash;I have great sympathy for the prison officer.</P>
    <P>However, the soldier is not recruited and trained for this and so he becomes impatient.  He himself is told, &ldquo;Turn to the right, turn to the left, march quick, march slow&rdquo;, and he does what he is told:</P>
    <P>Their's not to reason why, Their's but to do or die: </P>
    <P>How can such people be accepted by us as suitable for running a prison no matter who is in it and how intractable the people there seem to be?  So, as frequently happens in human relations, the simple answer is that the prison officer has to do his best to meet the frustration of <Col N="347" /> people in as tolerant a way as he can and try to explain to the individual that this is unfortunate, he has got to go through it and as far as he is concerned they will try to work it through together.  The soldier has no such training or inclination. The result is that imprisonment in a military camp such as the Curragh is qualitatively completely different from imprisonment in Mountjoy and other prisons, and it is indefensible.  The Minister has made no defence whatever beyond the one that it solves the problem of the difficult prisoner.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is a quotation.  One of my jobs once upon a time was looking after psychopaths, people who are very disturbed in what is miscalled a criminal way.  I remember reading a paper once which opened with talking about how to look after them and so on.  It stated: &ldquo;The only way to deal with the psychopath is to put him in a state of grace and shoot him&rdquo;.  Obviously, that is a doctrine of despair and sardonic, grim humour, but in some ways the Minister is moving to that kind of idea.  He is saying &ldquo;I am dealing with a very difficult problem.  I am fed up trying.  An ordinary prison is not suitably equipped and they find it very troublesome; therefore I will solve the problem for them.  I will put them into this place and I will put them under soldiers and I will break them.  They will be broken by brute force&rdquo;.  Therefore, complaints are discouraged.  Perhaps somebody gets a dreadful letter from home and something is going wrong and there is no question that the soldier is going to sit down and talk it over with the prisoner.  Visits are refused for trivial reasons.  Quite frequently, apparently, visitors are told that they cannot visit for no clear reason.  Letters in and out can be withheld and I have been given to understand that prisoners are pulled from their beds at midnight for strip searches.  The prisoners must stand to attention outside their cell doors when the MP blows a whistle or else loose three days remission.  Perhaps the Minister will deal with these charges.</P>
    <P>If we were allowed to visit the prisons we would not be so blind about these <Col N="348" /> things in so far as we do not know them from our own experience.  &ldquo;Prisoners must stand to attention and salute the governor when he appears.&rdquo; Surely this cannot be true.  Nobody would want an unfortunate civilian to salute him.  It seems an extraordinary reflection on the person who would look for this kind of compulsory salutation.  There is little or no serious work for the prisoners.  There is shovelling turf and trivial jobs of one kind or another.  The result is that the prisoners feel that they are living in the overcrowded, repressive conditions of a prisoner of war camp or even worse than that.  As we know from the H-Block protests, the general attitude towards prisoners of war is that their conditions are reasonably acceptable so long as they are not treated in a punitive way.</P>
    <P>On Wednesday 5 March 1980 two prisoners were punished by Commandant Mullowney, one for allegedly cutting the green cloth top of a pool table and the other for concealing the act. Each received 14 days loss of remission, two months loss of visits and letters in and out, two months loss of all privileges and use of radio, recreation, tobacco and sweets and two months solitary confinement. Is that true?  They got two months solitary confinement for tearing a billiard cloth.  I find it hard to believe that that is true and that such is carried out in my name in one of our jails.</P>
    <P>Surely this kind of behaviour towards people in custody is unnecessarily provocative.  As the lay members of the visiting committee said, the confined quarters in which these people are cooped up together in itself promotes an increase in tension.  These people said this spontaneously from their own observations. These people are not members of the Prisoners Rights Organisation but are members of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>In relation to the crucial question of medical care, I would like to read into the record part of the 1980 visiting committee report:</P>
    <P>The Military Detention Barracks is unsuitable for long term prisoners. <Col N="349" /> Long term confinement in such an enclosed area must have a tension creating effect on prisoners. </P>
    <P>This appears to relate to people who do not fit into the ordinary prisoners system.</P>
    <P>The other rather harrowing comment by this visiting committee is:</P>
    <P>The visual impact on seeing this structure must have traumatic effect on the minds of children when visits to parents are made. </P>
    <P>How could anybody be unmoved by that thought, whatever about the so-called criminals or anybody else involved?  The suffering of children is unnecessary and something we could avoid.</P>
    <P>Visual and audible methods could be used satisfactorily for interviews between married couples, instead of the presence of an MP. </P>
    <P>Could anything be more grotesque than to allow that to go on in relation to any human being or animal?  How little things change.  I remember long ago my friend Noel Harty made this claim about the man in Portlaoise&mdash;&ldquo;Would you keep a dog like this&rdquo;.  The man died on hunger strike.</P>
    <P>These people get help and that brings me to my profession's role in running a military jail.  In 1978, 50 per cent of the people in the prison got drugs regularly and 33 per cent have regular visits to a psychiatrist.  It is a small confined prison where these poor men have not even the consolation of being political prisoners, who at least have the sense of camaraderie, and companionship which belongs to political prisoners in any country.  They are really rather desolate people.</P>
    <P>When laymen, politicians of all parties, people of my profession who are so frequently decried as being self interested and only concerned for their own promotion, occasionally visit these places and come out with flat condemnation of the conditions under which people are imprisoned, what is the position of the medical officer who goes into a <Col N="350" /> place like that?  The medical officer must see what these lay men see.  At what stage should a doctor join his civilian colleagues in pointing out what appears to be an observation that should come more appropriately from a psychiatrist or doctor?  All credit to the lay man for making the comment, but how long should a doctor go on handing out soporifics to individuals who in the opinion of successive generations of visiting committees of all parties are improperly incarcerated in military custody?  How long should a medical officer feel that he can properly continue to play a role in stupefying through medication those unfortunate people so unjustly detained in these intolerable conditions?  Surely it is a strange thing that they have not gone to their association and that their association have not gone to the Minister and made their protest.  Only today, in relation to Foreign Affairs questions were put where we were critical of other countries for what they did in regard to something like that.  We are so critical of what we are told goes on in the Soviet jails, the stupefaction of human beings with thymoleptic drugs, tranquilisers of one kind or another.  The long term effects of these is to distort the personality of the individual.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Are these drugs in use in the Curragh?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt they would be used.  If one is faced with a position where somebody is hyperactive and under severe tension, the simplest drugs to give them are these drugs like largactil and tryptozol.  These are mood changing drugs.  The long term effect is as people say, these people who have had this kind of care in Soviet hospitals.  They tend to become as zombies eventually, and hardly know where they are or whether they are asleep or awake.  Certainly they are stultified.  That is the only way they can tolerate the appalling conditions of this kind of incarceration. There are prisoners next door to them in Portlaoise who are as intellectually bright, acute and active-minded as they were the day they went in.  Possibly <Col N="351" /> they do not ever take any of these kinds of drugs, or need them.  They can come to terms with the conditions under which they are there, thanks to the Minister, and thanks to the prison officers and the medical care they get for one reason or another.</P>
      <P>This is not true in the Curragh because of the close confinement of the conditions in which they are there, in a jail completely unsuitable for the purpose for which it is being used, staffed by people who are not trained and are completely unsuitable for the job they are doing. The inevitable result is their retention in conditions of crude, brutal, oppressive discipline, or else the total alteration of their personalities.  It is an obscene impertinence for any human being to take other human beings and, through medication, alter them and adapt them to suit the environment which you created and to which you entrusted them.  It is an obscene impertinence for us to do that to them.  That, I charge, is what is being done in the Curragh at present.</P>
      <P>When we see the mote in the other people's eyes it is time for us to take cognisance of what is happening in our society.  I see no possibility of there being proper facilities for serious psycho-therapeutic care for these people in the form of group therapy discussions, personal interviews, psycho-analysis, or any of these things.  A psychiatrist cannot pretend he is giving the care he would give to that person in his care in a psychiatric hospital.  For that reason it seems to me like somebody with a broken leg being given a quarter of morphine, and another person having nothing done about his broken leg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very reluctantly I say I believe that continuing to behave in that way amounts to medical malpractice.  It is about time my medical colleagues joined with the visiting committee and told the Minister that this jail is unsuited for civil prisoners, or for any kind of prisoners, and asked him to do what we all know he could quite easily do, that is, build a suitable prison quite quickly or, alternatively, <Col N="352" /> under the 1877 Act designate some other place or part of a place or institution as a suitable prison and man it with suitable trained prison officers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating dealt with the contempt for the Constitution.  I have been a critic of the Constitution a number of times but, the more I see it in action, the more I feel it has some fine features and that, if we did not have them, we would have some very unpleasant laws on our Statute Book and be left to the tender mercies of Ministers like Deputy Collins. I hope some organisation on behalf of these people will take constitutional action in order to get a decision as to whether it is permissible for a Minister to unsurp the functions of the Judiciary by relocating prisoners from the civil prison system into military custody. From the behaviour of our authorities in these jails, it would appear that we set out deliberately to torment these unfortunate people.  So much could be done for them; life for them is so forlorn and so hopeless and very little is done to attempt to ameliorate their conditions. Deputy Bermingham pointed out the difficulties we face when we complain about the treatment of Mr. Lambert, or about H Block or Armagh jail.  Others can point over our shoulders and say: &ldquo;Put your own house in order and then you have a right to complain.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is one other consideration in relation to this attitude to people who found their way into this place in the first instance&mdash;the fact that they did so because they were subversives.  My impression is that we are moving into a period of considerable political turmoil, for obvious reasons: the monopoly capitalism system under which we operate and the impossibility of dealing with the social and economic problems facing our society.  For these reasons there will be increasing unrest, not the kind Deputy Keating referred to, what are called criminality and vandalism, but there will be very much more action in the streets, protests by trade unionists, strikes, official and unofficial, lock-outs and legislation to suppress them.  The fact that this kind of legislation is on the <Col N="353" /> Statute Book is rather sinister because the Minister is so indefinite about it.  He said he thought he would not have the jail finished in three years even though he is asking for three years in the Bill.  As far as the Minister is concerned, he can see it going on, and on, and on.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that the Offences Against the State Act does not apply only to what we call subversives, the Provos and the other forms of Sinn Féin organisations.  As a High Court judge recently made clear, it also applies to ordinary civilians and it has been applied on a couple of occasions to trade unionists. Taking this legislation, together with the Special Criminal Court, it is particularly offensive, repugnant, repelling and dangerous from the point of view of ordinary people.  The right to military detention and to extend that military detention in respect of civil prisons and the right to deal with greatly increased prison population composed of trade unionists or protesting workers, as was tried before here, is contained in this Bill.</P>
    <P>A 30-cell prison is such a trivial thing that it is hard to understand how it should take so many years to build.  It is an incredible assertion for a Minister of State to make in respect of his Department that he was unable to do this work because he could not get the money or whatever.  Is there an element of thimble-rigging? Is this legislation designed to deal with troubles that are expected, industrial troubles?  Linked to the Offences Against the State Act, and the Special Criminal Court the Prisons Bill would be a very tidy end result for dealing with what Senator Cooney, as Minister &mdash;Deputy Collins held the same view&mdash;described as subversives, other than the Provisional IRA and the other forms of IRA, IRSP and so on.  Senator Cooney, when Minister, equated Marxists to subversives.  Do we see in this Bill part of a process of a government rather frightened of the future, as many western European Governments are because of increasing unemployment, uncontrollable inflation, falling living standards, <Col N="354" /> massive assaults on living standards by successive Governments and consequent industrial unrest and public dissatisfaction?  Is it a much more sinister proposal than <i>prima facie</i> it gives the impression?</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to believe that any Department has to come to the House stating that it was not possible to build such a prison for what I believe to be specious reasons, the fact that it was not possible to get a site.  Obviously, it is possible to get sites.  The entire of the centre of Ireland is available for sites. The most absurd feature of it all is that we have been told that it is not possible to get ordinary prison personnel in a designated building made secure&mdash;as Loughan House was in its way&mdash;for the detention of such prisoners.  There are plenty of high security prisons, unfortunately, all over Great Britain and the United States and I have no doubt that it would be possible to learn the techniques of high security prisons quickly to meet the needs of what I have no doubt are a difficult handful of people whom one necessarily finds in jail and who simply cannot come to terms with the appalling system of being in prison and all its humiliations.  There is no justification for the argument that it is not possible to have a high security institution staffed by trained personnel.  It must be possible to get a building for this purpose with people recruited for that purpose other than Army personnel.</P>
    <P>As other speakers have stated, no other western European country has a jail of this type run in this way.  That is a shocking admission for a country which protested when we were going into Europe that we would spread the gospel of our liberal attitudes to society, of our social attitudes and high moral values.  It is often said that we have no sense of humour, and I am prepared to believe it, that we can take ourselves and what we say seriously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Fundamentally, the reason for the Bill is one of accommodation. I realise that the immediate accommodation problem which led to the <Col N="355" /> original Act being passed in 1972 has been relieved and that now the facilities in the Curragh are being used for a different category of prisoner than was originally sent there when the legislation was first passed.  The accommodation, rather than being used to provide additional accommodation of an undifferentiated character, is now being used for a specific type of prisoner who cannot be kept in custody in proximity to other prisoners because of the danger to himself by the activities of other prisoners or the danger to the security of the prison by his activities among his colleagues.  Basically, it is still a problem of accommodation.  The facilities we have are not sufficiently adapted to meet the needs in question.</P>
      <P>In that context one can look at this Bill only against the background of the overall prison and courts policy which has led to the type and size of prison population now obtaining here.  I believe there are many people now in prison in this country who should not be in prison at all.  The reason they are there is that the only instrument available to a judge when dealing with a particular prisoner at present is the imposition of a fine&mdash;which in the case of a serious crime or of a person who has not the means of paying the fine is inappropriate&mdash;or of a prison sentence.  This lack of alternative instruments available to judges is the result of a failure by the Legislature to provide alternatives.</P>
      <P>I strongly believe that a judge should be afforded the opportunity, in deciding a particular case, for instance that a criminal, proven to be such, rather than go to jail be asked to work in the community and have a quarter or a half of whatever salary he earns devoted to making restitution to the victim of the crime.  By having this direct link between the person who committed the crime and the victim we would bring home much more fully to people who commit crimes, often of a casual nature under a fleeting emotion, the consequences in human terms of their act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, a man who, under the influence of drink, beats up somebody in <Col N="356" /> a fight will be much less likely to repeat it, much more likely to appreciate the gravity of what he has done if he remains in the community and has to do something to repair the damage done to the person he injured than if he is put into a prison and made associate with people who have committed far more serious crimes than he.  Indeed we all realise that our values are shaped very much by our peers.  If a person is put into a prison and his peers become other people who have committed criminal offences, possibly more serious than his, he will tend gradually to adopt the values which they have espoused in their longer prison careers and progressively will become a more hardened criminal than he was when first committed.  The aim of judges in dealing with people who have been convicted of crime should be as far as possible to find means of treating them in the community, by getting them to do productive work yielding a revenue which can be used to compensate the victims of their crime.</P>
    <P>We must also investigate the money that the present system is costing us.  In the last ten years the amount of money spent on prisons has increased by almost three times the amount being spent on the Garda Siochána, in law enforcement and crime prevention.  A system which is spending more and more money, which is absorbing more and more money which should be used on the prevention of crime clearly is one which should be examined and reformed.  The basic problem is that our judges do not have non-custodial treatment for offenders.  It should be quite a simple matter to enact legislation increasing the range of alternative treatments available to judges in deciding on the disposal of a person convicted of a given offence.  I believe quite strongly that the overall prison population could be reduced by up to 30 per cent if such alternatives were adopted.  If that were to happen there would be no need to use the Curragh and military means as a way of coping with the problem confronting the Minister.  The solution to this problem must be a two-pronged one, not one solely of simply providing more and better prisons but <Col N="357" /> much more, and more importantly, one of providing more and better alternatives to prisons to deal with the problems of offenders while still protecting the community.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister's predecessor, Senator Cooney, commenced research work when he was in office on alternative sanctions for criminals which could be made available to the Judiciary.  I should like the Minister to report on how far that work has progressed.  It is a very bad situation in which the amount of money being spent on prisons has increased three times as much as that being spent on the Garda Siochána in the last ten years.  That should not happen and we should endeavour to find other means of dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what exactly are the financial arrangements between the Departments of Defence and Justice in respect of the arrangements here?  Who is responsible for paying the costs?  What is the basis for any reimbursements that have to be made to the Department of Defence by the Department of Justice for the facilities being provided by the Department of Defence?  Does this reimbursement cover merely the personnel costs or does it include also an element of rental for an area in use?  Does it cover capital and maintenance costs of the prison?  I should like the Minister to let us know the overall cost to the Department of Justice of this facility since it was instituted. I should like the Minister also to give some information as to the relative cost of maintaining prisoners in this facility as against the cost of maintaining them in others within the purview of the Department of Justice.  This information should be available to us if we are to make a mature decision on this issue.</P>
    <P>I should like to have some information also on the extent to which the Department of Justice, and the Prisons Division within that Department, involve themselves in the day-to-day running of the facility.  Do they have the right to inspect it?  Do they inspect it frequently?  What <Col N="358" /> rights of access do they have to the facility, or is the matter solely within the competence of the Department of Defence?  Where there is a decision to be made about policy in respect of a particular prisoner within the facility&mdash;not involving his transfer to some other location&mdash;by whom is that decision made?  Who has the final word?  It would seem to me that where there are two Departments involved, if they are in an equal position and have different views, there is the possibility of deadlock.  I should like to know how a decision is finally arrived at, which Department take the final decision as to what is to be done with a particular prisoner.</P>
    <P>The Minister should make available to us also information on the use of drugs in this facility.  I realise that, in any form of psychiatric treatment, drugs have a part to play.  If there are prisoners with psychiatric problems, just as there are individuals in the community with psychiatric problems, in some cases the prescription of drugs is a part of an answer, not an answer in itself, to the solution of their problem.  In the case of people who are in custody there is a special duty on all of us to ensure that decisions are taken with due care.  We must all realise that, in the long run, drugs do not solve a problem as far as people are concerned.  They may restrict symptoms and help people on the road to a solution, but the final solution of a psychiatric problem is one more in the realm of psychology and motivation than any in the realm of behavioural change brought about by means of drugs.</P>
    <P>I believe that in the entire area of medicine there is far too much reliance on drugs as a means of coping with problems.</P>
    <P>Many of the problems, both of physical and mental illness, arising from the psychological condition of the individual could be treated more readily by somebody having the time to talk to that person and to try to understand his problem.  Unfortunately, very often those concerned do not have such time and the result is that a prisoner is given drugs to <Col N="359" /> keep him quite.  That would not be an appropriate method of dealing with people in custody and that is why the Minister should ensure that every means possible is adopted to resolve the problem of the difficult prisoner without having recourse to drugs.  In any case, drugs should not be used for dealing with people either in or out of custody without careful consideration being given to the prescribing of such drugs, but this careful consideration applies particularly in respect of people in custody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank all those Deputies who have contributed to the debate and to let them know that I have been pleased with the tone of the debate.  Their views will be on the record for anybody to read.  I have never said anything other than that I would like to see the prison at the Curragh closed.  Others have expressed the same sentiment and I hope that they were sincere in saying that.  However, for the first time, something is being done about the situation.</P>
      <P>It is not necessary for me to go into the background of the situation at the Curragh.  The detention centre there was set up following the riots in Mountjoy Prison when that institution was wrecked.  It has not yet been restored to what it should be.  Indeed, a lot more of the taxpayers' money must be spent in restoring it to the type of prison it should be.  A good deal of restoration work has been carried out to date, but the institution is much overcrowded.  Another aspect of the situation is the structural weakness of the building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Bill to provide for the setting up of the detention centre at the Curragh was introduced in 1972, the provision was for a two-year period. This was based on the belief, in good faith, that Mountjoy would be repaired and restored to what it had been within that time.  However, in 1974 my predecessor, Senator Cooney, found it necessary to come here and to tell the House that it was only after thorough examination of the damage that had been caused to the building that there <Col N="360" /> was a full realisation of the extent of the damage.  When restructuring work commenced the building was found to be in a much worse condition than was thought initially.  Consequently the then Minister sought an extension of the legislation for a further three years and the House agreed in an effort to help him in an extremely serious situation so far as the prison population were concerned.  At that time there was fresh thinking regarding the safe custody of subversive prisoners and Portlaoise Prison in which up to then long-term, or convict prisoners as they might be called, were detained was taken out of the ordinary prison system&mdash;a luxury that could not be afforded then but which was necessary in the interest of the security of the State <i>vis-à-vis</i> the very real threat that existed at the time.  In that way long-term prisoners were denied the type of accommodation which up to then had been considered necessary for them. These prisoners were removed to Mountjoy, an institution which was not suitable for such prisoners and which will probably never be suitable for them, but there was no place else in which to put them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bermingham queried, and rightly so, the position regarding Arbour Hill.  That prison has been extended and refurbished, but it still would not be suitable as a place of detention for the most disruptive type of prisoner.  This is the advice that has been given to me by the prison administration.  Arbour Hill is full to capacity.  But even if this were not the case it would not be suitable for the type of prisoners to which I have referred because they might find their way out easily.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Justice came into the House in 1977 there was a protracted debate, such as that which we had this afternoon from Deputy Keating&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Both Deputies Keating and Bermingham made a good case.  It was the type of case that I <Col N="361" /> should like to make and which could very easily be made.  But whatever plans the then Minister had between 1974 and 1977 to build a prison that would serve as an alternative to the institution at the Curragh, those plans never got under way.  I do not know the full story of what happened within the Government at the time but the outcome was that moneys were not made available to the Minister for the building of that alternative detention centre.  He was starved of money by the Government of which he was a member, and to that extent I was sorry for him.  If he had been allowed to make a start then the Curragh military prison would not be required now.  Deputies will find that during the course of my contribution to the debate which took place in April or May 1977 on this subject I made a similar comment.  I would not wish that in four years' time&mdash;though I shall hardly be Minister for Justice then&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am quite sure that whoever is Minister for Justice in four years' time will not want to come in here and ask for something that he knows is wrong because it is an unsuitable place and the people there are not being accommodated as they should be.  There should be no doubt in the mind of any Member of this House or of the Seanad but that something definite and concrete is being done now and Deputies will see, from the insert in my speech, that work has already started on the site.  I had a difficult task in securing moneys for this new prison which we are building down in Portlaoise but let me assure the House that if I do nothing else in the area of prisons&mdash;and I hope to do a lot of other things&mdash;I will see to it that the division of the Department of Justice dealing with prison construction will continue their work.  I compliment them on the work they have been doing and let me assure Deputy Keating that they are not a part of a tired administration.</P>

      <P>Everything possible will be done to get this new prison built, block upon block, with no obstacle coming in the way.  I have had meetings with my own people on a regular basis in relation to this.  I have had meetings and discussions with the people in the Office of Public Works and I have been pushing them as hard as anybody can push because unless we can say that we are doing something solid and definite about this then we deserve to be taken to task. In fairness to the Government there were many calls on them in recent months from different Ministries and every Department's problems are, to them, the most important problems.  But the Government recognised the case which I put and they agreed eventually to give me moneys to get started.  If my predecessor had been as lucky then as I have been now the greater part of this problem would no longer be with us. I will hold regular monthly meetings with those involved with this prison to satisfy myself that nothing is in any way slowing down the job we all want them to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="363" /> I am not going to talk about Plunkett Barracks.  We have had lots of comment on it, some of it ill-informed.  Deputy Browne was, through no fault of his own, confused about Plunkett Barracks. I, too, was confused about it when I was on that side of the House because the information coming across was very sketchy.  We did not know anything about Plunkett Barracks except what we read in the papers.  We did not know what it was for or how much it cost.  As far as I know now, nobody has been held or accommodated in Plunkett Barracks since it was built.  It was built for the Army for Army purposes and, despite impressions given at the time, it was never meant to be used as a detention centre or as a prison by the Department of Justice.  It is purely for Army purposes.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate the points made by Deputies about the difficulties for the military in running the Curragh.  They are not trained for that job.  I have heard all these arguments from them personally when I visited the Curragh.  I had discussions with them and if they had a choice they would opt out.  We have not got enough prison staff to run the prisons as they should be run.  But if I had enough staff or surplus staff I would readily suggest to the Minister for Defence that they should consider allowing prison officers to man the prison in the Curragh.  At the moment I am going all out to recruit prison staff.  There are shortages and we are trying to do something about them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bermingham knows, probably better than most, that the prison in the Curragh could accommodate many more than are there at present.  There are between 40 and 50 cells.  There are 27 people there at present and it is my intention to keep the numbers as low as possible because of the lack of facilities, because of the lack of space and because of the difficulties the military staff there experience in trying to run the institution and, of course, because of the very real difficulties for those who are held there.</P>
    <P>In Mountjoy at present we are doing <Col N="364" /> certain reconstruction work to provide a type of cell that would be better than the ordinary security cell there at present. With the administration of Mountjoy we went in great depth into the possibility of accommodating the prisoners from the Curragh there.  I am sure this would not work.  It is something I hoped we would be able to do but it was not possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton asked one or two questions.  One was about finances. Directly, there is no cost to the Department of Justice.  The costs at the Curragh are carried by the Department of Defence but the welfare service from the Department of Justice regularly visit the prison there.</P>

      <P>Yes.  That is what she told me today.  I am delighted that Deputy O'Brien gave us an opportunity to debate this motion.  This is a problem which is of deep concern to me.  One of the comments made by Deputy Desmond last night was that one should not be emotional when talking about vandalism or the problems being caused.  I am extremely emotional about this subject because, like Deputy O'Brien and Deputy Keating, I have a constituency where the people have suffered very badly at the hands of a very few thugs and gangsters who have been able to cock a snoot at the law for so long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advent of Loughan House did help to contain some of that element.  It has not been a popular cause to be in favour of by the media or by many social workers.  I assure the House, and through it the media, that it is a very popular cause with the people who are the recipients of the violence that has been inflicted upon them by this small band of hard-core juvenile delinquents.  I received a letter from a constituent of <Col N="367" /> mine which I should like to read because it reflects so much better than I could the call from the hearts of many people in our city today for some alleviation of their suffering.  That is very emotional language but as I said these are the people who are on the receiving end.</P>
    <P>Anybody reading the Official Report, or the papers tommorrow if this letter is reproduced, will recognise the sincerity of the person writing it.  I will not mention the name of the association because it would bring retaliation on some of its members by some of the young delinquents, aided and abetted by their fathers and older brothers in some cases.</P>
    <P>The letter states:</P>
    <P>Dear Mr. Briscoe,</P>
    <P>I have to write to you again in connection with vandalism and general lack of law and order in the area of </P>
    <P>She names here a particular corporation flats area.</P>
    <P>Over the past few months the law abiding citizens have found to their cost that there is no advantage in contacting the gardaí when a crime is seen to be committed.  The gardaí tell us they are undermanned and cannot respond to our calls any quicker than they do.  Even when these thugs are caught they appear back on the street immediately, because under the present system they either get bail, appeal, or get concurrent sentences for a number of offences, which means that the punishment by no means fits the crime.  You also have the ludicrous situation where some of these young thugs are let out for week-end &ldquo;holidays&rdquo; and immediately set about intimidating the old and infirm.</P>
    <P>At the moment it appears to the ordinary citizen that they in fact are the prisoners, while these thugs roam at will.  It is now extremely unwise for any resident or shop-keeper to leave their homes unattended in the evening, and it is nothing new for break-ins to occur in daylight.  In the last three to <Col N="368" /> four weeks the stolen car syndrome has appeared here also, and if they cannot get a squad car to chase them they simply crash into each other and then set fire to the cars.  It is only a matter of time before a serious tragedy occurs with so many children and old folk in the area.</P>
    <P>Lest you think that we have suddenly been invaded by a host of lawbreakers from other areas, let me tell you that 95 per cent of our problems are being caused by the members of three families and a couple of hangers on.</P>
    <P>Needless to say, all of this activity has lead to a number of applications to the corporation for transfers.  These are from residents of over 20 years standing who can no longer tolerate these conditions.  When these flats fall vacant the corporation tries to re-let them, but when the new tenants arrive to view the flats, mostly old people, they are intimidated by these same thugs, with the result that approximately 16 of the 60 flats are now inhabited by squatters and several of them are considered the personal property of the local &ldquo;Godfathers&rdquo;. They now play musical chairs moving around from flat to flat, so that under the present legislation there is no possible way for the corporation to dispossess them.</P>
    <P>As in other areas, it is a very small minority who are causing all this trouble and heartbreak, and it seems unbelievable that nothing can be done to contain them.</P>
    <P>As matters stand at the moment all faith has been lost in the gardaí, local representatives and the Government. </P>

We did get a special squad car, the famous wagon, put on for about a month but then it was needed somewhere else.  We will just have to get it back there again.</P>
      <P>The Garda are demoralised because very often the courts cannot sentence some of these perpetual wrongdoers because Loughan House cannot contain more than a very small number.  There is need for another institution similar to Loughan House.  I read in the newspapers some weeks ago where, I think it was District Justice Kennedy, said that in Ard Mhuire in Lusk they are terrorising the local people.  It is an open institution and they get out at night and terrorise the people.  There is a need for containment.</P>
      <P>I feel very frustrated because I love children and love to think that they can grow up in a country we can be proud of.  Only recently one of my constituents came to me.  She had been given a flat in one of these areas and while she was unpacking her few belongings she sent an eight-year old child out to get an ice cream.  The girl came back beaten up and the money stolen.  The woman would not take the flat even though it was in a very desirable area from the point of view of applications in Dublin.  I do not want to be emotional about this, but one can imagine the impact that had on the child.  I asked the woman if she would go back to that area and take another flat but she said no.</P>
      <P>In another area where most of the residents had already purchased their houses from the corporation a house became available recently.  All these people came with me to the housing department to plead with the head of the allocation section not to let a family with a long record of crime have the house. The corporation are not in the business of finding out the social record of applicants for houses, but they know their bad tenants and they know the families who need rehousing.  Sometimes by putting many of these families together an enormous problem can be created in an area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="370" /> We hear about children being punished and vandals committing crimes.  We are living in a society where all the emphasis is on the person who commits the crime and not on the victims and the people living in terror.  It has been said in this debate that the protection of the public peace should be the concern of all citizens and that they should help the Garda, but they dare not do that because if they do their windows will be broken, their houses may be set on fire or their families may be threatened.</P>
    <P>I was talking to a garda not too long ago and he told me he caught a 17 year old burglar in his house.  He thought of giving the young man a good beating in the hope that that might solve the problem, but he did not.  He brought him to court.  What did he get?  In spite of a string of previous convictions he was fined £5.  That garda's children could not walk in peace through their own neighbourhood because this young man got his pals to intimidate them.  There must be more facilities for the court to punish these perpetual offenders.  We must get to grips with this problem.  It is not a question of thousands of vandals. Our youth are grand people and most of them are the victims of a small group of thugs.</P>
    <P>We are told that if more amenities were provided there would not be so much vandalism, but these things will always happen because there will always be a certain group who will not join anything.  How many amenities in Deputy O'Brien's constituency have been burned down, vandalised and destroyed by such people?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the stolen car which killed three people.  He said he understood the 12½ year old boy's mother was joyriding in the car when the accident took place.  This bears witness to the fact that many parents are involved with these young gangsters.  There are a number of families in this city who are well known to the Garda.  These godfathers are reigning supreme.  I have the utmost confidence in the Garda because <Col N="371" /> they have a very difficult job to do but they need a better back-up service.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Brien admitted there was a need for Loughan House and the Minister said he did not like having to bring in Loughan House.  No one did but it was necessary.  From Deputy Eileen Desmond's remarks last night one comes to the conclusion that the Labour Party do not have a policy to tackle this kind of crime.  We are being told we cannot do this or we cannot do that to these children.</P>
    <P>A woman visited my clinic recently and asked me to make representations to have her son freed or sent elsewhere.  He and two other men had been sentenced to three years for a crime of violence.  I told her that because of the viciousness of the crime I did not feel inclined to do anything for him.  I said he should have got a good hiding from his parents when he was younger and she said her husband agreed with that.  Her husband said short, harsher sentences would be better than long sentences.  She said that the drink was to blame in her son's case.</P>
    <P>I admitted that when I was 16 or 17 I too had a few drinks with the lads, but we did not go out looking for people to rob and beat up.  We are being told that drink makes these people act in this way, but brutality is inherent in some of them. We have to try to break this vicious circle. Their parents' history is the same as theirs.  When these young people with a very low IQ have children the cycle will be repeated, and we have to break that cycle.</P>
    <P>Loughan House has turned out to be a great success.  In spite of the attempts of many inmates to wreck it, a number of boys have benefited from it and I hope some day we will hear from them. Loughan House was set up to contain the hard core vandals.  A possible solution to car ramming is for the Garda to adopt new methods to deal with this problem.  Perhaps they could get from the Army, painted blue with the Garda Síochána badge on it, an armoured personnel carrier capable of carrying 17 men, park it down a lane and let the vandals ram a car when they are around.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="372" /> These things happen simply because a few thugs are allowed into the streets.  I do not want to be emotional about this, but it is something that must be stamped out quickly.  There is need for more desperate measures if the situation is to be remedied.  If newspapers play up these crimes people are at it all over Dublin. The stolen car syndrome has reached my area.</P>
    <P>On the question of bail, the sooner the Minister brings in legislation to change the law in this respect the better.  Any crimes committed while people are on bail should be punished by longer sentences. I think this would help to reduce the crime rate.</P>
    <P>The solutions to this problem are long-term but we must also have short-term and intermediate remedies.  It has been said that more gardaí are needed in the streets.  We now have 1,500 more gardaí in the streets than last year but it does not seem to have made any impression on the crime rate.  Every time an arrest is made a man is taken off the beat to take the case to court.  What is needed is not more gardaí but the strict enforcement of the law, the tackling of small groups of families who are creating this problem.  These families in my area are well known to the Garda and if the Garda were allowed to take these families off the streets and put them away for three or four years there would be a great improvement.  However, the Garda are not getting the back-up in this respect and they are as frustrated as anybody else.</P>
    <P>Deputy Eileen Desmond referred to children committed to Loughan House and said they were supposed to be the greatest offenders.  They are not supposed to be the greatest offenders, they are known to be, with long lists of absconding from open centres.  These people cannot be contained anywhere. They are the people I referred to earlier. One of them coming out of the Children's Court in contempt threw a brick through the window of a Garda car and gave the usual well known sign at the gardaí and there was nothing they <Col N="373" /> could do about it.  Recently a constituent of mine was battered to death in the streets of our city, a particularly vicious crime.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the task force being increased to more than double their size.  I am glad to hear that and I should like to see a chief superintendent appointed to take over this work in relation to juvenile crimes. The JLO service is very good and those manning it do an excellent job.  They have a chief superintendent in charge. They do great work among young people and they deserve all the support and finance they need.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Brien last night rightly referred to unreported crimes.  People are fed up reporting crimes.  Therefore, statistics do not mean a thing.  People get rocks thrown through their windows every night and they have become fed up reporting it&mdash;they just put the window back and hope it does not happen the next night.  I suggest that somebody should be appointed to take charge of the fight against that kind of vandalism for at least six months or a year.  I should like to see better promotional possibilities for the JLOs.  They are dedicated people.  Society is too ready to expect dedicated gardaí in special branches to forego promotion opportunities in other branches of police work, and I suggest that special promotions or special recognition should be given to these people.  It might help to ease the present level of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeat that one of the most important methods of dealing with this kind of crime is to put away the small number of <Col N="374" /> families who are responsible for most of the crime.  I should like the Minister to get a breakdown from the Commissioner in regard to the families who create the problem in each area.  The Minister should get a figure of the percentage of crimes that could be attributed in that way.  If he gets the figures the Minister will see that there is no need to recruit another 10,000 gardaí.  A garda to whom I spoke recently said that putting away such families would be like soaking up water with a sponge.</P>
    <P>When speaking about the number of gardaí on the beat I can assure the House that very few gardaí would go into some of the areas in my constituency about which I have been talking. If they did I do not think there is an insurance company in the world that would give them insurance.</P>
    <P>In this connection we always hear about deprived families.  About 99 per cent of our people have been deprived in one way or another sometime in their lives.  This is a country of self-made people. Since we achieved independence our people have been learning how to stand on their feet.  Yesterday I spoke to a man who works a little bit of land in Crumlin&mdash;I suppose Deputies did not know there is land in Crumlin.  He educated one daughter to become a barrister and another is doing another degree course.  He is in market gardening and time and again he has seen his greenhouses smashed.  He is coming to the end of his tether.  Any money he has made he has put to the education of his children.  Most people in this country have come from poor backgrounds and we can be proud of the opportunities that are given to our people to get on.</P>
    <P>There is need to support the Minister in the work he is doing in this area.  I should like to see Labour Party Deputies getting properly to grips with this problem.  I should like to see them going through their constituencies and talking to the people there because they seem to be opposed to giving protection to the victims of crime.  For instance, they have a motion on the Order Paper condemning Loughan House.  Loughan House <Col N="375" /> has been doing satisfactory work.  The tragedy is there are not enough places there.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I repeat that we should be giving more legislative backing to the Garda and we need a change in the law in regard to bail.  The gardaí should be able to go in and get the families who are making life hell for other residents in flat complexes.  If we could do things like that we would get rid of the problem in a short time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate affords us an opportunity of discussing an issue which is of great concern to many people at present and I should like to support the general sentiments of the previous speakers from my own party in that regard.  I shall try not to repeat what has already been put on the record, but will add one or two things.</P>
      <P>It would be simplistic to extract, as it were, the problem of juvenile crime and see it in isolation.  There is no doubt that it is a real problem.  It would be wrong, however, if we believed that a simplistic, reactionary in the literal sense of that word, response was all that was necessary.  The truth is that violence is endemic in the age in which we live.  It surrounds us, permeates our way of life and undoubtedly influences very many of the actions of many people.  We must make up our minds that violence is anti-social and anti-human and should be combated.  I am mindful, as the father of two very young children&mdash;one four-and-a-half years of age&mdash;that I am increasingly having to explain the violence which is presented on the television, through the media, or on the streets to these innocent minds.  I am often saddened by the thought that so many young people do not understand even the violence that we portray as entertainment&mdash;a plethora of superfluous and trivial alleged entertainment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not bear in mind any longer the significance of somebody pointing even the image of a gun at somebody else's head.  These are images which daily confront young people and adults.  We have come to accept that this idea is part and <Col N="376" /> parcel of life.  There will be those who say that it has not been scientifically proven that television, for example, affects people.  That is nonsense.  The reason why advertisers spend millions of pounds honing the science of advertising to a fine art is that any communication influences people.  It would be trite and erroneous to imply that commercial advertising influences and other material does not.</P>
    <P>Violence begets violence and we have violence all about us.  The problem of juvenile crime, delinquency, and vandalism, which is the essence of this motion, is much wider than building sufficient security detention centres and locking up young people in them.  The area I represent&mdash;North Central Dublin&mdash;has had more than its fair share of adverse comment in this regard. Some effort should be made to redress the balance, even if only in a sentence or two.  The reality is that when you pack 6,000 people into a street and deprive them of the normal facilities which any community in any part of rural Ireland would expect as part and parcel of a townland, you are creating a recipe for trouble, to put it mildly.  I am very impressed by the fact that so many people live such decent lives under such terrible conditions.  I have no doubt that if I were living in those conditions I would not be able to compete and succeed as well as so many of these people have under the extraordinary conditions.  Most of us in this House have no idea what some people have to live with.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that we should excuse all crime as having a social, or even a genetic, origin and being therefore somehow less offensive.  It is profoundly shocking for old people to be terrorised. In parts of Dublin city at present the windows and balconies of people's flats are covered up with plastic and so on to stop interference, tampering and the rest of it.  People are living in some cases in islands of fear, often cut off from normal community life, afraid to go out.  I met one lady&mdash;I do not know if it was purely due to this reason or not&mdash;who had not been out of her third floor flat for 13 <Col N="377" /> years.  A flat, by the way, would be one room.  I do not know how anyone stays sane in those conditions.  I have great admiration for the gritty character of the average person in urban Ireland who will put up with the trauma of an environment which is truly stripped of any of those elements of civilisation which we consider normal or desirable.</P>
    <P>We can draw a lesson from one instance. We all remember the Pope's visit to this country.  During that visit he drove through the streets of part of my own area&mdash;not because it is my own area, I hasten to add, but because it was portrayed to him as being an area which had particular problems and which he should perhaps visit.  On that occasion, the reception given to him was rapturous and the preparations were very magnificent in every sense.  The young people there were very involved in the erection of an altar on the main street which was painted in the papal colours, bright yellow and white.  A picture was erected, along with a vase of flowers.  To this day, which is some six or seven months later, not one element of that altar has been interferred with or tampered with in any way.  No graffiti has appeared and the picture has not been taken down.</P>
    <P>If there is a real investment of resources, of love, of interest, of political commitment in people, they will respond. There will always be the incorrigible few who for one reason or another will not be able to mesh into that responsive framework and to whom a different approach may be necessary.  We should not baulk at creating the institutions and framework in which these young thugs in some cases will have to try to rediscover the right way to live, if that is not too arrogant a phrase to use.  It is our obligation, while this process of resource and commitment is going on, to ensure the protection of individuals.  Nobody in this House, and certainly not the Minister, can believe that he has anything less than the full support of every Deputy in so doing.  It is absolutely vital that we restore our cities and towns to normality, so that people can live <Col N="378" /> without fear, go out to visit their neighbours at night and their young children can walk down the street at night without being molested.</P>
    <P>The reality is that young people causing this crime are only a symptom, which is why the often simplistic and hysterical talk is too easy and too trite. They are not the beginnings of the problem, but the end.  We should focus at least as much attention on the beginning as on the end.  It is easy to do it the other way and it has short-term expedient, political popularity connotations associated with it.  That may be, but I think people are more intelligent and more far-seeing than we in this House often give them credit for being.  This balanced, rational, level-headed, sensible approach based on the twin concern of protecting people and ensuring their security, and at the same time analysing and realising the basic roots of the problem and responding on that level also, is the way to go about it.</P>
    <P>The efforts of the Garda, local clergy, who are doing enormous work, local community workers, who are similarly doing extensive work in these areas and, particularly, the members of the juvenile liaison officer scheme of the Garda Síochána, are all to be commended.  I was pleased to note the expansion of the JLO scheme involving both the Commissioner of the Garda and the Minister for Justice.  That is the right approach, the preventative approach which really says that one pound of prevention is worth a thousand pounds of cure.</P>
    <P>In regard to some of the items referred to by Deputy Briscoe, I have doubts about the rightness of the approach.  I candidly and honestly believe that the only way we will ultimately make major onslaughts on crime in our community, which after all is no more than a continuum of other communities around the world in the context of a global village, shrinking daily by means of growing media communication, international travel, international influence and so on, is by creating the right kind of values in our society, the values of caring and sharing, of mutual affection and compassion, <Col N="379" /> of neighbourhood community, of limiting the size of cities, of analysing the roots of urban sprawl and seeing the damage it does.  All of these things come into it.  How can we expect, as we do, a mother of six children to rear them in one room, with a television set in one corner, a child crying in a pram in another corner and perhaps a husband who cannot cope with all the problems drunk in the third corner?  From my experience as a teacher, I know the problems of teaching in such a situation. Even if the children in the beginning are encouraged to go to school they cannot compete there.  In some cases they go to school unfed.  I should like to place on record my admiration for the work of the School Attendance Department of Dublin Corporation and, in particular, the Chief School Attendance Officer, Brian Doolin.  He has commented on many occasions on the number of children who go to school daily without a breakfast.</P>
    <P>It is too easy for us, adult well-fed males to get up here and hammer those children when they go wrong.  Let us make an effort to get rid of those situations that diminish the dignity of the individual, which deprive him of equality of opportunity, which strip him of all the possibilities and potentialities that our children have and that we wish for them.  Let us have the courage to face that kind of challenge.  Many young people at the moment do not have a goal. The values we put forward for them are largely acquisitive, monetary and materialistic and they find them shallow. There is a great possibility of creating a kind of &ldquo;peace corps&rdquo;&mdash;something analogous to what was set up in the Kennedy era in the United States when Sargent Shriver formed such a corps for international work.  I see no reason why that kind of principle could not be used here, utilising the goodwill and altruism of young people.  They should be involved in a campaign to recreate an environment in our cities that would be beneficial to all.</P>
    <P>In terms of tackling crime it is not a question of &ldquo;us&rdquo; and &ldquo;them&rdquo;; it is a <Col N="380" /> question of all of us working together. We must try to lead people out of darkness, isolation and alienation rather than locking up people and throwing away the key.  This is a major challenge where we could find again a new spirit, where we could apply ourselves with energy and where we could get a response from people.  We hope the Minister will listen to the increasing need to respond to this problem.</P>
    <P>As this is my first opportunity to do so, I congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of Justice.  I wish him every success and happiness in his job.  I hope his efforts in the Department will be crowned with success and I hope all of us will give him the necessary support in his work.  So long as we keep a balance in mind, so long as we do not get sucked into some hysterical reaction too often ill founded for a reaction to trends that sometimes are more apparent than real, we will be doing a worthwhile job.  However, we should not ignore the basic challenge which is about the kind of society we have.  Therefore, we should see crime as a symptom rather than a basic disease.  Nobody would be justified in diminishing the gravity of the situation at the moment.  It is a major challenge. Let us hope that together we can bring about improvements in social, economic and cultural aspects.  This will be necessary if we are going to have a meaningful and profound change so that the ugliness, the sordidness and the violence of the age will give way to an era of peace, harmony and stability where everyone has the right to be fulfilled and to have a place in the sun.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to associate myself with the remarks of Deputy Keating in relation to the appointment of the Minister of State at the Department of Justice.  I wish him well in his onerous task.  He can rest assured that his efforts to amend existing legislation or to introduce new legislation for the furtherance of these worth-while aims will get the wholehearted support of this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a former member of the Garda Síochána, the present Minister of State <Col N="381" /> at the Department of Justice is only too well aware of the kind of information needed to amend legislation in connection with the motion before the House.  It is indicative of the change in Irish society that this House should have to debate a motion that deplores the increase in violence and vandalism in urban areas and that this party have had to call on the Government to introduce positive and comprehensive plans to eradicate this growing problem.  As a result of changes in our society, we now find ourselves not able to cherish all the children equally as was envisaged in our Constitution.  It is fair to say our country has come a long way from the vision of the founder of Fianna Fáil who spoke of &ldquo;a land of comely maidens and athletic youths&rdquo;.  That vision has not materialised.</P>
    <P>Last week a former special counsel to a former President of the United States was in this country.  He spoke of the tendency in the United States to incarcerate too many people.  Since his rise and fall from the heights to the depths and his subsequent imprisonment, he became aware of the stigma in the United States attached to prisons.  As a result of that he became involved in the Christian Leadership and Prison Fellowship Foundation and now he travels the world lecturing on the evils of incarceration.  His theme here was that if this country does not become aware quickly of the increasing crime and do something about it, within the next ten or 15 years we will be forced to include in our budgets amounts of money to provide further places of detention such as Loughan House and the proposed institution at Lusk.  These places never have solved and will not solve the problem entirely even though it is fair to say there will always be people in any country who will need custodial care of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>I remember as a working student in New York going into Central Park and speaking to a young police officer who was literally armed to the teeth with his revolver and radio and every piece of police equipment he could have, including on a chain on his left hand, a <Col N="382" /> killer alsatian.  In his right hand he held a whip.  These people were trained to shoot first and ask questions afterwards.  I do not envisage that type of situation ever arising here.  I hope we would not deteriorate to that extent in the scale of human deprivation.  That was some years ago and since then there has been a dramatic change even in that most socially deprived part of the world, where the people themselves closed that park at weekends and took to walking in the only open spaces provided for them. The crime rate in that area dropped substantially because people in their own city decided to use the space available to them.  That is in a different context to what is happening in this city.  But it makes a point that people themselves can have a dramatic influence on the levels of crime in the cities in which they live.</P>
    <P>The media which pump out so many million pounds worth of propaganda into our homes every evening from different parts of the world with a variety of so-called entertainment in some cases can play an effective part.  At that time some years ago there was a very popular motion picture called &ldquo;Death Wish&rdquo; which described the efforts of an individual vigilante to wreak revenge on some offenders in this city in the US.  The reaction of the American people was one of adulation.  The national news media interviewed people in the streets asking for their views as to whether the theme of the individual vigilante being set up in different cities and extended to groups should be adopted in order to combat crime.  It showed that people from what might be called middle or upper class areas had a basic fear of people coming from socially deprived centres.  The greatest fear we have is the fear of the unknown.  If they are afraid to meet them, speak to them and work with them on their own ground, channels of communication are never really opened and this great problem can never be really solved.</P>
    <P>Areas in our own city here in Dublin where there are young people who are not cherished equally with others in the <Col N="383" /> country are breeding grounds for depression and frustration and for the release of enormous amounts of aggression, when such young people from their cradle days see the outside world as presented to them in glossy magazines and on television.  The result of all that is that in areas where the father is possibly an alcoholic and the mother never properly trained to raise a family, from the earliest days these people have an in-built aggression towards what they call &ldquo;Them&rdquo;.  This leads to an &ldquo;Us&rdquo; and &ldquo;Them&rdquo; situation which is not being tackled.  The rising crime and vandalism rate will not be properly tackled until the &ldquo;Us&rdquo; and &ldquo;Them&rdquo; situation is eliminated.</P>
    <P>The symptoms of violence and vandalism evident in this city are not really an expression of the whole situation but only one aspect of it which results from the inbuilt frustration and depression caused by changes and different levels in our society.  Even in the most socially deprived centres in our cities we have people who are very rich in spirit who, if given the chance, can make a tremendous impact on their local communities. The vandalism taking place is not an expression of the whole problem but rather a symptom of something radically wrong, a symptom that will grow and develop unless necessary action is taken. It is fine for politicians to speak here in cliches about short-term, medium-term and long-term problems, crisis situations and so on but the vast majority here do not have to go into tenements where many have to live their daily lives and do not have to experience the very close and cramped living quarters existing there. They do not have the inbuilt fear shared by many of our very young and very old people of being robbed or assaulted.  It is easy to speak here of these things from a distance.  Again, it is an &ldquo;Us&rdquo; and &ldquo;Them&rdquo; situation; they are out there and we are in here and this is the place where the finance is voted, where laws are made or amended.  Unless these people see actual change on the ground it will always be an &ldquo;Us&rdquo; and &ldquo;Them&rdquo; situation for them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="384" /> The very real problems these people experience in their daily lives must be seen to be believed and many Members of this House have not had that experience. Deputy O'Brien, representing the inner city area of Dublin, probably has more experience than most of us in this field and his views should be seriously considered.  How many young people in the heart of the inner city have actually heard the swish of a hurley in wet grass or the thump of a football on a football field on a summer evening? How many of them have felt and know what it is like to work in the field with and against the forces of nature?  If many of Dublin's young people were brought from the heart of the city to regions in the west even for short periods to show them what it is like, what actual physical, productive work is like it would have a major influence on their minds and their feelings.  It would be a new experience for them.</P>
    <P>It appears that the allocation of houses in the inner city area through the years has not, by and large been carried out successfully.  If you house people who have already failed altogether it is logical to assume that the total plan will also fail.  That does not say that you have not people in these areas very rich in spirit who can have a great influence on the development and progress of their communities.  Changing people from inner city areas to places like Ballymun does not solve the problem but probably makes it worse in that the extent of crime and aggression can rise.  It seems there are very few statistics available on the actual number of people who are not being catered for by the law in this respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Brien and all Deputies who represent the inner city areas experience through their constituency work the actual problems their people face and perhaps it is in order to suggest, and it might be worth bearing in mind that we should have an Oireachtas committee on youth affairs or youth problems specifically because the growing problem of vandalism and the increasing crime rate warrant progressive legislation.  The views, experience, wisdom and ideas of <Col N="385" /> those in this House who have worked in these areas through the years should not be forgotten or go to waste but taken in conjunction with the views of welfare officers, youth groups and social workers who work in the deprived areas could possibly enable us to come to an agreement that something positive and comprehensive could be done.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister for Justice said that parents and schools could do more. We can all agree with those sentiments. The basic idea behind any school is that it should be an extension of the home.  If any teacher in any school finds that the school is not an extension of the home then he or she is simply wasting time trying to impose discipline on a set of pupils who do not want it, have never understood it and have never felt it. Teaching from that point of view is not a success.  The school begins in the home and parents have a moral duty to impose the necessary discipline on their children and to bring them up in a proper, decent manner, and if parents have failed in that respect it is difficult for the children themselves to grow into a lifestyle that is proper, decent and far removed from the vandalism and violence into which so many of them drift.  It is all right to speak of Loughan House and the detention centre at Lusk, but probably many of the young offenders who go in there know more about crime and vandalism when they come out than before they went in because they learn from their comrades&mdash;or compatriots if they may be so called&mdash;in those centres of things that possibly they did not know before they went in.</P>
    <P>I have always believed in work and it might be worth bearing in mind that possibly many of the victims of these crimes are also believers in work and restitution.  Perhaps something could be worked out in the area of getting these young offenders some sort of work either in the country or the city whereby part of the income accrued from that could be paid back in restitution to the people who were victims of the crime in the first place.  Thereby the victim of a crime would be satisfied to a certain extent and <Col N="386" /> a great social need would be fulfilled in that the young offender would experience the value of the physical fatigue that comes from a good day's work.  If that were to happen, you would not have to the same extent the in-built aggression released in the shape of violence and vandalism on the streets of our cities.  We will always have detention centres and there will always be people who will need custodial care, but God forbid that we have a rash of them as the result of negligence on the part of any Government. If ever collective responsibility comes into being, this is an area that we should take up very seriously indeed.  It is all right to speak of short-term, long-term and medium-term solutions, but unless we do something in the short term it is more than likely that the problem will get worse.  There are people in this country pedding drugs and young people are being drawn increasingly towards that and other related and very dangerous areas, and it seems as if we have not the forces and the necessary equipment to carry out remedial and educational measures and, in some cases, the proper legalising of all of these items, or to bring to the understanding of these young offenders what exactly is involved.</P>
    <P>The housing, education and work needs of many of our young people are neglected totally.  As I have said, it is very difficult for teachers to teach in schools to a decent level or to the level of professional training when the school is not in any way related to the situation in the tenements from which some of these people come through no fault of their own.  An indication of the fear and basic mistrust that many of our employers have is that they will not accept the capacity for work and the character of many of the young people coming from these areas.  Although they might be qualified for certain positions, simply because of their address they are not acceptable. Surely that is a terrible indictment on our society, on an any Government in office and on all of us.  A person may be as capable if not more capable than people coming from a different area <Col N="387" /> who apply for the same position, but yet is denied the right to work.  Social workers send a young pupil from such an area to do an AnCO course and then find that, having fulfilled the course, that young person is not acceptable in the employment for which he or she is trained.  That that should happen in 1980 is an indictment on all of us.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment refers to the support given to the Garda Síochána in the measures they are taking to deal with the situation and I am glad that the amendment was phrased in the words &ldquo;to deal with the situation&rdquo;.  I feared at first that it would read, &ldquo;to combat the situation&rdquo;.  Had that been the case it would have been a clear indication of Government thinking in that it was really a case of us against them, a situation of war within our inner cities.  You could move all the gardaí into the deprived areas of our cities and still they would not solve this problem.  The sight of a Garda uniform is a deterrent in itself. It should instil a sense of discipline and of respect for people, property and places.  In the main that does happen but in these socially deprived areas where this aggression is in-built and is being released as a symptom of this sickness in our society, all of the gardaí put together possibly could stop temporarily this increase in crime and vandalism but that would by no means get to the root of the evil or solve the problem.  It is said that money is the root of all evil.  It is probably true also that lack of money is the root of the greatest evil.  The Government should think seriously about setting up an all-party committee to consider injecting the necessary finance through the Estimates into worth-while schemes for the proper training and rehabilitation of our young people in these areas and instilling into them a sense of respect, giving them something fulfilling to work for and something to strive for to give them a goal in life.  We should at the same time educate our employers and instil in them the confidence to take on these young people after they have gone through the necessary training programmes and fulfilled the qualifications in that respect. <Col N="388" /> There is much to be done in the area of social services and innovative education, in the area of community health, mental health, research, child care, geriatric services, maintenance services and environmental maintenance.  All of these things need to be looked into in relation to this motion.</P>
    <P>The Garda spend a lot of their time chasing after vandals and thugs but that does not solve the basic problem and it never will.  We should be concerned about crossing all borders especially in relation to sport.  That is something which has come to a head on a major scale with the Olympic Games, but it is a fact that in many deprived areas the beginnings of understanding, of a sense of discipline, of a sense of team work and of respect for people, places and things starts in a planned programme on the sporting field.  This should be encouraged in the youth encounter projects and in the Department of Education projects. The Minister for Finance recently announced the allocation of certain moneys for leisure centres and sports complexes and this is worthwhile.  These facilities are needed in many parts of the country but in any area that is socially deprived, they can mean the beginning of understanding and respect for people and things.</P>
    <P>This motion got the priority it deserves in so far as it has been debated in the House.  I trust that the Minister will see to it that positive and comprehensive action is taken on foot of this motion so that it will not die as so many other motions have died.  If not, it will be seen as an indictment not alone of the Government but of all politicians who have failed in their efforts to have this socially important motion dealt with in the manner it should be dealt with.  If the necessary programmes are implemented and followed through, by the year 2000&mdash;and it will easily take that long to get the situation under control&mdash;we will find ourselves in an entirely different situation.  If we do not implement these programmes, I would not forecast the type of society we will have by the turn of the century, if our present situation <Col N="389" /> continues at the alarming rate it has continued over the past number of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I must draw the attention of the House to the lack of commitment by the Government to this motion. The Government have put down an amendment:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;aware of the problems posed by acts of violence and vandalism in urban areas fully supports the Garda Síochána in the measures they are taking to deal with the situation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is not facing up to their responsibilities. This is a shoddy amendment.  I did not attack it last night because I hoped that the Minister in his reply would come up with some concrete proposals.  The Minister did not come up with any and tended to clap himself on the back for most of the night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course we support the Garda.  That is why we put down this motion.  I would ask the Minister and the Government to support the Garda.  We are concerned about what is going on in the area of crime and vandalism.  The Inspector's and Sergeant's Association of the Garda Síochána reported to the Minister as to how to deal with this problem, so it is not good enough for the Minister to come into the House and put down a meaningless amendment like this asking us to support the Garda.  That goes without saying.  I want a commitment <Col N="390" /> from the Government that they will do the job.  We got no clear indication from the Minister that any further steps will be taken to deal with this problem.  Despite the best efforts of the Garda crime is on the increase and the Garda are not happy with the situation.  If the Minister had said last night that he would examine in detail and broadly accept the report from the Inspector's and Sergeant's Association I would have been satisfied and I would not be here tonight to attack.  I am totally dissatisfied with the way the Government have handled this motion.  They are showing no will to tackle this serious problem.</P>
    <P>I suggested short-term and long-term solutions.  In the long term I asked for better educational facilities, better housing, better job creation policies, job experience schemes and so on.  The inner city report in the area of crime and violence suggests that education, housing and job opportunities are very important. If we are going to tackle the long-term problem we must tackle it in these areas.  The Minister did not mention this and is apparently unconcerned about it. The Minister talked about the additional gardaí in the force today.  That is a statistic that looks good on paper but it does not deal with the problem.  The Minister responsible for the garda should support them when they are now for the first time looking for help and putting forward proposals which should be listened to as they are the experts in this area and their point of view should be respected and acted upon, but no.</P>
    <P>I suggested last night that this was not the time for emotional speeches or for scoring points.  I thought this motion would be taken seriously by the Minister and the Government.  To my surprise, last night the Minister rounded on this side of the House, and on Deputy Eileen Desmond who had not spoken at the time, in a defensive manner.  He had spoken for about 25 minutes and he had not come up with any solutions.  He was not prepared to talk in the long-term or in the short-term.</P>
    <P>It is sad to think of the high level of vandalism in our cities today.  There was <Col N="391" /> a hope that there might be a decrease in that level, but the Commissioner of the Garda feels that is being optimistic.  As I said, a number of crimes are not being reported.  People feel so frustrated that we are not getting the facts.  If we do not take action, our cities will become places which people cannot enjoy.  We must take the necessary measures suggested by the Garda and give them the necessary tools to do the job as soon as possible.  We must ensure that our elderly people, our infirm people, our young people and people in general can walk the streets in safetyso that we can be proud of our cities and welcome our visitors.  When we reach the point where people cannot walk the streets in safety, it is time for us to take our responsibilities very seriously, instead of the Government putting down meaningless amendments to try to score political points.</P>
    <P>This type of motion does not deserve to be treated with cheap petty contempt, as I would call it, by the Government Having listened to the Minister for half an hour last night, I do not see any hope in this area.  I heard that there are task forces in particular Garda stations in the city and they are doing a good job.  They may have to be withdrawn because of lack of finance.  Even while they are there we can see the problems but, if they are withdrawn, the problems will increase.</P>
    <P>They should be augumented and increased and every facility should be given to them.  It is my information that this is not the case, and that we cannot look forward to an increase in their activities. I have no doubt this is why the Sergeant's and Inspector's Association are so concerned.  They are in the middle of it.  They have to risk their lives.  It is time the Minister took his responsibilities seriously and supported the Garda Síochána as suggested in his amendment.  If the Minister lived up to his own amendment and gave the Garda what they require to do the job I could see some hope.  I do not see any hope at the moment.  That is a sad thing to say.</P>
    <P>I represent an inner city constituency <Col N="392" /> and I see the problems from day to day. I see the fortresses people have to build around their homes to try to protect themselves.  That is a fact of life and we are all aware of it.  I put down this motion in the hope of hearing the Minister coming up with new ideas and giving a firm indication that he would tackle these problems once and for all and deal with them effectively.  That is not being done.  All he is doing is paying lip service to an amendment which he is not prepared to accept himself.</P>
    <P>I am angry at the dishonest way in which this motion has been treated by the Minister.  The people will judge the Minister and the Government for the contempt they have shown.  They cannot take any more and the Minister and his Department know that.  The cry for help is there.  Why not give it?  If this goes on much longer the thugs, the vandals and the marauding mobs will have taken over our cities because the Government have not the moral courage to take them on and put them down.</P>
    <P>To come back to the long-term solution, I want to see a commitment by the Government to this report by the interdepartmental committee which was set up by the Government but which is now being cast aside like an old boot.  The messages are loud and clear in this report: better housing, better education, better job opportunities, a better environment and development of communities. These are the solutions in the long-term.</P>

We do not want lectures or motions or amendments about supporting the Garda.  Our record is there I want the Minister to support the Garda.  I want him to support the inspectors and sergeants.</P>

    <P>To assist the teacher in understanding the root causes of the child's problem we would recommend the following:</P>
    <P> 1.  That a complete profile of the child is built up in a records system designed to show relevant aspects of the social, educational and medical background of the individual child.  Appropriate financial resources should be allocated to schools for this purpose.</P>
    <P>2.  In the case of a child displaying disruptive tendencies there must be consultation with the parents.</P>
    <P>3.  Class teachers and year teachers should be allocated time-tabled time ex-quota for the purpose of pastoral work, and guidance teachers should be provided in each school.</P>
    <P>4.  That where a child has specific difficulties in literacy and numeracy, that an adequate remedial and guidance service is present in the school.  It should be noted that the failure to have remedial teachers outside the quota is a hindrance to the proper development of such a system.</P>
    <P>5.  For children who are deemed remedial, syllabii and texts should be developed which would meet their own particular needs.  Attempts to fit these pupils into academic and examorientated courses leads only to frustration and tension on the part of both pupils and teachers.  Considering the numbers of pupils in this category&mdash;20 per cent of all first year students&mdash;and the imbalance of these students in <Col N="296" /> Vocational Schools, as a union, we condemn the limited resources allocated to this sector by the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>6.  Where referred by a Department psychologist, children who have severe emotional disturbances or behavioural problems, should have available to them special facilities or non-residential schools where they could be given short to medium term specialist care. </P>
    <P>We believe that if the proposals outlined were implemented, then we would be progressing towards a school environment in which the incidence of aggressive behaviour would be curtailed and contained in a manner conducive to the educational development of the individual child.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit for four separate periods between December 1979 and April 1980.  Before payment could be authorised it was necessary to have inquiries made as to the number of contributions paid in respect of her in the 1978-79 contribution year, which governed her entitlement to benefit.</P>
      <P>It was established that she had a total of 29 paid contribution and 23 credited contribution in the 1978-79 contribution year and payment has accordingly been made to her at the maximum rate of disability benefit applicable to a married woman in respect of these claims.</P>
      <P>The person's entitlement to pay-related benefit is being examined and any payment due will issue as soon as the necessary inquiries are completed.</P>

      <P>The social welfare officer who investigated this case and recommended that no pension be paid on the grounds that the claimant's means exceed the statutory limit, has appealed against the local pension committee's decision to award full pension from 27 October 1978.</P>
      <P>The appeal will be referred to an appeals officer as soon as my Department have been informed that the deed of transfer of the claimant's holding has been stamped.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to a question with a similar background last week, appeals officers, who are the final deciding authority in relation to claims to non-contributory pensions, normally require that a deed of transfer of land should be stamped before accepting it for the purpose of a claim.</P>
      <P>In view, however, of the delays which can occur between signing and stamping I am having administrative procedures examined with a view to determining whether it is possible to expedite such payments.</P>

      <P>The person concerned submitted a claim for disability benefit on 28 January 1980 in respect of an incapacity <Col N="298" /> from July 1979 to December 1979.  According to medical evidence received, she appeared to be suffering from an occupational disease.</P>
      <P>The relevant regulations provide that a claim for benefit must be made within 21 days of the commencement of incapacity. However, following inquiries regarding the delay in making the claim it was accepted that there was good cause for the delay in this case.</P>
      <P>A medical examination of the claimant was carried out on 2 April 1980. As a result of this examination it was accepted that the incapacity arose from the claimant's employment and it was decided, therefore, to treat the claim as a claim for benefit under the Occupational Injuries Acts.  A cheque in payment of injury benefit due for the period up to 17 December 1979 has issued.</P>
      <P>The claimant's entitlement to pay-related benefit is being examined and any payment due will issue as soon as the necessary inquiries have been completed. In the meantime she has also received payment of maternity allowance with effect from 31 March 1980.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has not claimed unemployment benefit from my Department.  A claim for maternity allowance in respect of a confinement expected on 22 March 1980 was received from her on 6 February 1980. The claim was admitted from 11 February, 1980, the commencement of the sixth week before the end of the week of expected confinement, which is the earliest date from which the allowance can be paid.  Payment of maternity allowance and pay-related benefit was made to 29 March when, in accordance with the normal practice, payment was suspended pending receipt of notification of the date of confinement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On receipt of a certificate indicating <Col N="299" /> that the confinement had taken place on 31 March 1980, a cheque in payment of maternity allowance and pay-related benefit for the period up to 26 April 1980 was issued on 22 April 1980.  Payment will continue up to 17 May 1980 when her entitlement to maternity allowance ceases.</P>
    <P>Two maternity grants, on her own and her husband's insurance, have also been paid.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 23 December 1978 and was paid regularly each week in advance subject to the receipt of monthly medical certificates of incapacity. Payment continued to 16 February 1980 but was discontinued from that date as his doctor had certified him fit to resume work on 4 February 1980.</P>
      <P>He subsequently submitted a medical certificate dated 22 February 1980 indicating that he was again unfit for work.  In view of the earlier certificate of fitness to resume work payment could not be made until further medical evidence establishing a period of continuing incapacity had been received.  He was advised accordingly and the additional medical evidence required was received on 24 April 1980.  Payment of disability benefit for the period from 17 February 1980 to 3 May 1980, less the one week previously overpaid, has now been issued to him.  He had actually resumed employment for that week and was accordingly not entitled to payment in respect of it.</P>
