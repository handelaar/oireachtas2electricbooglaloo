    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach in relation to section 5 of form A of the Census of Ireland 1979, if he will define the term &ldquo;other status&rdquo; in item 5 of the section relating to marital status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Moore) Séan Moore">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Moore)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the 1979 census householders were requested to answer the question on marital status in terms of their present legal status.  The <Col N="1328" /> term &ldquo;Other Status&rdquo;, to which the Deputy refers, was included to provide an appropriate category for persons who had obtained a divorce in another country and whose legal marital status would not therefore be covered by the categories of single, married or widowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the term &ldquo;other status&rdquo; therefore confined to divorced persons?  Where does the section relative to persons who are separated and persons who are cohabiting exist on that form?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It refers to couples or people who have obtained a divorce in another country only.  It is the legal status we are dealing with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The other sections relate to persons who are married, widowed or single.  Is the Minister of State suggesting that only those persons who are divorced come under the category of &ldquo;other status&rdquo; as he indicated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Where do persons who are separated or persons who are cohabiting give an indication on the census form as to their status?  Why is the Minister not honest enough to put those separate categories in so that people can fill them in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>We are being very honest. We are dealing with the legal status of persons.  We must be guided by the CSO in this matter.  They drafted the form and they are the experts on getting the information needed in the census.  The emphasis is on the legal status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>On that section of the form there is now apparently no provision for persons who are separated or persons who are cohabiting.  There is no section on an Irish census form where they can indicate their status.  Apparently people have been filling in census forms on entirely erroneous questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1329" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the legal status we are talking about.  The Deputy is splitting hairs in relation to the other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to approach this matter from a different angle from that of Deputy Desmond because I take it that the question is about legal status.  Why is the word &ldquo;divorced&rdquo; not used, because once you say &ldquo;other status&rdquo; is there not a danger that people in one or other of the categories Deputy Desmond speaks of would put themselves under &ldquo;other status&rdquo; not realising that it is confined to people who are divorced?  Why, therefore, is an ambiguous term used rather than the actual, correct legal wording?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will recognise that a census being taken must give the legal status; must be legal&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, that is my point: why use the non-legal term?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>What about people who have not got a legal status in this country&mdash;that is where the national hypocrisy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said earlier, one may perhaps hurt people or invade their privacy by asking for further details.  We are dealing with a legal status; if they come under the legal status it is all there for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister listened to me because my point was different from and indeed opposite to that of Deputy Desmond: as the question relates to legal status why not use the word &ldquo;divorced&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;other status&rdquo; which is a confused, non-legal term and might lead non-divorced people to include themselves in this category thereby vitiating the statistics?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

      <P>May I ask for the benefit of my constituents: if a person <Col N="1330" /> has been married for 50 years but is not living with their spouse, what would such a person put down on that census form?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Married.  They would still be married.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 33 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen the reports referred to.  As I explained to a deputation from the Secondary Education Committee for <Col N="1353" /> Protestant Schools, which I met recently, I am very much aware of the special educational needs of the Protestant community. The special needs of Protestant schools are taken into account by my Department in the allocation of grants. In addition to the special block grant paid annually to the Protestant Secondary Education Committee, special provision is also made in the free transport schemes for children attending primary and post-primary schools under Protestant management.  Moreover, special remoteness grants are payable to any Protestant pupils who are outside the range of daily transport to a suitable secondary or other second level school.</P>
    <P>Successive Ministers for Education, keenly aware of the special difficulties of the Protestant community, particularly in rural areas, have dealt generously with claims for assistance over and above that available to schools generally.  I am personally very much aware of the particular difficulties facing the Protestant community in the educational area and will continue to help them in every way open to me to overcome these difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the statement made by bishops at that synod, does the Minister intend to take further steps to ensure financial assistance is made available to Protestant boarding schools to ensure that none of them will have to close because of lack of State funds?  All Members appreciate that what was done was most acceptable to the House, but will the Minister try to move further and meet the people concerned with a view to giving them the money required to ensure that the boarding schools will prosper?</P>

      <P>Some minutes ago the Minister said he was asked questions only about 1980.  There are two questions down about the 1980-81 school year and we are entitled to answers because the academic year is a unit and parents need to know what will happen in that year.  Can the Minister give an assurance that there will be no change during that academic year in existing school transport arrangements?</P>

      <P>The Leader of the Opposition is familiar enough with the conditions governing the allocation of money in respect of calendar years and must surely appreciate that I am not in a position to forecast budgetary provisions for 1981.  As an economist he should appreciate that.</P>

      <P>As an economist who has had some experience in an educational institution, I understand that it is vital in respect of each academic year to have stability.  It has been a clear <Col N="1360" /> practice to maintain stability within an academic year and I am, therefore, asking the Minister if the school transport scheme will continue throughout the academic year.  The Government may have to make decisions in the budget which could affect the following academic year, but that is another day's work to be faced when it comes.  I am asking about the academic year beginning next September and running until the following June.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a day-to-day administrative matter for the IDA and it would not come directly under my control.  However, I am aware of the situation.  At the time of payment of the grant the then considered opinion was that it would be more beneficial from a national point of view to pay the grant to the parent company rather than to the Irish subsidiary because in the event of anything going wrong with the Irish subsidiary there would be a lien on the parent plant.  What has happened is that the parent plant have gone into receivership rather than the Irish subsidiary; the parent organisation have dragged down the Irish subsidiary.  The IDA will be making a claim against the parent organisation.</P>

Further, does he know that Killdara Spinning Company do not owe any money to the bank and that the action was taken because of the action of two directors outside the country in signing a guarantee?  Does he know that Killdara Spinning Company have made a profit and have a full order book, that they have to close down because of an action by a company outside this State?</P>

      <P>Like many companies here, Killdara Spinning Company are a subsidiary of a parent organisation outside this country.  The parent organisation went into receivership on the 16th of <Col N="1362" /> last month and a receiver was appointed for the Irish subsidiary on the 27th of last month.  There has been a European recession with regard to the entire synthetic fibre industry caused by problems created as a result of the Americans subsidising their synthetic fibre industry. This affected the UK parent of Killdara Spinning Company and, in turn, it affected that company also.</P>

The IDA succeeded in attracting an industry to take over and but for that we would not have had the Killdara Spinning Company. The IDA are working with the receiver throughout all their offices in the world to find a promoter to come here in place of the UK company who have gone to the wall.

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;provided that an exemption from or a reduction of tax under this section shall have immediate effect and shall not be subject to repayment by the Revenue Commissioners at the end of the tax year.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was announced in the budget that any single person whose income is less than £1,700 or a married person whose income is less than £3,400 a year will not be liable for tax in the current financial year.  Obviously their tax allowances would be less than this amount and a situation could arise in the last four or five months of the year where people who were technically not liable for tax would pay tax which I presume the Minister would refund after the close of the financial year.  There is no provision in the Bill to ensure that tax will not be collected from people in this situation.  A person earning £1,700 a year whose tax allowance if he had no other allowance would be £1,130, would use up his tax allowance in approximately two-thirds of the year and then his employer would have to deduct the appropriate amount of tax on the balance from his salary, yet this person is not liable for tax.  The Minister probably intends to refund the money at the end of the year but I want to ensure that people who are not liable <Col N="1407" /> for tax will not have to pay tax even though it is intended to refund that money at some stage after the end of the financial year.  Bearing in mind that this affects the people who have just barely crept into the tax net it is obvious that they can ill afford to have any money deducted from their weekly salary.  Due to administrative and technical difficulties, to the fact that Governments are notoriously slow in refunding money, however good the intention, and due to high inflation even when the money is returned possibly six months later, it is worth much less than when it was deducted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the House that administrative arrangements are being made to apply the exemptions immediately. These arrangements work on the basis that a taxpayer who is exempt will not have to pay tax at all in the current year.  I assure the Deputy that existing legislation is sufficiently flexible to allow this.  I appreciate what the Deputy is trying to achieve in his amendment but his amendment would mean that in the event of there being any repayment of tax it would not be possible to provide any repayment.  It is not the intention to withhold the benefits of the exemptions until after the end of the tax year as the amendment implies. Neither are there any administrative or technical difficulties which would cause any undue delay in the operation of the system.  The administrative arrangements being made will ensure that the exemptions will apply immediately as distinct from what might have been the case of applying them <i>ex post facto.</i>  The possibility of anyone overpaying tax during the course of the year will not arise.</P>

So far as the exemption is being given from the beginning of the year&mdash;the tax is a matter for administrative arrangements&mdash;it will not become payable during that year.  The Deputy will appreciate that where they have been given exemptions on the understanding that the total income was £3,400 or less and where it turned out at the end of the year to have been more, some adjustments will obviously be made in the following year or whenever the matter came to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners but it is not the intention to claim it back at the end of the year.</P>

    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide that, where a husband wholly or mainly maintains his wife who is separated from him, he will receive the married personal allowance.  This really maintains the <i>status quo</i> and goes perhaps a little further in that the husband who mainly maintains his wife will <Col N="1410" /> now benefit as well as the husband who wholly maintains his wife.  Deputies will see that it is simply maintaining the <i>status quo</i> in relation to the existing provision having regard to the impact of the Supreme Court decision and of the income-splitting proposals.  To the extent that it effects any change it is a change which extends the provision to husbands who mainly, as distinct from wholly, maintain their wives.</P>

      <P>Not the full married person's allowance in all cases, but the Deputy will be aware that at the moment the position is that if a wife has separate employment or any part-time employment, that in effect debars the husband from claiming the married allowance under the existing law.  This amendment does not correct the law completely because it is tied up with other legislation which extends beyond tax legislation, such as that relating to family, home, property and so on, but to that extent it is appropriate to make this amendment here, in respect mainly of maintenance. The application of the legislation will be a matter for determination by the Revenue Commissioners in the first instance, but it is an advance to try to meet that situation.</P>

      <P>Really this is intended to preserve the married allowance where a husband maintains his separated wife.  Obviously up to then, the husband has received the married allowance and this would maintain that provision.  I started by saying that this maintains the <i>status quo</i> in respect of the maintenance by the husband of the wife, but there have been cases, as distinct from wholly maintaining the wife, of mainly providing maintenance for her where up to this moment the allowance was not claimable by the husband.  This is a move in that direction.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that, and I applaud the Minister for going in that direction because there are a certain number of cases&mdash;perhaps not many&mdash;in which a great deal of hardship has been caused.  Presumably it is in response to cases of that kind that the Minister has made these changes.  Can he assure us that he will look into that twilight area of the common law wife in that these are, admittedly, all individual cases?  It may be difficult to enshrine in legislation suitable statutory provisions to apply in all cases but this is an area in which a relatively small number are concerned and there is a good deal of hardship for the children concerned in this kind of situation at present.</P>

Deputies will appreciate that there are a range of possibilities such as voluntary separations, <Col N="1412" /> separation under court order where the husband is wholly maintaining the wife, separation under a court order where the husband is partly maintaining a wife and the other twilight area that the Deputy has referred to.  To the extent that at this time we can only make a move in this direction, we are doing so in this Bill.  Other consultations will have to follow and they will also have to take into account the nature of court decisions under the law as it stands at the moment.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 are related and amendments Nos. 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15 are alternatives to amendment No. 4. Deputy Barry will move amendment No. 4 and he will discuss all these other amendments with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 11, lines 4 and 6, to delete &ldquo;£2,230&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£2,565&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments is quite clear.  It is to ensure that the allowances in every year, this year in particular, reflect the increased cost of living between one year and the other.  I have picked the figure up to last February which is the only firm one which could be written practically into the Finance Bill because it is the only one available when the Finance Bill is published in April or May.  A fairer figure from the tax payers' point of view would be the May figure of which, even though we have not got it yet, the indications are that it is going to be considerably worse than the 12-month figure to mid-February last, but I have chosen 13.6 per cent which was the official figure in the CPI increase between February 1979 and February 1980.  If the Minister will not accept this amendment he will find himself being pushed into doing so with the present rates of inflation as more and more people are sucked back into the tax net because of inflation reflecting itself in increased wages fairly regularly in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1413" /> It would be far better if the Minister would accept the principle now which I pushed forward last year and am pushing forward again this year in these amendments, that indexation should apply to the tax allowances.  The Minister will argue that these allowances have been increased very favourably by virtue of the Supreme Court decision already referred to, but it is hardly adequate because the Supreme Court decision covers only married people and about 50 per cent of the work force are single. Therefore, half of the work force will not benefit by that decision but they will find themselves, especially those in the lower income group, paying tax above the £3,400 level which is the present ceiling below which tax will not be paid, even though they may consider themselves exempt. The present rate of inflation is running to 20 per cent or more for the 12 months to mid-April 1980, and if we are to believe the statements of certain trade union officials on radio and in the press, that is the figure they have in mind for any national understanding in the 12 months ahead.  Anybody who at the moment is earning £3,000 will find himself or herself in the tax net before the current year runs out, despite the fact that the ceiling is at present £3,400.  That could in turn bring its pressures both on the Minister for readjustment and on employers and trade union officials either to break or renegotiate the national understanding which, if negotiated, will come in with what may seem fair but with the current rate of inflation will be seen quickly not to be adequately recompensing those on whose behalf it was negotiated.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Minister should accept the amendments.  Deputy O'Leary's amendments go much further than mine in this regard, and I presume that he intends to explain them.  As I have said, I have taken the figure to mid-February last.  If the possible, projected or prophesied figure from May 1979 to May 1980 were taken, then the £2,565 which I have in amendment No. 4 would be much greater.  This House should obey the spirit of what the Minister announced in the budget as well as the letter <Col N="1414" /> of what is written into the Bill.  The consumer price index for the 12 months should be used as an adjustment for tax free allowances for taxpayers in the coming 12 months and in subsequent years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barry has indicated that the suggestions we made appear to go some distance further than the proposals before us.  The figures we have calculated for this exemption rate relate to an inflation rate in excess of 20 per cent for the year.  It may be claimed that that is an exaggerated figure but the CPI figure for the June quarter shows a startling rate of inflation.  It is central to any hope for restraint in wage claims to provide a tax reduction for the people concerned.  A commitment by the Government that salaries will not be taxed as heavily as heretofore is central to restraint in wages claims.  There is a trade off between the restraint which can be exercised by the Government in the collection of taxes and that which can be obtained voluntarily from wage earners generally.</P>
      <P>Without the indexation principle being conceded&mdash;and it has not been conceded&mdash;most improvements in exemption rates are eroded as the year goes on. In the increases we are looking for, we allowed for foreseeable increases arising from another national understanding or from plant by plant bargaining in a negotiating situation similar to that which obtained in the late sixties.  We do not know what the position will be after the unions and employers have had their discussions and negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may claim he has not got the resources to meet these requests, but he will concede that any realistic hope of achieving wage restraint must lie along these lines.  With today's rapidly rising costs, we cannot expect wage and salary earners to respond in a satisfactory manner to demands for restraint, without giving them the package of tax reforms they have been seeking for many years.  In relation to the provisions in the budget, my worry is that what appear at first glance to be moves in the direction of tax reform will be seen before the end <Col N="1415" /> of the year to be lacking in that element of indexation.  These improvements will be seen as being not quite adequate to deal with the head of steam which has been built up.  Tax reform cannot be tackled in isolation.  There is an intimate connection between it and restraint in the wages area.</P>
    <P>If the Government can be accused of one failure in their economic management it is their failure to seek consciously to wind down inflation.  It appears that they have lost their courage in dealing with that matter.  This is the sensible course to adopt and the one the previous Government adopted in attempting to bring the rate of inflation under control.  All the signs suggest that it is getting out of control once more.  This is one suggestion the Minister could adopt to ensure that his management of the budget assists in winding down inflation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments raise some very fundamental issues. Deputy Barry referred to the number of people paying tax and the levels at which they are paying tax.  He and Deputy O'Leary would suggest both amendments are directed toward relieving the tax burden.  I should like to make some general comments which the House may find enlightening on the progress made last year and the year before and the major progress which will be made as a consequence of the proposals in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total number of taxpayers for 1980-81 is estimated at 727,000.  That might not seem of immediate significance, but it is the lowest number of taxpayers since 1972-73.  That is a matter of considerable importance and it should be an inducement and an encouragement towards reason and understanding on the part of those who are expressing and have expressed concern about the level of taxation.  There are now fewer people paying tax than there were in 1972.  That is an indication of great progress, having regard to the increase in the number of people in employment. It should be a major element <Col N="1416" /> in achieving reason and understanding and co-operation.  That is not the end of the story.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that the figure will have altered by the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is by comparison with the beginning of any previous year. One must compare like with like.  That achievement should not be passed off lightly as if it were in ease of the Minister for Finance or the Government to claim credit for it.  It is no harm for the public to know that, and those who are anxious to get an understanding in the broadest sense of the word should mark that progress for what it is.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry's proposal would cost an extra £60 million in a full year. Deputy O'Leary's proposal would cost an extra £98 million in a year.  Both those Deputies are spokesmen for the Department of Finance.  I could understand other Deputies saying: &ldquo;So what if it is an extra £60 million or £90 million?&rdquo;  Some people are concerned about the regulation of the public purse and the control of public expenditure. Deputy O'Leary mentioned inflation specifically.  One is entitled to ask both Deputies in the light of the real progress being made in this area this year on what basis do they suggest it is not enough and that we should add on Deputy O'Leary's £98 million or Deputy Barry's £60 million.  Deputy O'Leary's proposal would mean an increase of about 2 per cent in the borrowing requirement and Deputy Barry's proposal an increase of 1½ per cent.  On the face of it, those proposals would be acceptable to and popular with those who did not give very much thought to them but would not commend themselves to those with the responsibility of Ministers for Finance. Nonetheless, I suppose every year no matter what is being done in a particular Bill amendments to increase the allowances are put down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me make some other points that may help the House to recognise that of all years this was one year when this <Col N="1417" /> standard amendment was not and is not appropriate.  A little more thought might have suggested that this was a year that could usefully have been passed by.  In 1972-73 the single allowance was £299; married allowance, £494.  Over the five years to 1977-78, a relevant period in respect of both Opposition spokesmen now, the single allowance was £665 and the married allowance £1,100.  The increase in the single allowance over that period was £366.  In fact £100 of that was required to compensate for discontinuance of earned income relief in 1974, so that the net increase in the single allowance over that period was £266. Similarly, the net increase in the married allowance over the period&mdash;apparently indexation was not in vogue then nor the case for it&mdash;was £441.  In the two years 1978-79 and 1979-80 the single allowance was increased from £665 to £1,115, an increase of £450.  The married allowance was raised from £1,000 to £2,230, an increase of £1,130. Very considerably more has been achieved in two years, particularly in this Bill, than was achieved in the previous five years.</P>
    <P>I felt I should mention those three factors first, that the total number paying tax is the smallest number for seven or eight years; secondly, the level of allowances is the highest by any standard and certainly far in excess of the allowances applied when Deputies opposite might have been in a better position to give increases and, thirdly, there is the cost.  In view of those reasons I do not think either Deputy will be surprised if, having gone so far this year, farther than anything contemplated previously, I am not of a mind to say that I will add an extra £90 million or £60 million and let us guess where it will come from.</P>

Some of them do not even talk to each other and collective responsibility does not apply at all.  I notice Deputy Keegan who was one of the gainers out of that exercise three years ago is here as a result of it.  Be that as it may, the Minister says fewer people now pay tax than at any stage in the past eight or nine years.  That is not true.  Many people pay income tax but the people who have been caught by this most savage budget in other areas are taxpayers and they are the poorest section of the community.  I think it has been proved by and accepted in very perceptive articles in one of the newspapers that in fact the lower paid people benefit least from the tax concessions in the 1980 budget.  By the time they had become liable for increased taxes in other areas&mdash;drink, petrol, cigarettes and 5 per cent on VAT&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With due respect, if I am allowed to speak I shall finish perhaps sooner than if I am interrupted. The points were made by the Minister that it would cost too much and that there are fewer people in the tax net now than there were seven or eight years ago. He has not, of course, mentioned that all those people are paying considerably more tax indirectly than they were paying three years ago.  There is an increase in the price of petrol which will affect their jobs as well as their pockets.  There is an increase in the cost of other oils. The chairman of one company has pointed out that the amount of tax collected from his company as a result of that increase would equal the total wage bill for the company for 12 years.  The amount of tax that the ESB will have to pay under this heading is some £11 million. Eventually all that will have to be paid by taxpayers to whom the Minister is now saying they have been relieved of their burdens.  They are not being relieved at all; the tax is just being collected in another way and from the less well-off section of the community.  The Minister should, in justice and equity, accept these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>As a six months old Minister for Finance it is understandable that the Minister can indulge in financial responsibility and in speeches on that score here.  Also, as Minister for Finance he is in a different position certainly from the Minister for Finance in the Government to which he refers in the period between 1973 and 1977.  That Government during most of their period in office waded through one of the <Col N="1421" /> deepest world recessions since the thirties. The present Minister for Finance now stands on the brink of another recession.  Opinions differ as to what measures will be forced on him through this recession, whether as serious or otherwise as the last one.  He will find that the constraints become more formidable in financial management as one works through a recession.  But he is right to remind the House that the country is living beyond its means and that inflation is a serious matter and affects everybody.  We have previously made the case of course that his very own budget has contributed to the increase in inflation here by its reliance on more indirect taxation.  But that argument has been gone over already and I do not propose to go down that road.  I would simply make the point&mdash;and this is the only reason we put in these amendments which the Minister said would cost more and of course they will cost more&mdash;that the increased cost of these amendments is intended to be part of a bargaining process that would give us moderate wage increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The civil servants in the Minister's Department who worked out the figures relating to what these amendments would mean in increased costs can also give him figures relating to the public service pay bill; for every extra percentage point there the public service pay bill, as the Minister knows, goes up by a certain figure.  It is a very interesting thing to examine and it is part of the thesis of these amendments that the tax reform and exemptions and indexations that might be agreed in this area go hand in hand with moderation in wage claims. It is part of a policy that leads to improvement in the inflationary situation so that it is not simply mindless largesse. One could again say to this Minister in particular and to anyone in this administration that, as an administration, they have not been quite so scrupulous in their immediate past in ensuring that taxpayers' money was spent to the best benefit.  That again is an argument I do not propose to pursue here this afternoon. I would merely make the point that such increased expenditure as would <Col N="1422" /> follow as a result of these amendments being adopted in the context of wage bargaining can be defended if a <i>quid pro quo</i> for these reforms in the tax area were sought in the wage bargaining area. So when the Minister dismisses these amendments by simply saying they would cost more he must also consider that costs will come if the subsequent bargaining between the social partners gets out of control and that he himself, in his guise as chief Government employer or negotiator for the Government as employer, will be forced to pay very large sums of money indeed as a result of the decisions reached in these wage negotiations and bargainings.  So financial responsibility is something that it is good to see in a Minister for Finance, even one who is only six months old and very good to see even in a Minister for Finance in an administration who have had some profligate habits over the last two or three years when the economy was improving.  Without going into a complete defence of the attitude of the last Government on tax reform because I do not think the argument should be related to it, I would simply say that if the Minister wishes to compare like with like, to compare the tax reform programme of a Government who were hit amidships by a very deep international recession with a Government who are just now encountering the first bitter winds of the present recession is not to compare like with like.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reaction to Deputy Barry's amendments a few minutes ago, delivered with a disarming smile along the lines that Deputy Barry must have his tongue in his cheek if he did not realise that his proposals were going to add a point and a half to the public sector borrowing requirements, makes me wonder what exactly is the financial and economic policy of this Government at all.  It is true that there has been an attempt and that there is a continuing attempt to shed responsibility for the white balloons that Deputy O'Donoghue was launching in all directions with a crowd of laughing children behind him, including the Minister opposite, <Col N="1423" /> at a time when there was applause all around for those balloons.  It is true that, since they have mostly drifted out of sight, there is now an attempt to put a distance between the Government as at present constituted and the Government which contained Deputy O'Donoghue.  I must say I would like to get some guidance on what their thinking is.  Is it Keynesian or is it not?  It did appear to be Keynesian at the wrong time if one was to judge from the strategy with which Deputy O'Donoghue wanted to identify himself.  He had some dashing figures of speech three years ago&mdash;and shortly after he entered that office they excited even me&mdash;about how we had to do things which otherwise might not be advisable in order to float off the economy from the rocks, in order to prime the pump, although I do not think that phrase was his own but was borrowed.  He even had the simile of the economy being like a beleaguered caravan of people making for the new territories of the wild west surrounded by circling, whooping tribes of Indians and deciding that they either would make an effort to break out or they would end up all scalped.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kelly should deal with the amendments before the House.  They only deal with the personal allowances in the income tax code.  The Deputy is talking about everything but the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, we are talking about the cost of this amendment.  I have got the Minister's word for it that the cost of Deputy Barry's amendment would be £60 million.  He then said, and I could not help laughing at it, that there is not really any difference between that and Deputy O'Leary's amendment except that the latter would cost £98 million.  I know an extra £38 million seems a bagatelle.  But the whole thrust&mdash;to use another word from the manifesto age, since this equally appeared over the hill&mdash;of the programme was to put money into the economy in order to gear it up, in order to allow it to <Col N="1424" /> float off the rocks on which, as they would have us believe, the malice of the side I worked for had stranded us.  Surely the proposal which Deputy Barry's amendment represents would be very much in line with that kind of thinking.  It will add a point and a half to the borrowing requirement, but the Government have already over-borrowed by three points last year and are going to do so by another three points over and above the O'Donoghue 1977 target this year. Where, therefore, is the killing finality in the argument of the present Minister to Deputy Barry that his proposal, socially equitable though it seems to be, will add a point and a half to the public sector borrowing requirement?  Let me tell the Minister opposite that if he has got a crushing borrowing requirement it is because of the reckless prodigality with which his Government sought to pretend they were curing the unemployment problem by creating unnecessary public service jobs, stuffing school leavers behind desks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows that we are winding our way with no one at the helm, unlike the Government that I worked for, into a very serious financial situation.  He also knows that part of the financial orthodoxy, that I understood was axiomatic, and I do not set up to be a financial expert and never did, is that one spends one's way out of a recession and when one is in calm water again one draws in one's horns and economises. Both parts of that axiom were neglected by the Government.  The recession was already over and the National Coalition had pulled the economy off the rocks a year-and-a-half before the Minister opposite entered office.  That did not stop them spending when they got in to buy off election promises.  Then when the recession has now really begun to bite, as Deputy O'Leary said a moment ago, they drew in their horns.  I agree that <Col N="1425" /> they have virtually no manoeuvring room, virtually no leeway, virtually no scope for drawing in horns, very little area in which to economise and there is a population twice as ungovernable as it was when we left office and twice as bloody-minded about being asked to carry any burdens at all.  The Government have only themselves to blame for that because of their having flattered the people into believing that they need not carry any burden and that anybody who imposed anything on them was being either malicious or incompetent or both.</P>
      <P>This set of amendments in the name of Deputy Barry is socially equitable.  Admittedly, their acceptance and implementation would cost money, and to this extent I would accept the Minister's figure of £60 million.  However, that money would be a very substantial contribution towards easing the business recession and towards easing the difficulties of individuals whose shortages in regard to credit are having a very bad effect on the building trade.  In general this £60 million could be seen to be pumped straight into the economy and for that reason, if for no other reason apart from the element of social equity that is involved, I urge that the amendments be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to note first that in regard to what the Deputies opposite are asking, regardless of whether one thinks in terms of £60 million so far as Deputy Barry is concerned or of £90 million so far as Deputy O'Leary is concerned, we are talking of these amounts in addition to what is being done in this area.  Deputy Kelly may go back as far as he wishes, but we are talking here about this year's Finance Bill.  It is important that I should tell the House that the full-year cost of the allowances being introduced in this Bill will be of the order of £231 million, a sum which by any standards and in the context of anything that has been done in this area up to now, not only in one year but over an aggregated four or five years, is an unprecedented major development.  In view of that and since what we are doing goes even further than <Col N="1426" /> the case made to me in submissions by such people as the ICTU and other concerned interests, it is somewhat unreal and very unreasonable for Deputies opposite to be pressing for the further allowances as suggested in these amendments.</P>
      <P>It may well be that the type of case made by Deputy Barry and Deputy O'Leary will be the case that will be made annually by Opposition spokesmen and, when we take their arguments together with the passionate plea of Deputy Kelly, the attitude of the Opposition seems to be: &ldquo;Why not go all out and let us all be merry and gay?&rdquo; That would appear to be the basis of Deputy Kelly's case.</P>

Everybody, with the exception of those who are arguing here today, recognise this step as being a major and unprecedented step.  Deputy Kelly chided me for smiling a little but if I smiled it was because of the difficulty I had in taking seriously the proposals of the Opposition.  If I were to take them seriously I would have to show an appalling sense of shock that Finance spokesmen from the other side should make such proposals at this stage.  Even in the very difficult year we are experiencing, we are making these major concessions.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding what Deputy O'Leary has said, one of the reasons for these very generous allowances is our recognition of the importance of creating a climate of responsibility and of understanding throughout the community in the context of a national understanding.  For those who have said so often that these allowances had to be introduced anyway as a result of the Supreme Court decision, I would underline the fact that the implication of that decision would have cost £30 million this year whereas what is being done involves a figure far in excess of that.  I have heard arguments about the lower-paid workers and about our alleged lack of concern for them, but I would have thought that this question was dealt with in terms of the exemptions in taxation.  It is important to remind the House and the people generally that the lower-income sector here have a much lower tax liability than their counterparts in the UK and in Northern Ireland, for instance, where the lowest rate of tax is 30 per cent compared with 25 per cent here.  To give an example of what is involved, a married man here, <Col N="1428" /> without children and earning £5,000 per year, will pay £227 less in income tax than his conterpart in Britain will pay, and we must remember that Britain has the North Sea oil.  For all these reasons, particularly in view of the major steps taken so far, I would suggest that the Deputies opposite do not have much of a case.  I do not believe that they have much stomach either in pressing this issue.  It may allow Deputy Kelly an opportunity to go over historic arguments, arguments that were put forward at the last election and which presumably will be put forward again on the next occasion, but this is hardly a time for such arguments.  If it is the view of Fine Gael that the addition of another £60 million or £90 million is not of any significance, that message should be heard loud and clear.</P>

      <P>Even at this difficult time there are people on the other side who would wish to be in my place. However, regardless of that, I can tell the House that I am determined that, in so far as I can do so as Minister for Finance, the borrowing requirement will be kept within the limit announced.  Apparently the difference between the Opposition spokesmen and myself is that they, of their own action and not even because of any pressure on them from any other source, are proposing the spending of this extra money.  In all of the consultations I have had with the various interests I have not had a request either from trade union representatives or from anyone else to increase the allowances beyond the figures announced in the budget.  That pressure has not been put upon me and I assume, by definition, that it has not been put on the two spokesmen for finance on the other side.  If it has not, they themselves, by their own actions, are saying: &ldquo;It does not matter.  We are going to increase it anyway&rdquo;.  They are taking that decision now, which is rather different.</P>

      <P>I did not say that at all. There are other ways of doing it.  It is typical of the Fianna Fáil Party to think that the only way to get money is to borrow it.  They have taken an overdose of this medicine in the last three years, including the example I gave last year, where in spite of the fact that it was one of the ten commandments of finance that the borrowing requirement could not be breached, it went up by about 40 per cent in 12 months.</P>
      <P>I wish to give notice, but I am not sure if it is the correct time to do so, that I would like the Minister's comments on an article in today's <i>Irish Times</i> which may be appropriate to this section of the Bill, and will be of concern to many people.</P>
      <P>Portion of the article reads:</P>
      <P>The position in relation to married couples who have paid tax for any preceding tax year (pre April 5th, 1980) and whose returns and assessments have been completed, accepted and finalised <i>prima facie,</i> appears to be that they cannot now seek a refund for the &ldquo;unconstitutional&rdquo; portion of tax paid by them.</P>
      <P>I am not asking the Minister to answer that point or to comment on it at this stage, but am asking him at the appropriate section of the Finance Bill to comment.  This has very important implications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This was the decision of the Supreme Court and that was the basis on which they approached it. What is being done in this Bill in the various relevant sections will concern earned income but includes also unearned income.  To that extent it takes note for the first time of the role of the wife who works at home.  This year alone it will cost at least four times what the Supreme Court decision would have required us to provide for.  It not only introduces that principle but because of the extension of the tax bands, which have been an issue for some considerable time, the level of tax which these people pay on their salary has been reduced very considerably.  It is important to mention at this stage, in the context of the attitude towards the national understanding, that the new tax allowance forms going out will not immediately disclose to the person in respect of whom they have been drawn up that their tax liability will be considerably less than it was.  This form will show only the tax allowances and will not indicate to them that in almost every case they will be in a lower tax band.  It is of vital importance to consider the impact of all that has been done in all these sections.  I became aware of those myself over the weekend when some people who had received their tax allowance forms said that they were getting only a little more than last year and did not appreciate that, in addition to increased allowances, the application <Col N="1432" /> of this system means that they have moved from a higher to a lower tax band.  This will be seen to operate in the next few weeks and people will then appreciate the impact of both events.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Briscoe's other question, I am afraid I have not an immediate answer to it.  I may have an opportunity in the meantime of looking at the matter of the position of widows and single parents.  This matter will be dealt with in detail at another stage when I shall be able to give the Deputy an answer.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Minister says that it will be apparent to certain people in a few weeks' time what exactly the budget is doing for them.  One thing which will be apparent is that for people in the lower income bracket it is doing very, very little.  Until you get up to at least £8,000 a year, it is an &ldquo;as you were&rdquo; and in many cases a worse off budget.  I am obliged to Deputy Briscoe for asking the Minister to clarify the point about the Supreme Court case.  On a number of occasions since I came into the House the Minister has said that the Government were doing much more than they were bound to do by the Supreme Court decision.  That is correct, if you put a very strict and extremely narrow interpretation on the Supreme Court case. The Supreme Court were asked to decide whether it was constitutional to aggregate the earned incomes of husbands and wives.  That is all they were asked to do and that is all they decided. The Minister says that it will cost £30 million to put that right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, everybody knew that it followed, just as day follows night, that the first time the courts were asked to adjudicate on unearned income or splitting of income the decision would be the same.  Of course, it would be the same.  The Minister may laugh at that, but what in the name of goodness is the difference between earned income and unearned income?  There was a difference away back, when there was an allowance for earned as against unearned income, when £500 or so was exempt <Col N="1433" /> from tax.  That has gone with the snow.  As far as income in the hands of a spouse is concerned, there is no difference&mdash;and the Minister knows it&mdash;between earned and unearned income.  It was indeed very wise of him to take the bull by the horns now and deal with the matter, because he knew perfectly well that it was only a matter of waiting until somebody brought him to court and he would have to do it.  In so far as married couples are concerned in this budget, they may thank Mr. and Mrs. Murphy, and not the Minister for Finance or the Fianna Fáil Government, for anything which they have got out of this.  Mr. and Mrs. Murphy brought them to the High Court and then to the Supreme Court and got a decision which virtually means across the board, that you cannot aggregate the income of a husband and wife.</P>

Surely the plain truth of the matter is that Deputy Fitzpatrick's point represents in the forceful language that is natural to him what the legal adviser to the Government told them was the likely outcome in the long-term of the decision in the Murphy case?</P>

      <P>The Minister made the point that the Opposition were being irresponsible in seeking exemptions which would cost in the region of £98 million.  He claimed I was irresponsible in making such a point at a time of economic difficulties and in the context as he put it, of a budget which was so generous and bent on reform in many areas.  I would defend costings even of the order required&mdash;I take the figure given by the Minister as being the cost of my suggestion&mdash;as a worth-while investment in assisting the winding down of inflation. I see a direct relationship between budgetary reform in the taxation area and the obtaining of reasonable pay settlements.  It is crucial to the country's economy this year that settlements are obtained freely from unions and employers which the country can live with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe the Government in the budget made it any easier to get such settlements because their action in altering <Col N="1436" /> the fiscal stance to one of depending on indirect taxation embittered the atmosphere. It will make it more difficult to get the type of reasonable settlement the economy requires in this crucial year.  If one accepts the importance of getting settlements which will permit, to the greatest extent possible, employment to be created that figure is a worth-while investment and one that can be defended, even to the costings of £98 million.  We all know that in the absence of such a settlement increases will be sought which will add appreciably to the public wage bill.  The Minister is aware that pay settlements that go beyond a certain figure in this area pose a grave threat to our resources.</P>
    <P>The Minister's case is not made when he accuses us of being irresponsible.  We would be irresponsible if we looked upon these figures in isolation but I do not put them forward in isolation.  I put them forward in the context of bargaining as a <i>quid pro quo</i> for the reform elements involved in allowances obtained from the social partners in reasonable pay settlements. Inflation is a serious problem but this administration who set out to conquer it are now succumbing to the inflation psychology.  Apparently, they do not have any solution to the problem and are prepared to live with it.  It is possible that in a certain sense they consider that in terms of tax collection and so on it is an endurable infliction.  In the context of the EMS the kind of inflation we are facing this year is very dangerous and it makes good sense to consider trade-offs of the kind implied in the amendments.  They are not irresponsible taken in that context.</P>

      <P>What is being done in the Bill provides at least twice the measure of relief the Opposition are asking for.  When that is being provided it is unreasonable to ask for the type of allowances they have suggested.  That is not in line with what I would have thought to be the position of Opposition spokesmen on Finance in a year in which we have made the greatest single advance.  I hope the significance of this will not be missed by those referred to <Col N="1437" /> by Deputy O'Leary, the social partners. It is the main thrust of Government policy.</P>
      <P>The position for a PAYE taxpayer who is married in the three year period to 1980-81 is that the increase in his allowance will be £1,530.  That compares with an increase of £440 over the previous five years.  That is very substantial. It is at least three-and-a-half times what it was in the previous five years. Most of that substantial increase has been introduced in this year's Bill as a consequence of the budget.  I hope it clearly demonstrates the Government's concern to ensure that the tax scheme is such as would make a major contribution towards understanding, in the broadest sense of the word, and to the national understanding as well.</P>
      <P>The single allowances have increased to £850 in the three year period by comparison with £260 over the last five years.  Surely that is evidence that this scheme is making a major contribution. Surely it is evident that it is costly, although it is a cost that will be well repaid if people take note of what it will mean in real income as distinct from the impact of other taxes which might not affect all of them.  What has been done is far in advance of what has been done in wealthier member countries of the EEC. One would expect the support of both sides of the House for doing it rather than asking us to go further still.  If Belgium or the Netherlands had this scheme, their workers and married people would say it was a major revolutionary advance.  We have it and yet we are asking for more as if more were necessary.  I am asking for reasons at this stage and to acknowledge that we have made progress.</P>

      <P>In page 12, subsection (1), column 9 (3) of the Table to delete &ldquo;195&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;300&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is the section of the Bill which reduces the allowance for children under the Income Tax Acts from £218 to £195.  This is the second consecutive year this reduction has been made in the allowance for children of taxpayers.  The Minister will argue that the children's allowances have been increased, but that is a different thing altogether.  Children's allowances are designed to help people with large families to rear those children; they are designed primarily to assist people in the less-well-off sections of our community.  I think it is for administrative reasons only that a means test is not applied&mdash;and maybe it should be applied&mdash;to those.  But to deprive taxpayers of a benefit in helping them rear their children, or indeed failing to increase the allowance by an amount equivalent to the rate of inflation, but to actually reduce it in the year strikes me as petty, mean, unnecessary and very anti-family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat at a loss here.  I have been reading over the debates on the Finance Bill each year.  I have been reading the proposal made by the Deputy last year and the reply given him by my predecessor.  Perhaps that reply incorporates the best precedent one can find for the proposal adopted in this Bill.  I do not know if I can do better than quote from what the present leader of the <Col N="1441" /> Deputy's party had to say on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill, 1969, because where I might not succeed in persuading Deputy Barry perhaps the leader of his own party might.  Here I quote from volume 241, column 587 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>.... I should like to congratulate the Minister on this move.  What he has done is, in fact, to recover only a proportion, a fraction, of the amount involved.  Perhaps he might go further, not because any one wants more taxation&mdash;none of us wants it; none of us paying it wants it; I am one of those who suffer from it&mdash;but because every £ we get back from people who do not need children's allowance is an extra £ which we can give to people who are in very real need.</P>
      <P>Deputy Richie Ryan, when introducing a similar proposal in 1973, said in his Budget Statement, at volume 265, column 1255 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>As a partial contribution to the cost of these proposals,</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the increases granted in the social welfare children's allowances&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>the allowances under the Income Tax Acts for each such child will be reduced in the case of taxpayers whose net incomes exceed £2,500.</P>
      <P>He in fact set a precedent for what I am now doing.  I can only say that I agree wholeheartedly with both spokesmen that one must define the priorities.  The priorities they proposed then, which were followed by my predecessor, are ones that are not only meritorious but absolutely essential in ensuring that the benefit of the social welfare children's allowances be applied to those who need them.  The only way in which this can be guaranteed is to effect this clawback by reducing the actual child allowance now being proposed.  That is the pattern that has been followed and, if it was right then, it is right now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should tell Deputy Barry that, apart from his amendment drawing no distinction between those in greatest need of children's allowances and those who are <Col N="1442" /> not in need of them this year if I were to do as he asks it would be at a cost of £15 million, which would be almost exclusively in ease of those who do not need this as an income supplement.  If that £15 million were available I would prefer to spend it on providing greater benefit for those in need of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. J. Flanagan Mr. O. J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a section in which I am greatly interested.  Would the Minister not feel that the expenditure of £15 million, in compliance with the full wishes and terms of Deputy Barry's amendment, would be wisely and well spent?  There is no point in the Minister quoting previous Minister for Finance. That cock will not crow now.  The Minister is responsible for his budget and this Finance Bill.  We are living now in different and more difficult times.  Now is the time for the implementation of new measures, particularly those affecting the family.  When one realises that the family constitutes the fundamental unit of society there is no point in a Minister for Finance or any other Deputy giving lip service to and pious expressions of goodwill towards the family when there is an opportunity afforded in this section, through the adoption of Deputy Barry's amendment, to do something in practical terms for the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite wrong, in the event of children's allowances under the Social Welfare Acts being increased, that there should be any question of a clawback in the finance regulations so that any increase in benefits granted by the Minister for for Social Welfare with one hand would be taken back by the Minister for Finance with the other.  The whole principle is wrong.  The Minister's granting of allowances in respect of children under this section is a recognition of the parents' responsibility for the welfare and maintenance of their children.  Here a golden opportunity is afforded the Minister to give serious recognition to the standing of the family in this state, it being recognised that the family constitutes the fundamental unit in society. This affords the Minister an opportunity to do something in a very practical way to assist large families particularly and <Col N="1443" /> the father or wage earner who must support that family.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider very seriously the full terms of Deputy Barry's amendment because it goes to the very heart of family life.  It is quite wrong for the Minister to say that the social welfare children's allowance should be withdrawn from the better-off people.  Is this not another method of imposing a means test on children's allowances under the guise of national economies?  The Minister has said that the implementation of the provisions of Deputy Barry's amendment would cost £15 million.  In my opinion that would be £15 million very well and wisely spent in assisting and encouraging families.  I give my fullest support to the amendment tabled by Deputy Barry as constituting a most practical means of assisting the family as the fundamental unit of society and as so recognised under our Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I support Deputy Barry's amendment.  Since this Government came back to power they have been particularly mean in regard to families.  That has been the trend of their budgetary policy year after year.  In the first year they did not give any increase, the first time it had not been done in many years. In 1979 they reduced the child allowance for income tax purposes from £240 to £218, and this year they have had another go at it and reduced it to £195.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at the table in this section there is evidence that the Government know that the cost of living in regard to children has increased substantially, because they have doubled the allowance in respect of the children of widows and other such people from £250 to £500. They have increased the allowance in respect of an incapacitated child from £165 to £330 and in a case where both spouses are blind they have increased the allowance from £330 to £660.  I thank the Minister for that because it happens that in my constituency there are two people, husband and wife, both of whom <Col N="1444" /> are blind.  However, there is not much money involved in giving the increased allowance for incapacitated children&mdash;it is a glorified cosmetic exercise.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the table provides evidence that the cost of maintaining children, whether incapacitated or normal healthy children, has increased, but this is the first time in our history that we have seen a budgetary trend against the family, particularly the larger family.  In the first year of this Government being in office, children's allowances were not increased whereas every other form of allowance was.  They increased these allowances for tax purposes last year but this year they attacked them with a clawback clause which reduces the income tax allowance from £240 to £195.  That is a substantial reduction and Deputy Barry's amendment, therefore, has great merit and should be supported.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The best way I can present my case is to refer to the combined effects of income tax provisions and children's allowances.  The Opposition have been complaining about the reduction in the child allowance and say that the combined effect has been a lowering of the benefit.  Deputy Flanagan suggested that if one is concerned about the need for supplementary incomes for larger families one should express that concern through every avenue available. That is what is being done as distinct from applying the available resources to all families irrespective of income.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the scheme we are proposing is to define these priorities and act accordingly, and the proposals being put by the Opposition would have the opposite effect.  The quotation I used earlier from the Leader of Fine Gael was not from a statement he made as Minister for Finance but as spokesman on Finance in Opposition in 1969-70.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer to the combined effect in regard to PAYE of the reduction in the child allowance.  A married couple with one child on an income of £3,000 a year&mdash;we have been expressing concern for the lower paid&mdash;as a consequence of these general provisions in respect of children's allowances and the child allowance will be saving £147 per annum, about £3 per week.  A married couple with two children with an income of £6,000 will have an increase in the order of £236.  I am taking random examples.  In the case of a married couple with three children and an income of £7,000, the increase will be £243 per year or £5 a week.  It is arguable that we should spread the net wider and hit upper incomes more, without applying any priorities.  The Deputies opposite know that there are choices.  Children's allowances could be paid irrespective of income, to the poorest and to the richest&mdash;perhaps Deputy Flanagan is suggesting that this be done&mdash;and then there could be a clawback to ensure that the taxpayers' money would be applied to benefit those most in need.  That is what is being done, and from the examples I have given I cannot see how it can be argued that it is not being done to the benefit of families with lower incomes, those who are most dependent on us.</P>

      <P>If the Minister is so fond of reading past speeches and giving quotations by Deputy FitzGerald and others, would he direct his talents to reading some other speeches, particularly that made by the late Deputy Seán Lemass when he spelled out in this House that children's allowances by the Department of Social Welfare were for every child of every family in the State? The majority of Members accepted the <Col N="1446" /> principle that children's allowances were to assist parents to provide for their families.  At no time did I ever hear the late Deputy Seán Lemass say children's allowances were for the full support of children.  As I said, these allowances were to help parents to maintain their children.  He never said children's allowances were to be given with one hand and taken back by the other.  This smashes the recognition of the scheme of children's allowances and drives a coach and four through the principle of encouraging large families.</P>
      <P>This year and last year we had this unreasonable and very biased attitude by the Government which appears to be against children's allowances.  The Minister would need £15 million to meet this request but he does not have that money.  There are numerous ways a Minister for Finance can obtain such a sum.  Under our present income tax laws certain persons are exempt from paying tax.  More power to them.  It is terrible to see wealthy cultured workers getting away with real concessions under the tax laws while, at the same time, the family unit appears to be the target for the Minister's arrow.  I am sure these people would not have any objection to paying their fair share of tax if they were assured that the majority of families would be given sufficient allowances to help them educate their children.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick was right when he said parents of large families were experiencing unbelievable difficulties in rearing their children.  The Minister represents a rural constituency which has a number of large families.  These parents, who have only an average income, are feeling the strain financially, mentally and physically.  It could be said that we should discourage large families, but that is not the right attitude to adopt.</P>
      <P>We should encourage large families and also encourage parents to spend as much as they can on educating and clothing their children.  The Minister has a golden opportunity to do something about this problem and all he needs is £15 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister, a dedicated family <Col N="1447" /> man, to have a measure of sympathy for parents of large families who are saving every penny they can to provide for their children.  I am sure if he examines the tax laws he will not reject this amendment but perhaps he needs more time to look at the merits of this amendment.  If he looks seriously at this grave situation he will do his best to provide £15 million for the family unit.  I appeal to him to do something practical to meet the terms of this amendment.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> As I understand it, the Minister justified his rejection of this amendment by saying that by taking income tax and children's allowances into account, a married man with three children is £243 a year, or £5 a week, better off under this budget than he was last year.  If that is the best argument he can give to support his rejection of this amendment, he should accept it.</P>
      <P>How much of this £5 a week is gobbled up by paying for petrol to bring this man to and from work?  How much is gobbled up as a direct result of the 20p tax on a gallon of petrol?  How much is gobbled up by the indirect effect of the tax on petrol which has increased the cost of transporting goods and supplies across the country?  How much is gobbled up by the brutal increase on the pint and on cigarettes?  How much is devoured by the increase in the cost of living and inflation at the rate of 20 per cent?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Deputy Briscoe may have different ways of doing things, but I would like him to tell the House how a married man with three young children and earning £7,000 a year can afford holidays in Spain.  I am finding it more and more difficult to understand how a married man with a few children, trying <Col N="1448" /> to run a car, paying a house mortgage and doing the ordinary things people have to do, can exist on £6,000 or £7,000 a year.</P>
      <P>I do not want to take up the time of this House on this section because this is a limited debate, but a married man earning £7,000 per year who has three children is worse off under this budget than he was in 1979 and notwithstanding that fact the Minister is gobbling back money from all income tax payers while people are left without any increase in respect of their children. We detect in this measure part of the social thinking of Fianna Fáil.  In their first budget since returning to power the one thing they did not increase was the children's allowance and in the following two years the allowance in respect of income tax was chopped from £245 to £218 and then from £218 to £195.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The great part of the social thinking of Fianna Fáil has been to try to help those most in need and this is seen by our Government as the best way to give sizeable increases&mdash;in this instance a 25 per cent increase in children's allowances&mdash;to those most in need.  People I have spoken to during the years have felt that the really wealthy people who were getting the children's allowance were using it as pin money. The wives would, perhaps, spend it on a few drinks with the girls or buy a new dress.  This was an abuse of the underlying principle of the children's allowance.</P>
      <P>The Minister has already stated that allowing for the increase in the children's allowance and the reduction in the tax allowance, it is still costing the State £15 million more this year.  It is not as if we were robbing from children's allowances. Normally we could afford to give bigger children's allowances but in this instance we are taking from those people who have bigger incomes.  I see this as the continuing policy of the Government and perhaps the Minister would confirm this in his reply.  This is a direct way of giving cash benefits to those most in need and reflects the general direction of financial policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I defend this policy and Deputy Peter <Col N="1449" /> Barry's amendment, if it were carried, would result in many people not getting the increases they need and the less well-off having to pay for increases to the wealthy.</P>

      <P>That is not so.  This case has been very eloquently put by Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Flanagan.  I would add that children's allowances are entirely separate from the tax code.  This Bill will have the effect of widening the gap between a married man with a wife and two children and a married man with a wife and no children.</P>
      <P>Referring to the Minister quoting Deputy FitzGerald, Deputy Flanagan said that that cock would not crow.  I should not like members of the party opposite to take that as an indication that we will not be quoting some of their more quotable sayings during the past 12 months.  I will be stitching many of them into the record at appropriate times.  That cock will still crow.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flanagan seemed to convey the impression that I was the first to introduce this principle; that is not the case.  His memory in this House is longer than mine and the principle was first introduced in 1944.  It was applied for a very considerable time and then was not pursued.  When it was reintroduced the leader of that party put himself firmly on the record in support of the principle for good social and economic reasons.  The measure was implemented by the Minister for Finance of that party.  This is not something which is being done for the first time.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Briscoe said, one has to decide what one's priorities are.  Should children's allowances be increased across the board without any attempt to effect a balance by way of clawback, ensuring that everyone gets a little irrespective of income, or should those who are really at the lowest level get much more than a little?</P>

In so far as I seem to be representative of a category in this House, I do not think that I or any other Member can complain too much if we have to forego a little by way of reduction in the child allowance so that those who really need increased children's allowances can get more.  That is the position to which I adhere and which I propose to the House.  I would point out that there was no effective increase in the child allowance between 1972-73 and 1975-76 when the first increase was given.

      <P>My priority is to ensure that this scheme will work on the basis of applying the overall benefits of the tax scheme and the children's allowances scheme to the lower income groups in particular. Over 80,000 people will gain totally as a consequence of the increase in children's allowances because they are not liable to tax.

I do not believe that people who have good incomes and can provide for their children without depending in any way on children's allowances will <Col N="1451" /> object to a little being taken from them to be given to those most in need.  The Opposition are in favour of giving extra money to people who can well do without it.  Surely we cannot advocate increasing allowances for people who are earning £10,000 to £20,000 per year? Those people do not need the money to look after their children.  They have sufficient money of their own to do that. Our priority is to give to families who are most in need.  I have always been in favour of increasing children's allowances.  Those who need money should get it and those people who can provide adequately for their children out of their own income should do that.</P>

He made a claim that every person with an income of £7,000 will be caught, but that is not so because everybody knows there are all sorts of ways to get tax relief on an income of that amount.  Most people in the income range of £7,000 to £8,000 probably have an overdraft and they will get tax relief on that, they will get income tax relief on the purchase of their house, on insurance policies and so on.

The existing allowances in this case are being doubled, as they are for incapacitated persons.  Deputy Fitzpatrick argued that because special provision is made for blind or incapacitated persons by doubling their allowances&mdash;this was a deliberate decision on my part and on the part of the Government&mdash;that was evidence of the fact that everybody's allowance should be doubled also.  On the previous occasion the Deputy appeared to suggest that because we were making a very proper adjustment in respect of blind and incapacitated people it should be done for all, that the cost of living was going up for everybody and people outside the categories I have mentioned should have their allowances doubled also.

      <P>The Deputy's amendments, particularly Nos. 24 and 25, are presumably intended to cover the position where a couple opt to be assessed on their combined income and the assessment shall be made on one of the spouses as the couple elect.  The Deputy's amendment would not have that effect nor would anything I could propose have that desired effect.  The effect of the Deputy's amendment would be that where a couple elect to be assessed on their combined income the husband shall be assessed and charged to tax on that combined income and the wife shall be assessed and charged to tax on that combined income.  It does not state, but it is presumably intended, that only one of them will be assessed.  The Deputy has asked why should it be the spouse.  It does not state either who will <Col N="1456" /> decide which of them will be assessed.  In order to meet the case made by the Deputy the amendment could not be accepted in the form it is in.  The principle behind the amendment should be commended.</P>
      <P>There will probably be cases where the wife will be the person with the family income, the husband being unemployed, and there will be other cases where both have incomes but the wife has the larger one.  The position, by and large, can be achieved under the existing legislation and the purpose of the amendment can be achieved without the need to introduce more complex legislation.  If we attempt to do what the Deputy is proposing we will have a situation where the husband could be assessed and charged tax and the wife could be assessed and charged tax.  I do not think that is what the Deputy wants to achieve.  I do not think the amendment is necessary.  It would be more desirable to accept the Bill in its present form to achieve what I know the Deputy is concerned about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if they apply for separate assessments.  Where, for instance, the wife has an income and the husband has little or no income, which is the case the Deputy is concerned about, the election for separate assessments under section 197 will ensure that the wife will be assessed in respect of her income. If they go for separate assessment this will ensure that the wife will be assessed in respect of her income, which is either the total family income or the greater portion of it.  She will be granted either the total allowances due to a couple or her portion of those allowances together with any balance of allowances unused by the husband.  She would then have the effective responsibility of meeting the tax liability falling on the couple.  As the Deputy is probably aware, it is open for couples to go for separate assessments and, if so, the application of the <Col N="1457" /> allowances can be applied in such a way as to be assessed on the main income earned.  If that is the wife's, so be it.</P>
      <P>I can give an example which might demonstrate the case to the Deputy's satisfaction.  I have sympathy with the case he is making.  Take the case where the wife is earning about £10,000 and her husband has very little earnings, say £1,000, giving a total of £11,000.  The situation there would be that the wife on her earnings would have an employee allowance of £400 and a personal allowance of £2,230 less £600, which is £1,630.  There are total allowances of £2,030.  There is total taxable income of £7,970 chargeable at 25 per cent up to £2,000, that is, £500, and at 35 per cent on the balance, that is, £2,089, making the tax payable £2,589.  The husband has no taxable income and the assessment can be made on the lines the Deputy is suggesting.  It is open to any couple to opt for separate assessment.  Where they do not opt for separate assessment earnings are assessed against the husband because in the vast majority of cases the husband is the main earner.  It is to the convenience of the vast majority of people who do not apply for separate assessment to assess earnings against the husband. There is no advantage or disadvantage in opting for separate assessment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 14, subsection (1), line 13, after &ldquo;£4,800&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;provided that this amount shall be assessed to tax for a widowed person for a period of seven years after the year of bereavement&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is quite clear.  The vast majority of people who claim relief under this provision are people with mortgages.  Obviously if the husband dies the financial circumstances for that family are altered, in some cases drastically.  If in addition to funeral expenses the wife is disallowed a further £2,400 in tax relief, having budgeted maybe for from five to ten years prior to her husband's death on the basis of £4,800 relief, and if she has children it is hard on her.  It is to provide for those tragic circumstances that I put down this amendment.  The £4,000 in the case of somebody who has been married should be carried on after the death of a spouse. In other instances as well, though perhaps not so many, this will be continued for seven years so that the widow will have a chance of making alternative arrangements or maybe her financial circumstances would improve.  At the moment besides the tragedy of losing her husband a wife at the same time is faced with this extra financial burden when her normal income has been reduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in sympathy with this amendment and I would not even limit the time to seven years.  A widow who is left with a very high mortgage when her children are very young and, as Deputy Barry said, her allowances halved to £2,400, in seven years might find herself in the situation where her children have to be educated and there could be further difficulties for her then. I hope the Minister will give the amendment every consideration because if it is not taken into account there could be cases where widows would have to sell their homes where they could not afford to keep up large mortgage.  Having budgeted for £4,800 tax free interest allowance a widow might have to sell her <Col N="1460" /> home and go to less expensive accommodation and this could cause great disruption to herself and her children and the family might be so upset that they might not settle down.  She might not be able to cope emotionally with the situation in which she would find herself. Other people might think that they were in the same category, but we must consider a widow or a widower in a very special category of people.  They are not like single people.  Their lives, emotionally, economically and in every other way, have been disrupted completely and they are due every help they can get.  I appeal to the Minister to think about this amendment and I hope he will be able to do something about it.</P>

      <P>At the conclusion of Second Stage of the Finance Bill I gave some indication that I would be prepared to consider some of the cases that have been made and generally I have sympathy certainly with the cases made by Deputy Barry and Deputy Lemass. Before and since Second Stage I have received representations from Deputies, particularly from Deputy Lemass, on behalf of this category.  She has been making the case that she has stated this afternoon.  I have considered it in the light of what Deputy Barry and Deputy Bruton said on the last occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise the special case that has been made.  But, generally speaking, it is proper to make some distinction between widowed people and the married couples we are speaking about where the section doubles the interest relief.  No one of these factors that I am going to mention is in itself absolute, but most widowed persons&mdash;not all by any means&mdash;are older people who do not have high mortgages by comparison with the average range of those who will be depending upon the mortgage relief as married couples.  Secondly, it is fair to point out that usually mortgages are covered, nowadays particularly, by mortgage protection policies.  Therefore, in the case of a widow generally there should not be a burden on her in respect of the mortgage if the husband dies. Rather ironically, it could operate the <Col N="1461" /> other way to some extent where the wife dies and the husband, being the wage earner, would now, as a result of this Bill, have the married person's double allowance of £4,800.  To lose that might in the circumstances seem rather harsh in addition to the other problems people have to face.</P>
    <P>On balance, I have taken note of what has been argued by Deputy Barry and Deputy Lemass.  I have considerable sympathy and I have come to the conclusion that an appropriate relief in this case should be something of the order of £3,500.  In response to the case that has been made I propose to introduce an amendment to that effect on Report Stage.  I think it would be appropriate, having regard to what I have said, and it should cover borrowing in that instance of up to about £24,000.  I hope that it will meet adequately the situation of widowed persons in more difficult circumstances. I do not want to add to that the fact that extra allowances that are applicable to widows and one-parent families are being introduced elsewhere in this Bill.  I hope that in all the circumstances what I propose will meet the case generally and that it would not be confined to a particular period, that it would have the same extent and duration as the other extensions in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for this response to this amendment.  I understand the difficulty and I appreciate what he has done.  I do not want to appear churlish but I would like to point out a case that can arise in this regard. The Minister has proposed an amendment on Report Stage for £3,500 as opposed to the £2,400 that would exist if the husband or wife died.  However, the strain on the family budget could still be to the amount of the tax on the interest between £3,500 and £4,800 and what that would be would depend upon the circumstances of the case.  I thank the Minister for his response to this amendment. He appreciates the case that I have made.  Deputy Lemass has particular reason for being able to speak more authoritatively from a human point of view in this regard than I have. <Col N="1462" /> Whereas I would wish for more I am thankful for what I have got.</P>

      <P>In page 14, subsection (1), line 15, to delete &ldquo;and&rdquo; and to insert the following paragraph after paragraph (a) of subsection (1):</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) by the insertion after subsection (3) of the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(3A) Where, in relation to interest paid in respect of any period beginning on or after the 6th day of April, 1980, relief is claimed by a person by virtue of more than one of the following provisions, that is to say, this section, section 76 (1) (c) and paragraph 1 (2) of Part III of Schedule 6, relief shall not be given to such person in respect of the part (if any) of the aggregate amount of interest paid by him that exceeds the appropriate amount specified in subsection (2A) in relation to the year of assessment 1980-81 and subsequent years of assessment.&rsquo;:</P>
      <P>and&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the loan interest relief in excess of £2,400 or £4,800 in respect of non-business interest may be claimed in respect of mortgage or loan interest paid to building societies, banks and so forth and loan interest to foreign banks paid out of foreign income which is chargeable to tax.  The new subsection ensures that the limit on interest relief will apply to the total amount of relief claimed regardless of the heading under <Col N="1463" /> which it is claimed.  It is meant to ensure that the total relief claimed can be applied irrespective of the headings. Whether it is mortgage or loan interest paid to building societies or banks, this will ensure that the total relief up to £4,800 can be applied across the sum of each of the categories.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(3)  Section 10 of the Finance Act, 1979, is hereby amended, as respects the year 1980-81 and subsequent years of assessment, by the substitution in subsection (2) of the following definition for the definition of &lsquo;A&rsquo;:</P>

      <P>(i)  in the case of a husband who is assessed to tax in accordance with provisions of section 194 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, £4,800, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  in any other case, £2,400.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 10 of the Finance Act, 1979, is the provision which ensures that the maximum amount of interest, that is £2,400, which ordinarily qualifies for tax <Col N="1464" /> relief will be scaled down in cases where certain employees and company directors enjoy the benefit of loans made at a preferential rate of interest.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of that section contains the formula which restricts the maximum amount of interest on a preferential loan which will qualify for relief&mdash;Deputies opposite will be familiar with this&mdash;applied particularly to preferential loan interest rates for employees of financial institutions.  The formula has been settled in that Act.  In this amendment we are applying the formula in respect of the increased interest relief. It is necessary to ensure that the arrangements which were brought into effect in that Act are implemented.  We are redefining the base of the formula to include reference to £4,800 in the case of a husband who, for 1980-81 and subsequent years, is assessed to tax on his and his wife's combined income in accordance with the provisions of section 194 of the 1967 Act.  In one sense it is consequential on what was already done in an Act, and it is also consequential on the increase in the interest relief now being provided in this Bill.</P>

      <P>This is the section which gives effect to the new tax rates <Col N="1465" /> and rate bands.  The rates and bands are set out in Part I of the Table and they apply in the case of single or widowed persons and where a married person is assessed to tax as a single person.  The doubled rate bands shown in Part II of the Table will apply in the case of a married couple, where they have opted for assessment on their combined incomes, whether or not each spouse has income.  The doubled rate bands and the doubled personal allowance for a married man as compared with a single personal allowance give effect to what has become known as income splitting. Under this scheme the tax bill of a married couple is the same as it would be if each of the spouses had half of the total combined income and each was assessed on that half as a single person. The tax bill of a married couple is the same whether or not one spouse only has income or each spouse has income, but the division of income between them varies from case to case.  The cost of this element in the scheme this year will be of the order of £61 million and £105 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to married couples who have paid tax for any preceding tax year (pre April 5th, 1980) and whose returns and assessments have been completed, accepted and finalised, <i>prima facie</i>, appears to be that they cannot now seek a refund for the &ldquo;unconstitutional&rdquo; portion of tax paid by them.

      <P>It comes up specifically on an amendment which I put down.  The Deputy asked earlier about the operation of marginal relief. Take the case of a single person with a total income of £1,780 in 1980-81.  His single allowance is £1,115 and what we call his employee allowance, the PAYE allowance, is £400.  That amounts to £1,515.  Therefore, his taxable income would be £265 and, at 25 per cent, that would be £66.25.  Under the operation of marginal relief, the excess of his income over the exemption limit of £1,700 is £80.  He has an income of £1,780.  His exemption is £1,700.  Therefore, the income excess is £80.  The maximum tax is 60 per cent of the excess which is £48. The marginal relief is £18.25.  There are other examples I could give the Deputy privately to enable him to see how it operates.</P>

That would give him a taxable income of £265 at 25 per cent and if marginal relief were not applied he would pay £66.25.  Because marginal relief does apply he will pay £48 tax.</P>

The new limit will have effect for the current tax year, as from 6 April.  I should also mention that I propose to introduce an amendment on Report Stage to correct a defect in &ldquo;top slicing&rdquo; relief which allows the avoidance of tax on very substantial termination of employment payments.  As matters stand, a situation can arise where a director or highly paid employee can reduce his liability for tax on a large termination payment by creating charges against this liability through offsetting allowances. There are cases on file where sums of up to £75,000 have been received practically tax free through the use of avoidance measures.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the introduction of this Bill is simply to permit a referendum to be carried out in order to allow the public to decide whether they are in favour of deleting Article 1.3.2 and 41.3.3 allowing for a law permitting divorce where there has been an irreconcilable breakdown in marriage.  This facility is already available in the North.  It is usual, where the Government opposes such a Bill, for the Opposition parties, while not necessarily supporting the principles of the Bill, in the interest of democratic parliamentary practice to permit the Bill to be at least introduced and printed and then discussed.  This occurred in the Capital Punishment Bill some years ago and, of course, in the contraceptive Bill later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ideally in an important issue where conscientious doubts are said to be held by Deputies both for and against the right to divorce, a free vote of the House <Col N="1471" /> should be permitted.  Since the right to divorce is already a part of Labour Party policy and Deputy FitzGerald has recently advocated that amending legislation in respect of and amendments to the Constitution should be introduced and the Taoiseach has equally expressed his commitment to radical constitutional changes if so requested by the Northern Unionists I hope that the discussion on this subject, the right to divorce, will at least be permitted by all-party agreement.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that the legitimacy or validity of a minority civil right should not depend on the size of the minority.  All of us know, however, that responsible authorities exist for the belief that changing attitudes of women to the social role in society, new stresses due to industrial and socio-economic changes have led to an increase in the breakdown of marriage in the Republic and an increasingly insistent demand for the right to divorce.  Recent ESRI figures show that up to some 50 per cent of people are in favour of some form of divorce laws. Further, our failure to provide suitable housing accommodation, secure, well paid jobs and recreational facilities for children have added to the destructive pressures on family life in the Republic. Since the vast majority of the people of the Republic are members of the Roman Catholic Church, this Church while itself permitting effective dissolution of marriage and subsequent remarriage under its own annulment procedure does not favour civil divorce.  For this reason I suspect that successive Governments and political leaders have failed to introduce a law permitting divorce in the Republic.</P>
    <P>In recent years the Catholic Church has made it clear however that Catholic legislators may both advocate and enact laws opposed to their Church's teaching but considered by the legislators to be in the common good.  Such, I suggest, is this proposal on the need for divorce now in the Republic.  There are number of reasons, the most compelling of which are humanitarian and compassionate. <Col N="1472" /> There is as well the question of our respect for Article 44 which guarantees the rights of a religious minority to their freedom to practise their religion.  Concerned action by the Catholic majority now conceding this civil right to a relatively helpless religious minority would more readily establish our bona fides on the issue of genuine concern for the rights of a religious minority in an ultimately united Ireland.</P>
    <P>Because of its consistent failure to implement the basic principles of pluralism, secularism and radicalism in our Constitution and laws I have continuously questioned the validity of Irish Republicans' claim to represent an authentic Republican philosophy.  I have consistently held that Mr. de Valera's 1937 Constitution has been the greatest single impediment to political <i>rapprochement</i> between the peoples of the North and South.  I am glad to see that the Leaders of Fine Gael and the Government party, through the Taoiseach in Downing Street and subsequently at his press conference, have conceded that radical amendments to the Constitution are now needed.  I suggest that this is not a time for new time consuming commissions of inquiry since such an inquiry, the prestigious all-party Dáil Committee in 1967, have already established the need for some form of divorce procedures.  There is an urgent and growing severe human problem in our society with much avoidable suffering involving adults and children alike to whom a Bill of this kind can bring badly needed help.  I ask for support at least in allowing for discussion in the Dáil of the serious issues involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated to Deputy Browne that I oppose the motion.  As the Deputy is aware, recently the Taoiseach said in this House that the Government had no plans at present to promote legislation to amend the Constitution to remove the prohibition on the grant of a dissolution of marriage.  It will be readily appreciated by Deputies that it would be inconsistent with that statement if we were not to oppose this motion which <Col N="1473" /> seeks leave to introduce a Bill designed to do precisely that.  On any issue as basic as this the Government should not be neutral but should oppose a piece of legislation for which, in their view, there is not any significant level of public support. The Government recognise and are deeply concerned about the hardship and suffering that arises for people whose marriages have broken down. However, to be in any way ambiguous about the possibility of divorce legislation would be misleading to those amongst them who might wish to avail themselves of divorce facilities in that it would hold out prospects that are unlikely to materialise.</P>
      <P>It would also be seriously disquieting to what I have no serious doubt constitutes the majority of our people who support the constitutional prohibition on divorce.  Any legislative proposal to hold a referendum would necessitate a full analysis of what a civil divorce law would entail.  I believe such an analysis at this stage would only serve to demonstrate the size of the existing majority opposed to such legislation and would not serve any useful social purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I should like to refer briefly to what is sometimes regarded as the related question of nullity.  There is some misunderstanding on the question of nullity.  It is simply not the case that the constitutional prohibition on divorce prohibits also changes in the civil law of nullity.  Attempts are made to suggest that the existence of a number of annulments that are not recognised in civil law is a problem that is created and made insoluble by our Constitution.  It is not. The Constitution does not prohibit changes in the law of nullity and the reasons for the problems are quite separate from the existence of the constitutional prohibition on divorce.  There are, however, very complex issues involved and these were recognised by the previous Government when they referred the matter to the Law Reform Commission. That nullity and divorce are separate concepts is shown by the fact that nullity is well known to the laws of <Col N="1474" /> other countries, even those which have divorce.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At the best of times the process of reform legislation in this State or in this House tends to be very slow and difficult. Before a measure can be put through the Houses of the Oireachtas, irrespective of what quarter it comes from or from which party it emanates, it requires a high degree of consensus and support and a recognition of its urgency.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question of the need to regulate the price of urban building land that consensus, by and large, has now been reached.  So far as the Labour Party are concerned there has been recognition for a long time of the paramount importance of the introduction of a Bill of this kind.  Indeed, the last Fianna Fáil Government recognised that some degree of response to the problem was required.  Consequently, they commissioned the Kenny Report.  We have now as a Member of this House a man who was a member of that committee.  I refer to Deputy O'Donoghue from whom I hope we shall be hearing during this debate which I understand will continue over a couple of weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thy Labour Party were requested in line with what was set out in our policy document and confirmed by way of a <Col N="1476" /> motion at our annual conference, to introduce such a Bill.  With the assistance of numerous Members of the Labour Party and of the people in the Bills Office, I spent the last year or so attempting to devise such a Bill.  I have attempted to bring in a Bill which meets the first test of being workable, both in terms of meeting the requirements of the Constitution and of being feasible of operation when it becomes law.  The Bill is designed in essence to control the cost of land required for building, whether it be agricultural land coming for the first time into the urban net or existing land being redeveloped for new urban use. The present situation is that such land, particularly agricultural land or land which has been under-utilised can obtain on the open market a price away in excess of its existing or intrinsic use value.  The difference between the existing use value and the market value is created solely by demand as a result of growth and expansion of the urban community. This value is in no way created by the individual landowner, land tenant or person with any form of interest in the land.  Under our Constitution and our present legal system the added community value created by the growth and expansion of the urban community can be captured by an individual land-owner who by accident of location is in a position to benefit from it.  That individual landowner can subsequently resell back to the community land at that increased price and retain the profit.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the provisions of the capital gains tax and the now defunct provisions of the wealth tax, the position is as I have described it.  If you could describe the history of the latter part of the nineteenth century in this country as a struggle from Fintan Lawlor down for the control of rural land, then we are coming to the stage where, in the last years of the twentieth century, our history in social terms could accurately be described as a struggle for control of urban land, and I shall conclude by quoting from Fintan Lawlor.</P>
    <P>What is the background to the situation that brought about the publication <Col N="1477" /> in March, 1973 of the Kenny Report and the present situation in June, 1980 where we still have no proposal to deal with the problems of urban building land?  Why is it necessary to deal with these problems?  The facts substantiate that this country and our society are faced with the task and challenge of urban growth, the growth of our population in absolute terms since the establishment of the State in 1921 and the shift of that population from a rural to an urban habitat.  The nation quite simply is moving house.  There is no more simple way to describe the enormous, constant and never ending shift from rural to urban Ireland.  This movement has gone on unabated since the foundation of the state. In 1920 or thereabouts approximately 20 to 25 per cent of our population lived in what would be described as urban areas&mdash;that is, towns with a population of more than 1,500&mdash;the balance living in rural Ireland.  According to the 1971 census&mdash;we do not have a breakdown of the latest census&mdash;the balance has shifted to 52 per cent in urban areas and 48 per cent in rural areas.  It is quite clear from existing trends that, even maintaining the census definition, by the end of this century the position will be all but reversed.  Eighty per cent or thereabouts will live in what are described as urban areas and 20 per cent in rural areas.  Indeed, if 20 per cent of our population live directly on and off the land, it would still be probably the highest percentage of agricultural population within the European Community as it then will be.  That growth is a phenomenon of Irish society which is not going to go away.</P>
    <P>Because of the rate and speed of that growth, the whole pattern of settlement evolved over the previous 300 years at least is now being reversed in the space of 80 to 90 years.  There was in consensus terms a recognition on all sides of this House of the need to confirm the expansion of urban Ireland and to plan and coordinate a settlement pattern for this island.</P>
    <P>In 1963 a former Minister of this House who is still a Deputy, Deputy Blaney, moved what I believe in many <Col N="1478" /> respects to be one of the most radical pieces of legislation of this House&mdash;the 1963 Planning and Development Act. This Act and the amended Act of 1976, combined to respond to how a society can regulate, in the interests of social justice and equity, the growth to which I have referred.  In that legislation a specific role for the local authorities as the planning authorities was set out to enable them to regulate, on behalf of the community and in the interests of the common good, the orderly development of our human settlements.  I now submit to the House that it has become effectively impossible for the local authorities as planning authorities to meet that objective which is enacted in our law if there is not available to them, and through them to the community, some mechanism or means to regulate the cost and supply of development land to the market in order to maintain some degree of social justice in our society.  If we do not empower local authorities, as planning authorities with the necessary legislative instruments, we shall be building into the bricks and mortars of our settlements the pattern of social injustice which it will be impossible to remove for many, many years.  There are enough inequalities in our society without their being cemented into the ground.  Yet the present situation is moving in such a way that this is what will result if we do not take action.</P>
    <P>I can understand why there is reluctance to take action.  We are products&mdash;and, indeed, sometimes prisoners&mdash;of our culture and background.  Most of us, if indeed not all, in first or second generation come from a rural past.  In my case my grandfathers left the land, not willingly, but in search of a better form of life.  The value system of that heritage has permeated to the present day.  It affects our attitudes and our willingness to interfere with the system of land tenure.  Indeed, to a certain extent it could be argued that it is embodied in the 1937 Constitution.  Such an attitude does not justify the most extraordinary increase in urban land prices that has occurred over the last 30 years.</P>
    <P>I should like to give the House some <Col N="1479" /> examples and to quote the first example in the Kenny Report of increased land prices:</P>
    <P>In 1938 a farm of land containing 128 acres with a substantial residence on it in Clondalkin, County Dublin, was purchased for £3,600 when it had no value as building land.  The lands have not yet been provided with services but in 1971 the Corporation of Dublin decided to acquire them for their building programme.  They negotiated an agreed purchase price of £192,075 with the owners.  This was reasonable having regard to prices which were being paid for similar land near Dublin.  There was no element of speculation whatever.  This is an increase in price of over 5,000 per cent between 1938 and 1971.</P>
    <P>That Report gives a series of examples, one more dramatic than the other, and they, obviously, only went up to 1971 or 1972.  The most recent up-dating of that study in terms of land prices is contained in a document produced by an agency of the Department of the Environment, An Foras Forbartha.  The author is Mr. R. Jennings, and the document is entitled &ldquo;Land Transactions and Prices in the Dublin Area.  1974-1978&rdquo;.  In essence that confirms the trend outlined in the first example in the Kenny Report.  In one of its general conclusions that report states:</P>
    <P>The price of private housing land transacted over the period increased five fold from about £500 in 1974 to £3,000 in 1978 per undeveloped house site.  The increases were not uniformly spread over the Dublin Area, but ranged from a six fold increase in the South Suburbs to a one-and-a-half fold increase in the New Town Areas.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that as a community we can afford to pay such massive transfers of wealth within our society and not at the end of the day produce a more unequal society.  I do not believe any party has a mandate here to increase the degree of inequality in our society. Yet, if we do not act and enable the community <Col N="1480" /> to retain the added-value which it alone creates, as illustrated in the two examples I quoted, that is precisely what we are doing.  In the early seventies, the Government responded to that pressure and established the Kenny Committee. Their report generally recommended that the law should be changed and that the principle of existing use value, plus an added percentage, should be the maximum amount a land owner would get in a designated area if the local authority needed to acquire that land or thought it was required for overall development.</P>
    <P>There were divided opinions on that committee and a minority report was produced.  However, all opinions were agreed that the question of the constitution might be at issue and confined themselves exclusively to the question of new land coming into the urban net for the first time.  They did not address themselves to the even more critical problem of the redevelopment of inner city land or land which had ceased to be used for its original purpose and was in the process of transition.  I share the view that the Kenny Report was inadequate and I regret that successive Governments have not brought forward a legislative proposal which in part would meet the positive aspects of the findings in that report and add to them a measure which would enable the local authority to respond to the question of existing development land coming on to the market for the second, third or subsequent time.</P>
    <P>Our Bill will enable just that. Basically, the Bill has three parts.  It enables a local authority to assess what is required or considered to be the total area of land, both existing and new, which will be required for development and expansion of the urban population in a forthcoming period of five years.  It is open to the process of public participation and consultation in so far as it proposes that the local authority's assessment of that designated area should go on public exhibition and the ordinary public, as individuals, would have the right to make submissions to extend or amend in whatever way they <Col N="1481" /> thought fit the proposed designated area. Under the Bill a local authority would have to take into account such submissions after the process of public exhibition had been undertaken.  Ultimately, it would be the reserve function of the councillors of that local authority to define the designated area.  That designated area then would go to the Minister for the Environment who could confirm in whole or in part, or refuse to confirm, the proposal of the local authority.  In other words, an open democratic consultative procedure which could not be described as authoritarian, confiscatory or bureaucratic, a procedure modelled on the process of development planning as set out in the 1963 Act and used, in part, because of the familiarity of the Department, the local authorities and, at this stage, the public with that process.  It is a procedure which the Government and the Minister used in relation to the Act dealing with toll roads.</P>
    <P>The second section of the Bill provides that having designated the area required the local authority alone will be the body entitled to purchase land in that area. Obviously, it would not need all the land for its own use and it would consequently be empowered to purchase land and sell it on to interested bodies concerned and involved in the development process of our urban areas for the provision of everything ranging from churches and places of religious worship to industrial employment, the entire spectrum of urban activity which requires land.  It would be the local authority alone that would be empowered to purchase the land.  The final section establishes the process whereby, in the absence of an agreement, a lands tribunal would be established and the process of arbitration and compensation clearly set out.</P>
    <P>On the question of land purchase by a local authority there is now a second argument riding parallel to the initial one of equity which makes it imperative that a local authority have this power.  It is my view as a working politician, a former member of a local authority and as a professional architect and planner that <Col N="1482" /> the present Act dealing with planning and development casts local authorities in the role of a referee in the football match analogy of the development process.  As such it can regulate and comment on, and, periodically, blow the whistle on the process of urban development but it cannot effectively direct or control it.  I believe the second provision in the Bill, that of the unique purchase, will enable the local authority to move from the passive position of being a referee, frequently powerless in the face of the development process, to be the prime mover, co-ordinator and body that can regulate the rate and scale of urban growth.  It is that power and facility which will enable the local authority to ensure that the growth occurs in certain areas in a co-ordinated and comprehensive fashion and most important of all&mdash;the Minister will accept this&mdash;in accordance with the available capital funds for such a development.</P>
    <P>The scale of urban growth is placing such an extraordinary demand on our requirements for services of an infrastructural nature, for facilities both social and educational and additional ones such as recreation and religious that, as an urban community, we cannot afford them if they are not approached in a co-ordinated and integrated fashion. The absence of such powers to local authorities ensures that urban development around our towns and cities is occurring in an unco-ordinated and scattered fashion which is imposing an enormous drain on the resources from the Custom House to each local authority. As regards the capital and current account budgets for each local authority, it is no fault of the Minister involved as it is reasonable to argue that every Minister for the Environment will be faced with the same problem when the irrationalities of the capitalist system continue to swing from boom to slump. That problem, even in a planned economy, will not go away.  We are going through an historical process of change which will settle out in about 20 years.  We have only that length of time to respond to it.</P>
    <P>At present, because of the unco-ordinated <Col N="1483" /> way it is occurring we are getting a haphazard unco-ordinated growth in our urban environment which results in some people, whose cheque books are large enough, can buy a home in a place with adequate facilities while other people, not in that position, cannot. They have to try to create a home in an area where the supports do not exist and will not for about five or ten years. The most graphic memory I have of that description was a constituent of mine in search of a house in Ringsend coming to me and my telling her that at that time there was no possibility of her getting a house locally but given her position on the points system she could reasonably expect a house in the outer suburbs.  It would have been no more than six or seven miles from where we were both sitting and her response was that it was so far out from the urban areas that she knew and derived support from that she would need a passport to live that far away.  That is not a prejudice against rural suburban Ireland.  It was a straightforward recognition that an area where there were no schools or post office, where she could not have a telephone for five years and where the bus services did not extend would provide no possibility for her, her husband or children to create a home out of a house if her husband was to maintain his job as a shift worker in the Irish Glass Bottle Company.  That is the reality for many people.  We are a long way from the two- and three-car family. Given the current price of energy I do not see us achieving it.  The creation of urban estates without the necessary facilities is posing major problems for people.</P>
    <P>The problem is current in the newspapers and recognised frequently. There have been numerous articles and requests for action.  The most recent was carried in yesterday's <i>Irish Times</i> under the by-line of Frank Kilfeather who has watched and commented on the process of urban growth in the Dublin area for many years.  He is the longest serving local government correspondent of <Col N="1484" /> any newspaper.  In his article under the title &ldquo;Gentlemen Farmers&rdquo; he states:</P>
    <P>The situation at present is that most local authorities throughout the country cannot afford to buy land banks; they cannot compete with the speculators because land prices have got so much out of hand.  Dublin Corporation is finding it almost impossible to build in the city and most of their houses are now being constructed in the county area.  Land in the county is also expensive but Dublin County Council refused to change the Development Plan density of ten dwellings to the acre to the 15 or 20 to the acre that the City Council would like.  There are between 5,000 and 6,000 families on the housing list in Dublin; 500 families are squatting in Corporation dwellings.</P>
    <P>We know from the census figures that the pressure is not going to go away and that the cost of accumulating a land bank is becoming so expensive that local authorities simply are not proceeding to do so.  If the argument is so clear what are the reservations and what is preventing them from doing what we all know must be done?  The two previous Governments accepted in principle the response of the Kenny Report.  It is embodied in Article 43 of the Constitution. I should like to put on record the section of that Article which enables a measure like this to meet the constitutional test.  I accept it is a valid criticism for anyone in the House to say that while they agree with the principles set out in the Bill it would appear to be in conflict with the provisions in the Constitution.  Article 43 (2) 1 states:</P>
    <P>The State recognises, however, that the exercise of the rights mentioned in the foregoing provisions of this Article, ought, in civil society, to be regulated by the principles of social justice.</P>
    <P>2º The State, accordingly may as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of the said rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1485" /> The phrase &ldquo;the exigencies of the common good&rdquo; is embodied in the long title of our Bill, not by any coincidence but to meet that provision.  I do not believe the Constitution of 1937 was ever designed either by Dr. McQuaid or by the late Eamon de Valera to enable fortuitous and accidental landowners on the periphery of urban areas to capture for themselves the community created value of urban growth.  I do not believe, in fairness to both gentlemen, that they were capable of foreseeing the urban growth that has taken place.  In relation to Eamon de Valera he was opposed to it.  He belonged to a time and era which would have preferred us to maintain our rural past rather than our urban present and future.  One cannot prevent the process of social change, much as one would like to.  It is critical and important that we recognise what that process is, why it is, what is determining it and how we respond to it so that we constantly relate to it and attempt to ensure that the basic principle of social justice is made more feasible rather than more difficult and less feasible.</P>
    <P>For reasons I do not understand&mdash;and on which the Minister might elaborate with the assistance of the expertise in his Department&mdash;both in the minority report of the Kenny Report and frequently by way of replies to parliamentary questions from former Deputy Kevin Boland and others, there has been some constitutional fear about taking land into controlled price ownership, that somehow or other it would be repugnant to the Constitution.  It seems to me that the balance has always come down on the side of the individual against the exigencies of the common good.  Yet there is no proposal in either the Kenny Report, with its existing use value plus 25 per cent, or in the Labour Party Bill before the House to take away or confiscate property, no proposal whatsoever.  There is a proposal to compensate people whose property is compulsorily acquired.  There is the proposal, as set out in section 15 of the Act and in the accompanying Schedule to our Bill, to compensate people who wish to continue the activity of farming to the extent <Col N="1486" /> that the cost of re-location, in addtion to the acquisition of a new farm, can be provided for.</P>
    <P>I do not see in any clause of the Constitution that the inalienable right to private property confers on the citizens of this State the inalienable right to the maximum market price they can screw out of the community.  I have read the Constitution and all the arguments surrounding this and I have yet to come across that particular clause.  I really do not believe it is there because if it were then the present Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism would be in contempt of the Constitution because he exercises a system of price control. There are certain commodities sold by traders throughout this country whose price is regulated, who could get more for their commodity if the full, open market was allowed to prevail, but they are not so allowed.  There are price control provisions enacted in this House which have never been tested or found to be repugnant to the Constitution.  It appears that we can control the maximum price for stout, butter and meat, but when it comes to the sacred question of land then we are talking about something different and the provisions of the Constitution mysteriously come into operation.</P>
    <P>That brings me back to the kernel of this matter, which is our attitude to land in the 1980s, our attitude to land in the twentieth century.  Each one of us in this House has in our memory cells the history of the land struggle of the last 200 to 300 years.  We are in essence the children, if not the grand-children, of a peasant people.  The very basis of our survival was related to our ability to hold and own productive land.  The struggle of Irish history and of the Irish people could be told simply through the history of the land struggle.  We should not allow ourselves to become prisoners of our past.  We should not allow ourselves to become trapped by patterns, values and attitudes, valid in their own time but which no longer have relevance to today's needs.  The land struggle of the 1880s was one of a people for survival, <Col N="1487" /> to own land, to grow food with which to feed themselves.</P>
    <P>I believe that in a period of rapid urban growth&mdash;and we have now the fastest urban growth of any member state of the EEC&mdash;the last 20 years of this decade will be a struggle for urban land.  If we do not regulate its price, if we do not as a community keep to ourselves the added value we create instead of allowing it to be highjacked or taken away, then at the end of the twentieth century we will have built into the bricks and mortar of our society a human settlement pattern which will be fundamentally unjust in that it will render it more difficult for people with limited means to exercise urban choice or avail themselves of urban facilities because of the way in which land is allocated.</P>
    <P>The Jennings Report talked about land prices increasing six times in some areas, the south city area, and one-and-a-half times in the new towns of the western area of the city.  There is a reason for that; there are more facilities, resources and opportunities on the south city side than there are on the western side and that is reflected in those land values.  I believe all parties share the view&mdash;but the Labour Party particularly are fundamentally committed to it&mdash;that if we want to create a socially just society we must begin to construct a stage upon which social justice is at least a possibility.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude with a quotation from James Fintan Lalor, who is described as patriot and political essayist in a book on his writings published by The Talbot Press Limited in 1919 with a preface by Arthur Griffith.  Lalor, addressing himself to the nineteenth century land struggle and to the land owners of that day after the Great Famine, said&mdash;and this applies line by line to today:</P>
    <P>The rights of property may be pleaded.  No one has more respect for the real rights of property than I have; but I do not class among them the robber's right by which the lands of this country are now held in fee for the <Col N="1488" /> British crown.  I acknowledge no right of property in a small class which goes to abrogate the rights of a numerous people.  I acknowledge no right of property in eight thousand persons, be they noble or ignoble, which takes away all rights of property, security, independence, and existence itself, from a population of eight millions, and stands in bar to all the political rights of the island, and all the social rights of its inhabitants.  I acknowledge no right of property which takes away the food of millions, and gives them a famine&mdash;which denies to the peasant the right of a home, and concedes, in exchange, the right of a workhouse.  I deny and challenge all such rights, howsoever founded or enforced.  I challenge them, as founded only on the code of the brigand, and enforced only by the sanction of the hangman.  Against them I assert the true and indefeasible right of property&mdash;the right of our people to live in this land and possess it&mdash;to live in it in security, comfort and independence, and to live in it by their own labour, on their own land, as God and nature intended them to do.</P>
    <P>Lalor, an Irish patriot and poet, talking from his own direct experience of the nineteenth century, was forecasting something to which we must now respond.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett) Sylvester Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is presumably to tackle the problem of the high price of building land, particularly land for housing, and to try to ensure that increases in the value of building land resulting from investment in infrastructure by local authorities is not &ldquo;creamed off&rdquo; by individual landowners or speculators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are in complete agreement with this objective, and possible methods of achieving it are at present under consideration in my Department in conjunction with other interested Departments.  The Bill, however illustrates in a striking way the pitfalls for <Col N="1489" /> those who opt for an easy, ready-made solution without taking account of the constitutional, administrative and financial problems which beset the question of building land prices.  The Bill, far from achieving its intended purpose, would if it were ever to come into effect, cause chaos in the programmes for public and private building; it would put local authorities in an impossible position and it would freeze completely the market for land in the &ldquo;designated&rdquo; areas.</P>
    <P>In order to appreciate clearly what the Bill would mean if it became law it is well worth while considering again some of its main provisions.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to enable local authorities to designate land which may be required for housing or factories or for the purposes of expansion or development over a period of five years ahead.  Designation will be a function of the elected members.  The most extraordinary consequences would flow from the decision to designate in so far as the designated areas are concerned.  The local authority would be obliged to proceed to acquire all the lands in the designated area.  The basis of compensation for acquisition would not be market value but what is called &ldquo;existing use value&rdquo;.  This means that the compensation would be restricted to what the lands would be worth if they could never be used for any purposes other than those for which they were being used at the date when the question of compensation was referred to the special lands tribunal to be set up under this bill.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that with this basis of compensation land owners will not be willing to sell their lands, and the Bill then obliges the local authority to proceed to acquire the property by compulsory acquisition.  But on compulsory acquisition the basis of compensation is not market value but existing use value. Here again it requires no stretch of the imagination to be certain that owners of affected property would resist compulsory acquisition by every means in their power, including recourse to the courts.  The acquisition of every plot of <Col N="1490" /> ground in designated areas would be fought out long and bitterly.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that the designated area is the area marked out by the local authority as the area where &ldquo;lands will probably be used during the following five years for the purpose of providing sites for houses or factories or for the purpose of expansion or development&rdquo;. The local authority in marking out the designated area would be required to have regard to their development plan for the area.  I think it follows from this that lands outside the designated areas would be unsuited for development for one reason or another. They would be lands where the local authority did not desire or intend development to take place over the coming five years at any rate.</P>
    <P>Thus, the designated area is the area set aside for development by both the public and the private sector.  But all development effectively would be stifled by the problems of land acquisition to which I have just referred.  The long battles over acquisition would range from futile negotiation to compulsory acquisition and on to court cases based on constitutional and other grounds leading to years of stalemate.</P>
    <P>Is there a possibility that private enterprise may be able to get on with the job of building and development even if the local authority have been brought to a standstill?  I do not think so.  The Bill appears to visualise that the local authority will proceed to acquire all land in a designated area.  It also provides specifically that nobody may purchase any lands in a designated area which a local authority are empowered to acquire except with consent of the local authority.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that planning permission may be refused for the development of land simply on the ground that such land is included in a designated area.  Furthermore, no compensation is payable in respect of a refusal of planning permission where the refusal was on the grounds that the site of the planning application was in designated area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1491" /> If these obstacles are not enough to inhibit housing and other forms of commercial and industrial development by the private sector, there are further restraints and controls provided for in the Bill.  If a local authority had succeeded in acquiring land in a designated area and had decided to dispose of it for development to any person, that person as well as being required to have planning permission, must develop the land &ldquo;in a manner specified and on conditions and terms agreed by the local authority&rdquo;. He must also commence the work within two years from the date on which he enters into possession of the land and complete the development before the expiration of five years.  With all these obstacles the Bill would succeed very effectively in putting the private sector as well as the public sector out of the business of development.</P>
    <P>This Bill, if implemented, would mean that the responsibility for deciding the lands which would come within the designated areas would be placed on the elected members of local authorities. This raises the question as to whether it is a reasonable proposition to ask elected members to draw the lines on a map which decide the divide between the farmers and landowners, who will have their lands compulsorily acquired at prices depressed below market value from those who would get market value. Another problem would be created by requiring elected members to decide when property in centres of cities and towns is being under-utilised and should therefore be taken from its owners.</P>
    <P>It is important to see the difference between designation under this Bill and the ordinary process of zoning for development which is part of the work of a local authority in preparing their development plan.  Land for designation would probably be land which has already been zoned for development in the development plan of the local authority.  Designation under the Bill is the process by which the councillors of a local authority will mark down all the land required for all forms of development <Col N="1492" /> for the following five years.  All that land will be acquired by the local authority, by compulsion if necessary, and the compensation is to be not what the land would sell for in the open market but what it would sell for if it could never be used for any purpose except what it is being used for at present. Therefore, if at present the land is being used as a farm or market garden, or if it consists of a disused storage yard or old sheds, the compensation for compulsory acquisition will ignore completely the potential of the site and be related entirely to its present use.</P>
    <P>Is it realistic to expect local councils to engage in the exercise of designation of areas in these circumstances?  In a society where the rights of private property are generally accepted most local councillors and other public representatives would find serious difficulty in implementing the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Whilst local authorities at present seek to maintain reasonable banks of land for public housing, they provide very little land at the moment for private housing which requires an average 19,000 sites a year.  The proposals in this Bill mean the local authorities would have to provide sites for this development in designated areas, areas by definition of greatest housing need.  Every piece of this land would probably have to be acquired compulsorily.  This would be slow&mdash;if due process were not followed the courts would quash the compulsory purchase orders.  It is likely that a majority of cases would be hung up in the courts anyway.  All this would slow up necessary development.</P>
    <P>In the suggested rules for assessment of compensation, apart from their constitutionality which I will return to, have Deputy Quinn and other members of the Labour Party given any thought to the predicament that farmers and other landowners would find themselves in if these proposals were implemented?  Initially a good deal of the land in designated areas would be owned by farmers; eventually most of the land would be owned by farmers.  If compensation <Col N="1493" /> on the lines suggested in this Bill was fixed for such land, farmers who wished to remain in farming would find difficulty in replacing their holdings.  They would have to seek alternative land in non-designated areas where existing market arrangements for land transactions would apply.  How could affected farmers compete for such land with the compensation proposed in the Bill?  Even the compensation proposed in the Kenny Majority Report which is 25 per cent higher than proposed in this Bill would in all probability prove inadequate.  It would require considerably higher compensation than is proposed in this Bill to ensure that farmers who have been compulsorily evicted could relocate in non-designated areas without any loss to themselves or their families.  The cost of implementing the scheme suggested in this Bill would of course depend on the extent to which local authorities exercised the power to acquire lands within designated areas.  Even if local authorities were to confine their acquisition activities to land required for housing only, and if one were to assume that a substantial proportion of it could be acquired at existing use value, the cost of a year's land requirements would be in the region of £12 million, and of course if the local authorities were to acquire a reasonable bank of such land, the cost could be considerably greater.</P>
    <P>On the basis of an overall land bank for the five year period envisaged in the Bill, the cost could be something in the region of £120 million.  There could be some change if the scheme were confined initially to the major developing areas, but this would not be very great. As land is sold back to developers, part of these costs would be recovered but there would be a substantial initial gap. An enormous amount of capital would be required to operate this scheme and it would be some considerable time before any return would be shown.  Circumstances are not ideal for contemplating such a massive diversion of scarce resources.</P>
    <P>Another point worth mentioning is the effect these proposals could have on the <Col N="1494" /> development plans of local authorities. One of the purposes of these development plans is to help to secure the overall proper planning and development of the local area.  There is the danger in the type of solution proposed in this Bill that the supply of building land in designated areas could dry up.  This would increase pressure for development in the non-designated areas.  This, of course, would run counter to the aims of the local authority in their own development plans.  Development would stagnate in the areas where it should be taking place&mdash;the designated areas&mdash;and there would be great pressure to allow development to take place outside the designated areas.  In fact I fear very much that designated areas would become areas of stagnation.</P>
    <P>Apart from the financial difficulties and planning difficulties already mentioned, a scheme as suggested in this Bill, if it were to be implemented, would bring a serious risk of stifling building programmes by the introduction of a large and expensive layer of bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>The needs of the planning authorities for personnel to operate the scheme would be very substantial.  Local authorities already experience considerable difficulty in recruiting and having available adequate engineering, planning and other professional staff.  In addition, valuers and surveyors, who would be essential for the proper operation of this scheme, are in very short supply.  It is not possible to estimate how many additional staff would be needed but a figure of 500 to include professional and administrative staff seems reasonable. These additional layers of officials would be intervening in the operation of the building and development industry and slowing it down.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the constitutional problems associated with any proposal to acquire land by compulsion in a manner such as proposed in this Bill.  As already mentioned, there has been a long history of attempts to find a satisfactory solution to the issues which arise because of, first, pressure on the supply <Col N="1495" /> of suitable land for housing and other public purposes and second, speculation in land expected to become ripe for development as a result of the provision of water, sewerage and other services by local authorities.  Numerous proposals have been considered over the years but they were rejected, and a major factor in this was the constitutional problem.</P>
    <P>My Department had in the past given much thought to proposals for amending the compensation code so that local authorities could acquire land at existing use value.  However, the legal advice given to them was firmly against such a proposal being acceptable on constitutional grounds.</P>
    <P>On the question of constitutionality, there are problems even in regard to the Kenny Majority Report proposals.  The majority Report recommended that their scheme when enacted should be submitted to the President of the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality.  The minority report considered that the majority report recommendations were unconstitutional. Major provisions in this present Bill, such as the provision in section 4 that the local authority be the designating authority, depart fundamentally from the provisions in the Kenny Majority Report which were specifically designed in relation to the constitutional issue.  This weakens even further any prospect of this Bill being constitutional.</P>
    <P>In view of the critical nature of the issue of constitutionality perhaps the Labour Party should have considered the possibility of proposing a constitutional amendment which would remove present constitutional protection of private property so that a scheme of land acquisition such as is envisaged in this Bill could be legally promoted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1496" /> If the proposals in this Bill were implemented they might curtail speculation in land, but only in designated areas and then only because transactions in land in these areas would cease altogether. However, proposals that give local authorities power to designate areas where they could acquire land at its existing use value, irrespective of its market value, would almost certainly fail to pass the constitutional test.  It is also certain that landowners will not sell land voluntarily and will resist compulsory acquisition by every means in their power. Housing, industrial, commercial and all kinds of development would be brought to a standstill in the designated areas. There would in consequence be pressure to carry out development outside the designated areas contrary to the development plan intentions of local authorities.</P>
    <P>The scheme in the Bill would also certainly be opposed by farmers who would lose their livelihood because of the compensation proposal.  It would also place intolerable burdens on the elected representatives of local authorities who would have to designate areas where lower compensation rates would apply and also decide on whether land was being used in a proper manner.  It would place an enormous strain on the finances of local authorities and indirectly on the Exchequer and would require, in addition to the staff required to service the proposed lands tribunal, substantial increases in the staffs of local authorities.</P>
    <P>As I stated in a reply to a parliamentary question recently, possible methods of dealing with building land costs are under consideration in my Department in conjunction with other interested Departments.  What I have said should indicate the complexity of the legal, financial and administrative problems which would have to be solved and I will not be in a position to formulate my own proposals for consideration by the Government until consideration of these issues is finalised.</P>
    <P>However, I have no intention of putting forward proposals that are certain to be found unconstitutional, nor am <Col N="1497" /> I going to recommend proposals that will be manifestly unjust to any section of the community.  I have also no wish to put forward a scheme the only outcome of which is a massive disruption in the building programme.</P>
    <P>There must be a reasonable prospect that any proposed solution will be an improvement on the existing position.  It must be framed within our existing Constitution and laws.  It must be capable of being implemented by our local and central authorities.  It must not give rise to new layers of bureaucracy in the areas of planning, house building and development generally.  It must not require capital moneys beyond the resources of the community to provide.  It must not bring doubt, delay and uncertainty into our housing and development programmes in the public and private sectors.</P>
    <P>I would point out that something similar to this has been tried on three occasions in the United Kingdom.  I am not saying that we should follow the line taken in that country but we can sometimes learn from what has happened there.  A similar type of legislation was introduced by the Attlee Government in 1947 known as the Town and Country Planning Act and this Act provided that all development rights in undeveloped land should rest in the State.  This Act failed to provide the land and was rescinded by the next Government in 1953.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Act failed and this is a matter about which the Deputy can find out.  The Land Commission Act of 1967 under the Wilson Government introduced the betterment levy of 110 per cent of current use value.  This Act was repealed in 1970 because it had no effect and did not serve this purpose.  A further <Col N="1498" /> Act was passed under the Callaghan Government in 1975 which provided for a development land tax and this Act was repealed in November 1979, again following a change of Government.  It was the performance under the Bill which really mattered and it did not succeed in achieving the desired ends.</P>
      <P>One part of that legislation was not rescinded and it concerns the land authority in Wales.  This body still operates reasonably successfully.  The main difference between the operation of this authority and the proposal in this Bill is that the land authority buy land on the open market when it is offered for sale by public auction or by any other means.  They bid with other possible customers and this is the method by which they acquire land.  That system works in a reasonable manner in Wales.</P>
      <P>The most important point in this legislation concerns the method of compensation. Deputy Quinn refers to existing use value but it is the market value which is important.  Under the CPO system the artibrator can decide the market value, not the current use value, and base his valuation accordingly.  This is a much more fair system than the system proposed in Deputy Quinn's Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn mentioned that there was provision in the Bill to compensate farmers who would be obliged to sell their land for the disturbance this caused.  It is stated in section 23 that the tribunal may award to such persons such compensation for the expenses caused by the removal to other premises as it shall consider just.  That sounds like removal expenses, as distinct from disturbance compensation.  I do not think that provision would tempt anyone to sell his land.</P>

      <P>The question of the establishment of a National Folk Museum has been considered from time to time by the authorities of the National Museum and my Department.  There are no immediate plans for the establishment of such a museum as it is considered that there are other aspects of the museum service to which priority has to be accorded in the matter of requirements for improvement and expansion.</P>

      <P>Since 1952 there has, by agreement, been no immigration control on the movement of persons between Britain.  Northern Ireland and the State. A necessary concommitant is a measure of co-operation between the two immigration services.  This is recognised formally in Article 5 (2) (j) of the Aliens Order 1946 (at present inserted by Article 3 of the Aliens (Amendment) Order 1975, (S.I. No. 12B of 1975)) which empowers an immigration officer to refuse leave to land to an alien coming to the State from a place not in Britain or Northern Ireland if he is satisfied that the alien &ldquo;intends to travel, whether immediately or not, to Great Britain or Northern Ireland and the officer is satisfied that the alien would not qualify for admission to Great Britain or Northern Ireland if he arrived there from a place other than the State&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>There has been no unnecessary delay in this matter.  The application was received at the end of July 1979 and, because of certain aspects of the case, some special inquiries had to be made.  The applicant was informed by letter dated 25 February 1980, that I was not prepared to grant a certificate of naturalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1380" /> Following a further application, the applicant was informed, by letter dated 23 April 1980, that I would be prepared to consider an application again in a year from then.  That implies that the reservations I have in this case might no longer obtain after that interval, but at this stage I cannot say how the matter will stand 12 months or so from now.</P>

      <P>In the case of energy, my Department maintain close liaison with the Department of Energy on the question of ensuring a continuous supply for agricultural purposes.  In times of restricted supply, agriculture and horticulture have been included among the essential services to be given a priority rating for supplies by that Department.  In addition, my Department promote through leaflets, articles and the advisory services ways and means of conserving energy usage in agriculture.  Farmers are also encouraged to have sufficient oil storage capacity to ensure an uninterrupted supply of oil during peak seasons.</P>
      <P>On the horticulture side my Department were represented on a technical group set up by An Foras Talúntais to study the long-term energy needs of the glasshouse industry.  The report of the group was published recently and is under consideration.</P>
      <P>With regard to fertilisers, the country is now self-sufficient in the production of nitrogen but, as there are no deposits of either phosphorus or potassium here, it is necessary to import the raw materials for these fertilisers.  Farmers are also being advised on the storage and most efficient use of farmyard manure including slurry.</P>
      <P>Regarding protein feed, my Department operate EEC aid schemes to encourage production of feed such as dried grassmeal, peas and field beans for animal feed.  The subsidies which are provided for the use of skim milk powder and liquid skim milk in animal feeds help to reduce dependence on imported protein feed.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disablement benefit under the Occupational Injuries Scheme on 26 September 1979 in respect of accidents which occurred on 7 April 1979 and 19 May 1979.  A claim for injury benefit in respect of the accident on 19 May 1979 was then under investigation and interim disability benefit was being paid pending a decision regarding injury benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Injury benefit is payable for a maximum period of 26 weeks from the date of the accident and normally disablement benefit is payable when injury benefit ceases if the insured person is disabled as a result of the occupational accident. One of the qualifying conditions for disablement benefit is that the accident should have arisen out of and in the course of insurable employment.  Inquiries <Col N="1390" /> in this regard from the employers were necessary.  It had been determined in January 1980 in connection with the claim for injury benefit that the accident on 19 May 1979 was an occupational accident.  Further inquiries were necessary regarding the accident on 7 April 1979 and the necessary report was received on 29 February 1980.  Owing to unavoidable delay, however, in associating the report with the earlier injury benefit claim, it was not determined until 15 May 1980 that the accident on 7 April 1979 was an occupational accident.</P>
    <P>Arrangements have been made for an examination of the claimant on 10 June 1980 by a medical referee in order to assess the degree of disablement.  A decision on the claim to disablement benefit will then be made and payment of any disablement benefit due will be issued as soon as possible.  Any such payment will be in addition to the disability benefit and pay-related benefit currently being paid to him.</P>

      <P>An official of my Department called to the person concerned on Wednesday, 28 May 1980.  While she stated that she was anxious to receive a separate pension book in respect of the adult dependant's allowance payable in respect of her on her husband's old age (contributory) pension she would not permit the official to speak to her husband who, she said, was at present seriously ill.</P>
      <P>Separate pension books cannot be issued without the husband being interviewed and informed of the reasons that separate pension books are considered necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears, however, that she may be entitled to a non-contributory pension in <Col N="1391" /> her own right which would be at a higher rate than the adult dependant's allowance at present payable in respect of her.  In this connection a social welfare officer called to her on Thursday, 29 May 1980 with a claim form for non-contributory pension.</P>
    <P>A decision on her claim will be given as soon as possible.</P>
