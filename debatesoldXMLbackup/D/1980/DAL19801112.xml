      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 33 to 35 and in page 4, to delete lines 1 to 3 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) In addition and without prejudice to any specific functions given to it by this Act, the Board shall assist and encourage by any means it considers appropriate the making of films in the State and the development of an industry in the State for the making of films and assist in the promotion and distribution of films made in the State and may engage in the establishment of a national film archive and in any other activity which it is empowered by this Act to engage in.  Specifically the Board shall have as one of its primary functions the assistance and promotion of Irish film culture.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us on this side of the House recognise that we are discussing two pieces of legislation which are interconnected and both of which are enabling pieces of legislation, enabling the film studio facility at Ardmore to be put on a more sound and effective footing and also enabling the film board to promote the making of films in this country by foreigners and by <Col N="161" /> Irish personnel in all sections of the industry.  It is not our function to tell the board how to do their job but it is our function to ensure that the board are not inhibited by this legislation from promoting an Irish film industry to the utmost. Accordingly, in this, the first substantial amendment to the legislation, we have tabled our amendment after consideration and after discussion with representatives of the film industry here.</P>
    <P>During the Second Stage debate, Deputy Desmond and I referred to the considered and mature representations that had been made in respect of the legislation by three bodies &mdash; the film section of the ITGWU, the Arts Council and the Association of Irish Film Producers.  In this section, where we are talking about the actual board and about what they can do, we believe that the acceptance of our amendment will not inhibit in any way the objective that the Minister has sought in bringing the legislation before the House in the first place.  Undoubtedly, acceptance of the amendment would enable the board to do a certain number of things which are not possible for them to do at present.  The Minister has considerable experience of semi-State companies having been set up in the past under restrictive legislation in terms of their functions and of Ministers coming back to the House subsequently either seeking additional capital or broadening the terms of reference to enable a board to do something that they were prevented from doing within the terms of the legislation.</P>
    <P>There are two parts to this amendment. The first is at the core of what this whole debate is about so far as the Labour Party are concerned and so far as the Irish film industry are concerned, that is, the effective promotion of Irish-based personnel in producing Irish films for domestic and international consumption, with the maximum utilisation of Irish resources and in such a way that the expertise gained in the making of such films can be retained within the industry, to be improved on, to be developed and subsequently to be re-utilised in the making of further films.  This is the reason for <Col N="162" /> the amendment being worded as it is.</P>
    <P>The House may recall that on Second Stage we talked in terms of a split in the direction of funding along the lines of 80 per cent of available funding going to Irish-type productions and 20 per cent going to encourage large international or multi-national productions.  That 80-20 per cent split was one that was suggested by the industry, but we would be willing to talk in terms of various kinds of splits. I do not think that we would have either the necessary expertise or the finance to allow us to be hard and fast on any such split, but the ratio given is an indication of what might be the case.  If we were to insist on, say, an 80-20 split, we would be intruding unnecessarily on the area of flexibility that the film board must retain for themselves; but there would not be any intrusion if we include this clause which makes it clear that the board should have regard to promoting an Irish film industry in the way set out and in a way that is not manifestly clear in the Bill as it stands.  At the outset the board should be clear as to what they are enabled to do and as to what they are being encouraged to do.</P>
    <P>The second point relates to a national film archive.  During Second Stage the Minister indicated that he was not very keen on this idea.  The archive is an integral part of promoting and developing an Irish film industry.  There has not been any State assistance in this regard, but some very interesting films have been made here down through the years of the industry.  The nature of the technology at that time has put much of that film material at risk.  It is scattered in various libraries. Mr. Morrison, whom most of us will remember for his work on the films <i>Mise Éire</i> and <i>Saoirse</i>, compiled much of his material from primary sources and demonstrated the wealth of material that is available.  We should ensure at the outset that the film board are not under any misapprehension as to their entitlement to promote and assist the establishment of a national film archive.</P>
    <P>We are talking about enabling legislation. I got the impression from what was said on Second Stage that a very narrow interpretation of the legislation on the <Col N="163" /> part of the film board in the future could preclude them from becoming involved in any way in helping to establish a national film archive.  Accordingly, we have included that objective in our amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse what has been said on the amendment.  As Deputy Quinn has pointed out, there are two aspects to the amendment; one concerns the promotion and distribution of films throughout the world.  While there is a loose reference in the Bill to the fact that the board may engage in activities from time to time, which I assume would include something like this, it is not spelt out specifically.  If we are serious about the film industry here we must realise that an integral part of that industry is the export of our commodity.  We have for many years indulged in very strong export drives for our manufactured goods.</P>
      <P>The film business has a very strong export potential.  It is accepted that with the right atmosphere, circumstances and financial assistance we can become very good at this type of business so we should not lose sight of the export potential. Unless the board are conscious of that potential we are falling down badly on one very important aspect of this industry, or of any industry where, because of our size, we cannot hope to have a viable industry if we are to depend on internal consumption.  There is no country big enough to rely totally on its own consumption because of the nature of filming. The USA and other large countries engaged in the film business are very conscious of the export potential of that business.  They have very strong export drives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The part of the amendment which is concerned specifically with the distribution and promotion of Irish films abroad is absolutely essential if we are to ensure the viability of this industry.  It would be a pity at this stage if, when for the first time we are coming to grips with this industry and laying down some ground in legislation, this particular aspect of film making was overlooked.  I fail to understand the reluctance of the Minister to <Col N="164" /> include this, which ought to be a legitimate part of the activities of the board. He has shown himself to be very strong on the export end of his Department in relation to other areas.  I see no reason why he should not be as concerned about the export aspect of this industry.</P>
    <P>The part of the amendment dealing with an archive is also very important because while we are talking here we are losing out through neglect, lack of facilities and possibly ignorance.  Many fine pieces of film which should be housed and looked after in a film archive are being damaged.  This is something which cannot be deferred indefinitely because of the cumulative damage.  Future generations will not look very kindly on us if we do not grasp the nettle now and provide the facilities whereby our children and our grandchildren can look back and view the progress made in the industry by the people who pioneered it.</P>
    <P>The cultual and historical aspect of films is being lost in many cases because we have no archive.  An archive is an integral part of the industry and it is an aspect of the industry which cannot be put back because of the cumulative loss which is going on all the time.</P>
    <P>The third part of this amendment concerns the preference given to the Irish made product as against that made elsewhere. While there may be problems associated with our membership of the EEC other countries seem to be able to provide some protection to their national film industry.  I see no reason why we should not attempt to do this.  I am sure the draftsmen should be able to come up with some format which would get over this problem caused by our membership of the EEC.  If we are to ensure the success of this venture and the State involvement in it, it is only natural to assume that the board would look more kindly at the national aspect of the industry as against that provided by outside agencies in relation to film making.  This amendment has been put forward by people who are nationally minded, concerned about this Irish industry and its success in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, as we <Col N="165" /> know from the debate on Second Stage, appears to accept that Irish film makers should receive particular support and special encouragement from the board.  Our quarrel with him at this stage is that we have a rather modest promotional amendment to the Bill but he is not prepared to accept it.  Perhaps in his reply he will agree to accept it.  A strong case can be made to the Minister that there should be some formal structure in the Bill so that some particular legislative encouragement will be given to the board to act in this direction.  We find the Bill deficient in this regard.  Trade unions involved in the industry and Irish film makers have a legitimate and entirely genuine view on this matter.  The Minister should ensure that the board are given reasonably clear guidelines so that Irish film makers are given support.  Where loans are given, we should ensure that the Irish sector of the industry have an opportunity to contribute to the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our amendment we used the words &ldquo;shall assist and encourage&rdquo;.  I do not think we could have made the wording any weaker without making it devoid of meaning.  We have used the words &ldquo;assist in the promotion and distribution of films made in the State&rdquo;.  We have not put imperative obligations on the board but we think it would be useful if guidelines were laid down.  In this connection, I should like to mention the six guidelines contained in the legislation relating to Fóir Teoranta.  They can give assistance to Irish industry along specific guidelines and providing an applicant meets the six guidelines set out in the Act he is likely to get a loan to stave off bankruptcy.  We think it would be very useful to place a stricture on the board in this instance, even in the mild terms we propose here, to ensure that the board shall endeavour to discharge their obligations in this respect.  The Minister has indicated his opinion and the view of his advisers in the preparation of this Bill that the Community might regard this as being an unduly protectionist clause.  The Minister is experienced in such matters and he knows that whether one is arguing about <Col N="166" /> the protection of the textile or footwear industry or the granting of special incentives to promote industrial development one can argue quite vehemently to the Commission that legislation on that line would not be contrary to the treaty or to the prohibitions contained in the rules of competition or to giving aid to certain sectors.  I think the Minister is being unduly cautious in his reluctance to accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to the Danish Cinematograph Act as amended in 1977.  That Act was promulgated on 7 June 1972 and amended on 8 June 1977.  Section 11 of that Act speaks of &ldquo;loans or guarantee for loans for the production of Danish films and co-produced films&rdquo; section 21&mdash;I am quoting from Chapter 7 of the translation under the heading &ldquo;Danish films and co-produced films&rdquo;&mdash;states &ldquo;for the purpose of this Act a Danish film means a film shot in Danish with predominantly Danish artistic and technical personnel&rdquo;. I am sure there is similar legislation in the other member states.  As the Minister knows, the French are adept at giving special privileges to their own industries and this has been particularly evident in the cultural area.  I have no doubt the Commission would be prepared to accept the rather weak preferential clause in the legislation we are discussing here today.  We deliberately worded our amendment in this way because we consider that while there should not be a total and absolutely rigid obligation on the board in this respect nevertheless it is desirable that they should have a finger continually pointed at them.  We consider our amendment would be useful.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.  In examining the dozen bodies that have come before the committee, it has struck me frequently that the legislative framework dealing with the establishment of the bodies has been rather weak, generalised and even vague.  In some cases it is practically open for a coach-and-four to be driven through it by the boards concerned. I think this has been because of the lack of coherent thinking when the <Col N="167" /> bodies were set up and a lack of precision on the part of legislators when they came to consider the Bills going through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I am not proposing that this Bill should be inward looking.  I think there should be an opportunity to develop the Irish film industry on a self-generation basis with assistance from the board.</P>
    <P>We have also referred in the amendment to assistance in the promotion and distribution of films made in the State.  I do not think the Minister would cavil at that.  We are merely asking that such an obligation should devolve on the board.  It is not emphatically directive in any way but it is a useful guideline which is essential in the national interest.  On occasion boards are set up which have a spectacular director general or chief executive who will go for the large kill and very often an international producer-speculator arriving in Ireland is clasped to the bosom of the individual most anxious to make the biggest possible name for himself in the shortest possible time. That is, of course, spectacular but in the long term it is not conducive to the development of an Irish film industry or the production of work which will have a lasting impact on the native industry. Very often such ventures are not very lucrative for the board itself.</P>
    <P>One of the big problems is that of film distribution.  If the Minister examines the guidelines given to CTT in the establishment of the Irish Export Agency he will find that this is a mirror image, the purpose of CTT being to assist firms in the promotion of exports.  There is nothing particularly novel in this amendment.  I strongly believe that limited State support, carefully controlled and without overtones of massive subsidy or massive hand-out, can give individual Irish producers a shot in the arm in the establishment of a distribution system for their work.  One of the major roles of the board should be to establish contacts with major distributors throughout the international circuit, to ensure that full information is available to Irish producers and to give basic services and facilities to them.  In so doing the board would give valuable <Col N="168" /> assistance in the promotion and distribution of films made in the State.  Such is the nature of production costs in this industry and such is the limited market here that unless these films achieve at least a reasonable segment of the international distributive market they have not a hope of breaking even.</P>
    <P>Our amendment is reasonable and carefully phrased and we urge the Minister to consider it.  It would be of major national importance if some consensus could be reached in the House on this Bill.  If the Minister finds any part of the amendment unacceptable or ambiguous we would be willing to re-submit it on Report Stage, but the basic import and principle in the amendment would still stand.  We look forward with interest to the Minister's reply.</P>

      <P>This amendment is a substitution of subsection (1) of section 4 of the Bill with certain additions.  Three points have been added, but before dealing with them I wish to draw the attention of the House to the nature and wording of subsection (1) as it stands because it seems to have been ignored to some extent.  It is deliberately drawn in very broad terms and virtually nothing is excluded from it.  It is stated that the board shall assist and encourage by any means it considers appropriate the making of films in the State.  I cannot envisage, and the parliamentary draftsman cannot draft, a broader, more general and more all-embracing sentence than that.  Within reason, the board is allowed to do virtually anything it sees fit in its wisdom to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn made the point that experience had shown that some of the legislation passed in this House over the years setting up semi-State bodies had been found to be defective in that it was too restrictive or limiting on the boards concerned and that it was necessary for Ministers to come back to the House from time to time to extend their powers.  This is true and there is no doubt that 20 years ago the thinking was <Col N="169" /> that we should restrict the powers of these boards.  There was a certain jealousy about the setting up of the boards and the extent of the powers they should get.  For that reason there are very considerable restrictions, even in an Act as recent as the Export Promotion Act, 1959, which set up CTT.  There are an enormous number of restrictions which we have discovered in recent times and many things which CTT would like to consider doing are in some doubt, even though they might be obvious things to the average observer.</P>
      <P>I do not think anybody here today, 21 years later, would have any objection to an export promotion board doing such things but, because that Act &mdash; and I take that one specifically &mdash; was drafted in the kind of way that the proposers of this amendment are asking us to accept now, those difficulties have arisen.  On the other hand if the Export Promotion Act, 1959 had been drafted as subsection (1) of section 4 of this Bill is drafted then there would not be any problems.  The same applies to many other organisations. Perhaps the proposers and those who inspired them may not realise that from everybody's point of view the broader the drafting the better it is from the point of view of the board concerned or the company concerned or the industry which they are trying to help.  This is true in something like the film industry because it changes quite rapidly from year to year and what might be appropriate in 1980 as we discuss and pass this Bill might be quite inappropriate in 1985 and might be positively harmful by 1990. But under this subsection as drafted any developments in any direction in regard to how the industry might more beneficially be assisted and promoted are catered for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having made that general point, which I suggest to the three Deputies concerned is a valid one&mdash;and they should accept it&mdash;I come to the specifics of what they say.  Their amendment can be divided into three parts because it adds three bits to the subsection as it is here.  The first one is that the board shall assist in the promotion and distribution of films made <Col N="170" /> in the State.  That is the first part of the new part; that is essentially the amendment, I dealt with this the last day in my reply to the debate on 16 October:</P>
    <P>There is a great danger that if the board were to set themselves up as a distributing board also and take over responsibility for distribution they would have landed on their doorstep many films which may not be easy to distribute in the difficult world of film distribution.  In such a case if a film was not distributed successfully the board would be blamed.  Film distribution is not like selling an ordinary commodity; it is a very specialised and narrow area which is controlled worldwide by a small number of companies.  It is not the kind of area in which an Irish semi-State body would necessarily be successful for quite a while.</P>
    <P>What I said then holds true now.  I would not be prepared &mdash; and I think the House on reflection would agree with me &mdash; to impose from the start a statutory obligation on a board such as this to distribute throughout the world films that are just planked on their table.  What I would envisage is that they would give every assistance that they can.  I would hope they and other people in Ireland in the semi-State bodies who have some experience and have had some limited success at least in terms of worldwide distribution will help.  They are the NFSI and RTE. Certainly this board will co-ordinate all these efforts.  But it would not be appropriate to have in this section the phraseology used here, &ldquo;shall assist in the promotion&rdquo;, because if they are handed a film which they say is not capable of distribution outside the country it will be open to the producer of that film to go to the High Court and seek an order compelling the board to exercise their statutory functions.  For example, CTT are not obliged to assist every exporter who comes to them.  If they look at his case and decide his product is useless they will tell him to go away, that there is nothing they can do about it.  It would be otherwise under this amendment and it would be unreasonable.  Distribution is a very difficult area.  There is no question about <Col N="171" /> it.  It is important that the board should seek to build up expertise and experience and contacts in respect of this area at the earliest possible date but I could not accept, and I am sure the House on reflection would agree, that I could not accept a situation where they were statutorily compelled to distribute films right from the start.  There was no such provision in the Film Industry Bill, 1970, and it was never really suggested until very recently when some people saw that it might be an easy way out of a difficulty that obviously smaller producers of films would have.</P>
    <P>The second part of this amendment, the new part, relates to the question of a film archive.  I made some references to that on the last day too.  I said:</P>
    <P>Again while I recognise that the establishment of a film archive has merit and that this is another matter which the board will have to consider, I feel nevertheless that there should be no statutory obligation on the board to get involved in this area at the very start.  The establishment of an archive could be fairly expensive and could present certain technical/administrative difficulties and therefore I feel that it would be more prudent to await an in-depth study of this whole question. In my opinion, the main preoccupation of the film board should be to get films made and if they become too deeply involved at an early stage in ancillary matters, it could have a detrimental impact on their operations.</P>
    <P>Again I do not see any real need to revise that view.  Quite clearly the board, under the general powers given to them in this section, have the power to establish a film archive.  There is no question about that.  It is a question of whether or not to put a specific statutory obligation on them to do it.  If, for example, when they were established they felt they should not start spending a large sum of money setting up an archive in the first two years, should we put them into a situation where they can be compelled by somebody who wants his films stored to establish an archive?  I do not think so.  The board should be allowed to exercise their judgment <Col N="172" /> independently on that, and with the very limited amount of money that inevitably will be at their disposal to establish in the general interests of the industry a reasonable order of priorities, and since their main priority will be the making of films, I do not think it would be appropriate to put this obligation on them as a statutory obligation because there is no doubt that however desirable this might be, and I suppose we all recognise that, it is very much an ancillary activity from any stand point, a kind of a luxury item to some extent compared with the necessity to get films made and to give employment and so on.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, this part of the amendment is drafted differently because it says they may do it and it is of course unnecessary for the section to say they may do it because the general clauses of the section enable them to do it anyway. But because it says &ldquo;may&rdquo; and to show my goodwill I am not prepared to say no to it.  It is meaningless and unnecessary and a bit prolix but I have often accepted prolix and unnecessary amendments to show that I am not being unreasonable in regard to them.  Because it is worded differently from the earlier part of it I am prepared to accept it.  I hope I am not offending the draftsman's good sense of drafting but I am prepared to accept a prolix amendment because it does not add to anything that is already there and it does not create an obligation on the board.  They have, of course, full power to do it.</P>
    <P>The third part of this amendment is the last sentence in it, &ldquo;Specifically the board shall have as one of its primary functions the assistance and promotion of Irish film culture.&rdquo;  I am sure a bevy of lawyers&mdash;six or eight of them one must employ nowadays if one goes to the High Court, two Senior Counsel, one junior and one solicitor on each side&mdash;would knock a few lucrative days out of arguing about that sentence, because I cannot imagine anything more vague.  I am disappointed that my friend, Deputy Kelly, is not here today because he would be very eloquent about this one.  He was very good on Second Stage at deriding the whole notion of what is contained here.  I do not <Col N="173" /> agree with all of what he said, but some of what he said was relevant to this.  I am sorry he is not here today to deride it on my behalf.  It is hopelessly vague and likely to create some problems for us within the Community.</P>
    <P>I made the point at some length in my opening speech on the last occasion that of course Irish film producers will get considerable assistance from this board; that was one of the principal reasons for setting it up.  But the board will have to be given reasonable discretion to exercise their independent, commercial and artistic judgment.  I am not prepared in advance to tie down the hands of any board so that they have to do specific things.  Irish film making, like any other Irish activity, should rise or fall on its merits or abilities.  I am not prepared, and I strongly advise this House not to direct by statute, any board to devote a high proportion of their very limited resources to specific projects thereby directing them to devote a very low proportion only to certain other projects.</P>
    <P>I have discussed this matter with various interests in this industry.  There is by no means unanimity in regard to the point made.  It comes from a very limited circle indeed.  The board will administer what is essentially a circulating fund.  The nature of a circulating fund is that at least some of the investments will have to be able to show a sufficient profit to maintain the size of the fund for the benefit of everybody.  It would defeat the whole purpose of the fund, and therefore of the board and of the legislation, if a situation were to obtain in which the board were forced to invest a high proportion of their money in activities not likely to prove commercially viable.  It is not in anybody's interest to do that because the fund would be extinct within a very short time.  What I would hope to foresee is a judicious mix of, hopefully, commercial and profitable activities with ones which are likely not to be commercially viable or profitable.  In that way the profitable projects will carry the unprofitable ones to the benefit of everybody.  On reflection I think people will accept that that is the obvious and only way to do it.  That is the <Col N="174" /> way such funds have been utilised in other countries, and with some success. One must mix the commercial successes with the others for the purpose of developing an industry.</P>
    <P>Also one cannot disregard the interests of the National Film Studios of Ireland, the next Bill on the Order Paper.  Unhappily that studio has been commercially and financially very unsuccessful over the past number of years and has been losing over £500,000 a year.  It will not continue to lose £500,000 a year because, if it does not get straightened out very quickly at least in part as a result of this legislation, I shall, as they say, pull the plug.  I do not see why the taxpayer should continue to lose more per annum on this operation than I think the place cost the first day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite an unacceptable situation that cannot be allowed continue. Therefore, one must bear in mind the needs and interests of that studio in relation to this Bill.  The making of short, non-commercial type films and their predominant funding from this fund will be of no use whatever to that studio.  As I see it, that studio is now on its last chance and, if it does not work, will have to be closed down.  There is absolutely no point in keeping it if it is going to continue to lose very large sums of money.  For that reason I cannot at all favour the third part of this amendment.</P>
      <P>I hope I have dealt fully with all of the points raised.  I have endeavoured to explain my view in regard to them.  On reflection I think Members of the House perhaps should agree that it is a reasonable, open-minded approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been more than forthright in his expression of his view on this matter.  I would suggest that this is the principal amendment on Committee Stage.  The remaining amendments are consequential or of no real significance by comparison.  This is really the gist of the two divided opinions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept fully what the Minister has said in relation to giving directions in <Col N="175" /> regard to the day-to-day operations of any State company.  But the House has an obligation to endeavour to define the operational policy or objectives.  How they are best achieved is, obviously, a task for the day-to-day and indeed year-to-year management.  It would be a grevious mistake for this House to try to replace that kind of task &mdash; which is outside the Legislature &mdash; by statutes and restrictions embodied in enabling legislation. But equally it would be an abdication of our democratic responsibility at the outset not to set some clear, overall objectives towards which this film board should strive.  Otherwise we might as well delete the word &rdquo;Irish&ldquo; and call it merely the Film Board Bill.  Why bother to call it Irish, because they could be making films for anyone and everyone with the rotating fund of £4.1 million?  If we were lucky, then every so often we might get a little bit of Irish film culture &mdash; to use the phrase incorporated in our amendment &mdash; gratuitously promoted.</P>
    <P>We are concerned that there is not sufficiently clear direction in the Bill about objectives.  I accept fully what the Minister has said about subsection 4 (1), which is a very general, enabling subsection. We do not want to take in any way from its generality or flexibility.  We want simply to add an aspiration, or a direction, to the incoming board, something that this House decides rather than the informal, though written, directives from the Minister when the board is established. Those are the kind of behind-door directives from the Minister of the day to the board which certainly I do not accept as an acceptable alternative to this House democratically voting, openly and publicly, on the kind of aspirations it has for the creation of an Irish film culture. That is at the core of where our difference lies.</P>
    <P>Let us take the three sections as the Minister has divided them.  I do not think there is any disagreement on the first part, providing for flexibility in the operation of the film board and enabling them to decide how best to achieve an Irish film industry relative to the state of the market and the state of the art.  I think <Col N="176" /> the Minister has accepted, in principle, the question of the national film archives, I did not hear the adjective he used but he more or less implied that we were gilding the lily, since the board are enabled to do everything which included the establishment of a film archive and, therefore, it was not necessary to include it.  We have used the phrase &rdquo;may engage in the establishment of a national film archive&ldquo; simply to suggest as legislators to the incoming members of the board that this is something they should consider. We are not putting any specific obligation on them to do so but you cannot talk in terms of an Irish film culture without a film archives being established. It appears to us that this body, when established, would be the appropriate body to take some part in its establishment and, consequently, we make reference to it in the only way we can, as legislators.  I accept that we are not putting an obligation on them but we are saying this is one of the things they should consider.  I accept that the Minister has, in principle, subject to its being suitably redrafted accepted this second point of our amendment and I thank him.</P>
    <P>The last amendment is what this is all about and that is specifically the board shall have as one of their primary functions the assistance and promotion of an Irish film culture.  The Minister is a professional lawyer, I am not going to argue about the legal interpretations, if he has certain reservations we will accept, through the Chair, an amendment.  Since we cannot interfere in the day-to-day running of a semi-State body, since we cannot as legislators write directives from the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism to the new members of the board stating how the Department of the day see the promotion of the Irish film industry, the only way we can as legislators try to give some direction which is not a directive and therefore not something that limits the flexibility of the film board but undoubtedly guides them in the direction we think they should be going, with our money, is to include a clause like this.  I do not see any alternative and, if the Minister was on this side of the House, he would be arguing <Col N="177" /> exactly as I am arguing.  There may be defects in the specific wording of the last sentence, if so let us come back on Report Stage and deal with it.</P>
    <P>I have no desire to increase the fees of the legal profession or to clutter up the courts; that is not the intention of the amendment moved by Deputy Desmond and by me, but the amendment is quite specific in that it does aspire in an enabling section setting out the terms of reference of the incoming film board, that they should have as one of their primary functions the assistance and promotion of Irish film culture.  If we, through the Chair, take that away from this legislation, it will have no impact and leave no imprint on the way that an Irish film industry should develop.  We would be at the mercy of the Minister of the day who, in turn, would be at the mercy of the Minister for Finance of the day in relation to the funds that can be made available. Therefore, we in the Labour Party have a very clear obligation to set out some aspiration as to what one of the primary functions of this board should be, as set out in the legislation, not set out in the speeches on Second Stage and Committee Stage.  If it is tested in court the last thing that the lawyers will do is refer to the speeches made in the Oireachtas when the Bill was going through.  They will stick with the printed word in the legislation and what was decided, not on what was talked about, so we do have this obligation.</P>
    <P>The reason we are sticking with this point is precisely because, in the past, semi-State bodies have not been as responsive to the Oireachtas as we would like.  The whole relationship between semi-State bodies and the Oireachtas is an unhappy and uneven one.  We have the recent experience of NET and the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies and the whole question of how the operation of the public sector on a management basis can operate effectively at one level and what the inter-direction between that management is with the role of the Oireachtas, who ultimately have to foot the bill when things go wrong.  Accordingly, there should be no blank cheque in the terms of reference <Col N="178" /> given to this film board, nor can there be specific requirements built into the legislation that confine them from the start, but a clear aspiration should be written into the terms of reference and I regard section 4 as being the terms of reference for the board in relation to the establishment of an Irish film culture.  If we are simply interested in having films made here then the whole paraphernalia of the film board is unnecessary.  It could be done without taking up the time of the House, by very attractive legislation of fiscal measures carried from one budget to another, by grants and tax write-offs and there would be no need for an Irish film board, as such, to promote and develop the film industry.  Since the embryonic industry is clearly very anxious to have more than that &mdash; they have waited for ten years to debate legislation &mdash; surely we should embody in some shape or form the aspiration which we have attempted to put down in the amendment.  As the Minister knows, this is an amendment initiated by the industry itself and which we have been honoured to promote and move in the House.  If the Minister has arguments about the technicalities of the amendment or if he is worried about a legal interpretation that may cause difficulties which we do not foresee, we can continue talking on that basis but we do not think we are restricting the board.  On the contrary, we are giving the board a very clear impetus to get on with the business of promoting an Irish film culture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made the point that section 4 (1) as drafted was very broad, very flexible and included any possible combination of approaches that might be made by the board, for the good of the film industry.  I accept that, for example the reference that it is considered appropriate to make films in the State and to develop an industry in the State.  I know and I accept that the Minister would personally ensure that the best interest of the Irish film industry would be served through the directions he would give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there is merit in having a broad subsection &mdash; and this is the crunch section <Col N="179" /> as far as the industry in concerned &mdash; all other aspects of this Bill are consequential and, indeed, peripheral to the industry.  This is the establishment of the board and the definition, or finding, of their functions.  While in that definition of functions, any restrictive measures ought to be looked at attentively, we must be careful to specify functions since, because of this flexibility &mdash; and the Minister must accept this argument &mdash; while they can do anything they wish as they see appropriate, they need do nothing. That is the logic of the thing.  That is the reverse side of the coin.</P>
    <P>As the Minister also knows &mdash; and he mentions solicitors and senior counsel having a field day on certain aspects of the amendment &mdash; we are not talking here about the spirit of the law.  In this country, in so far as I know &mdash; and I am not in any way legally trained &mdash; the courts decide on, and make judgment on, specifics, on what they see in print in front of them, not on the underlying spirit of what might be said during Second Stage or Committee Stage debate.  We are talking here about a very flexible section which can lead to great things. But, on the other hand, all that we are asking &mdash; and I am fully in accord with the terms of the amendment &mdash; is that the specifically Irish film industry would be recognised for what it is at this stage, when legislation is being introduced.</P>
    <P>If, at this stage, the Minister is worried about the &ldquo;shalls&rdquo; and so forth which would indicate a legal obligation, surely there is nothing wrong with having the amendment redrafted on Report Stage to show a definition of, for example, development of an industry to include the promotion and distribution of films.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Minister would seem to have accepted the notion of an archive. I am sorry that he uses the word &ldquo;luxury&rdquo; in relation to an archive.  We owe it to future generations to preserve in such an archive anything worth preserving.  That is not a luxury; it is an absolute necessity if we are to take this industry seriously. The reluctance on the part of the Minister to write into the section a specific reference to the preference which would be <Col N="180" /> given to the Irish film industry or Irish film makers is puzzling.  Overall, surely the board, in dealing with and distributing public funds, must give serious consideration to this aspect?  Naturally, they are not going to be associated with anything which can be shown from the very beginning to be a waste of time, effort and public money because they will then be castigated for it and will not be carrying out their functions as a board using public finance.  All that is being asked is that, where appropriate and where the board think fit, they would give preferential treatment to Irish-made films. Surely the section as drafted, which concerns itself with the development of the industry, would include or must include, if we are serious about it, this kind of approach, if we are to expand and improve the expertise and the artistic and technical field in this industry?  That is all that is being required.  I fail to see why there is such reluctance on the part of the Minister to include this.  Probably it is his legal training.  He sees snags where I do not.  Surely, it is not beyond the bounds of possibility for his draftsmen to produce a format that would ensure that those legal snags would not arise?</P>

      <P>I have nothing to add to what I have already said.  I have dealt with all these matters in great detail and have dealt openly and fairly with them. In relation to what Deputy Quinn has said now, unfortunately his second contribution made no reference at all to what I said.  It was, as it were, made <i>de novo.</i> Probably he was not here for most of what I said.  It is more useful, I find, on a Committee Stage debate, to discuss one another's contribution, rather than make these <i>de novo</i> speeches out of the blue. A lot of the points Deputy Quinn made the second time, I had dealt with in what I had to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already indicated that I am prepared&mdash;on the basis that it is a non-binding reference&mdash;to draft an amendment for Report Stage referring to a national film archive.  Incidentally, I propose to have that amendment drafted myself, in order to be satisfied with the wording of it.  I am prepared&mdash;if the draftsman is <Col N="181" /> able to dream up and put into words some form of non-binding reference to an Irish dimension, shall I say, in relation to the film industry&mdash;to put in some form of reference of that kind, but only on the basis that it is not binding on the board. I am not going to tie the board's hands to specific percentages or anything else.  The point made by both Deputies that this amendment, or the principles underlying it, is the request of industry, as it is described, is not correct.</P>

      <P>I have met a portion, but quite a narrow portion and I have met several sectors of it, some as recently as a couple of days ago, and it is the view of certain sectors of the industry that this type of amendment is quite undesirable and would be unworkable and unnecessary.  The House should not mislead itself in that respect because there are very definite differing views.  I have gone as far as I possibly can in this regard.  I hope that the House will accept that and, in the circumstances, that this amendment would be withdrawn on the basis that I am bringing forward what I have referred to on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>In the light of the progress which we seem to be making on this, at this stage we shall not press our amendment to a division, but certainly we look forward on Report Stage to having an opportunity, preferably some time in advance of Report Stage, of examining the content of the suggested ministerial amendment.  I do not want to labour the point unduly since we have been discussing it for over an hour, but we very strongly, and in all earnestness, say that the sixth line drafting of the general functions of the board is, to say the least, very bald, very terse and very inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that on reflection these could be broken down into three or four component parts.  On Report Stage that section could be usefully rephrased. In the rephrasing I do not think the Minister should be unduly swayed by some of the more esoteric comments of our colleague, <Col N="182" /> Deputy Kelly.  There is a thing called an Irish film industry, although as yet it is very much in embryonic form. Even back to my student days in Cork when I met people like Louis Marcus, there was what was called an Irish film culture.  I do not think we should confuse the obsession or preoccupation of Deputy Kelly with certain nationalistic aspects of Irish life with our national culture. In my view Deputy Kelly has become bemused by this.  In fact, he is enjoying it with a rare sense of self indulgence and humour.  It is all very titivating in a legislative sense, but it is also likely to divert us from the most serious aspect of trying to ensure that we should have an Irish consensual approach to this without being excessively preoccupied with the narrow irrelevant areas mentioned by Deputy Kelly on the last occasion.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not be preoccupied about what the Community might think of the drafting.  I am aware that the Minister on Second Stage told us he had not submitted the Bill to the Community and that they wanted to know the procedures to be adopted in the event of the Bill being passed.  It is useful that the Minister intends having a second look at the section.  In the light of that we will not press our amendment to a division, because we are anxious to get all-party consensus on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in drafting his amendment, should think hard about the distributive aspects referred to in our amendment.  It has some sense.  I do not think we would be imposing High Court judgments on the future of the board if enabling guidelines were developed on the board in this regard.  An acceptance of an amendment along the lines suggested by us would certainly prevent the board gaily deciding what they wanted to do without reference to the Legislature.  We have a right, an entitlement and an obligation, when it comes to the growth of an industry or the expenditure of taxpayers' money, to ask the board to move in a certain direction.  We would like the board to move in the tripartite direction outlined in the amendment by way of <Col N="183" /> assisting the promotion and distribution of films, dealing with the question of the archives and the basic question of the making of films in the State.  We look forward to a change of mind by the Minister in that regard on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 9 to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;9.&mdash;Where a term or condition subject to which an investment, grant, loan or guarantee made or given by the Board under this Act is contravened by the person to whom or on whose behalf the investment, grant, loan or guarantee is made or given, any amount owed to the Board in respect of the investment, grant, loan or guarantee (together with the interest payable on it) shall, if the Board requests repayment of the whole or part of the amount, be deemed, to the extent of the request, to be a debt payable forthwith to the Board and may, to that extent, be recovered by it as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The text of section 9 has been re-examined in consultation with the parliamentary draftsman in the context of sections 6, 7 and 8 and it is felt that section 9 could be made more precise by the addition of specific references to investments and grants where appropriate.  This will include possible contraventions of terms and conditions in respect of investments for grants by the board.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to outline in detail how he sees the operation of this section which is, in a sense, the second core of the legislation.  We are talking about a capital sum of £4.1 million, the maximum amount of money which at any one time will be made available by the film board to those deemed worthy of support by way of loan, grant or investment.  Obviously, that figure was <Col N="185" /> not taken at random and presumably it relates to part of the detailed study provided by the consultants referred to by the Minister on Second Stage.  Will the Minister sketch out for the benefit of the House the kind of split he sees?  The fear has been expressed to us that if an investment is made in a film&mdash;for argument sake £250,000&mdash;and the recoupment of that investment takes a certain number of years that amount of money is frozen out of the residual capital sum until such time as it is all repaid.  We are worried about the mechanics of this.  It will be easy to exhaust by way of grants, loans or investments the capital sum having regard to the cost of medium sized feature films.  At one stage we were saying we would like to have enabling legislation which would be as broad and as flexible as possible for the film board.  In section 10 we are being very specific about the amount of money they can spend. Obviously the sum is based on a figure which is the consequence of study and research.  I should like the Minister to say how he sees this operating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The £4.1 million will be put in over a four-year period.  I think the figure for the first year is £1 million, or the figure asked for is £1 million.  What it will be remains to be seen.</P>
      <P>The management of the money will be a matter for the board.  This Bill does not set out various limits as, for example, industrial legislation does.  It tries to allow for a certain flexibility.  Obviously one would not envisage the board putting all their resources into one film.  Clearly they could not and should not do that. Equally I do not think they should spread it too widely.  It is hard to lay down hard and fast rules in advance.  The board will consist of responsible, competent people and they will have to judge that as the situation arises.  I am confident that they will make the right type of judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>For argument sake, if the board give a grant of £200,000 to film Y, does that effectively reduce the operating capital to £3.9 million?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is a non-repayable grant I suppose it does.  There is a wide variety of methods whereby assistance will be given.  One would envisage non-repayable grants in certain circumstances. I would see it as being much more likely that the board would make an equity investment in the film or would give a repayable loan to be paid back out of the proceeds after distribution.  I would not see the non-repayable grant as forming any significant part of their activities because that would have the effect of reducing the fund.</P>
      <P>The board are empowered to pay grants but I would see their activities mainly in equity investment in the film and in loans where appropriate.  The financing of films is a very complicated matter.  One should seek to allow them the greatest flexibility.  I know something in a peripheral way about how some recent films were financed here.  It is incredibly complicated.  Obviously we will have to have on the board some people who understand how this system works.  They will be able to deal with it. I would not see grants as being a major element.  I would be rather inclined to think that grants will probably be confined to ventures which will not make the grade commercially but will have certain artistic merit in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has clarified that point.  It raises a certain worry but obviously the board will realise that and respond accordingly.  I want to ask two specific questions.  The first is how was the figure of £4.1 million arrived at?  Secondly, in view of the fact that the Minister referred to the probability&mdash;without preempting what they will do since they must rotate this capital fund and cannot erode it by way of grant&mdash;that they will have to invest in some form of equity participation, surely this underlines and strengthens the argument for involving the board in some system of distribution.  If they are not involved in some system of distribution they will have no way of assessing the revenue earned by the film and consequently what their full equity share would be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like the Minister I concede fully that <Col N="187" /> the financing of the film industry is complex and is probably matched by the complexity of the percentages from films in the distribution world internationally and particularly in the English speaking areas where many of these films will be going. This reinforces our exhortation in our first amendment about the need for an inter-connection between the promotion and distribution of this money by the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that £4.1 million will be at the disposal of the board and that perhaps in the first year £1 million will be at their disposal. He seemed to imply that the £1 million might not be available to them.  Perhaps he would qualify that remark.  If and when the Bill becomes law, could the board draw on the whole £4.1 million if they needed it and if they thought the best interests of the film industry would be served by drawing on the whole sum? Will he guarantee that the money will be available to the board if and when they need it?</P>

      <P>Is there any prospect of the £4.1 million being increased in the light of inflation?  By the time this Bill is enacted and signed there will be further inflation.  It is a rather odd figure to put in the Bill.  I would have rounded it up to £5 million.  I know we are handing out gaily more of the taxpayers' money every day.  To set the board off on the right foot it should be £5 million to take inflation into account.  We are adding on 18 per cent for this year alone.

      <P>Deputy Quinn and I are interested in having a response from the Minister on this.  The only personal experience I have in this area is when we on Dublin County Council gave a grant to the Olympia Theatre, and likewise when Dublin Corporation gave it, and when I became a director of that body at that time.  We felt that this was an area where we should preclude ourselves from exercising a directive function.  It is a matter of cultural hygiene that the Minister of the day should, in relation to the performance of his functions in matters of artistic consideration, exclude himself from that area. As the Minister knows, pressures of a negative nature can arise.  I am sure this view is shared by a number of responsible legislators so we put this amendment forward for consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope that directives given would be of a general nature. In order to clarify my point I will refer to column 1667 of the Official Report of 13 December 1979 where the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy said in <Col N="190" /> relation to the vote for Industry, Commerce and Energy:</P>
      <P>The film industry generally of its nature is not one for which a public-type State board is necessarily the most suitable. It is an imaginative, innovative type of business where artists and people of originality get strokes of genius and tend to come to the top rather than people who want a steady 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. job with a pension at 60 or 65 years of age.</P>
      <P>In dealing with people who get strokes of genius we must be sensitive because these are sensitive people.  I am concerned that directives issued by the Minister might inhibit these so called strokes of genius in their implementation.  In dealing with artists one must be careful not to upset the artistic balance or inhibit the kind of work they do.  Many of them deal in abstractions and to the ordinary individual it may be difficult to see what they are getting at until the picture is finished.  I use that illustration both literally and metaphorically.</P>

      <P>These people of genius may still be making a point which is more easily seen at the end of the day.  Any kind of restrictive directives might inhibit the development of genius.  For that reason the amendment comes down on the side of freedom in this area.  None of us is expert in this field.  As the Minister said, it is a specialised area.  While the Minister must retain control over expenditure of public money, as guardian he must have a certain flexible approach in this case in the operation of the Act. In the area of the pure artistic atmosphere, academic freedom or artistic freedom should be seen as a first consideration.</P>

I have no objection to putting in an amendment which would avoid any purported directives being given in relation to the artistic aspect of films.  I do not think it would ever arise because I do not think they would be given.  As an example, one might envisage the possibility of some public demand for such a directive if somebody was to come along and run a camera in front of a blank wall for two hours and then sell that film as a work of genius.  I suppose in the world we live in today that is not impossible because Dublin Corporation spent £20,000 of public, taxpayers' money on something like that.</P>

This section setting up boards is in every Bill and you have to have a situation where the Minister can give general directives. The power is very rarely exercised, but the Minister is answerable to this House and the board, therefore, must be answerable to him and he must be in a position to lay down broad lines of policy and leave it to the board to implement it and work it out on a day-to-day basis.  The kind of directives that would be given would be the sort of things that I have been saying, for example, in the course of these debates there, and the manner in which they would be delivered probably would be a speech that I would make at the first meeting of the board, which would be couched in general terms laying down these general guidelines.  Of course, the basic guidelines are the Act itself.</P>

      <Col N="194" /> Due to a minor drafting error the reference to the Minister for Finance in this subsection is incorrect.  It should refer to the Minister, who in the context of this Bill is the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism.  It is the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism rather than the Minister for Finance who guarantees the borrowings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. D. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="195" /> The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the control and regulation of casual trading and for connected matters.</P>
    <P>For some years past trade interests, local development associations, local authorities, trade unions, consumer interests and others have been making representations that the operations of both street traders and occasional traders have resulted in unfair competition; that the jobs of shop assistants were threatened; and that these classes of trading were unfair to the consumer.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices Commission carried out a study and they recommended new legislation to regulate both street traders and occasional traders. Initially we proposed to have a single Bill but it was discovered that there would be special problems in formulating provisions to deal with street trading and for that reason we went ahead with a Bill to deal with sales from temporary retail outlets, the Occasional Trading Bill, and this has since been enacted.  The Occasional Trading Act, 1979 is achieving its objectives. Notwithstanding this, a loophole in it has been discovered and I propose to remedy this by way of an amendment contained in this Bill.  I will deal later with the problem in question.</P>
    <P>We are now considering the Bill to regulate roadside and street trading.  The majority of submissions to the Restrictive Practices Commission were that roadside and street traders have an unfair advantage over established traders.  It was alleged that they do not pay rent, rates, taxes and do not have other overheads which have to be met by shopkeepers.  In some respects, the allegations were exaggerated but there is no doubt that the selling costs of street traders are lower and they do offer very severe competition.</P>
    <P>Trade union interests have complained that the employment prospects of their members have been jeopardised not merely because of the higher overheads which have to be met by shopkeepers but also because street traders do not observe the statutory and reasonable negotiated conditions of employment of shop assistants. <Col N="196" /> I accept that the trade unions have grounds for complaint.</P>
    <P>Additionally, and as we are all aware, there has been widespread concern about the traffic and other environmental problems created by some outdoor traders.</P>
    <P>I have merely touched on some of the arguments for better regulation of outdoor trading, but since Deputies on both sides of the House have made representations about the inadequacy of the existing law, I feel I have gone far enough. The form of control suggested in most submissions to the Restrictive Practices Commission &mdash; especially submissions made by local authorities &mdash; was for a more effective system of licensing subject to certain conditions, linked to designated areas and with penalties which would be a deterrent.  There were suggestions for licensing at national level and at local level and for a combination of both.</P>
    <P>The Bill goes along with the majority of the submissions made to the Restrictive Practices Commission.  It proposes a system of licensing both at national and local level, the designation of trading areas by local authorities and the detailed regulation of trading by the authorities. Very wide powers are proposed which will enable local elected representatives to confine trading to the places where it will be a service to local communities rather than the nuisance it now often is.</P>
    <P>Casual trading is defined as retailing at a place, including a public road, to which the public have access as of right or at any other place that is a designated trading area.  For example, a local authority will be empowered to acquire land and designate it as a trading area.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that, with a few exceptions, anyone engaging in casual trading will have to have a national licence issued by the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism and the fee will in general be £100 per year, but this will be reduced to £5 in respect of a person selling fish, horticultural or agricultural produce, other than meat, or a family selling their own manufactures.  In addition to the national licence, where local authorities have designated an area, casual traders will have to have a local authority <Col N="197" /> permit costing £20 per year to trade in such an area.  A separate local permit will be needed for each trading area.</P>
    <P>The few classes of trading which we propose to except from the Act are those which either do not create the problems we are trying to resolve or which could not reasonably be confined to designated places.  As examples, a farmer selling his own produce at a public place does not pose the problem the Bill is designed to deal with; and the breadmen, the milkmen and other door-to-door salesmen provide a service which could not reasonably be regulated in the manner proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There are provisions relating to the granting of licences and permits and the refusing and revocation of these in cases where the Act is contravened.  It is proposed that conditions may be attached to permits and licences.</P>
    <P>If a member of the public has any complaint to take up with a shopkeeper there is no problem in contacting him but the same is not true for roadside traders. Consequently, we propose that a casual trader shall display either a national licence or a permit wherever he traders so that any interested party can note the number of the permit and the trader's name and address.</P>
    <P>Very wide powers are proposed to enable local authorities to designate the places in their functional area which will be set aside for outdoor trading and they will be empowered to make by-laws to regulate trading.</P>
    <P>Authorities are being empowered to acquire market rights some of which are at present in private ownership as a result of Royal Charters and Letters Patent granted centuries ago.  There are provisions for appeal to the Circuit Court against the decision of local authorities.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the legislation will be enforced by officers from the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism, local authority officers and the Garda.  The proposed powers of authorised officers are in general the same as those they exercise under the Occasional Trading Act and prices legislation.  It is proposed that the Garda will have the <Col N="198" /> same powers as authorised officers and, in addition, powers similar to those they enjoy under the Street Trading Act, 1926.  It is felt necessary that the Garda should have the power to arrest without warrant any person contravening the Act and seize and detain any goods, containers or vehicles being used in connection with the business.</P>
    <P>In submission to the Restrictive Practices Commission reference was made to the fact that local authorities have difficulty in enforcing existing legislation against mobile traders because they had not powers to enable them to establish the ownership of goods.  In the case of the Street Trading Act, the Garda do not have this problem.  The Revenue Commissioners' staff also have powers to seize goods in connection with the enforcement of the tax laws.</P>
    <P>All but one of the remaining provisions of the Bill are fairly standard in this type of legislation and I do not propose to summarise them.  I will, however, refer briefly to the proposed amendment of section 2(2) (1) of the Occasional Trading Act, 1979.  It was felt that that Act should not apply to sales from which no private profit was derived.  We were thinking of such things as sales of work and jumble sales in aid of churches, schools, football clubs, foreign missions and hospitals. However, we have become conscious of the fact that it would seldom, if ever, be possible to prove it if someone was making some contribution to, say, a charity and was also taking a private profit.  I am not saying that this has happened but, as drafted, section 2 (2) (i) of the Occasional Trading Act could be abused and we propose to bring it into line with the corresponding provision in the Casual Trading Bill &mdash; section 2 (2) (g) &mdash; which proposes to put the onus of proof on the retailer that no private profit is being taken.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices Commission concluded that the Pedlars Acts and the Hawkers Acts &ldquo;relate to a commercial environment so different from the present that they are in effect obsolete and inappropriate to current problems&rdquo;. Other legislation is inadequate in so far as it is not capable of controlling adequately <Col N="199" /> these types of trading.  Quite clearly what was needed was one piece of legislation which would enable local authorities to decide the places where outdoor trading could be carried on in a disciplined way in the best interest of local consumers, established traders, casual traders and all other interested bodies. Central Government could not decide where trading should be permitted and what detailed conditions should be attached to such trading and the Bill is designed to give local authorities all the powers they could reasonably need.</P>
    <P>I believe the Bill will stand the test of time and I recommend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been needed for a number of years.  As the House is aware, the type of trading envisaged in this Bill has increased in volume over the past few years.  At present on many of our main roads one can see ten, 20 or 30 mobile homes, with accompanying lorries, vans and motor cars and most of these people are making very considerable profits from this type of trading.  Their contribution to the national Exchequer and to the country is minimal.  Therefore we asked for some effort to be made to ensure that these people make some contribution to the Exchequer.  Their contributions by way of value-added tax, income tax, PAYE, PRSI, rates to local authorities and so on are very small.  They are making things very difficult for the ordinary shopkeeper and trader who has to pay all these taxes, as well as paying staff and keeping accounts.  These people are engaged in unfair competition and their activities must be curbed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to note that from now on officials of the Department as well as members of the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners will be in a position to demand that trading licences are produced.  In fact, licences will have to be displayed from now on.  A major factor in regard to casual or roadside trading is that in some instances the goods involved are &ldquo;hot&rdquo;, their origins being either unknown or doubtful.  The authorities were not in a position to cope adequately <Col N="200" /> with that sort of situation because of the difficulty in tracking down the goods concerned.  I am not saying that the sale of such goods was widespread but it was happening to some extent.  I have had reports that such items as television sets, radios and blankets which had been stolen were being sold by casual traders.  We hope that this Bill will eliminate such practices.  The Garda will now be in a position to check invoices and so on in respect of materials that are being offered for sale.  Without this legislation the probability is that increasing quantities of stolen goods would be offered for sale by roadside traders.  We must ensure that the steps we are taking go far enough and will prove to be adequate in terms of eliminating the undesirable practices we are talking of.</P>
    <P>Another point of concern in regard to roadside trading is the hazard to traffic when these traders are operating on national primary roads.  Sometimes on a main thoroughfare one sees between 40 and 50 very good caravans surrounded by some very big cars where goods are being offered for sale.  One might say that in such a case there is a market-like situation. This presents a very serious traffic hazard for road users because of the congestion caused and because of passers-by stopping suddenly on spotting the goods on offer.  Pemission should not be granted by any local authority in respect of trading on a main thoroughfare.  Planning permission in respect of building a house for instance, on a main road is very restricted.  It is usually restricted to a farmer's son who is living on the farm. Therefore, there is no reason whatever for casual traders being allowed operate on our main thoroughfares.</P>
    <P>Another point in regard to casual traders is the condition in which they leave the areas in which they have operated. We hear a good deal about keeping Ireland clean and beautiful but the task presented to local authorities in cleaning up an area that has been used by casual trades is very great because these people leave behind huge quantities of refuse such as big boxes and so on.  In many instances we can assume that the situation presents health hazards.  It should be <Col N="201" /> a condition in respect of the issuing of a licence to trade that the area in question is left clean and anybody who fails to comply with that condition should not be granted a licence for the following year. We must be very strict in this regard.</P>
    <P>While I have been critical of roadside traders there are instances where those people are giving value for money and people are able to purchase products from them which they cannot purchase as cheaply elsewhere.  The Bill will legalise the position and will ensure that the people who are carrying on this legitimate type of business can continue to do so.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the restrictions which the Minister is imposing are enforced rigidly. I can foresee some difficulty arising with regard to the issuing of licences. There may, for example, be 20 or 30 people involved in a particular grouping engaged in roadside trading and one person may say that he owns the particular vans, that he is in charge and he obtains the licence.  What happens if that particular person breaches the regulations contained in his licence?  As far as I can see all he has to do is allow the fine to be imposed.  He may have made a very great profit in the meantime and losing his licence will not mean a lot to him.  His brother can have the licence issued in his name the following year and the year after that some other relation can have it issued in his or her name.  How does the Minister propose to tackle that problem?</P>
    <P>Will the one licence issued cover the 40 or 50 people in a particular group involved in casual trading?  The Minister may be tightening the procedure a little bit but it will not pay for the enforcement of the scheme if up to 50 people can get away with only having to pay for one licence.  This may be a very convenient way round the issuing of a licence under the Bill.</P>
    <P>The fines are pretty large in regard to anybody who contravenes the Bill but nevertheless people will endeavour to get around them.  It says in the Bill: &ldquo;a fine not exceeding £5000&rdquo;.  I believe it will be very rarely that such a fine will be imposed.  If only one person has the licence <Col N="202" /> and the conditions are being broken by one person in the group how will the Minister get around that?  It is important to tighten up that regulation.  As well as the fine of up to £5,000 there is a continuing fine of £200 a day.  This is a real deterrent and I hope that it is sufficient to ensure that the spirit of the Bill is complied with.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with the designation of casual trading areas.  It states in subsection 4:</P>
    <P>The designating of land as a casual trading area shall be a reserved function within the meaning of the Cork City Management Acts, 1929 to 1971, the Local Government (Dublin) Acts, 1930 to 1971, the Limerick City Management Acts, 1934 to 1971, the Waterford City Management Acts, 1939 to 1971, and the County Management Acts, 1940 to 1972.</P>
    <P>I regret that a final decision will not be left to the elected representatives.  It seems to me that this will be a reserved function of the county managers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be the function of the elected councillors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that.  It is important that elected representatives have a very definite say in the designation of land for casual trading areas.  If the elected representatives have not a say in this matter public representatives will receive a lot of pressure.  They should have a definite say in regard to the areas which will be specified as casual trading areas by the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The licences issued for dance halls and casual licences are put up in a particular place in some instances but in most <Col N="203" /> instances they are not displayed at all. They are not very legible and while they are supposed to be on display a person who wishes to see them has to take some time to find out where they are displayed. Will the position be the same in regard to the licences for casual trading?  The licence should be displayed clearly so that people may be able to read it.  In addition, the people engaged in trading should wear some kind of badge, or insignia, showing the number of the licence.  It is absolutely essential that people should be able to read the number on the badge of the individual who is conducting the trading.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to enable a consumer who considers he has been over-charged or has some other reasonable grounds for complaint to report the matter to the Department in the knowledge that action will be taken against the person responsible.  The fact that he may report the matter to the local authority or to the Department is the strength of the Bill before us.  I should like to put to the Minister the case where sales may be conducted in a number of caravans and where the permit is on display in one place only.  I wish to know if it will be necessary to have a permit in each caravan.  It appears from the Bill that one permit may suffice for a group of people and I suggest that this may cause problems for the purchaser where sales are being conducted in a number of caravans.  I consider that people who are carrying on such sales should be obliged to wear a badge showing the number of the licence.  That would provide some protection for the public.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on the section dealing with the sale of agricultural produce, potatoes and so on.  The licence fee payable is only £5 and this is a very good step.  It is my view that we do not sell enough of our horticultural and agricultural produce and the Minister should be congratulated for encouraging people to sell such items.  It will be possible, for example, to sell Irish potatoes in a casual trading area and it is my hope that any trader who wishes to avail of this provision will enjoy greater sales than his <Col N="204" /> competitors who may be selling potatoes from Cyprus or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>We should encourage people to sell our agricultural and horticultural products throughout our towns and villages. A very considerable amount of fruit, vegetables and agricultural products are imported and sold here.  If people had initiative and energy they could ensure that many Irish items could be sold in the casual trading areas and this would be of benefit to the economy.  I hope the Department, in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, will make every effort to ensure that Irish agricultural and horticultural produce is sold not only in the casual trading areas but in all shops throughout the country.</P>

      <P>Has the Taoiseach given any consideration to the suggestion I made recently during the debate on the motion of no confidence in the Government's economic policies about the possible introduction of import levies under EEC rules arising from our balance of payments difficulties, which under normal conditions would yield a balance of payments deficit of about £1,000 million if the economy were making any headway?

      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that the present balance of payments situation is abnormally favourable with a 7 per cent drop in the volume of imports and that under normal conditions, even if there were no growth in imports, the balance of payments deficit would be nearer to £1,000 million?

      <P>It is serious enough when the Deputy casts gloom and doom on the basis of facts but he is now resorting to talking about what the balance of payments situation might have been. <Col N="206" /> Neither we nor the Commission can deal with the balance of payments situation which exists only in the head of the Leader of the Opposition.  Our balance of payments situation is much more favourable than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year and it is not correct for Deputy FitzGerald to say that this is due entirely to a falling off in imports.</P>

In these exceptional circumstances, facing difficulties on the political front in the North and having a large number of young people in this State, would the Taoiseach agree that a strong case could be made to our partners in the EEC for special aid?

Having said that, the level of unemployment and the depth of the economic recession throughout the Community is something which must be addressed by the forthcoming Council.</P>

      <P>Am I to understand from the Taoiseach's reply that the Government were planning at the beginning <Col N="207" /> of this year on the selling off of our breeding stock and on the 7 per cent drop in imports?  I doubt very much that this was the case.  The present state of our balance of payments arises from the collapse of our economy during the past six months.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not correct in his analysis of the developments in our balance of payments situation.  The balance of payments has been adversely affected by developments on the imports side, in particular by our having to pay out an extra £250 million this year for oil. Despite that, the balance of payments deficit has come down to a level which is lower than we had anticipated.  That has been brought about to a considerable extent by an increase in exports.</P>

    <P>Of course industrial disputes of this kind result in losses to both employers and workers and they can also endanger jobs, especially where, as in this case, seasonal operations are involved.

He is at present due about £4,000 from the Department.  Is the Minister not aware that, despite all the talk about the efforts to encourage disease eradication among cattle, this problem where vets are not being paid for the work they do until many months afterwards is causing a lot of trouble and is likely to cause much more trouble unless the Minister is prepared to do something about it?</P>

Is the Minister not aware that one of the excuses given for non-payment of this money was that one of the very junior officials of the Department was ill and as a result the payment could not be made? Surely this has become completely ridiculous particularly as the Minister's predecessor gave me a similar reply last year although subsequently a sum of nearly £5,000, being arrears due to this man from the previous year, was paid within a month.</P>

We have had long-term plans for a district veterinary office to serve Tipperary in Thurles, County Tipperary, and that met with some opposition. I, and I am sure my predecessor also, met deputations from Tipperary and Nenagh.  Because of the type of service that was being given from Tipperary for North Tipperary, it was decided that the best solution is continuation of the office in Tipperary with proper accommodation and a new office in Nenagh.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>As in the case of other agricultural products the rules of the European Community prohibit the grant of national aids to poultry and egg production.  Indeed, the introduction of such aids could be detrimental to our long-term interests since it could encourage other member states to take similar action and thus inevitably lead to marketing problems.</P>
      <P>In recent months the Community market for poultry and eggs has been undergoing some difficulty mainly because of over supply.  I accordingly raised the matter at the July Council meeting with particular reference to the situation of Irish producers.  I sought and received an undertaking from the Commission to examine the matter urgently. I understand that in the meantime the Commission has been having discussions with the trade interests involved with a view to taking measures to strengthen the market.</P>
      <P>A formal complaint was lodged by Ireland about the alleged below-cost selling of eggs imported from Northern Ireland and the Commission is investigating the compatibility of this practice with the Treaty of Rome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>An official complaint was lodged on 25 June 1980.  The Commission <Col N="214" /> have discussed with trade interests the formation of a European Joint Trade Organisation for eggs and poultry and meat and they have an examination going on about this below-cost selling of eggs and poultry from Northern Ireland in the context of the Treaty of Rome.  In July also I drew attention to the fact that a feed price allowance was being paid in Northern Ireland at that time and it was discontinued immediately after that. Whatever measure I can take, realising the difficulties that can exist in the poultry and egg industry, I will take, and I will be looking for the support of the Commission in that area.</P>

      <P>The excess brine being pumped in.  Is the Minister aware that there have been serious allegations of excessive amounts of brine being pumped into Irish bacon which is giving it a bad name abroad, when the weight is not in fact bacon but brine which people do not want to consume, and also that there have been other even more serious allegations about weight being pumped up by means which are not alone immoral but illegal?  Might I ask the Minister if he is satisfied, as I am not, with the arrangements being made by his Department to police these factories to prevent this happening so that the reputation of Irish bacon abroad can be vindicated and maintained?  Would the Minister not agree that this matter is something on which he can himself take action immediately without consulting anyone?</P>

      <P>The Government's proposals for a review of the boundaries of the disadvantaged areas were submitted to the EEC Commission in February last year and since then they have been the subject of considerable discussion between officials of the Commission and of my Department. As Deputies are aware, the areas scheduled as disadvantaged cannot be extended without the concurrence of the EEC Council and Commission.  The Council, in June last, amended the relevant directive so as to permit of certain limited extensions being made in the total agricultural area of member states which can be classified as disadvantaged.  It is still necessary, however, for the Government's proposed changes on our boundaries to be decided by an EEC Commission procedure involving the Standing Committee on Agricultural Structures This committee is due to begin its deliberations on this issue shortly.  It would not be appropriate, pending a decision being taken at Community level on the Government's proposals as a whole, to comment upon the position of individual areas.</P>

Perhaps north Tipperary will assume eminence again with the pending by-election, if rumours are correct, and again farmers in the Slieve Felim area will be promised that they will be included.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 24 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to the present year scholarships to agricultural colleges have been awarded by the county committees of agriculture, which have in most cases confined elegibility for them to persons resident or owning land in their functional areas, which exclude urban areas.  In doing so committees were acting in accordance with the Agriculture Acts.  In the case of Waterford, the committee made special provision in their scheme to enable the children of residents in the urban areas of the county to be awarded scholarships after the requirements of qualified candidates from the rural areas had been met.  I understand that the sole qualified <Col N="230" /> urban candidate was in fact awarded a scholarship under this provision.</P>
    <P>In future years the award of these scholarships will be a function of An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta.  The matters raised by the Deputy have been brought to the attention of ACOT.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that children of parents who live in an urban area are just as much entitled to a scholarship to an agricultural college as children of parents who live in rural areas?  Does the Minister agree that the scheme, as presently operated, discriminates against children from urban areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that this matter arises because of the extension of the borough boundary in Waterford.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is basically a matter for ACOT to determine whether children from urban areas should be awarded scholarships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that under the scheme children of parents living in urban areas who wish to avail of such scholarships are deprived of doing so by virtue of their residence? Does the Minister agree that that is not very democratic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Agricultural scholarships are awarded to sons or daughters of farmers with the intention of getting young people to return to the land.  Those living in urban areas, unless they have land in a rural areas, do not qualify.  If their parents have land in a rural area they automatically qualify.  We want most of the money paid to sons and daughters of farmers who will return to the land thereby improving farmers' incomes in general.</P>

      <P>It would not be necessary or desirable to publish all reports commissioned by the Department of Health or by individual health agencies.

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will outline the Government's attitude in regard to facilitating access by Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the general public to health board homes and residential care institutions; if he is satisfied with the present position regarding access; and if he has any plans to introduce changes in these respects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of access to the homes and institutions referred to by the Deputy is a matter for the health boards.  Each of the boards has arrangements for committees of its members to visit their institutions regularly.  These committees may include Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas who are on the health boards.</P>
      <P>Inquiries which I have made from the boards indicate that any request for access by other persons to homes and institutions is considered on its merits and that generally no difficulties have arisen in relation to the arrangements.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the boards are acting reasonably in the matter and I do not think that I should take action to introduce changes in the procedures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not know of a number of instances where Members of this House were refused admission to health board homes and residential care institutions, including members of his own party?  Does he <Col N="236" /> believe it should be necessary for a Member of this House to apply formally for the normal courtesy of admission to a home or institution publicly funded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a summary of the complaints received through the different health boards.  I will summarise very briefly.  In the case of the Eastern Health Board, there has been no complaint from any public representative about access to the board's institutions.  In the case of the Midland Health Board, there has been no recent complaint from public representatives about access.  In the case of the Mid-Western Health Board the situation is similar.  In the case of the North-Eastern Health Board, no complaint was received about access to institutions.  In the case of the North-Western Health Board, no such request was received in the recent past.  In the case of the SouthEastern Health Board, similarly there was no complaint.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Western Health Board, there was one incident which was widely reported.  Perhaps that is the one to which the Deputy is referring.  That was considered by the other public representatives who are members of the standing committee associated with the board.  They reached agreement with the Deputy concerned.  In effect, the resident medical superintendent has the statutory function in relation to the operation of psychiatric hospitals under his control. There are arrangements through the boards and through the public representatives who are appointed to the various committees to visit through visiting committees, standing committees, and so on. When other Deputies have indicated a desire to visit, they have been accommodated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the number of reports may bear no relationship to the actual number of incidents to which I have referred?  People may not necessarily report or complain to the board but may go away in high dudgeon, or offended, or rebuffed.  As a matter of principle one should not have to grovel for access to homes and institutions which are publicly funded, particularly  <Col N="237" /> when there have been so many allegations recently about practices and procedures which perhaps should be more modern than they have been up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only deal with factual situations which are raised in a factual way.  We have an inspector of mental institutions and he can inspect any mental institution on my behalf.  If any complaints are brought to my attention I will certainly take them up.  I will certainly take up any complaints raised by Deputies. These complaints have not been raised formally.  I accept, as the Deputy says, that people may have requested access and not been given it at the time at which they requested it or on the conditions requested.  If that is so, they should bring it to our attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the composition of the visiting committees is not very important.  They are members of the health committees, or the health authorities, or the health boards, who go around to the various hospitals on behalf of the boards.  The Minister is being asked is he aware that Members of this House should not have to have their applications vetted by the visiting committees.  Their requests should be acceded to without any trouble by the chief executive of the health board concerned.  Would he now take steps to ensure that when a Member of this House applies formally to visit an institution in this State that request is acceded to immediately by the chief executive officer of each and every health board in the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with the Deputy that the members of the local committees are not important.  These are the locally elected representatives and they have this specific task.  They were appointed for that reason.  On the question of access for Deputies, if a Deputy brings to my attention the fact that he is not being allowed access I will be happy to investigate the particular incident. Deputies must realise that the health <Col N="238" /> boards have statutory authority and statutory functions.  It would not be desirable that just because a person is a member of this House he should feel that he had to investigate all the activities of the health boards.  If Deputies feel they are not getting reasonable courtesy and access, we will certainly take that up. When we gave statutory authority to the health boards we gave it to them to carry out their jobs with certain committees and administrative arrangements.  We will stand behind those arrangements because we have tended to centralise and bureaucratise the whole operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was necessary to try to ensure that proper safeguards are adhered to in roadside trading.  I hope that the safeguard provided here will protect the private individual who has a grievance against a roadside trader in relation to some item purchased so that he can have his grievance redressed.  This Bill does not go far enough in that regard.</P>
      <P>In relation to sites or stalls for roadside trading I hope that the local authority will be able to ensure that there is sanitary accommodation, cleanliness and so on. This is essential.  Casual trading is desirable as it provides people with an opportunity to purchase items at a bargain price.  However, casual traders are exempt from rates, taxes and so on, so I hope they will not be allowed to cause a nuisance for ordinary shopkeepers who have to pay these duties, by being allowed to do business on their front doorsteps thus damaging legitimate business.</P>
      <P>In some instances this has occurred and customers endeavouring to enter the shops have been intimidated by roadside traders.  People have to make their way through an array of 20 to 30 tables laid out with goods for sale in order to get to a shop and the shopkeepers can see customers having to come through almost a barricade of tables to get into the shop. This presents a serious problem for the genuine shopkeeper.  I hope a situation will not arise where customers of certain shops will have to put up with that sort of thing where casual traders have been provided with sites by the local authority. This happens at present in many cases and people have difficulty in entering shops because of caravans, stalls, vans and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="279" /> As far as I am aware the Minister has received representations from trade organisations in regard to this.  These people are concerned that kerbside traders will be provided with stalls outside their shops and that they will damage their business.  I hope that these casual trading areas are not going to be situated where they will damage existing businesses. They should not be damaged or affected in any way.  I hope this will be safeguarded against.  I hope the Bill not alone works but is seen to work, and that some of the people who have permits and licences do not breach them by conducting business outside the casual trading areas.  Departmental officials should ensure that people do not go outside the scope of the law.  It will be difficult to enforce this and I hope the Minister's Department will be vigilant in closing loopholes which would enable people to get around the law.  That is essential</P>
    <P>I note that the local authorities have power to grant a permit for trading in a particular area.  They can also designate land as a casual trading area.  The Bill specifies the procedure whereby this is set out in newspapers circulating in the area, and the order is made by the local authority.  A person has a right to appeal only to the Circuit Court.  I am surprised at this, I feel a person should have a right to appeal to the High Court against the decision of the Circuit Court.  Would the Minister explain this?</P>
    <P>I am in broad agreement with the Bill. Casual trading has been in this country from time immemorial and it will continue for a long time to come.  The curbs in the Bill are very necessary and we welcome them apart from the reservations I have mentioned.  Trade of this nature is desirable if there are proper restrictions on it.  People can purchase items at a reasonable price but we must ensure that these traders do not have an unfair advantage over private individuals who are carrying on businesses.  The road-side traders must contribute their fair share of taxation.  We must also ensure that their business is conducted in safe areas.  No licences or permits should be granted for trading on national, primary <Col N="280" /> or secondary routes.  It would be a grave mistake to allow this.</P>
    <P>A fee of £5 is reasonable for people selling agricultural and horticultural products.  I repeat, we are importing far too many foodstuffs, fruit and horticultural products.  The Minister should encourage people to involve themselves in trading as specified for a licence of £5. If people can be encouraged to sell produce of this nature it will help to curb imports and it will mean that people have an opportunity to purchase these items at a reasonable price.</P>
    <P>One of the things that concerns me regarding legislation that has been brought in &mdash; the Occasional Trading Act, the Pyramid Selling Bill and the present Bill &mdash; is that it has not reached many people throughout the country.  It got coverage of a minor nature on radio and television but the nitty gritty and the hard facts did not get across to people. They are reported also in the national newspapers regularly but I hope that local papers will co-operate in disseminating the spirit and the contents of the measures that are before the House.  One paper, the <i>Westmeath/Offaly Independent</i>, wrote about casual trading in their leading article on 7 November 1980. Local papers are read very extensively and I hope that many more articles will be written about casual trading and also about the Occasional Trading Act, the Trading Stamps Act, the Pyramid Selling Bill and the Sale of Goods Act.  There is a tremendous amount of information in all this legislation.  People should be made aware of the benefits that are there and to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>I am happy with most of the contents of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to avail of this opportunity to congratulate you, a Cheann Comhairle, on your new office in the Chair and to wish you every success in that role.  Also I extend my congratulations to the Minister of State in his new office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  From the point of view of Dublin, we have seen in recent years a new breed setting up, the casual traders, and they have become a scourge <Col N="281" /> in the city.  This trend started on the periphery of Dublin and it has worked its way into our smaller back streets.  It must be said at the start that a most important aspect of this question of casual trading by the fly-by-night operators is that they provide no after-sales service nor is there any attention for their customers once they have sold them the goods.</P>
    <P>The aspect that I am concerned about directly is the question of jobs.  By supporting casual trading we are in direct conflict with the provisions of jobs in shops and in industry.  I have found &mdash; and I am quite sure that this has been the practice throughout the country &mdash; that many of the goods that are on sale are a cheaper variety goods imported in massive quantities and, consequently, at very low prices and probably, in many cases, under deception.  People feel that they are getting goods of quality and will buy on that account alone.  However, no after-sales service is provided and people are left with goods that they cannot have repaired if anything goes wrong with them and they have no recourse in that respect.  Someone purchased quite a large cassette radio from a casual trader and, on opening the radio, found it to be full of wrist-watches, obviously smuggled. This gives an example of the type of protection that is needed for consumers. Suddenly a person intending no harm could find himself receiving stolen goods. There are probably many cases of this kind.</P>
    <P>The Bill is excellent in that it is a balanced approach to casual trading.  It is not a finger pointing at those who have been trading casually as a service to the community over the centuries.  The amount of money that is being made by organised rings of casual traders is a matter which needs consideration.  I referred earlier to the practice of casual trading in Dublin.  This has grown into a situation where people are organised to trade casually even in motor cars.  A number of our quiet residential roads are blocked due to indiscriminate parking of old, abandoned cars and cars that cannot be sold easily through legitimate outlets. These casual traders come along, rent a premises and then park about a dozen <Col N="282" /> cars outside, and the pressure from the residents of the area becomes immense before these traders move along.  This is the extreme in casual trading.  The problem is severe and it is growing in Dublin where people purchase motor cars and then they cannot get the satisfactory after-sales service which is part and parcel of buying a motor car.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the matter which needs attention is the question of people trading casually in a premises that they have rented for perhaps a day or two.  It could be argued that provision is made under the Occasional Trading Act, 1979 to prevent this practice but, as the Minister has referred to the loophole whereby people can trade in this manner, I would like to amplify the point.  Casual traders come to Dublin and other parts of the country and rent a room or a suite of rooms in a hotel where they sell the goods.  They put an advertisement perhaps in the newspapers on Saturday when it is impossible to get in touch with Government Departments to report them and they sell their goods by auction or straight trading on Sunday or Monday morning. This happens quickly before the Garda can prosecute them or get at them through the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism.</P>
    <P>I am thinking of a carpet sale which took place recently.  The traders set up as experts on Persian or Oriental carpets but nobody had any means of finding out whether their claim to this was correct and the goods could have been of cheap quality from the Orient.  We are trying to encourage the national &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; attitude in this country and this type of trading, which is opposed diametrically to that concept, should be stamped out straight away.  With the best will in the world people support such sales because they feel that they are getting good value, but the sales are run by perhaps very slick salesmen who can talk people into these supposed bargains and convince them that the goods are cheap because there are no great overheads and therefore they can afford to charge a price less than the goods would cost in the shops.  When, to their regret, the people discover that the goods are inferior they try to get back <Col N="283" /> to these casual traders who have disappeared without trace.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign. A certain store in Dublin made a very strong effort to encourage that campaign. Within a week or two of the start of it sellers from overseas orchestrated a campaign of their own to scuttle it.  That is serious and from that point of view I welcome the Bill.  I feel that the Minister will refer to this point when he is summing up and will make provision that the casual trader cannot avail of the practice of simply renting a premises to add some type of psuedo respectability to the malpractice. Of course there are no overheads and no staff to consider.  There are no rates and there is no stock to hold. This is very unfair competition.  Previous speakers have pointed out this before now, but it must be brought home to people who are engaged in casual trading that from now on they will have to pay for an annual licence.  Then they will realise also that this will necessitate inspection of their premises.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's provision whereby local authorities will be able to designate areas of the city or anywhere in the country where casual trading can take place.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier of the problem in relation to motor car trading, which reminds me of the appalling traffic conjestion caused by this type of casual trading.  We do not wish to go overboard and to be complete kill-joys in our attitude and thus eliminate a vital fact of the life of the country as far as small-time selling is concerned. I am directing my criticism as vehemently as possible at organised casual trading through which the public are deliberately deceived and cannot be assured of any after sales service.  That is another reason why the Bill is particularly welcome.</P>
    <P>Another point is that a lot of this type of trading occurs on Sundays.  It is a dreadful experience to drive to the seaside or elsewhere on a Sunday and find oneself in a two or three-mile long traffic jam caused by casual traders along the wayside.  Indeed such traders welcome <Col N="284" /> traffic stoppages because they assist them in their business.  Vast quantities of goods are being sold in this way without guarantee to the consumer.  It nearly got out of hand in Dublin where we have an unfortunate itinerant problem on our hands.  Many itinerants engage in this type of casual trading.</P>
    <P>A most undesirable element of this type of business became manifest recently in Terenure when itinerants were encouraged, indeed paid, to occupy a site in order to put pressure on local residents to facilitate developers to get their way.  Casual trading is an established part of the livelihood of itinerants, they have been at it for many years, but when it becomes organised in the way I have described it must be stamped out straight away.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides a balanced approach. It does not propose a clamp-down on charitable work, sales of work and so forth.  However, trading in the name of charitable institutions sometimes leaves a lot to be desired because people have been known to cash in on the charitable side, perhaps giving a certain amount of what they make to charitable institutions which they use only as a front.</P>
    <P>I wish the Bill every success.  It will tighten up a great area of illicit trading in Dublin and with the Christmas season coming up it is appropriate to protect the consumer and to safeguard jobs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Bill is necessary to deal with the unfair competition which is involved in casual trading.  It is also necessary to remedy some of the nuisance and street obstruction caused by casual trading, and I hope it is wide enough to deal with the selling of inferior goods in the course of casual trading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of unfair competition, it has been said that casual trading constitutes very unfair competition at the moment.  Traders drive into towns on prime market days, they set up stalls and trade all day.  They do not pay rates to the towns and I am sure they do not contribute anything to the social welfare fund operated by the State.  Then they drive off again leaving behind a mess of <Col N="285" /> litter which must be cleared up at the expense of the ratepayers against whom they have been competing during the day.  I have always thought that not only is that unfair but that it can be intolerable from the point of view of smaller shopkeepers in the towns.  Between the large chain supermarkets and stores on the one hand and the casual traders on the other, the small to medium-sized shopkeepers are operating in nearly intolerable conditions.</P>
    <P>Since 1926 the law in this regard has been defective.  It has not been strong enough to enable local authorities to move casual traders from positions in towns where they have been creating a nuisance, an obstruction and congestion, and indeed in some cases they have made it impossible for people to get into public buildings such as post offices to transact legitimate business.  Therefore, the Bill is overdue, not by a few years but by at least a quarter of a century.</P>
    <P>Having been a member of the local authority for several years, with one enjoyable break, I know the troubles local authorities encounter by this casual trading.  Therefore I hope the Bill is strong enough to restore some element of fair competition into trade.  I agree that these people provide a service and that many people want to avail of that service.  I do not propose to go through the Bill section by section&mdash;that can be done more effectively on Committee Stage&mdash;but I have been asking myself a question in regard to the permits to be issued to enable people to trade casually. It also gives authority to the local authorities to designate areas within their sphere of jurisdiction, and where such areas are designated, the casual trader will have to get a local licence for which he will pay £20.</P>
    <P>As I see it, this casual trader can acquire the right to trade in several towns &mdash; I was going to say six because there are only six trading days but, if he was big enough he could trade in 15 towns or in as many towns as he could get people to represent him &mdash; for £100.  There was a time when £100 was a sizeable sum and <Col N="286" /> a person had to think before spending it, but having regard to inflation, £100 can be dealt with lightly.  In my opinion, £100 is not a sufficient fee for a national casual trading permit.  If the casual trader is a small man, operating in one or two towns, that might be a sufficient fee to charge, but if he were operating in six towns that is not a sufficient fee to introduce fair competition.  He does not pay any rates while a person with a lock-up shop in the centre of any town with a population of 5,000 or 6,000 upwards, is paying a few hundred pounds a year. Admittedly, the casual trader is operating only one day a week but he is operating on the prime day.  The Minister should have further thoughts about this and see if he could introduce categories of licences.  I realise that if we break up the licence into categories it will be very hard to identify the big man but, in my view, an effort should be made in this area.</P>
    <P>The biggest difficulties local authorities have had over the years in dealing with these casual traders were that they were confronted with ancient charters and market rights and attempt after attempt to solve the problem and get the traders moved fron one part of the town to another failed.  That certainly failed so far as my local authority were concerned and I do not know of any local authority which succeeded in this area.</P>
    <P>I hope the authority given in this Bill is wide enough to enable local authorities to extinguish existing trading rights because there are old charters which set aside parts of a town for the sale of clothes, another part for the sale of vegetables and so on.  If the Bill is not wide enough, it is no use.  At present prime market squares all over Ireland are used by casual traders and there is no authority to move them.  Efforts by local authorities to change by-laws have not been successful and I hope this Bill is sufficient to do that.  I also hope it is sufficient to enable local authorities to acquire market rights held by people other than themselves.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (2) contains a list of things that are excluded from casual trading. One is selling at a market or fair held in pursuance of a market right.  The definition <Col N="287" /> of &ldquo;market right&rdquo; is &ldquo;a right conferred by a franchise or a statute to hold a fair or market, that is to say, a concourse of buyers and sellers to dispose of commodities;&rdquo;.  I hardly think that includes a person setting up a stand, but if a number of these people set up stands in a square, would that exclude them from the definition of casual trader?  Section 15 imposes penalties.</P>
    <P>I am glad this Bill was introduced, although it is 25 years overdue.  I am firmly of the opinion that the fee is not sufficiently high to introduce fair competition into trading and I hope the Minister will be able to confirm that existing market and selling rights can be extinguished and that the local authorities can accommodate them elsewhere.</P>
    <P>This Bill can be better dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I was one of those people who made representations in regard to this legislation because I was aware of the unfair competition that had to be faced <Col N="288" /> by regular traders as a result of the operations of casual traders who do not pay either rates or taxes.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that some of the allegations that have been made may have been exaggerated but undoubtedly street traders were able to sell to the public at prices that were much lower than those being charged by registered traders.  The casual trader whom I would refer to in particular is the itinerant who offers goods for sale on the side of the road.  There has been a good deal of that sort of activity without there being overheads of any description involved.  I am aware that a number of companies have had to go out of business as a result of the kind of competition with which they had to contend because of casual trading. These people were mostly in the electrical goods business.</P>
      <P>I trust that the Minister, through this legislation, will be able to put a stop to the practice of roadside trading which is the type of trading that I consider to be the worst in the context of what we are talking about.  Street trading and market trading have been features of our life for a very long time and these forms of trading are accepted generally but roadside trading is a different matter.  Anyone passing the encampments of those who engage in this type of trading can see there many new motor cars showing Northern Ireland registrations. Obviously, there is no shortage of money so far as these people are concerned.  By their activities they are taking jobs away from people who are employed with regular traders.  Therefore, I hope that from now on anybody who sees casual trading taking place will get in touch either with the Garda or with the Department about the matter.  We have waited a long time for this legislation.  It has been difficult to draft but it should put a stop to the sort of roadside trading that is being carried on on an increasing scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One aspect of legislation of this nature which should concern us is the question of penalties.  We should have a system whereby penalties could be updated by regulation instead of having to introduce amending legislation whenever it is considered necessary to increase penalties. <Col N="289" /> There is in existence legislation that was introduced as far back as the turn of the century and which provides for penalties that are laughable in today's terms.  There are many cases in which there is provision for maximum fines of £5 but in order to bring that figure up to a realistic level amending legislation would be necessary. I suggest that the Department consider this whole area with a view to having a situation whereby penalties for breaches of the law could be increased by way of regulation.</P>
    <P>In the case we are talking of, a fine of £500 would not mean very much to the casual trader though it probably would represent at least the amount that a registered trader would be paying by way of rent or that market people would pay the local authorities for space.  It is very important that the roadside trader is put out of business.  If they wish to register and be licensed they are free to make the necessary application.  Then, if they are successful they can continue to trade but will have to pay their fair share of rates and taxes.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the £100 licence fee is adequate.  That does not mean very much one way or the other.  Even if the fee were £500, or, perhaps, £1,000, the difference to the Exchequer would not be great and neither would it mean very much in terms of prohibiting people from seeking licences.  There must be strict control in regard to the granting of licences so that there will not be situations in which, perhaps, six people will operate under the umbrella of a licence granted to some other person.  I can understand a licensee sending somebody to represent him at a stall but we must be vigilant in ensuring that one licence will apply to one activity only and that a licensee will not consider himself free to have stalls in six different places on the basis of one licence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly, casual trading in many of its aspects has become a menace in recent years.  I exempt from my remarks those traditional traders who have been involved in selling fish, for example, at regular stands in our towns and cities down through the years, but <Col N="290" /> the casual trading which many have regarded as an invasion of the roadsides in recent times has become a curse and has caused harm to every sector of the community.</P>
      <P>One would think initially that the consumer gains from this type of trading but that is not so.  The consumer does not gain because the cheap bargain often turns out to be the very dear dud.  I am glad that we have the opportunity of discussing in the House a Bill to deal with this problem.  The only thing I am concerned about is whether the Bill will be effective in controlling the problem.</P>
      <P>The present situation has caused problems for the consumer, the established traders in the towns and villages throughout the country and employees and trade unions in relation to its effect on employment. I am in favour of street trading being controlled.  However, there are some aspects which have to be borne in mind in relation to controlling the problem and which are relevant in considering the type of legislation we should be introducing.</P>
      <P>It is clear to me that many of the roadside traders have been operating without the normal constraints on traditional business from the point of view of VAT and other taxes.  I have no proof in relation to this but it has been suggested to me that the source of the goods in many cases is questionable.  The Bill is an attempt to tackle the problem.  Does the Minister feel that it will be adequate to do this?  It seems to me that the amount paid for a general licence could be considered inadequate and, with the rate of inflation we have had in recent years, it will certainly be inadequate in a few years.  I suggest to the Minister, firstly, that he fix a higher figure at this stage and, secondly, and more importantly, that he reserve the power to amend the figure by ministerial order when he considers it appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know how difficult it is to get another Bill before the House.  Some of the legislation we are talking about in regard to casual trading possibly goes back to the Street Hawkers Act in the last century.  I believe the figure in regard to the general licence should be higher <Col N="291" /> and that power should be provided to revise that figure by ministerial regulation from time to time.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the possibility of one of those traders obtaining redress.  The Bill provides that the trader is obliged to display his permit.  Is this sufficient?  I had experience once of somebody who dealt with one of those traders attempting to obtain legal redress against him.  It was like chasing a fly throughout the country to catch up with the trader.  I do not think that there is sufficient protection for the consumer by merely requiring the trader to display his permit.  He should have to provide a permanent address to the Department and, legally, any documents served at that address should be sufficient service for the purpose of court proceedings.  Would the Minister consider that a further protection for the consumer might be to insist on some form of insurance bond to meet reasonable claims.  I do not have the full answer to the problem but as I had experience of somebody who dealt with one of those roadside traders trying to contact him, I am concerned that the consumer has the same rights of redress in being able to bring a claim before the courts in relation to such a trader.</P>
    <P>The situation at the moment is utterly chaotic.  Those roadside traders move in a fly-by-night fashion from one town to the next.  They are in a state of perpetual motion.  I fear that the Bill will not bring any improvement in that regard.  It is an attempt to tackle the problem but I fear that it may not be totally effective.  I believe it needs to be tightened up in relation to giving more protection to the consumer.  I ask the Minister to consider any further steps which might be taken to ensure that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I give a guarded welcome to the Bill and think it has many factors to recommend it.  I hope it will not be interpreted as a witch hunt against legitimate traders, those who over the years have held hawkers licences and were engaging in their business in a legitimate manner and serving a useful purpose. The number of hawkers and pedlers in <Col N="292" /> recent years has multiplied out of all proportion. It has been obvious for quite a time that restrictive legislation was necessary and I welcome the Bill from that point of view.  I would like the Minister to tell us the number of hawkers licences which have been issued each year over the past twenty years.  I believe there has been a dramatic increase in the number issued.  Unfortunately, the increase is not justified.</P>
      <P>There is a place for legitimate casual trading.  I believe it is a constitutional right but it should be done in an orderly manner and there should be a restriction on the number of licences issued as is the case in relation to any other business, such as in the licensed trade, salmon fishing and so on.  It is recognised that there must be an acceptable number of licences issued and that there cannot be a proliferation to the extent that the right is abused.  The right of casual trading has been abused to the extent that the roadside trader besides creating a health hazard when the caravans move along, because those people have very limited sanitary services available, also at times create a traffic hazard.  I have no doubt that from time to time serious accidents have been caused not only because of the goods which the traders have on show but also by members of the public stopping their cars without indicating, or arriving in such large numbers as to prevent the free flow of traffic.  The position has been just as bad in towns.  What were known locally as market days or fair days have given an opportunity to hordes of casual traders to descend on towns and to mop up the profits that otherwise would go to businesses in the towns.  The time is long overdue for controls to be introduced.  When there is an abuse in any sector of society we are expected by the public, and especially by people who are paying heavy rates and taxes, to correct that situation.  This Bill will go a long way towards bringing about that ordered state in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is not a witch hunt.  There is an alternative.  In his reply I should like the Minister to expand on the idea that local authorities would have the right to provide alternative market places, designated <Col N="293" /> areas where these people could trade.  I hope local authorities will adopt a responsible attitude in this matter and will designate areas that will be reasonably accessible to the public and give the genuine street trader or casual trader an opportunity to earn his living.  I should hate to see a situation where the street trader was pushed into such a remote area that he did not have a chance to make a decent living.  This is an abuse on the other extreme that must be avoided. I should like the Minister and his officials to be vigilant in this regard, to see that the alternative is practical and reasonable.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Bill will hold up in law? We have been told that a loophole has been found in the legislation dealing with occasional trading which was dealt with in this House.  I am afraid that the legislation we have before us today is so technical and legalistic that there may be loopholes. I suppose we will find out the position with the passage of time.  From speaking to legal people, it appears to me that old charters, whether given by Queen Anne or by some other king or queen of England some hundreds of years ago have extraordinary strength in our courts.  I wonder if this Bill will be able to reduce those rights?  I am not asking that they be extinguished; I am just wondering if the charters can be reduced in their effects by virtue of this measure.  I understand that previously when attempts were made to change legislation to eliminate such charters it was found virtually impossible to do so. I hope we can dilute the strength of those charters because it is antiquated and ridiculous that charters going back centuries can still be valid and, at the same time, work to the detriment of genuine and established traders.  I shall look forward to a conclusion on this matter.  It is fairly certain that this Bill will be challenged in the courts and we will await the outcome with interest.</P>
    <P>On a minor and parochial scale, I should like to point out that in my home town.  Dungarvan, the Garda Síochána, at the request of the urban council, prosecuted street traders for parking for a <Col N="294" /> whole day in the centre of the town.  It was market day, the third Wednesday of the month.  The prosecution was upheld in the local district court but it was appealed to the High Court by the street traders.  I do not believe the case went through but I understand legal opinion was that the traders would win on appeal. I do not know if the legislation before us today is of such strength that such recourse to legal action will not be successful. It is my opinion there will be some legal battles with regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>The reason for that assumption is obvious.  Hundreds of traders have been making vast sums of money in recent years.  I have no evidence to say that their business is anything but legitimate.  I do not say they do not pay the correct taxes, whether it be VAT or customs duties, but it is obvious that these people are making considerable sums of money.  They will not give up without a fight.  I hope that the Bill before us will hold up.  It is not a penal Bill.  If designated market places which the local authority can earmark are provided in reasonably accessible areas I do not think the casual traders can complain.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's speech today it was stated that the trade union movement has been advocating that this legislation be introduced.  I have heard other trade unionists and members of the public advocate the contrary to a certain degree. They stated they were for the casual traders because they provide goods at such a low price, thus benefiting the general public and especially the poorer sections. I do not know if these people are providing top-quality goods at vastly reduced prices.  I am of the opinion that originally some of the traders provided good quality articles at very reasonable prices but the tendency in recent years has been for them to provide inferior quality goods at a higher cost.  With the advent in recent years of strict price controls the established businessman is not in a position to charge exorbitant rates.  I do not believe there is a valid argument that street traders are giving far better value.  It is my view that the difference is marginal.  In many ways the public needs to be protected <Col N="295" /> from the more unscrupulous street traders but we must be careful that the pendulum does not go from one extreme to the other.  In implementing this Bill we must not be seen to be vindictive or to crucify the legitimate trader who has done a service to this country over the years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. D. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the contributions made by Deputies and I am delighted that the Bill has been so well received.  There has been very little criticism of the Bill and the measures proposed to be introduced in relation to casual trading.</P>
      <P>I will refer first of all to a point made by Deputy Deasy.  It is not the purpose of the Bill to penalise anybody but merely to regulate a matter which has got out of hand.  It is felt that with the implementation of this Bill everybody will get a fair deal.  We are all aware of the problems which have been created over the years by people who congregate in large numbers in our smaller towns and cream off the profits which in some instances should go to the people who maintain services for the local population.</P>
      <P>The question of how the Bill can be implemented is not an easy one and we realise that there may be problems in certain areas.  However, the Bill gives a great deal of authority to the Garda, to inspectors of the Department and to the local authorities to ensure that any illegalities in connection with this type of trading can be checked and restricted.  I agree with the suggestion made by Deputy Enright and some other speakers that goods offered for sale occasionally by these people may be stolen or &ldquo;hot&rdquo; goods and this legislation will leave the Garda in a very strong position in dealing with this kind of trading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Questions have been raised about the role of local authorities in the implementation of the Bill.  I assume that local authorities will use their commonsense and discretion in deciding the areas which should be designated.  The members of local authorities are people who are familiar with circumstances in their own <Col N="296" /> areas and are constantly in touch with various interests.  I feel sure that they will bring this knowledge to bear on the question of designating areas for casual trading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the designated areas have to meet any standards?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It will be necessary for local authorities to take into account matters such as hygiene.  Deputy Enright mentioned that areas should not be designated along national primary or national secondary roads and I agree entirely with this.  The designation of areas along such roads would add to traffic hazards and the pace of traffic along these roads is generally very fast. Local authorities would take these matters into consideration in designating areas.  Despite any pressure from any source, I cannot envisage that they would select such areas for designation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy raised this matter and we will go into it in more detail on the next Stage.  The Deputy also raised the possibility of one licence being used by a group of people.  I assume that local authorities will ensure that it is not possible for one licence to be used by several traders.  There have been suggestions in connection with this type of selling, which could be discriminatory, but there is a limit to what can be done in relation to the making of such regulations.  The possibility of having certain kinds of identification in the licence would create a problem because there would be a certain amount of discrimination in asking a casual trader to do something which the ordinary businessman is not required to do.  The matter <Col N="297" /> has been given much consideration by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I want to mention.  An ordinary businessman is a permanent fixture whereas this particular person would be only there once over a period of two years and, as the Minister mentioned, the question of identification would arise and perhaps a photograph would help in the identification. This is commonplace on the Continent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest to the Deputy and to the Minister that we tease out these matters on Committee. They would be much more relative to Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy, the extra powers now being given to the Garda and to the officers of the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism and the local authorities in relation to this type of trading will help to eliminate many of the irregularities which we are facing at the moment.  It would not be possible to include all the details that Deputy Enright has given.  I agree that there is a need to do everything possible to ensure that these people are tied down as much as possible so that they will not be in a position, as they have been, to get away with many things that we all disagree with and will not come down on the consumer by dealing in any illegal way in the conduct of their affairs.  Deputy O'Keeffe mentioned a problem he had in relation to some of these people where he was trying to tie down a particular person who was found to have done something which was illegal; he found it impossible to tie him down.  The Bill and its provisions will help to get over the problem which Deputy O'Keeffe raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Enright mentioned another matter which is of importance.  He said that all possible information should be made available to the general public on the provisions of this Bill.  I agree entirely with this.  I am sure that when the Bill has <Col N="298" /> gone through both Houses of the Oireachtas my Department will try to ensure that the provisions of the Bill are made known to the general public and to traders.  So I cannot see any problem in relation to that matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright also raised the question of appeals to the Circuit Court.  He questioned why we decided not to go beyond appeals to the Circuit Court.  We have been advised by the Office of the Attorney General that appeals to the Circuit Court cover the situation.  We have been acting on the advice received.  Again if the Deputy, on Committee Stage, shows any good reason why we should go beyond that then we will be glad to listen to what he has to say and if we find that there are reasons for going beyond that point we will take the matter up with the Office of the Attorney General.  But at the moment that is the advice we have and it is because of that advice that we have decided not to go beyond that point.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brady dealt with trading in hotels and dancehalls and other places. That does not come under this Bill.  That was covered already under the Occasional Trading Act which was introduced some time ago.  This Bill as it stands does not cover that aspect of things.  The Deputy mentioned the question of after-sales service and matters of that kind.  It is well to bring that item to the notice of the general public.  It is a very serious problem in relation to casual traders because very often that type of service is not available. Even though the consumer or member of the general public may be spending a considerable amount of money on the articles, after sales service is not available and it is certainly not at all satisfactory. Here again this is highlighted in the Bill and it should serve as a warning to the general public in relation to their dealings with these people.  Deputy Fitzpatrick also mentioned this question.  The licensing facility and the licence itself will tie down the trader and will protect the consumer against this kind of unfortunate situation that people are in at the moment.  Under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act the consumer can be protected and with the issue of the <Col N="299" /> licence we will have something definite to work on as against the situation we have at the moment.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies questioned the licence fee of £100 and were of the opinion that it should be a much larger figure.  The Department have gone into this question. It may seem small in the case of the bigger operator but there are a number of small operators who will find it hard enough to pay £100 and it would be very unsatisfactory to have a grading of fees.  It is something that would not be too easy to introduce. Where would one start?  I cannot envisage how one could operate the fee on a graded basis.  I am not sure whether it was Deputy Fitzpatrick who mentioned the possibility of introducing an increase in the fee by way of ministerial order. There is a provision in the Bill for this purpose.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies mentioned the powers of local authorities to acquire any rights deriving from charters and letters of patent.  We are advised that the measures proposed in sections 8 and 9 will be adequate to allow local authorities to acquire any of these rights.  By way of a general observation on that I might say that a general right to the public to engage in buying and selling is provided by charters and letters in Thurles, Ennis, Carlow, Dungarvan, Longford, Mallow, Navan, Mitchelstown, Kenmare and Wexford.  Markets and fairs in other places are authorised by statute under the Markets and Fairs Clauses Act, 1847, local legislation, such as the Bray Township Act, 1866, Dublin Markets Act, 1899, and so on.  Royal grants usually entitle the grantees to collect tolls and other fees.  The local authorities in Thurles and Ennis acquired the rights of the original grantees.  But we are advised that these rights are very restricted and cannot be readily altered under existing legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the omission of references to certificate level courses and to diploma level courses, it would be wise to allow the college to be empowered to have certificate level courses.  There may be a very good reason for awarding certificates or diplomas in respect of specialist courses which it is hoped the college will run.  It may help teachers to pursue such courses if, having pursued them, they get a recognised qualification in a specialist field.  The best way to do that would be to allow the college to award certificates or to run certificate level and or diploma level courses.  I think it is a serious omission in the Bill.</P>
      <P>In relation to section (1) 4 (c), I feel the Minister is overriding the governing body in this respect.  The governing body has a part to play in the decision to lay on a course and I would prefer to see words such as &ldquo;the function of the college shall be to provide such other courses as they may from time to time determine and under such conditions as the Minister may lay down.&rdquo;  The governing body should be the initiating body rather than the Minister imposing power.</P>
      <P>In relation to subsection (1) (e), which says that subject to the approval of the Minister, after consultation with an tÚdarás, the college may buy and acquire lands or buildings, Subsection (2) of section 2 already gives this power to the college.  Why is it necessary to repeat that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">

      <P>There are problems here because one of the basic things we have to remember is that we are setting up a college of teacher education, and I am sure Deputy Collins will agree with me that it is hardly a matter for dispute that one of the longest and hardest battles which was fought by teachers over the years was the right to an all-graduate profession.  Presumably, this is the reason for the limitation in the terms of reference of the college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may even be power under section <Col N="305" /> 4 (1) (c) for courses other than degree courses to be provided in certain circumstances if the Minister deems it appropriate.  Perhaps this would meet the point Deputy Collins raised.  The general question of the degree nature of teacher qualifications is not in doubt.  There may be a wider philosophical question about the propriety of educating teachers in institutions in which teachers only are educated, but that is another debate and I do not propose to go into it now.  I underwrite the teachers' right to a degree and I see the primary function of the institution as providing graduate teachers. In another context I am sorry that the old problem of the non-graduate teacher has not been adequately tackled and, presumably, will be left to the care of posterity to deal with.  Those points are relevant on the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point was the one made by Deputy Collins about the omission of certificates and diplomas.  They are not mentioned because the purpose of the Bill is purely to provide suitable degree level courses for the training teachers.  Deputy Horgan rightly said that this was connected with the long campaign to have an all degree teaching profession.  This does not preclude other courses in the future being made available in the college.  The college is specifically for training physical education teachers and teachers of the specialist subjects, as they are called.  No doubt the college itself will see its role as being supportive of the teachers when they are actually in the profession and there is no reason why they cannot provide in-service courses for the teachers in these areas. It is a teacher training institution and the decision elaborated over the years of having an all-graduate teaching profession more or less imposes the obligation of having a degree level course in the college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point made on section 4 (1) (c) by Deputy Collins, there is no intention in the Bill to override the college's initiative because, apart from that section saying &ldquo;such other courses as the Minister may from time to time determine,&rdquo;<Col N="306" /> of course the college itself has the power to initiate courses.  There is no way that that will preclude the governing body's initiative.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point made on section 4 (1) (e) that there seems to be a superfluous subsection, subsection (2) of section was mentioned.  It says that the college &ldquo;shall be a body corporate with perpetual succession and power to sue and be sued in its corporate name and to acquire, hold and dispose of land.&rdquo;  That was the general empowering of the college and the other powers flow from it.</P>
    <P>In section 4 (e), the power is specific &mdash; to buy and acquire lands or buildings, to institute and, if thought fit, to award scholarships, prizes or other awards. Actual money is involved there.  The other is more or less a general legal definition of the body corporate and the powers which flow from the fact that it is a body corporate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan made the point about the old graduate profession and, indeed, I take his point that it is debatable as to whether teachers only should be educated with teachers in an institution.  It might be regarded as an academic weakness, but Members of the House will recall that I have a vision of the complex at Limerick &mdash; when it has had time to develop, grow, flex its muscles &mdash; involving a technological university with the National Institute for Higher Education in Limerick, Thomond College, and the training college for teachers, Mary Immaculate College, being involved in a development there.  I hope to live long enough to see that.  The usual date which I put on that possible development is about the end of the century, which is not so far away.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not terribly happy with the Minister's reply.  Section 4 (b) refers to providing courses for teachers already serving in such schools and institutions as may be determined by, in this case, the Minister.  Again, it is the Minister who specifically determines the courses, which is wrong.  The governing body should determine the courses, with the approval of the Minister.  There is a difference here because responsibility <Col N="307" /> lies properly, and should lie properly, with the governing body to initiate courses.  I am satisfied that the Minister should sanction the courses.  I agree with the Minister on that, although I am not even very happy doing that.  Emphasis must be placed on the fact that the governing body should be seen as being the pre-eminent agent in respect of the provision of courses.  In section 4 it is the Minister who is specified in (b) and (c). There is no reference to the governing body having the right to initiate courses or to lay on courses with the sanction of the Minister.  I am not happy with that situation.  It is a theme which has recurred in the NIHE, Limerick, Bill and the NIHE, Dublin, Bill, where the Minister is given the all-powerful presence in the Bill.  I do not agree with that.  The emphasis should be on, as far as possible, a reasonable independence for the educational institution, in this case Thomond College.  Of course, I agree with teachers having professional qualifications and a degree.  That has already been said on Second Stage.  However, I am making the point that the Minister has far too much power &mdash; or at least, is seen to have far too much power, even though what he has said differs from what actually is in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Coming back to references to diplomas and certificates, section 4 (b) refers to providing courses for teachers.  They may be able to provide courses, but will not be empowered to award certificates or diplomas.  That is the omission to which I am referring and that is an obvious omission from the Bill.  There should be an enabling subsection in the Bill to allow an award of a certificate or a diploma, apparently under the sanction of the NCEA, for such courses as in-service teaching or other special courses which the college may, in future, provide. There is no reference in the Bill to the awarding of certificates or diplomas and I am putting it forward that this is an omission.  I ask the Minister to give consideration to my points on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not at all see the necessity for the point which Deputy Collins <Col N="308" /> is labouring.  Courses to be provided for teachers already serving in such schools are obviously in-service courses in the fields of study for which Thomond College caters.  It is very important that the Minister and the Department of Education &mdash; which, in fact, deal with the qualifications of teachers and must be satisfied with these qualifications &mdash; should have a very strong say in the type of course and the person who should be taking such a course.  The teacher in an in-service course, by definition, has already the basic necessary qualification. Subsection (b) states that it is simply the college's function to provide courses and the courses will be funded through the HEA, on the basis of a recommendation from the Minister.  We simply indicate what teachers will benefit by particular in-service courses and the courses will be run and funded on that basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that there are posts of responsibility in our schools and it may very well be an extra qualification for teachers to accumulate, if they can get a certificate for special areas which would carry the appointment of a post of responsibility. That is my reason for raising this question. I congratulate the Minister on subsection (2) (b) where recognition is given to the fact that orders made under this subsection must have the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas, which is different from merely laying the orders before the Houses and giving 14 or 21 days before they automatically pass into law.  I am pleased to see that the Houses are being given recognition so far as a positive decision must be taken by the Houses of the Oireachtas in relation to orders made under this subsection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Sections 5 and 4 are, taken together, the heart of the Bill.  Section 4 did not present many problems as, over a number of pieces of legislation, we have teased out most of the issues involved in power and functions.  In relation to membership of the governing body, which comes under section 5, a number of issues need to be discussed.  It is always a difficult balancing act for a Minister and a Government and, indeed, for the Houses of the Oireachtas, to try to satisfy the legitimate desires of interested groups and persons involved &mdash; especially in education in which representative bodies of one kind or another proliferate &mdash; and at the same time ensure that the body will be an effective one, will do its work with expedition and will not be unduly hampered by internal wrangling.  The third <i>desideratum</i> is that <Col N="310" /> the public interest should be well served by the nomination by an appropriate number of members by the Government of the day.</P>
      <P>The particular nature of this institution could be better reflected in the governing body than the Minister's formula has it. We are dealing with an institution which will provide for the training of teachers of education and, not least, for teachers of what are traditionally known as the specialist subjects &mdash; metalwork, woodwork and so on.  These subjects have traditionally been their preserve for some 50 years and even though in recent years the subjects concerned have spread to all kinds of schools at second level it is true to say that in historical and present-day terms the bulk of this work has been carried out in the vocational sector.  The critical question we have to face is whether or not the vocational sector should have the explicit right of representation on the governing body not just out of concern for ancient piety but because the vocational sector still has, as it has always had, something very definite to contribute in terms of experience and knowledge to this whole area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised at the absence of any representative vocational education body in the list of organisations with the right of nomination to the governing body and even more surprised at the explicit reference to the fact that two of the members to be appointed shall be appointed on the recommendation of AnCO.  We are all aware of the fact that AnCO have a considerable amount to do with the kind of subjects the teachers will be trained in at these colleges but we should also be aware that AnCO's involvement in this area is by and large through the vocational education sector.  To that degree AnCO is, if anything, subsidiary to the vocational education sector in the exercise of its responsibilities in this area. The Minister may say that he has no objection in principle to what I am saying and that he may quite easily appoint, and presumably intends to appoint, under paragraph (4) (i) a representative of the vocational education body.  I do not believe that is enough.  In order to ensure <Col N="311" /> adequate representation for vocational education at this critical level I am urging that one of the members in the Minister's formula should come from AnCO and that one of the three members to be appointed under paragraph (4) (i) should be allocated to the IVEA by way of nomination from that body.</P>
    <P>That would not disturb the overall numbers of the governing body of the college.  It makes a specific representation for the IVEA on a level which is equivalent to that of the representation of full-time students of the college and is smaller than those who shall be appointed from the governing body of the Limerick NIHE or from the academic staff of the college.  It creates an equivalence between the IVEA and any other bodies representative of the interests of second level education.  I do not doubt the Minister's goodwill in this area but at this critical juncture in the formation and creation of a teacher education college for teachers of these subjects we would be wise not to leave it entirely to the Minister's goodwill.  We should try to write into this section a modest provision which will not only recognise the role the IVEA and the vocational sector in general have played in the past in this area but also its present role and future potential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the views expressed by Deputy Horgan.  We discussed the composition of Dublin NIHE and Limerick NIHE <i>ad nauseam</i> and we all agreed that any formula would not be acceptable to each one of us but we all recognised the difficulties of the Minister in ensuring that there is a balance. In the context of the NIHE Bills already discussed the formula in this legislation is not bad.  In relation to paragraph (g) it is difficult to understand how the universities will come together to appoint a member to the governing body of Thomond College.  It appears to be a monstrous system of appointing a member to represent the university sector.  I suggest that it would be easier to ask UCC, with whom the college has had some connections, to appoint a member.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like it to be the Minister's intention to appoint a member.  I hope the appointment comes independently from the university sector. The Minister should clarify that situation. Unfortunately, there is no way we can be sure that all the interests in the vocational sector are represented on the governing body.  I appreciate the part AnCO has to play in this sector but it does not really have a part to play in relation to the training of teachers.  It will only be in relation to the specialist courses to be provided by Thomond College that AnCO will be involved.  I would like to see better representation of the teaching profession on the governing body.  Deputy Horgan is anxious to give pride of place to the IVEA and I have no objection to that but the secondary school teachers might also wish to be represented on that body.  I would not like to prefer one to the other.  I do not think the Minister would like to be placed in the invidious position of having to choose a member from the TUI as opposed to a member from the ASTI or, indeed, an executive officer from the vocational sector. The Minister has struck a balance which may be criticised but not seriously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I thought because that would rule out what Deputy Collins was talking about.  I appreciate very much the motivation behind Deputy Horgan's amendment.  As he said, he was motivated by an appreciation of the work done by the IVEA.  I too appreciate very much the voluntary work done by the dedicated members of vocational educational committees throughout the country, and in this field even before the 1930 Act.  The fact that they are not specifically named in the Bill is not to be taken as a measure of my appreciation.  If the Bill were excluding them, I would be only too eager to accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Horgan mentioned one possible reply I could make which was that I could make provision for them in section 5 (4) (<i>i</i>) which reads:</P>
      <P>Three of those members shall be so appointed after consultation with such bodies representative of the interests of second level education as the Minister considers appropriate.</P>
      <P>That is so.  That is the place where the representative of the IVEA could be appointed by me.  I want to call the attention of the House to section 5 (4) (a) which reads:</P>
      <P>seven of those members shall be so appointed on the recommendation of the Minister in accordance with the provisions of subsection (5) of this section;</P>
      <P>There too there is plenty of scope for recognition of the IVEA.  Rather than putting it that way as a recognition of their services, I would prefer to put it in a vehicle for getting and using their expertise in this field.  That was one of the considerations which led me to have section 5 (4) (a) composed as it is composed in the Bill.  I can assure the House that, under either or both of those, it is my intention to appoint someone from the IVEA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to put it on the record of the House that it is my policy and set intention to increase the number of <Col N="314" /> teachers trained in these areas, particularly in the engineering, metal work, building and construction and woodwork areas, so that eventually all post-primary schools will be able to provide these courses which are becoming increasingly necessary.  For that reason I do not think there is any need for Deputy Horgan's amendment.  As I said already, I appreciate his motivation and the points he made.  If I thought there were any danger that the IVEA could be excluded from representation, I would willingly accept the amendment.  There is no such danger and consequently I do not see any need for the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one simple way to ensure that the IVEA will not be excluded and that is by writing them in. I would accept everything the Minister has said were it not for the fact that the IVEA are not written in and AnCO are. If neither the IVEA nor AnCO were written into the Bill and the Minister were to argue that in the exercise of his powers he would propose in the course of his nominations to nominate people from both those bodies, he would be on much stronger ground than he is at the moment.  I fail to understand why he has written in AnCO and not the IVEA. Could he explain that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Deputy said in his original statement.  If there were such a thing as a subsidiary in bodies working for the benefit of the common good, the IVEA would outrank AnCO in this field because they have been in the teaching section for so long.  I would not like any question of subsidiarity or which had the premier place to raise its ugly head in an education Bill.  One of the areas to which the Minister for Labour and I devoted considerable care and attention was this area so that there would not be an apparent clash of interest as between the IVEA and AnCO.  We have been very successful in that regard. The House can be assured that the interests of the IVEA will be looked after within the terms of the Bill as now written and published.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 4. (1) states quite clearly that a member of the governing body including the chairman shall hold office for a period not exceeding five years.  It seems to indicate that you can hold office for only five years.  I would prefer a situation where a member of the governing body would have at least the possibility of two runs on the governing body and the chairman should have a possibility of serving two terms.  The phraseology in Article 4 (1) indicates that an ordinary member or a chairman can hold office for a period not exceeding five years.  To me that is an unfortunate phrase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>We interpreted that in other Bills as indicating that a stop will be put to his gallop after five years but he can be reappointed and that that is up to the appointing and selecting body.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not think it advisable from a legal point of <Col N="321" /> view to have some phrase such as &ldquo;and shall be eligible for reappointment for a maximum of five years&rdquo; rather than have it open to misinterpretation or interpretation in a court of law which might not be the same as our interpretation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no amendment to that effect and I do not think that there is any need for it.  It is quite clear that he must put himself up for office again after five years.  He cannot continue longer than five years.  That is all that Article 4.(1) says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The opposite side of that coin is that he can be reappointed <i>ad nauseam</i> which also is not desirable.  The person should have the possibility of serving two terms but perhaps no more, unless there was a break after the second term.  The phraseology used in Article 4 provides for neither case.  In other words, you can have an appointment <i>ad nauseam</i> which is undesirable and there is no specific limit on a period which a person can serve, which also is undesirable.</P>

      <P>I accept that on occasion people holding office can go stale and a change is desirable but there is power to remove at the end of five years and there is an upper age limit as stated in Article 2.(4).

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already discussed under the NIHE Bill the question of a person being nominated to the Upper House or elected to this House or appointed to the Parliament of the European Communities.  I think the Minister agrees but he does not seem willing to do anything about it.  What should be there is that a person who is a Member of this House, of Seanad Éireann or of the Parliament <Col N="322" /> of the European Communities should be ineligible.  However, I hold clearly and definitely that a person who is merely nominated to contest an election should not be debarred from holding a position as a member of the governing body.  It would be extremely unfair to many individuals.</P>
      <P>We should be encouraging individuals who hold such positions as membership of the governing body to stand for Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann.  Here we are penalising them by ensuring that they can no longer, even if merely nominated for election, be members of the governing body.  Surely that is undemocratic.  It was not the design of anybody that a person nominated to stand for election in this country would suffer loss of office simply by virtue of being nominated.  It is a different situation if one is elected, and if he is a Member of one of the Houses he should not be a member of the governing body.  I will just about go along with that, although I do not see any merit in debarring people from continuing to be members of governing bodies of our academic institutions and colleges.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows in his heart and soul that there is a good case for changing the attitude in relation to the holding of positions on governing bodies.  This position is antediluvian in concept and the Minister knows that very well.  In relation to this Bill I ask him &mdash; if he agrees with the change in relation to the NIHE Bill or the NCEA Bill &mdash; to change his mind and let us go forward even from now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>We had this discussion thoroughly on the other Bills.  First of all, with regard to Article 6 (a) (i) there is a distinction there.  A nomination to Seanad Éireann can come from the Taoiseach and the first part of Article 6 (a) (i) deals with the nomination by the Taoiseach, which means Members of the Seanad.  I have to confess that when I was on the Deputy's side of the House I expressed sentiments much the same as he was expressing with regard to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  At that time the direct elections to the European Parliament had not taken place.  I have been, only just, convinced that Article 6 of the <Col N="323" /> First Schedule is necessary and in the terms as expressed here the wisdom has more in it than I was prepared to admit when I was on the Deputy's side of the House.  Therefore I propose to retain the wording of Article 6.</P>

      <P>Reference is made in Article 14 (b) to admissions and exclusions of students.  Can I take it that the governing body have absolute power in relation to the exclusion of students or can they only act on the advice of the academic council?  If the academic council advise that a person should be excluded can they do that with the word &ldquo;generally&rdquo; added?  Can they on the other hand only make general provisions with the governing body making specific exclusions, or can the governing body act on their own?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 14 (3) of the 1959 Act, under which the institute was established, provides that the institute may sell or lease any land, offices or premises no longer required for the performance of its function.  However, section 9 of the Johnstown Castle Agricultural College (Amendment) Act, 1959, provides that the above powers shall not apply to the estate.  Hence this section is necessary to permit the institute to dispose of those portions of the estate which are either indicated on the deposited map or are to be leased to the State at some time in the future, and which are marked on the map.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> This means that section 2 applies section 14 (3) of the Agricultural Act, 1958, to the estate, thereby allowing An Foras Talúntais to sell the properties mentioned, but it does not impose any obligation on An Foras Talúntais to sell the houses to anybody, never mind the tenants.  Deputy D'Arcy's difficulty concerns the gate lodge and the 13 houses which he thinks should be offered for sale to the occupying tenants.  Am I right in thinking that there is nothing in the Bill to oblige An Foras Talúntais or anybody else to sell the houses to the tenants in occupation?</P>

May we take it that this Bill will prohibit any other sale or change in respect of this estate other than that marked in colour on the map?  Is this the total that is to be disposed of?  We have not seen the map before now but it is very relevant to the entire Bill.  Those parts marked in orange on the map are the ones required by the county council while there is provision for access by the county council for possible further disposal. That is a very small portion at Churchtown and Redmondstown.  We should have been in possession of this map for some time whereas we were unaware of it up to now.</P>

      <P>We do not mind which section it is discussed with, but I am objecting to the position we are being put in by reason of the map being presented to us only now.  The map is a very important document in terms of the Bill.  I understood we were being presented with a broad blanket Bill whereby the Agricultural Institute would have the power to dispose of land as they saw fit.  It seems now that each area is very neatly marked out and specified so that we cannot be sure of what is the position.  It is not our intention to make matters awkward for the Minister but the map changes the whole situation.</P>

      <P>&mdash; 4.75 acres to the Meteorological Office;</P>
      <P>&mdash; 8 acres to Saint Martin's Hurling Club and</P>
      <P>&mdash; 11.5 acres for possible future disposal; these being mainly cottages and gardens on the estate, which tenants may wish to buy, and some small sites which will be cut off from the estate by the new roadway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I said that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this Bill is a simple one: it is to permit An Foras Talúntais to sell or lease certain portions of the Johnstown Castle Estate in Wexford and generally to lease to the State part <Col N="331" /> of the estate from time to time if required.  This is not possible at present because of the existing legal position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to gather from this that these are the first proposals for the disposal of certain lands and who is to decide whether other parts of Johnstown Castle will not be disposed of?  Or does the Bill include only what is marked here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, after the disposal of the lands specified there will not be disposal of any other land on the estate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>If there should be disposal at a later stage of further land, who would be responsible for that decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Such a step would require further legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>Wexford County Council have spent as long as six or seven years endeavouring to have this Bill brought before the House.  Though the Minister has read the sections of his speech that are relevant to our argument.  I am not satisfied that the position is clarified and that the provision is only for specific areas of land to be disposed of.  Surely it would have been possible to include in the Bill the authority for those who are operating the farm to dispose of land as they see fit. In the circumstances of what has now come to light we shall be seeking to amend the Bill.  After all our work over a number of years in having the Bill brought before the House we find that it is specific and very restricted and that, if at any time in the future either the Department or the Agricultural Institute wish to dispose of certain areas of this land, they may not do so unless further legislation is passed here.  I am very unhappy about the whole situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should repeat one of the concluding paragraphs of the speech.  It was as follows:</P>
      <P>By way of explanation, the inclusion in section 2 of the general power in future to make leases to the State &mdash; for example in the case of a request for a site like that from the Meteorological Office referred to earlier &mdash; is to avoid the need for similar legislation at a later date.  At the same time, the power is sufficiently narrow to ensure that there is no danger of the wholesale erosion of the estate as a single entity.  Such a development would, of course, be at variance with the spirit of the donation and acceptance of the lands as a free gift to the nation.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I find this very interesting both from a drafting and a procedural point of view.  I gather that Johnstown Castle and the property which it includes was conveyed or left or transferred to the State under certain trusts, one of which prohibits the sale of the property or any part of it and that now the State wishes to take on to itself the right to sell some of the property.  Is that the position?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> What I find extraordinary is the procedure which the Minister and the parliamentary draftsman have adopted to give effect to the wishes of the State in this matter.  I am not trying to be smart or to trip up the Minister of State.  This is a highly technical matter which would be above the heads of most people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section I defines the deposited map as a map that has been lodged in the Ordnance Survey Office and marked in a certain way, while section 2 relieves from the conditions prohibiting sale, certain <Col N="333" /> properties marked green on the map.  It is stated in section 3 that the map will be deposited in the High Court and Wexford Circuit Court as soon as may be after the Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>It was only by accident that this map, which goes to the very kernel of our discussion and without which it would be utterly impossible to have any sort of intelligent discussion on the Bill, came to light.  A copy of the map should have been circulated either with an explanatory memorandum or with the Bill itself. It would be impossible to know the land being released from the trust conditions without having the map on the table or reading the map in conjunction with the Bill.  The whole thing looked farcical until I went back to the definition section and saw that the map has been marked in a certain way and identified by seals and signatures.  The Committee Stage of this Bill should be adjourned to give the Deputies who are interested in ascertaining the property being made available for sale and property not being made available for sale and of expressing their views on it.  That is the only rational way to deal with the matter.  The Minister should withdraw the Committee Stage now.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Beef Intervention System: Motion (Resumed)</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Bruton on 11 November 1980:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann regrets the Government's decision to withdraw intervention for heifers, requests its reintroduction and affirms the importance of avoiding any weakening of the solid foundation provided for Irish agriculture by the intervention system.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1.</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitue the following:&mdash;&ldquo;welcomes the changes in the intervention arrangements for beef, which were announced by the Minister for Agriculture on 5 October and 3 November 1980 and affirms the importance of intervention to the price support system for beef under the Common Agricultural Policy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Agriculture.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are to make full use of the common agricultural policy we must make a united effort to maintain that policy.  The policy of intervention was introduced to protect the cattle trade, which we do not want to decline. It is through intervention that we can make a positive impact on market prices. We must not forget that on many occasions people in meat factories and elsewhere have not abided by the intervention prices fixed by the Community. Measures must be taken to ensure that this does not continue.  On many occasions when there has been a recession in <Col N="338" /> the trade it has come to the notice of people in the cattle trade that there have been abuses of the system by those who did not maintain the proper price level.</P>
      <P>The importance of the cattle trade must be recognised.  We must hold on to the advantages that we have.  In recent years there have been efforts by the Commission and others to create a very uncertain market.  Recently the French refused to support some of our demands in order that they would get a better price for their veal.  This is an abuse of membership. This kind of selfish action that has been practised by some countries must end. Approximately 6.9 million tonnes are in intervention in the EEC, but our contribution is only 8 per cent of the total.  We export 85 per cent of our total production. This motion will assist the Minister to make a stronger case for the restoration of intervention for heifer buying.  We know it is vital that we maintain intervention buying for next year because, while the trade will not collapse, prices will be much lower if we do not take some action.</P>
      <P>In my county we have 64,000 dairy cows, 32,000 beef cows and more than 7,000 heifers.  It is obvious that the contribution of my county to the trade is very significant.  In fact, we contribute practically 5 per cent of the total cattle population, and this is in an area where the land is not as fertile as that of the midlands. People in my county who sell heifers in the marts suffer a loss because they are not admitted to intervention.  We are getting only 63 per cent of the guide price set by the Community while other states are getting 80 per cent.  This is a rather unusual situation when one considers that Britain, Luxembourg, Denmark and other countries have the advantage of intervention for their markets.  It is clear we must strengthen the Minister's hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IFA have repeatedly asked the Minister to re-introduce intervention; in fact the previous Minister promised he would do so when the market warranted it.  Since May 1978 we have claimed on many occasions that such a re-introduction has been warranted.  Both the IFA and the ICMSA have also made representations regarding the matter.  In <Col N="339" /> March 1979 they asked that it be restored in the off-breeding season.  The Minister may claim that by preventing heifers going into intervention in certain periods he was helping to increase the cow herd, but I would point out that we have always requested that intervention purchasing should take place in the off-breeding season.</P>
    <P>In January the Minister met the IFA and I think he had a rather positive approach.  He also met Mr. Gundelach, but he was not successful in his discussions with him.  I accept he made a serious effort to have heifers included when the increase in the quota was adjusted.  We can determine our own course to some extent.  I should like to get a definite commitment from the Minister with regard to the marketing of heifers next year.  It is vital that there be an increase. Last year there was only a 4 per cent increase in farm commodity prices and this was totally inadequate.</P>
    <P>Economists have told us that since 1978 farmers' costs have gone up by 50 per cent.  There cannot be an indefinite continuation of production if there is an irregular, erratic and unstable market.  It is important that the Government should consider making arrangements with the ACC and the banks to subsidise loans in some way.  Can we afford to have the farmers in the position where they must off-load on the market cows which would be productive of milk next year?  This is what they must do at present in order to meet their commitments.  I hope the Minister and his Department will play a more active role in bringing about a definite price improvement and the re-introduction of intervention for heifers in 1981.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words in support of the Minister's amendment in regard to intervention arrangements for beef.  From the comments of the proposers of the original motion it is quite clear that there is a large measure of agreement on both sides of the House on the many aspects of the system as it operates at present.  We are all concerned that the cattle industry should be protected and that our producers <Col N="340" /> should get the best possible price for their cattle.  We are also concerned that employment in the meat trade should be maintained.  There are many ways in which this could be done.  We have one of the finest countries in the world for the production of beef and all of us involved in the business who have the best interests of the industry at heart have an obligation to make this fact known to the world.</P>
      <P>Recently I had the pleasure of heading a promotional group organised by the Irish Agricultural Export Co-ordinating Committee for the purpose of selling Irish beef to the Germans and I was amazed at the interest they expressed in Irish meat.  There is great potential for the expansion of sales of vacuum-packed meats.  Top quality products are, of course, demanded and there must also be efficient delivery.  I know that our factories are capable and there is absolutely no reason why we should not be able to meet in full the demand which exists.  In the interest of job creation and so on, that is the best way to get rid of our beef mountain.  Convenience food is the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing in Germany and we should exploit the market in full.  In the first half of 1980 the German market increased its purchases from us by over 26 per cent compared with the corresponding period in 1979.  I have no doubt that if we can establish a firm market there the contacts we have already made will be maintained, provided we deliver good quality produce on time.  The Germans are noted for their efficiency in this area and there is no reason why our factories should not be able to meet the demand.  The Germans have a very favourable picture of our country as being the place where we have lush fields producing top quality cattle and I am happy to say that this assumption is not too far from reality. We should exploit such markets to the best advantage of the industry and the country in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred to the intervention system as providing a solid foundation for Irish agriculture, and so it does.  He is anxious that nothing should be done to erode the value of the system and we share that anxiety to the full.  He <Col N="341" /> referred to serious problems in Brussels during the coming months and suggested that the intervention system must be defended.  Let me assure him and the House that we will do that in the same way that we tackled speedily and decisively problems which emerged from the Commission's recent alterations to the support system.  The Minister has already mentioned that earlier this year he stood alone in the Council of Ministers in resisting measures which would have seriously eroded the value of the system.  We will, of course, continue in the difficult months ahead to be steadfast in protecting the interests of Irish producers and ensuring the maintenance of the essential aspects of the CAP.</P>
    <P>It seems that the main emphasis of the original motion was on the fact that the removal of heifers in 1978 was made voluntarily, that we were under no pressure to do it and that we find it impossible to reverse the decision.  The Minister has dealt with the first issue: it was a voluntary decision taken calculatedly after due deliberation for the sole purpose of protecting the breeding herd&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;at a time when market prices were not likely to be disrupted. So it turned out, but I would not wish Deputies to go away with the idea that the door is now closed permanently to heifers.  This is not the case.  The Commission recognise that we have a case on price grounds for the inclusion of heifers in the system.  The Minister has raised this issue with them on a number of occasions, even as late as yesterday in the Council of Ministers.  We still believe that we can make positive progress on this issue in the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the positive approach of some of the previous speakers in regard to the relatively low prices paid to beef producers in Ireland and their counterparts on the European mainland.  Of course, our prices at 63 per cent of the guide price are far too low and it is precisely for this reason that we attach so much importance to the intervention system. <Col N="342" /> However, I should not like previous speakers to think that I agree with everything they said and I will mention a few of the areas where I would take issue with them.  A number of speakers referred to excessive culling and de-stocking and suggested that in some way, which is a total mystery to me, this is due to a lack of confidence in the intervention system. This is untrue.  Certainly the 1980 cullings are rather high but this is due to considerations other than the intervention system, especially the intensification of the bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis eradication measures.</P>
    <P>We all agree on the importance of the disease eradication scheme.  Again and again on all sides of the House we have expressed the wish that in the very near future we would see our national herd clear of these twin diseases, tuberculosis and brucellosis.  But unfortunately we still have a long way to go and we are living on borrowed time as far as the eradication of these diseases is concerned. It is up to each and every one of us to encourage our farmers to tackle this problem now and so guarantee the safety of our national herd and the markets which we have established on the mainland of Europe.  It would be a very sad day for our farmers if because we failed in our duty in regard to the eradication of these diseases we lost the markets that we have established.  All of us realise that.  I would certainly encourage farmers to participate in this scheme and to make sure that disease is got rid of as fast as possible.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister had figures to show that there has been no erosion whatsoever in intervention.  The opposite has been the case.  He also outlined a range of measures taken already by the Government to help farmers.  These measures are absolutely necessary at this time when farmers are going through such a difficult period.  One Deputy asked a most interesting question.  He may have noticed at the time that I smiled when he posed it.  He wondered when we could expect a rise in cattle numbers again.  I cannot help but reflect that if the offspring of the large number of pregnant <Col N="343" /> cows slaughtered in 1974 and 1975 were on Irish farms today the question would hardly arise.  But I would not wish to dwell on those dark days in our agricultural history.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Another issue also confused me somewhat. One Opposition Deputy referred in a critical manner to the volume of live exports of cows and lighter animals but another extolled the virtues of this trade, pointing out its value in the balance of payments situation.  This led me to wonder whether the other side of the House is for or against live cattle exports.  There is certainly no ambivalence on this side of the House on this matter.  It is our wish to see the maximum slaughtering and processing of cattle in this country but at the same time it has always been our policy to foster a healthy competition between the live and the dead meat trade <Col N="345" /> and we want no monopolies on either side.  Indeed, one might ask how producer prices would have gone earlier this year if there had been no outlets for live cattle.  Fortunately there were such outlets but at the same time the meat factories had been slaughtering very high numbers and indeed are well above last year's level.  It is clear that both trades can flourish simultaneously.  So it can be seen from the few remarks that I have made in answer to some of the criticisms offered by the Fine Gael speakers last night and again tonight that the Government are fully conscious of the problems facing our cattle and meat trade.  The House can rest assured that every step will be taken in these difficult times to ensure that protection is given to our producers and to our meat trade.  It is a very important industry for our country; it is one of the most important and it is up to all of us to ensure that it is given full support.  The measures taken by the Government in recent times will help in providing the type of support that is so necessary at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my voice to the speakers on this side of the House in support of the restoration of intervention for heifers.  History is now on our side in this.  What the Minister allegedly set out to do has not been done.  Deputy Bruton has already pointed out to the House that cattle numbers have come down drastically. The point cannot be made often enough that it was a voluntary decision. The EEC had absolutely nothing to do with it.  I see no reason why if we withdrew from intervention we cannot undo that without reference to anybody; the coefficient is a managerial problem that can surely be sorted out and should be sorted out.</P>
      <P>I am amused at the Minister talking about the dark days.  They are black now. It is night in farming, and a bleak, grim night.  In our own area at the moment we have healthy cows being slaughtered to pay the bank manager.  That is the position in one of the better parts of the country.  Confidence has gone out of farming, and for good reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The beef trade and cattle trade generally <Col N="346" /> would benefit considerably by having this intervention safety valve applied to heifers.  This whole business of intervention was a feature of the common agricultural policy and there is a lot of logic in it.  The secret of intervention is that when one has over-supply, instead of dumping one has intervention.  It is an essential safety valve in agriculture. While it might be easy to up egg numbers, pig numbers or even quantities of grain, everybody is aware that once a dairy herd on a farm is destroyed the chances of its being restored in the lifetime of that farmer are remote.  At present it is completely out of the question.  Anybody approaching a lending agency to replace stock at present is aware of the problems they face in this regard, the problem of getting the money in the first instance and, then if lucky enough to get it, the difficulty of repayment in a situation in which they are getting less for their product. As Deputy Taylor rightly pointed out, if this is what the IFA leaders and other people involved in agriculture really want, then they should get it. Surely the people on the ground are the best judges of what is good for them, not somebody in the civil service, not the Minister, but those people who deal with the cattle situation now and will in the future.</P>
    <P>Certainly what the Minister set out to do, to prevent the slaughter of heifers, has not had the desired effect.  After all, a beef heifer is a beef heifer, totally unsuited to dairying or milk production. The Minister seems to have forgotten completely that 50 per cent of animals born are heifers.  Therefore what the Minister is doing is cutting back on half a farmer's income in any particular year.  That point throws up how ridiculous is his action at a time when that farmer is finding it difficult to meet his commitments.  It should be remembered, as Deputy Bruton correctly pointed out, that that beef farmer is creating much valuable employment. In my area at present were it not for jobs created in agriculture workers would be on the streets.  These now appear to be the industries not laying people off, that are not on three-day weeks but rather those that seem to be able to pull through <Col N="347" /> in these difficult times.</P>
    <P>If this were taken a stage further one would see what this would mean to a place like Midleton where they have the Irish Meat Producers' plant.  If intervention was introduced for heifers in the morning, one can see the advantage it would prove to these producers.  Look at the advantage it would be in providing employment and to the farmer who has spent a lot of money building up an efficient beef enterprise in buildings and so on.  One must realise what a shot in the farm it would be to such a farmer to be told by the Minister tomorrow morning; &ldquo;Intervention is now back for heifers.  We tried cutting it out.  It was a voluntary decision but it did not have the desired effect.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Were we to do something like that the Government would be seen to be helping in an area in which, even at the best of times &mdash; and the Minister of State knows this as well as I do &mdash; the margins were never great.  Beef margins always are tight but now, with inflation, high interest rates and so on, they are tighter still. These are frightening prospects for farming at present.  It must be frightening also for the Minister and the Government to realise that this is an industry in very real danger because of the inability of the Government to control inflation.  French and German farmers were quite happy this year with their 5 per cent, because of course inflation is kept under control in such countries.  But where shall we end up with inflation of 20 per cent, when next year inputs will be nearly double those of last year, when the cost of seed grain, feed for cattle, fertilisers, oil, machinery and equipment will be nearly double?  How will these people survive if they are coping with prices for their produce which, at the very best, are equal to those of last year and, at worst, very much less, because that is how it is beginning to look?</P>
    <P>If the Minister is serious about his job and the people depending on him the first thing he should endeavour to do is to control inflation.  He should also point out at the Council of Ministers the problems of Irish farmers before it is too late. <Col N="348" /> He should point out that we are probably in a unique position in the EEC, that probably we are the only country in the EEC, the only farming group, who have to deal now with higher and higher input costs while accepting last year's prices for our produce.  One does not have to be a mathematician to realise that this cannot be allowed to continue.  One does not have to be very clever to realise that if one is to continue farming with present high overheads one must continue to make a profit.</P>
    <P>As I see the situation in the future in regard to crops like sugar beet, grain, even dairying, and bearing in mind the static type of price situation obtaining, with massive increases in costs, farmers cannot survive unless drastic action is taken.  That must be the first step.  Then the beef farmer will take heart and continue to expand.  It would be a large boost to the purchase of heifer calves and the tendency will be &mdash; here I go along with the Minister of State &mdash; for the Irish farmer to finish the product on his farm knowing that at the end of the day he will have this definite commitment to intervention and will not be facing a dicey up and down situation.  He will know that if the market is bad he will have intervention. That is the safeguard he must have. Particularly when one is talking about an animal costing approximately £250 or £300, one must have that safeguard.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the effect of intervention right across the board, even to the man purely in dairying, to a man who has now built up his herd.  The obvious thing for him to do would be to go into better bulls and the beef trade generally, knowing that whether it be a bull or a heifer he will be able to command a good price for that animal at birth.</P>
    <P>We, on this side of the House, want the Minister to give that industry a shot in the arm which it badly needs.  Even that fair and impartial man, Seamus Sheehy, tells us that there are grim times ahead.  Although I am not a dairy farmer, I am convinced that our only hope of survival is through the dairy industry. The dairy industry is in dire trouble because of the handling of our situation and because of the massive slaughtering <Col N="349" /> due to disease eradication.  These people are trying to pull themselves together and they will have to get all the help possible from the Government.  Money will have to be put into the dairy industry now before it is too late.  If farmers are selling herds at present because they are finding it difficult to keep going, they will have to be told that the Government will come to their rescue.  We have learned from the district planning meetings of ACOT how serious the situation is on the farm. If ACOT never accomplished anything else.  I hope that at least through their planning meetings the lesson will filter through.  I notice now that we are being curtailed in our district planning meetings and that is something we will have to take up with the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>At those meetings we were informed by farmers of the seriousness of the situation.  The problems are not insurmountable and the Opposition are offering to do something concrete about it to prove to the farming community that the Minister has had a rethink. There is nothing wrong with having a rethink, everybody makes mistakes. There would be no climb-down.  It annoys me that no Government &mdash; perhaps we were as bad ourselves &mdash; can take a solid amendment from the Opposition without twisting and turning it until it means nothing. We must get together on both sides of the House.  We must consider an all-party committee on the economy and on the agricultural industry in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a good suggestion from Fine Gael.  It would do the Minister untold good &mdash; it was his predecessor who made the decision &mdash; to say that his predecessor was wrong.  I think the Opposition are right.  It would do untold good nationally and would be very good for the industry. I do not say this for the sake of scoring political points, but for the sake of the industry.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this and forge ahead and do what we ask him to do because it is the right thing to do.  Intervention is the salvation <Col N="350" /> of the farming industry and I see intervention being taken still further to cover other areas.  The Minister of State knows about the problems of the horticultural industry which has not got the benefit of intervention.  If the housewife is to have what she requires at a fair price, at all times of the year, then intervention is a must.  If a farmer is to spend the sort of money he has to spend to be efficient then intervention is a double must, if for no other reason than to convince his lending agency that this safeguard is there if things do not go right in the market.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister and to the Minister of State, who is a practical farmer himself, to see the logic of the argument of Deputy Bruton and Deputy D'Arcy.  Far from being a climb-down, it would be hailed as a victory for the Minister if he said he was wrong.  I hope we will have action on this and that intervention for heifers will be restored.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have brought this motion before the House in order to highlight the grave situation of the beef industry. Cattle numbers have declined by 2,400 head to 240,000 head in the year ending in June 1980.  I am reliably informed that when the figures for January 1981 are published they will show that numbers are down by as much as 400,000-400,000 of a drop in one year.  If this happens, it will amount to one of the largest ever annual drops in cattle numbers on record.  In the 15 years up to the accession to Government of the present administration in June 1977, the cow herd which is a part of our total cattle herd, was increasing at an average annual rate over that 15-year period of two per cent per year.  It was increasing throughout that 15-year period.  Since the present Government came into office, the cow herd has been static.  In 1980 we have seen large scale slaughtering of cows by farmers who have to slaughter these animals in order to obtain an income to pay their bills and to pay for the upkeep of their families.  I fear that we are seeing the start of an actual decline in the cow herd and, for a country so dependent on agriculture and on livestock this is an event of unprecedented seriousness for the economy.  It will immediately translate <Col N="351" /> itself into lost jobs, for instance, in the meat factories.  As a result of the decline in cattle numbers, it is estimated that the number of cattle being supplied to Irish meat factories in 1981 will be down by approximately 300,000 head on the amounts supplied to meat factories this year.</P>
      <P>It is further estimated that every 250 head of cattle provided to a factory provides one job in that factory.  Therefore, it is obvious that if there is a decline of 300,000 in the number of cattle supplied to factories next year, as I think all the trends indicate will be the case, it will immediately jeopardise 1,200 jobs in Irish meat factories.  It reaches into the heart of our cities; it is something which affects everyone, not just the farmers. There is no greater evidence of the interdependence between town and country, of the need for people in all parts of the country to realise the importance of agriculture, than the consequences which will flow from this decline in our cattle herd which is already taking place.  This drop in supply will also have a serious adverse effect on our balance of payments. Obviously it will result in reduced exports of beef and will gravely worsen our balance of trade, create problems for our currency and for our ability as an economy to import goods, whether consumer or investment goods for further production. Our ability to purchase abroad, over the entire economy, will be damaged if there is, as I believe is inevitable, a decline in beef exports in 1981.  There is evidence in the form of reduced cattle numbers before our very eyes in the fields of this country at this very moment.  It is for this reason &mdash; and admittedly the action we are proposing is belated &mdash; that we are seeking the restoration of intervention for heifers.  It is only one of a series of measures which are necessary to combat this extremely serious situation. I shall be adverting to others in the course of my contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth recollecting, as Deputies on this side of the House have done &mdash; and, indeed, as the Minister has admitted &mdash; that the withdrawal of intervention for heifers was a voluntary act on the part of <Col N="352" /> the present Government in 1978.  Now, having voluntarily withdrawn this, the Government are finding themselves unable to reverse the position and restore intervention.  Despite the fact that Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark and the United Kingdom provide the protection of heifer intervention for their beef producers at this very moment and in full compliance with EEC rules, we are not able to do what they are now doing.  Yet we are supposed to be in a common market with Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark and the United Kingdom who are supplying the support to their farmers which we are not supplying to ours.  Indeed, it is no coincidence that in all of these countries the price obtained by farmers for beef is much higher than it is here.  The foolishness of the withdrawal of intervention for heifers here in 1978 is self-evident.</P>
    <P>Our motion also seeks to underline the importance of intervention in general. Ireland's position in support of the principle of intervention as part of the common agricultural policy was gravely weakened by the Government's voluntary decision in 1978 to withdraw an entire category of intervention, namely intervention for heifers, in this country. This Fine Gael motion now seeks to undo the damage which that measure did, by providing an opportunity for the Dáil to reaffirm its conviction that intervention is essential for the operation of the common agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>I shall deal now with some of the points made by the Minister here yesterday evening. He said that we could not now reintroduce intervention for heifers without EEC consent because the Commission of the Community would have to set a coefficient for the buying-in price.  Why can the Minister not go ahead and use the equivalent coefficient already in use in this island &mdash; in Northern Ireland, which is operating as part of the United Kingdom?</P>
    <P>Why can he not use the coefficients being used in the five other countries which have intervention for heifers at this very moment?  Why is it necessary to obtain the consent of the European Community for this?  Is it not possible for him to <Col N="353" /> operate this matter himself?  He will claim, of course, that the objection is being made by the Community that it could not find the money.  The amount of money involved on providing intervention for heifers would be a negligible amount and would pale into insignificance in comparison with the benefits conferred by having the safeguard of intervention available to our farmers for what is, as Deputy Hegarty pointed out, 50 per cent of our cattle trade, because 50 per cent of all cattle born in this country are heifers.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the EEC decision to disqualify forequarter beef from intervention, a decision announced very recently.  This is a very serious matter not only in itself but in the precedent it establishes that the European Commission can unilaterally reduce support for agricultural prices, without consulting the Council of Ministers and outside the annual price fixing negotiations.  This is a highly dangerous precedent for Ireland. Deputy Clinton, when Minister for Agriculture, resisted a similar effort by the then Commissioner Lardinois to such an extent that he obtained from the Commissioner a specific and formal assurance that such an effort would not be attempted again.  This is in relation to an attempt by Commissioner Lardinois to change the coefficients for beef in such a way that, without reference to the Council of Ministers and outside the price fixing negotiations, simply by changing the coefficients he reduced the price being paid to farmers.  A similar attempt is now being made again and there is no sign of a similar determination or a similar resistance being shown by the present Minister to this unprecedented and dangerous measure to that shown by Deputy Clinton in a similar situation in times of much less seriousness than we now face.</P>
    <P>I have, so far in my contribution, criticised the failures of this Government in regard to the beef industry.  I outline now the approach which Fine Gael in Government would adopt to this important industry.  The lifestock sector, beef and milk, represents such a large proportion of Irish farm output that special measures <Col N="354" /> to promote it are necessary.  Much of our tillage sector, indeed, is producing feed for livestock and it will prosper if livestock prospers.  In beef, in particular, we are producing less than our potential; we are producing the wrong type of beef and marketing it badly.  Messrs. Lea and Diamond in a study done for the Agricultural Institute show that our land could carry 70 per cent more cattle than it did in 1973, which was the highest level ever reached in the history of this State.  We are now carrying far less on our land than we did in 1973.</P>
    <P>We are also achieving a very low level of output of beef for the number of cattle actually on our land.  We produce 55 tonnes of beef per year for every 1,000 head of cattle on our land.  This is the lowest production of actual beef per 1,000 head of cattle on the land of any EEC country.  This is happening because three-quarters of Irish cattle require a third winter before they reach fat stage, whereas less than one-third of cattle require a third winter before they reach that stage, reaching fat stage after merely a second winter.  They are, therefore, able to turn over more cattle, producing more beef per year for a given number of cattle on their land.  Indeed, it has been estimated that we could increase our beef output here by up to 40 per cent without any increase in cattle numbers if we could just eliminate that third winter necessary for three-quarters of our cattle as against nearly one quarter in the UK, which is a country with comparable climatic conditions.</P>
    <P>That third winter could be eliminated primarily by making more and better silage in place of the hay on which we are now relying as fodder for our third winter. Our beef is not bred for consumer trade and is often wastefully over fat when sold. It is because of that that we lose out on grading with the result that our cattle are sold at a lower price than we could otherwise obtain.  That is an irony because it requires more feed to put fat on an animal's back than it does to put flesh on and yet we are producing too much fat at greater proportionate expense than we would if we were producing flesh on those <Col N="355" /> animals.  That arises because we are keeping our animals beyond the stage that we should.</P>
    <P>The marketing of our beef leaves much to be desired.  It has been estimated that there is a 2p per lb. discount on Irish beef on the United Kingdom market because Irish beef has a bad reputation.  That clearly indicates the failing in our marketing efforts by comparison with other countries.  If we could establish a good reputation and still produce the same product we could get 2p per lb. extra. There are many instances of people buying Irish beef and putting a label on it marked &ldquo;Scotch beef&rdquo; before selling it on the UK market.  Those people get 2p per lb. more because it is accepted as Scotch beef and people have confidence in Scotch beef.  That situation is unwarranted by the facts and can be overcome if we put more effort into marketing.  The key to growth of production in the beef industry is the elimination of the third winter by the provision of enough good quality fodder in the first two winters so that the animals do not lose condition during those first two winters thereby being able to reach the fat stage in the third rather than the fourth summer.</P>
    <P>A joint submission to the Minister by the Killeshandra Co-op, the IFA and the ICMSA pointed out that most of the crises which have occurred in the cattle industry here could more appropriately be described as fodder rather than cattle crises because they always arose as a result of farmers being forced to sell animals due to the lack of fodder to feed them over the winter.  That led to a collapse in prices and disaster for the farming community.  If we could solve that problem of providing adequate fodder in the form of silage we are well on the way to establishing our beef industry on a new solid foundation.  It is ironic that the reliance on hay is highest in the areas where it is hardest to make hay, namely in the west and north west.  In March last I suggested that a special grant scheme be introduced for a two-year period for farmers to transfer from hay to silage.  I suggested that it could be based on a custom-built low cost silage system suitable <Col N="356" /> to small farmers.  Too much of the research that has been done in this field is not directly applicable to the small farm situation in the west.  Such a system, promoted as the IDA promote advance factories, could mean more silage produced.</P>
    <P>The Killeshandra Co-op have also suggested that a payment be made on the volume of silage made by farmers for an initial period of two or three years.  The Minister, when he introduced a small scheme on a temporary basis for late season silage as a response to the recent fodder crisis, introduced something which should be the basis for a permanent scheme for the next two or three years to encourage the transfer from hay to silage. If that transfer takes place we will be able to produce the beef we need to obtain the prices and output we should be getting.</P>
    <P>However, even if we improve in the manner I have suggested we must face a further problem.  Beef prices in spring are often not sufficiently high to compensate farmers for the extra cost which will inevitably be involved in carrying cattle over the winter.  No matter how well organised a farmer is it still costs more to carry cattle over the winter than over the summer and no degree of efficiency in silage making will get over that financial reality. As a means to counteract that situation I suggest that the Minister seek an alteration in the EEC intervention system for beef to provide a higher guaranteed price for cattle in spring.  In that way farmers will be aware that they will get a higher price in spring to compensate for the higher cost to produce animals for sale in spring.</P>
    <P>The proposal I have outlined has been resisted by the EEC because of the cost that may be involved in it but there is evidence of long-term demand for beef and an inability by many countries to produce it.  The measure I have suggested would serve a useful purpose and be accepted by the EEC in the light of long-term trends in the beef industry.  There is a continuing demand for animal protein in the world and beef is one way that can be provided.  We will see an increase in demand for beef and if the Community is not to have a situation where beef <Col N="357" /> prices go shooting through the roof because of an insufficiency of supply it will have to take measures to encourage more winter beef production.  The Community will have to increase the level of output in Ireland and other member states.  Therefore, it makes sense from an Irish and Community point of view to have such a differentiation in the pricing system so as to provide a higher price in the spring which would be an incentive to winter beef production.</P>
    <P>We must start by getting more cattle. That demands immediate action.  I do not believe the action taken by the Government in providing a miserly £13 under the suckler grant scheme is sufficient for most farmers.  The way the Department propose to give the additional £13 is such that it will encourage bad rather than good quality animals.  It will prove an added benefit to the fly-by-night operators who will go into suckling this year because of the grant but leave it next year.  They will get the full grant while the person who has been in the business all along will receive it on his additional animals only and not on the entire herd. Such a person wil be penalised relative to the other operators.  We must have a suckler grant of at least £80 if farmers are to get involved in the suckler business. As Deputy D'Arcy pointed out, this is an expensive operation which is full of heartbreak and pitfalls.  It will be very difficult to get farmers involved in it on a professional basis without an adequate financial incentive which must take the form of a grant of that magnitude.</P>
    <P>I am sure the case will be made by some people: why should farmers be given grants to do something that should make sense anyway?  It can be argued that it would make sense to produce calves for the beef herd if there is to be, as I have said, a market for beef in the long term.  Unfortunately for the individual producer making the decision, in the short term it may not make sense and, in the long run it may not even be he who will suffer if he does not make the decision, but the entire country.  It will be people in meat factories, people who are relying on supplies of store cattle to fatten, who will suffer if the farmer does not <Col N="358" /> make the decision to expand the suckling herd.</P>
    <P>The Government are justified in intervening because they are providing an incentive, a grant, to one person to do something which will benefit not only himself but other people as well.  It is a classic case in justification of Government interference in the form of a grant. The Government do not give grants to people to do things which will benefit themselves only.  People will or should do those things anyway, if they have sense. The Government give grants to people to do things which, while they may be of benefit to the people receiving the grants, will also be of benefit to other people to a far greater extent.  That is the justification for grants.  There is a classic case for a grant of approximately £80 in the national interest to get the suckler business off the ground and to reverse the disastrous decline in our cattle herd to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>Assurance must be provided against a decline in cattle prices in the years ahead. One of the reasons why our farmers have not been achieving their potential level of output &mdash; and I have already indicated that even in 1973 at our highest level of production we could have carried 70 per cent more cattle than we did &mdash; is that farmers have not got confidence that prices will be maintained at a steady level in the years ahead.  One way in which we could provide such an assurance would be to say that the headage payment scheme will be varied in years in which prices fall, to say that if prices fall the headage payment will be increased and if prices rise the headage payment will not be increased.  We should vary the headage payment in such a way that, by its variation, it will provide a floor under the beef market.  I have advocated this in the past.  It is a sensible and intelligent way of using the headage payment scheme to do what the community want to do, namely, to provide a floor under the cattle business, and to encourage farmers to produce animals.</P>
    <P>Another way of ensuring that slumps do not occur in the market would be to set up a market monitoring unit to foresee supply and demand problems in the <Col N="359" /> beef industry and recommend evasive action in time.  Such a market monitoring unit should be managed not just by the Government but by the Government in conjunction with the producers and processors of beef.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated that existing trends show that there will be a decline of 300,000 in the number of cattle supplied to our factories next year.  That prediction is based on information which is available to us, but very few people are reflecting on that information.  Very few people have that information which is important to farmers making business decisions.</P>

This idea is not original. It was put forward in the McKinsey Report on beef marketing and dairy marketing and it should be acted upon.</P>
      <P>I did not get a chance to finish what I wanted to say.  These are some of the proposals which should be adopted to improve the beef herd.  I hope I will be seen in this contribution not merely as condemning the Government's decision to do away with beef intervention for heifers but also as making positive alternative proposals to provide a better future for our beef farmers than they can be assured of under this Government.</P>

        <Col N="254" /> Under the export sales relief provisions companies which export goods manufactured by them within the State are entitled to relief from corporation tax on their income from such exports.  Profits arising from certain trading operations carried on wholly or partly within Shannon Airport are also relieved from corporation tax.</P>
      <P>Both of these reliefs will be superseded as and from 1 January 1981 by a new incentive scheme which will apply to manufacturing industry and will provide for an effective low rate of corporation tax.  This scheme will apply to income derived by companies from the manufacture by them of goods in the State whether that income arises from domestic or export sales.</P>
      <P>Export sales relief did not apply to the services sector generally and it is not considered that it would be appropriate, or acceptable in terms of revenue foregone, to bring that sector within the scope of the replacement scheme.  However, as already announced, it is intended, subject to the approval of the EEC Commission, to extend the new scheme by way of an appropriate provision in next year's Finance Bill to certain non-manufacturing services based at Shannon Airport which are covered by the existing Shannon tax relief.</P>

      <P>No action has been taken by my Department as a direct result of the recent media reports on psychiatric hospitals to which the Deputy's question refers.  My Department in conjunction with the health boards have an on-going programme of up-grading accommodation in the mental hospitals &mdash; £11 million of capital resources has been expended on these hospitals in the ten year period ended on 31 December 1979.  In addition, health boards provide for the maintenance and renovation of existing buildings in their revenue budgets.  The majority of our mental hospitals were built in the 19th century and consequently are difficult and expensive to maintain.  A number of health boards have succeeded in adapting and renovating accommodation with a high degree of skill and dedication and therefore the services provided in these hospitals are of the highest quality.  Significantly, perhaps, none of these hospitals featured in the media reports referred to by the Deputy.  Nor indeed did any of the better units in the hospitals visited feature in these reports.  Much remains to be done in some hospitals and I intend to pursue vigorously with the health boards concerned the problems associated with improving these units.</P>

      <P>The person concerned reapplied for unemployment assistance on 4 July 1980 and requested that his means be assessed on a factual basis.  Following the necessary investigations his means <Col N="260" /> were assessed at £28.85 per week.  This entitled him to unemployment assistance at the rate of £4.85 per week and arrears were issued to him on 17 September 1980.</P>
      <P>The delay is attributable to the very large numbers of smallholders in the area who opted to have their means assessed on a factual basis which thereby increased considerably the existing workload of the social welfare officers in the area.</P>

      <P>A non-contributory old age pension at the maximum rate was awarded to the person concerned by the local pension committee on 24 May 1980.  However, the social welfare officer appealed against this decision as the deed of transfer of her holding had not been stamped. Following new arrangements which I <Col N="263" /> introduced in June 1980 for dealing with pension claims involving deeds of transfer, the file was referred back to the social welfare officer for a final report as the extent of the land transfer needed further clarification.  These inquiries could not be finalised until the end of August.  The claim was subsequently referred to an appeals officer who has awarded pension at the maximum rate from 15 October 1979.</P>

      <P>He appealed against this decision and the appeals officer reduced the assessment to £6 per week.  He is, therefore, entitled to unemployment assistance at the rate of £58.45 a week.

      <P>The person concerned was paid disability benefit by my Department to 10 February 1979.  Payment was disallowed after that date following examination by a medical referee of my Department who expressed the opinion that he <Col N="266" /> was capable of work.  He appealed against the decision disallowing his claim for disability benefit and, in connection with his appeal, he was examined by a different medical referee who also considered him to be capable of work.  This view was upheld by an appeals officer.</P>
      <P>As the claimant continued to submit medical evidence and appealed against the continued disallowance of benefit he was examined again by a third medical referee.  This referee also expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  This view also was upheld by an appeals officer.</P>
      <P>Following a further appeal by the claimant he was referred for examination by a specialist on the 21 October 1980. The specialist's report was subsequently considered by the appeals officer who decided that the report confirmed the medical referees' findings; consequently there were no grounds to warrant a revision of his previous decision in the case.</P>

      <P>I understand that at 7 November Kerry County Council had on hands 101 loan applications valued at £455,000 which were awaiting payment.</P>
      <P>An initial capital allocation of £900,000 was made to Kerry County Council in respect of the payment of local authority housing loans and grants in the six-month period ended on 30 June 1980.  Because of the greatly increased demand for loan payments which followed on the increase in the loan and income limits last January, the needs of each authority operating the schemes have, since the end of June, been assessed monthly.  On that basis a total of £427,000 issued from the local loans fund to Kerry County Council between 1 July and the end of October. An additional £93,000 issued on 7 November and it is proposed to release a further instalment of £100,000 on 21 November.  These issues, together with those available to the council from internal capital receipts, should enable the council to deal with all urgent cases.</P>
