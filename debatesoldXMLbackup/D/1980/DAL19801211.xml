      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann notes the terms of the joint communiqué issued after the meeting on the 8th December 1980. between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister.</P>
      <P>We have offered this debate to Opposition parties in order that the Dáil may fully consider the outcome of the meeting held last Monday in Dublin Castle between the Irish and British Governments and because I believe it is appropriate that the Dáil should have an opportunity to consider the results of that meeting and assess its importance on the basis of what actually took place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British delegation was, in terms of its composition, the most important to visit this country since the foundation of this State, or indeed for a long time <Col N="969" /> before then.  It was led by the Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, and she was accompanied by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, Lord Carrington, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Geoffrey Howe and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Atkins. Deputies will be aware that I was accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy.</P>
    <P>The talks were extremely valuable and were conducted throughout in the most constructive spirit.  The Prime Minister and I had a separate discussion lasting an hour and 20 minutes.  In parallel, the other Ministers had useful discussions on aspects of the Northern Ireland situation, cross-Border economic co-operation and European Community issues, including the common agricultural policy, EMS and the development of the Community generally.</P>
    <P>We then convened in plenary session and after a working lunch and further restricted discussions we concluded the discussions at a further plenary session in the afternoon.  In all, the talks lasted for more than five hours between plenary and <i>tete-à-tete</i> sessions.</P>
    <P>When considering the outcome of the meeting.  I would invite the Dáil to look carefully at the terms of the communiqué because it summarises meticulously what was discussed; it describes specifically what emerged; it sets out clearly what was agreed among those who actually participated; and it provides the only reliable basis on which the value of the meeting can and should be assessed.  This agreed communiqué makes it abundantly clear that progress, substantial progress, was made and has been recorded.</P>
    <P>The third paragraph of the communiqué outlines the areas in which new and closer co-operation has been achieved since the meeting in London last May &mdash; energy, transport, communications, cross-Border economic development and security.  It indicates that further improvements in these and other fields will be pursued, particularly in relation to energy and cross-Border co-operation.</P>
    <P>In the discussions on these matters I <Col N="970" /> emphasised the importance attached by the Government here to follow-up action on the cross-Border studies of the Derry-Donegal and Erne catchment areas and to the implementation of the development measures to be aided from the non-quota section of the EEC Regional Fund. I was also able to indicate that following examination of the constitutional, legal and other aspects of the matter, we are now ready to bring forward proposals to effect an extensions of the franchise which would provide voting rights for British citizens resident in Ireland but that these proposals may have to be held over until the forthcoming British Nationality Bill is brought forward and the concept of &ldquo;British citizen&rdquo; defined.</P>
    <P>I would ask Deputies to study carefully the paragraphs of the communiqué which deal with the relationship between Great Britain and Ireland and the situation in Northern Ireland and to assess their impact and importance for themselves. These paragraphs look forward to better times.  Does anyone anywhere in these islands wish to fault them for that?  We state clearly in these paragraphs our desire for a situation in which the relationship between our two countries, hitherto placed under recurring strain by division and dissent in Northern Ireland, will be placed on a new and better basis.</P>
    <P>The communiqué affirms our acceptance of the need to bring forward policies and proposals to achieve this better relationship. These policies and proposals will be set in the general framework of the development of the unique relationship between the two countries.  In this context, we have commissioned joint studies to cover a wide range of matters and we have agreed to give special consideration to these matters later.</P>
    <P>I consider that the points to which I have referred represent real progress and I believe that my view is widely shared by political leaders in Northern Ireland and by people of all shades of opinion throughout these islands.  The joint studies will embrace possible new institutional structures, citizenship rights, security matters, economic co-operation and measures to encourage mutual understanding. It would be our wish and our <Col N="971" /> intention that the approach to possible new institutional structures would be open and flexible, unrestricted by prejudice, and that different concepts would be considered solely on the basis of whether or not they can contribute to political development directed toward peace and reconciliation.  The words &ldquo;totality of relationships within these islands&rdquo; in my view simply mean that the special consideration to which our next meeting will be devoted does not exclude anything that can contribute to achieve peace, reconcilation and stability and to the improvement of relations between the peoples of our two countries.  Is there any serious politician in these islands who cannot visualise some new idea or concept which would be worthy of earnest and serious consideration in this context?</P>
    <P>It is scarcely to be expected that there will be a full coincidence of ideas.  The important thing is that there is agreement to conduct joint studies in which all ways forward can be explored without any commitment on either side.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government's deep concern and anxiety about the H-Block situation figured prominently in our discussion. The British Government fully understand that concern and I believe that our meeting and the statement included in the joint communiqué about the H-Block protest can contribute to a process whereby a solution can be found.</P>
    <P>I have made it clear that we are prepared to play any further part we can in bringing forward a solution if at any time it seems that we could make a constructive contribution in this regard.  We remain convinced that it is on the basis of the humanitarian aspects, as outlined by the Northern Ireland Secretary of State in his statement of 4 December, that a solution can be found.</P>
    <P>Deputies may recall how, in the debate which commenced here on 29 May last, I indicated the potential for progress that lay in the agreements recorded in the joint communiqué of 21 May.  There was some scepticism on the benches opposite. I believe that the outturn has justified my confidence and I would hope that, in the same way, the communiqué which we are <Col N="972" /> discussing today will, in its turn, give a fresh impetus to progress towards the achievement of a new and brighter era for people who have already suffered too much.</P>
    <P>I hope what I have said here and elsewhere indicates the constructive spirit in which the Irish Government are approaching every area of the relationships which exist and which, whether we like it or not must exist between the people who inhabit these islands.  To follow that, I want to say that, in what has been agreed, there is nothing to which any Unionist need take exception.  Our objective is to advance the welfare and security of all the people of these islands, including those in both sections of the community in Northern Ireland.  I have stated before, and I gladly reiterate here, that, come what may, the safety and welfare of the community, in Northern Ireland, particularly the Unionist section of that community, would be a special personal priority for me and I would add that in any situation which might develop now or in the future that consideration would remain a priority.  Northern Ireland's political leaders clearly have a very important part to play in any solution and I would like to see careful consideration being given to arrangements for appropriate involvement of such leaders in future developments.  In particular, I would suggest that they have a particular interest in the joint studies on security matters which could well be inter-related with those on possible new institutional structures.</P>
    <P>In my statement to the House today, I have kept close to the text and conclusions of the communiqué.  I do this deliberately because the document was drawn up carefully and agreed only after the most meticulous consideration.  Its virtue is that it represents exactly what was agreed.  Commentators in different areas for their own reasons have tried to put different glosses on what was said.  They parse and analyse to find disagreement where there is none.  They read meanings into <i>obiter dicta</i>, which are not there. They conjure up confrontation and controversy where none resides.</P>
    <P>The motives of those who would decry <Col N="973" /> last Monday's meeting or who would seek to undermine it by misrepresenting or confusing its outcome are difficult to comprehend.  These are people who would normally purport to support any attempt to improve relations between Ireland and Great Britain.  That is the outlook and the policy they would profess to uphold.  On this occasion, however, they seem to be determined to attempt to devalue a meeting which, by whatever criteria can be applied, made a significant contribution to the overall objective of better relations between the two countries participating.</P>
    <P>We are not engaged here in a peripheral exercise affecting some local, political or economic issue of measurable consequence. We are dealing with a problem which has bedeviled relations between the peoples of Ireland and Britain for over a hundred years.  We are dealing with something which can raise the most bitter passions and a situation in which there is already enough misunderstanding.</P>
    <P>Let me now deal with some of the attempts to seek out apparent disagreement. The British Prime Minister for example is correct, absolutely correct, in stating that the meeting was one of the series of meetings which we had agreed to hold.  At our meeting in London in May, it was agreed that a further meeting should be held before the end of the year and the meeting in Dublin Castle on Monday followed that pattern.  Nor is there anything extraordinary in regarding the work done at one particular meeting in a series being more valuable, more constructive or more significant than another.  The European Council, for instance, meets regularly but it is undeniable that some such councils are important and significant while others, by common consent, achieve nothing.</P>
    <P>Again, it is absolutely true to say that we are exploring the possibility of seeing whether we can give some form of institutional expression to the unique relationship between our two countries so as both to achieve peace and stability and improved relations.  That is what the communiqué says: that is what we are about; <Col N="974" /> and there is no disagreement on that basic quest.</P>
    <P>Let not this House waste its time chasing after imagined discord.  Let us rather direct our minds to the worthwhile purposes to which last Monday's discussions were directed.  These were, firstly, reconciliation and a just and durable peace throughout this island; secondly, the improvement of relations between Ireland and Britain, so that now, in this world, where wars and rumours of wars are becoming ever more frequent and ominous, old differences between our two peoples &mdash; who have so much in common and whose interests are so inextricably linked &mdash; can be eliminated and forgotten.</P>
    <P>I think I am right in believing that those in this House who disagree with these objectives are few.  There may be differences about means but not about ends.</P>
    <P>For all the parties involved in this part of Ireland in Britain and in Northern Ireland, there are vast and immediate benefits in a durable and lasting solution. For us there are issues of politics and history.  There is the possibility of reconciling ancient quarrels and providing a way forward out of the divisions which have impeded us for far too long.</P>
    <P>There are economic benefits of which I would like to give one small example &mdash; from an area indeed where we are given all too little credit &mdash; security related to the troubles in Northern Ireland alone costs us, on average, three times per head more than it costs the people of the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>For Britain a solution would involve similar benefits on a different scale. Northern Ireland has changed from a position where it once contributed to imperial costs to one where it is now the most heavily subsidised region in the United Kingdom involving an Exchequer subvention of more than £1.2 billion sterling this year.</P>
    <P>To the people of Northern Ireland itself the greatest advantage of all would accrue.  They have lived with violence for a period longer than one likes to contemplate &mdash; and are a community more deeply divided than anywhere in the western world.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="975" /> Progress can never be based on stagnation of political and economic thought. There can be no advance on the basis of learning nothing and forgetting nothing.</P>
    <P>That is why I have been saying that the problem of Northern Ireland cannot be solved in the old framework, which has failed; why we must try to break out of it; why we must seek to raise the problem to a new plane, in which the old questions can be looked at afresh and new solutions tried.  That is what we are about in seeking new initiatives, new ways forward, in which all parties to the present conflict are involved and no proposal is excluded simply because it has not been tried before &mdash; or does not fit into the artificial moulds of the past or the present.</P>
    <P>The meeting in Dublin Castle last Monday was primarily concerned with the relationship between the two islands of Ireland and Great Britain.  I believe that it represented a major step forward in that long and tangled relationship.  I do not conceal my hope that through the development of that relationship a solution to the problem of Northern Ireland will eventually come about.  Is it too much to ask all those who comment and criticise from the sidelines that they would accept that these are two noble purposes which can be honestly pursued side by side with malice toward none but rather for the benefits they will bring to countless thousands of ordinary men and women.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I wish to say that I do not propose to make any reference in the course of my remarks to the H-Block issue.  This matter is one in respect of which the Taoiseach, the Leader of the Labour Party and myself have been in touch during the past week, and in relation to which the Taoiseach has kept both of us informed.  The reactions of the three of us to the initiative of John Hume are on the record, and nothing that could be said in this House at the present time on this issue could add anything useful to what we have already said although we may permit ourselves an expression of hope that this initiative will in due course prove to have been successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="976" /> In respect of the other matters discussed at this meeting of the Prime Ministers and other members of the Irish and British Governments, I have not sought, nor would I expect the Taoiseach to have made available to me, any information beyond that given to the media and public at large.  The discussions that took place were inter-governmental, and confidential &mdash; save to the extent that the two sides jointly in the communiqué, or separately in later press conferences, chose to divulge their versions of what happened.</P>
    <P>Having said that I should add that if at any time the Taoiseach wished to exchange information, that such exchange would be in the national interest, I would of course be prepared to meet him for that purpose, without prejudice to my right to express my party's opinions, and to put forward its policies in respect of a solution of the Northern Ireland problem.  I have in the past exchanged information with his predecessor on matters relating to Northern Ireland, without in any way inhibiting either his or my freedom of action in relation to policy issues.</P>
    <P>Before coming to discuss the communiqué and the press conferences I should like first of all to put forward clearly and concisely my party's views on the basic issues at stake.  We share with all other parties in this State the aspiration towards a new relationship between the two parts of this island, on a basis that would be mutually advantageous, and freely agreed.  We recognise that the basis of such an agreement does not at present exist.  For it to be brought about, much would have to happen not merely in Northern Ireland, but here and in Britain also.</P>
    <P>So far as Britain is concerned there would need to be as a minimum a reaffirmation of the British solemn declaration in the Sunningdale Communiqué that the British Government would support a wish on the part of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland to become part of a united Ireland.  We regret that, while successive Governments here have upheld the equivalent Irish solemn declaration that Irish unity <Col N="977" /> requires the consent of a majority in the North, successive British administrations have notably failed to reiterate Britain's Sunningdale declaration of support for a united Ireland achieved by agreement. They have indeed chosen rather to harden attitudes by reversing this supportive declaration &mdash; the only one ever made by Britain after 1920 &mdash; into a negative formula of a guarantee for the status quo in the absence of such consent.</P>
    <P>I would go further and say on behalf of my party that we would regard it as desirable that British political leaders, most of whom privately express their belief that the ultimate solution of the problem must take the form of a coming together of the two parts of Ireland, should state this conviction publicly, in fairness to the majority in Northern Ireland who have never been accorded their entitlement &mdash; an honest statement of the predominant British political belief on this matter.</P>
    <P>Such an honest statement would not necessarily resolve this problem speedily. Even the knowledge of where British political opinion really stands on this matter while it might come as a shock to an important segment of Northern Unionists, would not necessarily lead a sufficient proportion of those concerned to turn their gaze immediately southwards. But it could help to start &mdash; or rather, for with a small proportion of traditional Unionist opinion this process has already begun, to accelerate &mdash; a reconsideration of entrenched attitudes, which, in time, if helped by constructive initiatives on our part, could lead towards a solution.</P>
    <P>Secondly, so far as this part of the island is concerned, we in Fine Gael believe that there has been a consistent tendency to under-estimate what this State and its people could contribute to a change of attitudes in Northern Ireland. One of our great defects as a people in dealing with this matter has been our tendency to regard the Northern majority as an undifferentiated solid mass, all equally intransigent about the possibility of any changed relationship with the Republic.  This attitude within our State stems from the depressing lack of contact <Col N="978" /> of so many of our people, including in particular our politicians, with the North, and above all with Northern Unionists. It was one of the objectives of our Government to break down this ignorance, to make contact with Northerners of both sections of the community in Northern Ireland, and to invite Unionists as well as Nationalists to visit us here informally. We succeeded in this to a degree which in the nature of things has never been fully appreciated, because many of these informal contacts took place only because they were discreet and unpublicised.</P>
    <P>What became clear during those years to all who were thus brought into contact with a range of political and public opinion in the Unionist community, is that within that community, and most especially outside the ranks of the politicians &mdash; there exists a wide range of views on the desirability, and/or the probability, of an eventual coming-together of North and South.  A significant minority of informed opinion on the Unionist side is not intransigent on this issue, and some of that tradition has come during recent years to accept that a new North-South relationship is inevitable while others have come to regard it even as desirable, seeing no future in a continuation of the present tragic impasse.</P>
    <P>It should be our task, our aim, our united objective, to seek to enlarge this minority within the Unionist tradition, by removing obstacles to the growth of this opinion.  If we are serious about this matter we should be seeking to eliminate anything which enables hard-liners to inhibit this growth &mdash; any laws or practices, or actions, or words &mdash; sometimes words are spoken here that are singularly unhelpful &mdash; that give a useful handle to those who seek to oppose a coming together of the two parts of our island. Yet, again and again, suggestions for actions that might clear away obstacles to the growth of a rational appreciation of the advantages of a new North-South relationship, have been opposed here on the grounds that we would be wasting our time trying to persuade Unionist hard-liners to change their minds &mdash; when in the ultimate it is not those hard-liners <Col N="979" /> who are the problem.</P>
    <P>The problem is to create conditions here that will encourage an expansion of the minority of Unionists who see their future as lying ultimately with us, an expansion towards a figure in excess of 25-30 per cent, so that in combination with the Nationalist population a clear overall majority could emerge in the North which would favour a new North-South relationship.  A combination of ignorance of the existence of this south-ward-looking minority in the Northern Unionist community, and a deep-seated inward-looking conservative reluctance here to change our society and to make it genuinely pluralist, has hitherto frustrated progress in this direction.</P>
    <P>This debate has to take place against this triple background, first of the need for and possibility of changes, in the expression of political opinion in Britain; second of the need to move towards a more pluralist society in this State &mdash; a society that could be acceptable to reasonable Unionists in the North; and third in the North itself, of the need to create conditions that will favour an expansion of the minority view that already exists in the Unionist section of the community, favouring an opening towards the South. Let us see this debate against this background, and not talk as if it were in a vacuum.</P>
    <P>That the Anglo-Irish relationship is a crucial element in this evolving situation has been evident for some time past.  As I pointed out in speaking in Belfast almost two years ago on Fine Gael's policy for a Confederal Ireland, we have to take account of close cultural and other links between the whole island of Ireland and Britain.  One model I said to which we might look in this context &mdash; though it could clearly provide only part of the answer &mdash; is Benelux, the institution which linked Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg even before the European Community was formed, and which continues to exist today.  These states are not, of course, represented in the Community by Benelux &mdash; their interests are too divergent &mdash; but they find it useful to <Col N="980" /> give expression to their especially close relationship with each other, which is in fact less close than that which links Ireland and Britain, by retaining this institution in parallel to the Community structure. One could envisage some such arrangement between the islands of Ireland and Britain, so structured as to give expression to what we and Britain share in common, without impeding the representation of Ireland's divergent material interests not alone within the Community but <i>vis-à-vis</i> the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>I went on in that speech to raise the possibility of common citizenship, which I pointed out already exists <i>de facto</i> so far as citizens of this State in Britain are concerned, and <i>de jure</i> in the Republic so far as almost all residents of Northern Ireland are concerned, a fact which is little appreciated either North or South. Finally, in that speech I added that if these arrangements were not felt to give adequate expression to the sentiments of many Unionists towards Britain, further consideration should be given to how this could be done as between a Northern state in an Irish confederation, and the neighbouring island.</P>
    <P>Of course, I was talking then in terms of a hypothetical Irish confederation. The discussions which the Taoiseach and other Ministers had with the British Prime Minister and other British Prime Ministers had to start further back along the road &mdash; they had to start from where we are now.  The communiqué refers to the inextricable links between the &ldquo;economic, social and political interests of the peoples of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Republic&rdquo;, for these are the existing political units between which discussions have to take place.  Nonetheless, the same basic concept underlies these talks as lay behind my approach two years ago &mdash; the concept of placing the Northern Ireland issue in a new and broader context, the context of a new Anglo-Irish relationship.</P>
    <P>This matter has become somewhat confused by a combination of the vagueness of the language of the communiqué &mdash; I do not complain of this, it is inevitable at this stage &mdash; and the very different <Col N="981" /> tones of the two press conferences that followed its publication.  It was perhaps unfortunate that there had to be two separate press conferences.  Our experience in government suggested to us that there are certain dangers involved in meetings between the Irish and British Governments being followed by separate press conferences and this led to the arrangement towards the end of our period in Government which I pressed for of a joint press conference by Roy Mason and myself in Iveagh House, following a meeting there &mdash; a procedure which ensured against any confusion as to what had happened at the meeting. The decision to seek such an arrangement was based on an experience we had had previously.  I commend this practice to the Taoiseach as one worthy of consideration in the future.  I suggest to him also that in his speech today he sounded an unduly defensive note, and seemed to be tilting at windmills, with his reference to people who would normally purport to support any attempt to improve relations between Ireland and Great Britain but who on this occasion, however, seemed determined to devalue this meeting.  In the meantime, opinion here is uncertain as to the real significance of this meeting. I hope that this debate may clarify some of this uncertainty though I am sceptical that it can in the nature of things.</P>
    <P>There are several other aspects of this matter on which I should like to comment, choosing my words with some care. I note and accept what the Taoiseach said in explanation of certain specific comments by the British Prime Minister, but there are other comments by her, and yesterday by the Secretary of State, to which the Taoiseach has not referred and on which I wish to comment in this speech.</P>
    <P>First, with due respect to the British Prime Minister, I have to say that I regret that she should have posited the unique relationship between Ireland and the United Kingdom as deriving from the fact that our State is the only one with which the UK shares a land frontier.  The uniqueness of the relationship between our two countries derives from the extraordinary close economic, social and <Col N="982" /> cultural links between our two islands that are the products of our joint history. The creation of that land frontier within this island in the last half-century of an eight-century-old relationship has complicated this unique relationship but is certainly not the cause of its uniqueness, which will remain even when this land frontier has disappeared.</P>
    <P>Second, I regret that she should have felt it necessary to say that there is absolutely no possibility of a confederation flowing from the discussions at Dublin Castle.  This statement is, to say the least, difficult to reconcile with the Taoiseach's statement that the two sides had &ldquo;set no limit on what institutions might be brought forward, might be considered, might be designed, might be conceived&rdquo;. Even more disturbing is the reported statement by the Northern Ireland Secretary in the House of Commons that constitutional changes are ruled out of these discussions.</P>
    <P>On a different aspect of the problem I note that the Taoiseach told his press conference that public representatives in Northern Ireland would have a very important role to play in bringing forward a solution.  Any judgment, he added, must recognise that Northern representatives would have to be involved in finding a solution.</P>
    <P>I note also that in his speech today the Taoiseach said that Northern Ireland's politician leaders clearly have a very important part to play in any solution and he would like to see careful consideration being given to arrangements for appropriate involvement of such leaders in future developments.  He was obviously suggesting that they might have an interest in the joint study on security matters which well could be inter-related with those on possible new institutional structures. Those remarks are an important reassurance because in the past the Taoiseach has seemed a little dismissive of the role of the people of Northern Ireland and their elected representatives.  Nevertheless, as he has also accepted explicitly, like all other political leaders in this State, that any solution must be one arrived at by agreement and not by constraint, the Northern Ireland input is crucial, <Col N="983" /> although of course, as I have already suggested, Britain's influence on this Northern Ireland input can be significant.</P>
    <P>Earlier in my remarks I referred back to my own approach several years ago to the possibility of a change in the Anglo-Irish context helping towards a resolution of the Northern Ireland problem.  The terms of the communiqué leave open the interpretation, to which Mrs. Thatcher seemed to be directing her listeners at her press conference, that the proposed new institutions would be confined to reflecting the relationship between the United Kingdom as it exists at present and our State in its present form.</P>
    <P>I would welcome closer ties between our two States as they exist, because I recognise that such closer ties will provide a better context for a solution to the Northern Ireland problem.  But the ultimate significance of a new institutional relationship involving the totality of these islands would lie in the way in which such a relationship between the island of Ireland as a whole and the island of Great Britain could provide part of the reassurance needed to secure the support of a sufficiently large proportion of the Northern population for a new North-South relationship.  This should not be overlooked. A new institutional structure between our States as they now exist could be no substitute for the new relationship that we are seeking to establish between North and South, and that needs to be said, quietly, but firmly.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is scarcely necessary to add that press references, allegedly inspired by our Government sources, to limitations of sovereignty arising from new institutional arrangements, must necessarily give rise to some concern.  It is of course true, as these Government sources apparently pointed out to journalists that we have already limited our sovereignty by our referendum decision to join the EEC, but there is a qualitative difference between the kind of limitations of sovereignty involved in that multilateral relationship, which involves a simultaneous and equivalent sharing by us in the sovereignty of the other nine States, and the kind of limitations that <Col N="984" /> could be involved in a new bilateral relationship with a single state so very much larger than ourselves, and with such divergent economic interests.  I shall not, however, develop this point further at this time.  It may be necessary at a later stage to return to it.</P>
    <P>Finally, none of us should be under any illusion &mdash; I do not think anyone is &mdash; that the route now being taken by the Government will yield quick or early results.  I am sure the Taoiseach does not wish to delude the House or the electorate on this point.  By its very nature the indirect route &mdash; through Britain, hoping to create a new context on which Northern attitudes may be changed &mdash; is a lengthy one.  First there has to be progress in Anglo-Irish relations, and then the results of this have to filter through to non-hard line Unionist opinion in Northern Ireland, which will need time to mobilise itself against the even more bitter attacks from the hard-liners which this approach will initially produce &mdash; indeed is even now producing.</P>
    <P>London and Dublin cannot settle this matter over the heads of the Northern Ireland people.  That would be the route to war, not to peace, and we have unanimously abjured violence and have chosen the path of reconciliation and of seeking a new North-South relationship by peaceful means.  We must be prepared to accept not alone that there is a long road ahead but that it is one that may involve frustrations at the initial stages, with an early hardening of opinion in extreme Unionist circles in Northern Ireland.  But so long as we make it absolutely clear at every point that the policy being pursued of creating a new and better relationship with Britain is not designed to lead to a deal over the heads of the Northern people, who must, as the Taoiseach has said, be parties &mdash; and fully consenting parties &mdash; to any North-South arrangement, we can accept the delays necessarily involved in taking the route through London.</P>
    <P>The House will have noted that I have been deliberately restrained in the comments I have made on this matter.  It could have been open to me to have made harsher criticisms on some points or to have raised more contentious issues. <Col N="985" /> The gulf between the two press conferences provided ample scope for such an approach.  But it has been my wish &mdash; and, I should add, that of my party &mdash; to avoid introducing such elements into this debate, not because we do not have serious doubts on a number of points but because we regard the issues raised by this meeting as much too important to warrant such treatment.</P>
    <P>If with the passage of time it appears that our restraint has not been justified and that the reality of what emerges from this meeting falls far short of what has been claimed for it, it will be time enough then for us to voice such criticisms.  To do so now would, we judge, be irresponsible. The Taoiseach knows as well as I do that it is on results, and not on verbiage, that the nation will eventually judge his approach to this problem.  But at this time we must wish his efforts well &mdash; for our country's sake and above all for the sake of our fellow countrymen in Northern Ireland who have borne the full brunt of this tragedy for over ten years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not prepare a script for this discussion because I wanted to hear what the Taoiseach had to say and be able to respond to what he said.  Listening to the Taoiseach I got the distinct impression that he was, to say the least, very defensive in his speech, conjuring up all kinds of images that those who did not go unquestionably along his lines were somehow less Irish and less patriotic than he.  Neither I nor my party have ever used rhetoric as a criterion for Irishness or patriotism and I do not intend to do so now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to confirm what Deputy FitzGerald said regarding the H-Block issue.  Discussions were held between the Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald and myself last week and yesterday and because of possible developments in the issue I also feel it would be of no benefit to anyone concerned to have any comment in the House at this time except to sincerely hope that the matter can be resolved within the context of the statements made by the Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald and myself, which were similar, <Col N="986" /> commenting on the initiative from John Hume.</P>
    <P>We asked for this report for two reasons. First of all it is appropriate that after a meeting of this nature the Taoiseach should report back to the Dáil and also because in this instance there is a very distinct and clear difference between the interpretation of clause 6 of the communiqué in London's view and in Dublin's view.  It is a very serious difference indeed.  Deputy FitzGerald said he felt one could be charged with irresponsibility if one raised these issues in the House at this time, and the presentation of the Taoiseach's point of view this morning was designed to some extent at least to fuel that approach by the media to anyone who would question what happened or did not happen.  At the risk of being termed irresponsible by certain of the media, I feel there is an overriding responsibility on a Member of the House to clarify or attempt to get clarification on precisely what is included and what is excluded in the agreement that was reached at the summit.</P>
    <P>I view the summit in two parts.  The Taoiseach very rightly and correctly claims that it was a very constructive meeting.  It was.  As a matter of fact, if it had not been for this very wide difference on clause 6 which has arisen between London's and Dublin's interpretation, one would have been in a position to congratulate the Taoiseach on the very constructive nature of the summit as far as closer links and development of mutual co-operation in many areas between the UK Government and our Government are concerned.  Of course they were useful and are of mutual interest and benefit.  Substantial progress was made on co-operation and economic matters. Communications, security, transport and cross-Border co-operation are all mentioned and a whole range of matters of mutual interest, not least those that come within the ambit of our relationship by reason of our mutual membership of the EEC, were dealt with.  The difference is not in some economic issue or technicality over cross-Border relations or in an area of transport or our approach to the common agricultural policy; <Col N="987" /> the difference is on the most important fundamental principle of Fianna Fáil policy.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach declared on his election as Taoiseach that the first political priority of his Government and party was the reunification of this country and to progress towards that.  That is how fundamental it was to the Taoiseach.  It is inconceivable to me that there was any misunderstanding on paragraph 6 of the communiqué.  If one accepts, as I do, that there was no misunderstanding, one must try to analyse how there was a difference. Why does it exist, how does it exist, and who benefits from the different interpretations? On the one hand, the Taoiseach gave a press conference in Dublin and described the meeting as historic.  It was an important meeting and made a lot of progress, but without his interpretation that the constitutional position of Northern Ireland could be discussed under the terms of paragraph 6 within the context of the joint studies that have been initiated, it could not be described as historic. That word was used deliberately.  We were told by the Taoiseach through the media at the press conference that he put no limits on what could emerge from these study groups, and there were hinting, implication and innuendo at all times, suggestions, but nothing definite, nothing clear.</P>
    <P>Again this morning there is nothing definite, nothing clear.  There is no statement by the Taoiseach: yes, the British Prime Minister and her senior colleagues agreed that the constitutional position of Northern Ireland could be &mdash; not even would be &mdash; discussed by the study groups and would be discussed at our next meeting. We have had no clear, unequivocal statement of that nature from the Taoiseach at the press conference, since or in this House this morning.  On the other hand the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, is very clear.  I heard and saw her on television and she was asked by a reporter on a BBC news programme on which she was being interviewed about the constitutional matters.  Immediately she pulled the reporter up and said,&ldquo;No, there is a difference.  Institutional <Col N="988" /> arrangements, not constitutional arrangements.  Good gracious, no, good gracious, no&rdquo;.  She repeated it.  She was quite clear that constitutional issues would not and could not be discussed, they were not open for discussion.  Certain institutional arrangements which would be of mutual benefit, which would help us all and which we would all subscribe to and support fully could be discussed but no constitutional arrangements could be discussed.</P>
    <P>Mr. Atkins in the House of Commons last night stated that constitutional matters would not be discussed; institutional matters, yes.  Here we have on this side suggestions, hints, innuendos, hopes, aspirations, all sorts of things; on the other side a clear, unequivocal statement regarding the constitutional position of Northern Ireland.  One wonders who is going to benefit.  Who wins by these different interpretations?  Much more important as far as I am concerned &mdash; and that is why I am prepared to stand up here and take the risk of being told that I am irresponsible &mdash; who loses? Who can lose more than political favour, votes, even their very lives?  All those elements are in this.  The Taoiseach can gain in political terms and advantage, there is no question about that.  The Taoiseach, the Government, the Fianna Fáil Party, by agreement with Mrs. Thatcher, have set up joint study groups, and the Taoiseach has implied not that this is the way forward towards better relationships between the UK and us, but that through these joint study groups, through their input, through the further discussions he is going to have with Mrs. Thatcher, unity is at the end of the road.  She has said definitely, &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  However, the Taoiseach has stated that, he has implied it and he has caused a considerable amount of confusion, and that is beneficial.  If it is not factual the next best thing is to cause confusion, particularly amongst our friends here on the gallery and more particularly amongst some of their editors who are only too willing to be confused, and have shown that.  They love it, but the stakes are too high to play footsie with this, they are too high for our fellow countrymen and women.  The Taoiseach <Col N="989" /> will gain.  We are going to have a general election.  It can be presented to the electorate as a marvellous leap forward.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the ultimate aspiration which we all share is now in sight due to the efforts of this Government and this Taoiseach.  On the other hand, Mrs. Thatcher has her home front to consider.  Let us be fair, a much more serious view is being taken, both within and without the House of Commons, of an office holder standing up and telling a deliberate untruth than there is in this assembly and in this country, unfortunately. It is not lightly done because the consequences and the judgment of your peers come swift and severe.  Unfortunately, that does not always happen here. but it does, by tradition, happen there. Therefore, Mr. Atkins on behalf of the British Government did not lightly get up yesterday and say that no constitutional issues would be discussed.</P>

      <P>I will not seek votes or political support over the dead bodies of Irishmen and Irishwomen or the possibility of it.  I will go out of this office and public life first.  Let us analyse this a little further.  Is Mrs. Thatcher a loser?  No, she is not.  Therefore, we have two participants in the Summit who can be gainers. We have paid a heavy price for her gain, and particularly the people of Northern Ireland have paid a heavy price for it.  What is her gain?  We have had the Atkins round of discussions, a total failure which fell in a shambles around his ankles.  The British Cabinet do not know what to do next or which way to go forward. There is no political initiative, but pressure, rightly, from the Taoiseach, from the Government, from the SDLP, from other interested groups, from us in this party, from Fine Gael, from America, <Col N="990" /> from European peoples and governments. That is her gain.  Unless the Taoiseach can get up here and reply in unequivocal terms that the constitutional issues can and will be discussed, what price have we paid?  The price of our silence when no political initiative is being taken on the North, when she can refer to the Taoiseach's assessment that these things can be included in the study groups.  That is a terrible price that we have to pay, particularly the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I do not know which is correct.  I have stated what I believe to be correct.  The Taoiseach pleads here for us all to be understanding and not to be seeing things that are not there.  If he wants that, surely if the British Prime Minister is entitled in her parliament through her Secretary of State, with the British media to state in clear, unequivocal terms that the constitutional issue cannot and will not be discussed, the Taoiseach is entitled to say to his parliament, to his media, to his people in unequivocal terms that they can be discussed.  He has not done so.  He can do so.  I will shut up if he does.  I will sit down if he does.  She has made her position clear.  He has the opportunity here this morning to make this perfectly clear as to what the proper interpretation is and how he arrived at that interpretation.  If there is any doubt, the irresponsibility is almost beyond comprehension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody here knows that, as far as Northern Ireland is concerned at this moment and over the H-Block issue, the sectarian tensions are at a height now that have not been witnessed since the early seventies and that both communities have retreated more and more to their own positions.  If the British Government, the British Prime Minister, our Taoiseach or our Government are trying to get political advantage out of fuelling that situation, which has been fuelled by this confusion and which can be cleared up if the Taoiseach wants to do it, it is not only irresponsible but criminal.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to say in clear, unequivocal, no roundabout way but straight out, is it permissible and was it agreed that the constitutional position of Northern Ireland would be referred to <Col N="991" /> those joint study groups?  Will they be on the agenda of the next meeting with the British Prime Minister?  If that is the position there is no breach of confidence as Deputy FitzGerald seemed to suggest. There cannot be a breach of confidence. The British Prime Minister has already done it in her parliament through her Secretary of State and directly to the British people on BBC television.  There is no breach of confidence.  The Taoiseach can do it.  The noise and the rumbling coming from Northern Ireland can put fear in the hearts of all our people, whether they be Catholic or Protestant. For God's sake, will the Taoiseach get up and be clear about what did or did not take place, whether or not those things can be included or excluded.  The Taoiseach owes it to the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This problem, to which the debate is addressing itself, is one between two governments in these two islands.  It is an Anglo-Irish problem which includes also the fundamental necessity to effect a reconciliation within the Northern Ireland community and the rest of the country. It is in that context that the discussions which took place last Monday and previously in London between the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach and between members of the British Government and the Irish Government should be viewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reaction to the meeting last Monday has been highly constructive in the British and Irish media.  It is in this area we must seek to mobilise support so that public opinion in this island and in the island of Britain can come to a comprehension of the complexity of the problem involved.  I would like to place on record my view that the constructive response by the media, with some exceptions, particularly in Britain, can only lead to a constructive evolution of debate and, hopefully, lead to a constructive conclusion to this intractable problem that has bedevilled relations between Britain and Ireland over so many centuries and has divided our people in this island.  I believe the part to be played by public opinion in <Col N="992" /> this matter is very important.  It is public opinion in the last analysis that will motivate the British Government.  It is public opinion at home, in the South and in the North, that will come round to a constructive and responsible attitude to the matter and lead those who take part in public debate to a similar constructive and responsible attitude to the matter.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly that the partnership at the present time between the people, the politicians and the media to see some way out of this intractable and complex problem is excellent and cannot but be fruitful.  In that context I might mention the excellent production at the moment on television relating to Irish history.  All of this I believe is leading to a new convergence of intelligent, constructive and responsible assessment of this situation. We do not want negative notes at the present time.  We want, above all else, positive thinking.  I do not have to emphasise what is set out in the previous communiqué in London that the relationship between Britain and Ireland is a unique one.  It is unique and it is also complex with its roots deep in history.  Real progress can only come about if there is a willingness to look at this relationship in a new light, to adopt a fresh and positive approach.  I believe the meeting last Monday was a major step towards the adoption of such an approach.</P>
    <P>Surely experience has shown us that there is no ready made solution that will suddenly emerge and that we must proceed in this area step by step and as long as we proceed constructively step by step and have an overall positive approach to the matter, that is important from the psychological point of view because this whole area is motivated by psychological attitude, the environment of thought, the approach of people and, in particular, the lessening of suspicion and distrust. This can only come about through exchanges such as we had last Monday and will continue to have on a regular basis with particular emphasis on the positive result of last Monday's meeting, to which I would like to address myself.</P>
    <P>We have now got a positive decision set out in paragraph 6 of the communiqué where the two Governments have now <Col N="993" /> decided to commission at the highest level joint studies covering a wide range of vital issues.  They are spelled out as new institutional structures, which is what counts.  There is no written constitution in Britain, for the benefit of Deputy Cluskey.  We are talking about new institutional structures within this island, citizenship rights, security matters, economic co-operation.  All of those vital areas will be covered by joint studies, already commissioned, which will be examined by officials at the highest level and will form the basis of an agenda for the next meeting between the two heads of Government and respective relevant Ministers, which will take place next year.  That represents a positive step forward because at this meeting special consideration will be given to making decisions on the basis of the joint studies in the wide areas I have just mentioned, which have been commissioned and will be examined between now and the next meeting.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise that this particular decision embodied in paragraph 6 of the communiqué merits the description of the discussions that gave rise to that decision, as referred to in paragraph 8, in which both sides subscribed to the view that the discussions were extremely constructive and significant.  The things I have just mentioned, those studies which will be specially considered at the next meeting between the two Governments, represent the significant element in the talks that took place last Monday.  The Taoiseach made that quite clear in the course of his press conference after the talks.  We are satisfied that it is through the development of a better mutual relationship between the two Governments and peoples that a lasting solution to the problems in Northern Ireland can be found.  The Government will press forward with these studies.  We are determined that the next meeting between the heads of Government will be important in that these studies, having been thoroughly prepared, can be examined fully and decisions made.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise another aspect which is also very important and essential. What we are talking about here is <Col N="994" /> not only the question of Anglo-Irish relations, though that aspect must be the broad context since Anglo-Irish relations comprehend exchanges between the only two sovereign Governments that exist in these islands.  In addition, there is the basic issue of the Northern Ireland community. At this point I would make a particular appeal to those who belong to the other Irish tradition.  There are two Irish traditions on this Island, the Nationalist and the Unionist traditions.  The people of the Unionist Irish tradition need have no fear provided that we set our sights on reconciliation, on the securing of stability leading to reconciliation and provided we set our sights towards achieving reconciliation by way of agreed structures and by way of discussion.  The whole emphasis must be placed on that area.  Every aspect of relations between the two Irish traditions is on the table for discussion by all the people of this island represented by those whom they have elected to speak for them.</P>
    <P>More than anything else we should emphasise that what we are talking of is not something exclusive between Britain and Ireland but, rather, that we are talking about an all-embracing exclusive aspect which includes Anglo-Irish relations on the one hand and comprehending and including relations both within the Northern community and between the Northern community and the rest of the country.  Our two islands are linked together inextricably on this planet and it is in that context that we are seeking to lift this whole debate on to a new level.</P>

      <P>In conclusion, I would emphasise one other aspect and that is that this debate be kept at the level which it has attained up to now.  I say this because the issue concerned is of such basic sensitivity and importance.  Proress is being made step by step and we hope that this situation will continue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach and the Leaders of both Opposition parties have talked about a unique relationship existing <Col N="995" /> between Ireland and Great Britain but they have omitted any reference to what I regard as unique in this whole situation: that we have here a Government dealing with the British Government and their representatives as if everything in the garden was rosy.  So far as I am concerned &mdash; and the same goes for thousands of my fellow countrymen both at home and abroad &mdash; the whole situation is bizarre as well as being unique in that we are occupied by Great Britain and have been so occupied for 800 years. We are partitioned within our own country by Great Britain while at the same time several Irishmen are dying in jails in the Six Counties.  Yet we continue to behave as if everything was normal and that there was a situation in which two sovereign Governments were discussing the economic difficulties being experienced both here and throughout the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not both sad and incomprehensible that we get the parsing and the analysing of what took place on Monday last at this so-called historic meeting?  Is it not sad that there is little emphasis on the part of the Taoiseach, none from either of the two main speakers from the Opposition and nothing of any sense from the Minister for Foreign Affairs &mdash; there seldom is &mdash; in regard to the burning question of those people who are on the brink of death, who are on hunger strike as a last protest against the inhumane treatment that is being meted out to their fellow Irishmen, not all of whom are Catholics, in Long Kesh, and to the women in Armagh prison, not to mention the treatment to which our Irish prisoners are subjected in jails in Britain?  It is difficult to understand how people can come here today and endeavour to gross over the whole problem.  We know, not as a result of any communiqué nor from anything that has been said here today, that the Northern Ireland Office in Belfast are prepared for the deaths of those prisoners who are on hunger strike.  We know from that office that in the event of the first death there are preparations for containing what would become an immediate escalation of violence.  That situation will <Col N="996" /> be contained by the RUC, backed up by the UDR &mdash; all of whom are Irishmen &mdash; in that order and finally by the British Army.  In other words, the RUC will be in the frontline followed by the UDR while the British Army take third place in order in containing what they expect to be an escalation of violence lasting for two or three days.  It is expected that those remaining on hunger strike would then decide to take food and that, consequently, everything would be the same as it was a couple of months ago.  But there will still be Long Kesh and the brutalising of our people there.  Yet there is no word from the Taoiseach on all of this.</P>
    <P>There is much that I could say on how the H-Block and the blanket protest came about, on how the hunger strike was brought about and on how it has continued.  I could say a good deal about how this hunger strike parallels that which took place in 1972 when political status was granted.  It parallels also similar situations in 1917 when political status was granted, too.  It is not being granted on this occasion.  One of the reasons it is not being granted is because successive Governments are not treating Britain in the manner in which we should at a time such as this.  Our unique relationship with them at the moment is that they are occupying our country, brutalising our people and discriminating against a minority within the partitioned part of our country.  Those who are protesting today on hunger strike and on the blanket are carrying on the struggle that has been going on for generations.  While the cause is still there it will prevent any real development of the relationship that should and could exist between two neighbouring islands on the fringe of Europe who need each other badly in the depressing world in which we live today.</P>
    <P>Has the Taoiseach put it to Mrs. Thatcher that the security he talked about here today is costing three times as much per head for the people in this part of the country as it is for the residents of Great Britain?  Has the Taoiseach asked Mrs. Thatcher to find a solution to this terrible tragedy and told her that, if she does not, we will not provide this security? <Col N="997" /> Has the Taoiseach said &ldquo;Why should we pay for securing a border that the British put there and want to keep there and that we want to get rid of?&rdquo;  As a representative of the British Government has Mrs. Thatcher been asked whether her Government are prepared to declare their intention to get out of this country?  What is the Taoiseach's attitude to the information coming from the Northern Ireland Office that they are prepared for the deaths of some of the seven, that the rest will come off hunger strike, that the public uprising that will take place will be put down in two or three days and that we will be back to square one or back to H-block?</P>
    <P>These are the matters that need to be clarified rather than whether Mrs. Thatcher and Deputy Haughey described their meeting in a manner that left all of us of the opinion that they were not talking about the same thing.  The essence is this: what is to happen to Irishmen and women on hunger strike?  What is to happen to those who are incarcerated in Long Kesh which is a hell hole and everybody knows it?  It is too horrible to think about and it turns people off, but while it is there and people are being treated in this way and while we are occupied and partitioned, our unique relationship cannot be developed.  This is the essence of any discussions that may take place.  The Diplock juryless courts and the conviction of 80 per cent of the people in Long Kesh due to forced confessions should not be accepted and it would not be accepted in most civilised countries.  Yet we deal with the people who perpetuate that sort of situation on our people as if everything was normal.</P>

      <P>I do not normally contribute to Northern Ireland debates.  This is not because I have a lack of interest, nor because I have not visited Northern Ireland and studied the problem, nor is it because I have not good relations with members of both communities there.  It is because I find that I agree with Deputy Blaney in that the trauma and the tragedy and the way in which the partition of this island has affected our thinking, emotions and our history is the most distressing thing in public life here, and words have not contributed a great deal to the solution of this problem over 60 years. The attitude of the founders of my party in the twenties was correct, and in spite of many Governments since then we were possibly nearer to unifying this country then than we are now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise the views of all Members of the House in their welcome for what the Minister for Foreign Affairs referred to as the other tradition of this island.  In our desire for friendship, harmony and <Col N="999" /> co-operation on this island unpartitioned in the future, everything we do and say should always be put forward with a view to reconciliation and eliminating the violence that has bedevilled this country for far too long.  I have tended to bend over backwards to facilitate what might be regarded as backward steps in this regard, because I fear the violence.  I fear for the future and the mental stability of people who are reared in violence.  I fear for the future of this country unless we can eliminate violence.  I look at everything in this House and any meetings to see if they measure up to two criteria &mdash; do they lead to unification and will they help to eliminate violence?  I am willing to submerge many of the criticisms I make of people and organisations if I can accept that they may put us on that road. It is with that outlook that I look at last Monday's meeting, the important part of which took place in the hour and a quarter the Taoiseach had alone with Mrs. Thatcher.  Obviously, in a meeting with just two people a much more frank discussion would take place and there would be a much clearer view of the necessary steps to bring about my two measurements of success &mdash; the elimination of violence and the reunification of the country.  As Deputy Dr. FitzGerald said earlier, many British politicians see that in the end this country will be united, but what they cannot see is the format of words or policies that would allow them get out with honour and without bloodshed. Perhaps the hour and a quarter that the Taoiseach spent with Mrs. Thatcher will have enabled them to come up with a solution to that problem.  If they have, whoever is head of the Government in this country will have the full support of our party.  In the meantime perhaps for the wrong reasons I will submerge any criticism I may have of the meeting.</P>
    <P>A joint press conference, after issuing a joint communiqué like this, might be more beneficial to both parties because it is not productive to have wrangling over the interpretation of the words used in the communiqué in the press as a result <Col N="1000" /> of two separate press conferences held in London and Dublin.</P>
    <P>I took particular exception, and I presume every Member of this House did too, to the reference by the British Prime Minister to the unique relationship between the two countries being a common land border.  That is not so.  The unique relationship between Great Britain and Ireland is that we have economic and cultural ties going back into history and we are two islands of the mainland off the west coast of Europe.</P>
    <P>As I said, I am willing to submerge any criticisms I might have in the belief that the participants in that conference want to achieve the same ends I want to achieve, even though it is more difficult for one of them to say so, that is, the unification of this country and an end to violence on this island.  If last Monday's conference leads to that end, the Taoiseach can be assured of the support of this party.</P>

      <P>This House is debating a joint communiqué issued after a meeting last Monday which was described very deliberately as being extremely constructive, this being the consensus of the parties to that meeting. Obviously we are trying to find a way out of the web of relations which existed between the two countries over the centuries, particularly out of the division, dissent and tragedy we have seen over the last 60 years, and particularly over the last ten years.  We have seen divisions, fears, prejudice feeding on prejudice based on ignorance and perhaps on fear. Last Monday's very significant meeting took upon itself the obligation, intention and determination to bring forward policies and proposals to achieve peace, reconciliation and stability where previously there has been division, distrust and instability, particularly in the North of Ireland and to eliminate the strain of dissent and division which has bedevilled relations between the two countries, between North and South and within the North.  These intentions and commitments which emerged from this very positive meeting will not be easily achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1001" /> These policies and proposals will tax the ingenuity, imagination, concern, commitment and confidence of all parties involved over each stage of this series which is getting under way as a development of what already exists.  Unfortunately Deputy Cluskey wants precision now as to what exactly will be done and what is intended to be done each step along the way.  He wants this to be clear and unequivocal thereby demonstrating his lack of experience in this kind of meeting and his lack of appreciation of the deep historical problems that have to be faced, solved and overcome in order to realise the potential on this island and for an improvement in relations between both parts of this island.  As one involved in these discussions I want to tell Deputies that any implication that there is not agreement and commitment by the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister has no basis.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there are some aspects of this matter which are very sad.  I heard on BBC Belfast this morning &mdash; and it was echoed a little by Deputy Cluskey when he said the Taoiseach will gain in political terms, implying that this advantage was only for himself and his party as distinct from the great political advantage that will benefit all &mdash; a former Member of this House and a current member of the Labour Party.  He said this would enable the Taoiseach to reap propaganda dividends inside the Republic.  That was said with a stamp of authority by an editor of a major British newspaper.  He went on to say that the Taoiseach stood to gain by fooling the electorate about a united Ireland.  I find it sad that someone, who may for one reason or another have been disillusioned at what he was not able to achieve, should now create confusion where the signs in the British media are very positive.</P>
    <P>We have come a long way from 1965 &mdash; this coincides with my first election to this House when I was involved in discussions in this area &mdash; when the only group in Britain, the Campaign for Democracy in Ulster within the Labour Party, were aware of what was happening; the media, or the political representatives <Col N="1002" /> were not aware.  The British media is now much more aware and is expecting much more from those who have the responsibility to help the people to find their way out of this fear, distrust and division into a new area of co-operation, understanding and achievement.</P>
    <P>This comes at a time when BBC are showing a very significant television series by Robert Kee which it is hoped will not stimulate fears but will create a new awareness among the British people of the tangled web of relationships between the two countries.  It is well that the problems of the past are known so that the problems of the present will be understood.</P>
    <P>Some of the facts we have to face derive from economic problems which I want to touch on.  The North of Ireland economy has been a dependent service economy, an economy which depends on public expenditure from the British Exchequer.  This has been the reality. Now that the pressures that apply to all Governments, particularly Treasury Ministers and Ministers for Finance, are becoming very clear, the need for a new adaptation of the structures there, and here, to meet the needs of the eighties, nineties and into the next century as distinct from the position over the last 50 or 60 years when each country had and played different roles, is of vital importance. Everybody is concerned with these constraints.  Allowing for the special preference which the British Government may see they are giving the North of Ireland in terms of public expenditure, we are concerned to ensure that instead of watching the consequences of a huge bill, greater economic depression, we can begin to see, through new co-operation on economic policies particularly which these studies will bring about, proposals that will enable us to harness our joint capacities and our total commitment.</P>
    <P>Security costs can and must be put to better use.  It will be a first priority of successive Governments here to ensure that while we recognise the responsibility this Government have &mdash; as the increasing security bill demonstrates&mdash;to see that that money, which incidentally turns up on the current budget and which economists <Col N="1003" /> would maintain is all current, is not deemed to be further evidence of our failure to control our current budget.  We are not failing in our commitment in that area.  I am glad to say that, from my own experience in this area, that question is now over; nobody now raises that as they did some years ago with the former Secretary of State and myself; it is over.  But both Governments are anxious to ensure that the moneys that are being applied there be applied much more positively to economic development.  There is a great space for study, co-operation and common cause and purpose in the interests of the people involved.</P>
    <P>Also our relationships will develop because of our relations together in Europe.  This Government are particularly pleased that we have been able to bring it forward beyond what might have been imagined some years ago, in terms of the response of our partners not just on the quota on the cross-Border regions but also on the non-quota on the cross-Border regions.  Every aspect of this is now a matter of keen awareness at European level and will so remain in terms of the Community's own policies.  The Government will indeed be applying persuasion, pressures and whatever imagination we have towards directing the resources there in the appropriate way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to make just three more points and it is essential that I do so.  Where are there now anywhere in Europe circumstances like those in Strabane, Newry, Derry, even Carrickfergus? Mind you, we do not have anything particular to be comfortable about here.  But I do say that the circumstances that are there will tax the imagination of all of those at official and Government level who will now undertake this major venture.  We want to see economic co-operation, more competition, where in fact to date we have been competing, at some cost to our taxpayers.  Here is a great new dimension which the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister established at this very significant meeting at <Col N="1004" /> which the relationships were such as to enable us to come to this conclusion and which the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain is as conscious as I or indeed any other Minister in this Government.</P>
      <P>Two last points: of course this does involve our fellow Irishmen in the North, Unionists and Nationalists.  Lest there be any doubt, let me say that I agree with Deputy FitzGerald about contacts with the Unionists.  This Government agree, and I doubt if any Government have had as much informal, private contacts with Unionists as we have had over the past 12 months in particular.  We do not boast about it but at least we have achieved an understanding based on their economic interests.</P>
      <P>I have one last comment to make.  We have built up relations with British Government Ministers at European level and at every other level, which is positive. After all of this my hope would be that some of the sadness and tragedy we have seen, sadness particularly, that I think is exemplified in one person I have met&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to take my 25 minutes because the pride of place, in terms of explanation to the House, still rests with the Taoiseach.  We have had 14 pages this morning of elaboration which, if one might be uncharitable about it, was strong in rhetoric but extremely slight in content.  The Leader of my Party has laid it straight to the Taoiseach to clarify his precise interpretation of the communiqué.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all accept that it is the conventional <Col N="1005" /> practice and wisdom on occasions such as the meeting between the two Prime Ministers that there should be a degree of licence permitted both participants in elaborations on what took place, particularly at subsequent press conferences.  I must confess to being rather jaundiced&mdash;as the Leader of my Party was correctly entirely jaundiced this morning&mdash;that the Taoiseach should come in here and rather defensively chide individuals like myself who went on radio and expressed a degree of scepticism on what allegedly had been taking place, and expressed a degree of concern that the media should be rather confusing the issue.  The reverse is the correct position. The Taoiseach took licence above and beyond the conventional interpretations given to those occasions when, at his press conference, he indulged in certain rhetoric.  Perhaps I may quote him from <i>The Irish Times</i> of Tuesday last, 9 December. I think that newspaper is reliable enough; its editor would be somewhat sympathetic to the Taoiseach's view on these matters; he is given to a good deal of rhetoric himself.  The Taoiseach is reported as maintaining that the discussions had brought &ldquo;significant political movement into this tragic situation&rdquo;.  The article went on to say:</P>
    <P>...the Taoiseach commented that he was hopeful that they were &ldquo;in the middle of an historic breakthrough&rdquo;...</P>
    <P>I do not know where he gets these public relations phrases&mdash;perhaps somebody in his Department hands him these pieces of paper&mdash;but the article continued:</P>
    <P>and that the problem facing the two Governments had been placed &ldquo;firmly on a new plane&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If expectations of a false nature have been created they have been entirely of the Taoiseach's own creation.  He should not indulge in what one might described as false recrimination against the Opposition or the media, that they are hammering him with interpretations which are incorrect when he himself quite evidently, way over and above the conventional wisdom, has gone on to create <Col N="1006" /> expectations apparently for internal, domestic consumption.  But we have a clear conflict.  The British Prime Minister has apparently been under no illusions whatsoever as to the format and content of her discussions with the Taoiseach. There has been the implication by the Taoiseach that the concept of studies relating to new institutionalised structures have a constitutional dimension.  This has been repudiated by Mrs. Thatcher and by Humphrey Atkins.  Therefore, a clear responsibility rests on the Taoiseach to set the record straight because without that clear and absolute confirmation from him we just drift on in an area of false expectations, false implications and false interpretations of what happened.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that in the communiqueacute; there was no reference in paragraph 6 to the situation in Northern Ireland.  If it is intended by the Taoiseach, and accepted by the British Government, that possible new institutional structures include the situation in Northern Ireland, then the Taoiseach should say so.  If it is not he should say so.  If it is his wish that that should be included he should say so. There is nothing more destructive to the political situation in Northern Ireland than that an impression should be created among the population of Northern Ireland that by a process of nudge and political wink between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister somehow or other they are in but they do not know whether they are or not in the context of institutional studies.  If the Taoiseach has been hoisted by anything he has been hoisted by the rhetoric of his own interpretation.</P>
    <P>It is not in any way destructive or counter-productive for the Opposition, relative to the situation in Northern Ireland, to ask such questions.  Down through the seventies &mdash; apparently now we are going to have a spate of it up to the next general election &mdash; we have had this perpetual ambiguity and creation of false expectations.  The Taoiseach is anxious to go into the next general election telling the people that the North is in safe hands and that we are on the verge of new studies.  He wants to be able to tell the people that we are going to emerge with a new programme and new proposals <Col N="1007" /> which would impinge on the constitutional structures of Northern Ireland. He wants his troops and the electorate kept happy about the situation.  I suggest that the situation is more serious and of far greater consequence than that kind of indulgence which has gone on down through the years in terms of alleged Fianna Fáil or Government policy at such meetings.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has told us that significant political movement in this tragic situation has emerged in those discussions but we want to know what movement.  Is there any real British initiative as of now for 1981 proposed relative to the political situation in Northern Ireland?  That is a straight question.  It would appear from the communiqué that was issued that the British Government have pushed it all away.  It would appear that if anything the whole process has been long-fingered by the British Government and that the Taoiseach is blandly accepting that situation. He knows he will have to face a general election within the next six or 12 months and he does not want to have to face the harsh realities in terms of stating his position unequivocally on that matter. If we are to have institutional studies of an alleged constitutional character, something that has been repudiated by the British, if there is no agenda or time scale and if the subject matters are no more than the conventional subject matters of economic co-operation, security consultation, matters relating to fisheries and agricultural policy or the role of sterling and the punt in the European monetary system, there is nothing momentous about that.  We welcome that type of mutual economic and political co-operation in these islands.</P>
    <P>However, if the Taoiseach is saying to us that there is within those studies a specific Northern Ireland content he should show us the agenda, if any agenda was agreed.  Presumably, the Foreign Office and the Department of Foreign Affairs had consultations prior to the Summit.  Generally, as we all know, in the development towards a Summit meeting prior consultations take place. The final discussion takes place on a comprehensive <Col N="1008" /> basis at such Summit meetings. In my view this is another example of this new characteristic in Government, that one has a public relations-media impressionistic policy of an almost atmospheric nature, all very vague, and once that impression of goodwill towards the situation is created by the Taoiseach it is a substitute for politics.  The real politics centres around the questions: was there any discussion between the Taoiseach, Mrs. Thatcher and Lord Carrington about next year in Northern Ireland, what is going to happen between now and local election time in Northern Ireland? Is there any prospect of a new assembly in Northern Ireland to enable public representatives there to act as the democratically elected public representatives in 1981?  Were those questions discussed or was it a question of the British saying that they would keep the Taoiseach on a little bit of a string, keep him happy, let him say what he liked about the communiqué but they were not going to give anything.  Was it a question of the British saying that pending the general election here they would not give anything and would let the Taoiseach say what he liked because he was needed on security matters.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, by agreeing to institutional studies &mdash; whatever that means &mdash; has long-fingered this matter into 1981-82. If our response this morning to the Taoiseach has been harsh it is because expectations of a very false nature were created and there was a manipulation of public opinion which we, in seeking elaboration from the Taoiseach, are not prepared to accept.  We do not accept it because to us that is the phoney politics of partitionism.  We cannot accept that type of phoney approach in Irish politics. It is because of the serious situation in Northern Ireland, where tensions can be heightened, where impressions can be created and where conflict of a serious nature can occur in inter-community relationships that that kind of ingredient should be removed from the mix of political inter-reaction.  We look to the Taoiseach to clarify the situation.  In that regard the position has been clearly stated by our party leader this morning <Col N="1009" /> and any further comment on my part would be superfluous.  Accordingly, we rest our response on that basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with great attention to the Taoiseach, the other Government speakers and speakers from this side of the House and I agree that this is probably the most urgent, most emotive and heart-wrenching subject Irish people have ever had to face in this or any previous generation.  The Taoiseach is saddled with the responsibility of going in the right direction and we, as fellow Irishmen, hope that he will succeed, because it is not important which party in this House or which Irishman of any political party can, in the modern term, deliver the goods.  I cannot see anything objectionable in the Taoiseach's speech.  It is a well-documented address, one with which I could not find great fault in sentiment but it had very little in content. It was reiteration of speeches made by former Taoiseachs, particularly in the Fianna Fáil Party.  I could not help thinking that it could have been the late Deputy Eamon de Valera or the late Deputy Seán Lemass who was making this speech, or maybe in more difficult times the former Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch could have made it.  The only things we would have to substitute are the name, the date and the occasion.</P>
      <P>However, one thing that all speakers have missed so far is the shift in position of the present Government party.  We all remember that it is not so long ago that the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party was a British withdrawal.  They knew that that would not work because if Britain did withdraw her troops and her finances with them, not alone would there be economic chaos in Northern Ireland but civil war would have followed inevitably. Therefore, after many months of listening to words of reason, maybe from their own party supporters at grass-roots level, honest-to-goodness Irishmen trying to think out seriously the correct way forward to reconciliation between Irishmen, they got away from British withdrawal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next cliché was, &ldquo;Take away the steel wall.  Take away the guarantees from the Unionists and let us treat them <Col N="1010" /> as equals.&rdquo;  That did not make much progress, and they moved from that position to a British declaration of interest in Irish unity.  That was an admission of failure on the part of that party who came into being on the two foundation stones of Irish unity and the restoration of the Gaelic language.  We know how successful they have been in restoring the native language.  This parliament must be the only parliament in the world where the native language has to be translated into a foreign language for us natives to understand it.  That is the progress, not a very pleasant thing to have to admit, since the party came into being as a separate entity in Irish public life in 1926 or 1927.  Their success in Irish unity is just as non-productive.</P>
    <P>Living in a Border area, born within a hundred yards of the Border, growing up in a community that straddled the Border, ignoring Partition because I had come to live with it, just recognising that the pillar-boxes on one side of the Border were painted green and on the other side red and that there was a red, white and blue flag called the Union Jack flying over the Post Office in Strabane and a tricol-our of green, white and orange flying over the Post Office in my native town of Lifford, growing up like many other boys in that community, I came to tolerate Partition, to ignore it, to relegate it to my subconscious.  It did not exist.  The only thing that brought me to reality was the policies of Irish Governments, particularly successive Fianna Fáil Governments, who put more partition between North and South than Lord Craigavon could have dreamed of.  What the Taoiseach has said today &mdash; if he means it &mdash; has come close to the basics of my politics and the politics of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government and of those people who believed in political separation from but economic association with Britain.  The difference between that and the Unionist-Irish tradition is that they wanted political separation and economic union.  This party tried to sell a concept that Irish unity was possible economically, culturally and socially between Irishmen of different tradition, but politically it was not possible until we won the <Col N="1011" /> confidence and consent of each other. That was the position between 1921 and 1932.</P>
    <P>At this belated stage has the Taoiseach really put the Fianna Fáil party on the right course to Irish unity?  If he has I assure him that my party as far as I and the leader of the party are concerned will not impede him for a moment in his attempts.  We all cherish Irish unity, not territorial unity but the unity of the peoples of Ireland.  That does not mean sitting down and talking for one hour and twenty minutes in private to a British Prime Minister, although that is a very necessary exercise and procedure to explain in detail to the British Prime Minister the political direction a Dublin Government hope to pursue in the quest of Irish unity.</P>
    <P>However, like it or not, lump it or otherwise, one million Irish people north of the Border will not be coerced into Irish unity and we at some time will have to take our courage in our hands and sit down and talk to those people, not on our conditions but on their conditions.  I hope that if the Taoiseach really means what he says in his speech he will not exclude anything at any further talks. That means going to the leadership of the Unionist loyalist community in the North of Ireland and saying to them, &ldquo;What do you want to talk to us about so that we can share the island of Ireland, that Catholic and Protestant, Nationalist and Unionist may share in the true tradition of Tone whom all of you idolise to the exclusion of others.  We do not tell you that you are less than Irish because we question the direction that you go&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It sickens me in my stomach and makes me ashamed at times to be sneered at by people, mostly from the Fianna Fáil Party but also from other super-republican groups in this island, and told that I and people like me are less Irish for seeking the friendship of other Irish people, for going into the ghetto areas of Belfast and listening painfully &mdash; I repeat painfully &mdash; to the concept of the people there of what we are all about until such time as they run out of wind and we get an opportunity to explain our true position.  What <Col N="1012" /> are we told for doing this by somebody whom the Taoiseach promoted to a Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture? That I and people like me are less Irish than he, that in some way we are a peculiar brand of Unionist or of West Briton.  I do not want to be anything other than Irish.</P>
    <P>If the people sitting in the Government benches want to put a tag after being Irish they are free to do it.  If they want to call themselves republican, super-republican or some other brand of Irishism which makes them feel first-class citizens of this State, that is their choice.  It does not impress me, because Ireland will not be united by coercion and it will not be united by conquest.  If the Taoiseach has been talking to the British Prime Minister about Anglo-Irish affairs, that he is entitled to do.  But if Anglo-Irish affairs take in the very deep meaning of the Irish relationship, then the conflict is not between Anglo and Irish, between Britain and Ireland.  It is between two groups of Irish people loosely called Unionist, Loyalist, Protestant, Ulster Scot, Irish Scot and, on the other side, Gaelic Irish, Nationalist, Catholic, Republican, call them what one likes.  Until such time as we can communicate with such people, Irish unity will remain an illusion</P>
    <P>The well-documented speech the Taoiseach made &mdash; I congratulate whoever put it together &mdash; will remain a collection of pious platitudes until we get below the surface and recognise, as the Taoiseach said, that nothing or no one can be excluded.  If the Taoiseach does not exclude them he must include them.  He must take into consideration the values which Protestant Loyalist Unionist people have which were given to them by their parents, the schools which they attended and the community in which they grew up and which make them what they are, just as our traditions make us what we are.  The conflict is no longer Anglo-Irish.  The conflict is that no Irishman in this Parliament has ever yet succeeded in communicating the true position of the Irish people in their aspirations towards Irish unity.</P>
    <P>I hope the Taoiseach is on the right track.  There is something terribly contradictory <Col N="1013" /> in the Taoiseach talking about a unique relationship between the people of these islands while in the south of the country there are members of his own party saying that British soldiers are legitimate targets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Taoiseach reconcile such a thing?  When the Taoiseach speaks about security there are people on those benches who reluctantly agree to security, saying that it is not our job to secure the Border.  We must understand, painful as it is, that if we aspire to Irish unity we have a commitment to protect the lives, limbs, properties and families of that other tradition who show no interest at this time in Irish unity.</P>
      <P>If we believe in Irish unity our responsibility does not stop at the Border.  It continues over the 32 counties of this island.  That is the test of whether or not one really wants Irish unity among Catholics, Protestants and dissenters, or will it be a conquest by those in the major tradition, of which the Fianna Fáil Party, the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party make up the big majority?  Is it conquest, conversion, coercion or unity?  If it is unity it means unity between the peoples of Ireland and has nothing to do with Partition.  Partition could be put away tommorrow by force, but it would not give us a united Ireland.  What would be the difference in having Loyalist groups in the North conducting themselves as the Republican groups are conducting themselves at present?  Where would be the unity in having soldiers or policemen employed by this Parliament in an all-Ireland framework being shot in the back by Loyalist groups?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel depressed at times that there are so many people on the Government side of the House who talk so much about Irish unity and do so little about it.  How many of them fulfil their party pledge, which says: I accept nomination from this party.  I believe in the unity of Ireland.  I will work towards that end?  How many of the Taoiseach's 84 Deputies have crossed the Border and talked to an Irish <Col N="1014" /> Protestant or could communicate their own basic position to a Protestant family in Belfast?  All of us in this House believe in Irish unity and there are many people of our tradition North of the Border who share that political aspiration.  There are many people in the Protestant community who would talk in some way about Irish unity but we have always made it difficult for them to do so because we never at any time tried to protect them, understand them, show them sympathy or love or affection or that they had a real role to play in an all-Ireland context. The Taoiseach spoke about confederation. I took him to mean a confederation of the British Isles&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As Deputy Cluskey said, it is time the Taoiseach told us what he did talk about.  The Taoiseach said we should take the communiqué seriously because it summarised meticulously what was discussed. Where does it do so?  He said it described specifically what emerged. Where does it do that?  He said it set out clearly what was agreed among those who actually participated.  Can the Taoiseach show me where it set out clearly what happened between those who participated? He said it provided the only reliable basis on which the value of the meeting could and should be assessed.  The Taoiseach issued a communiqué of three pages, the first two pages of which are restatements of what happened &mdash; nothing in particular.  He said that it was leading to new and closer co-operation in <Col N="1015" /> energy, transport, communications, cross-Border economic development and security.  What new breakthrough was the Taoiseach talking about when he said it was leading to a new and closer co-operation in energy?  The late Bill Norton as Minister for Industry and Commerce and James Dillon, as Minister for Agriculture, members of the first inter-party Government, which tried to take Fianna Fáil on a course different to that on which they had set the nation in 1932, were speaking in those terms.  There is nothing new.  The Taoiseach should tell us where the breakthrough is because the press are telling us that there is a good breakthrough. The Taoiseach used the word himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach described it as an historic meeting.  If that is not a breakthrough.  I do not know what is.  It is a choice of words.  The Taoiseach should tell us what extraordinary thing happened at this meeting that did not happen before.  When the Taoiseach speaks about &ldquo;institutional structures&rdquo; what is meant by that?  What is meant by &ldquo;citizens' rights&rdquo;.  We know what &ldquo;security&rdquo; and &ldquo;mutual understanding&rdquo; mean, and we hope the Taoiseach does.  These are all pious terms with which we do not find fault, but the view put across by the media amd by the public relations work of the Taoiseach gave the impression that there has been an immediate breakthrough, that something is about to happen. What we are talking about here is progress in the long term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Short or long, I am not finding fault <Col N="1016" /> with it.  In the most sincere words I can muster I say to the Taoiseach that if he succeeds in moving topwards Irish unity he will not be impeded by this side of the House.  We will co-operate with him in every way possible.  Any experience we have gained in the past ten years is at his disposal just for the asking, not in the interests of political gain or vote-catching but in the common interest of Irishmen in the hope that we can put an end to the slaughter that has taken place in the past ten years.</P>
    <P>When we hear Fianna Fáil these days talking about economic co-operation we should not overlook that when they came to power in 1932 they changed the course of Irish history.  Unity has not been achieved, and 50 years further on we find ourselves more remote from Irish unity than we were then.  The only man I gave credit to for breaking away from that harness is the late Seán Lemass.  He tried to renegotiate the free trade agreement that had existed from the time of Grattan's Parliament until 1931.  Fianna Fáil believed there were other ways to attain Irish unity and they have pursued policies in the meantime which were partitionist in themselves.  Right up to the break with sterling not enough consideration was given to that.</P>
    <P>As a fellow Irishman I wish the Taoiseach in the time left to him in office every success in his endeavours to bring Irishmen together peacefully.  However, I hope he will respond to and reciprocate the good wishes of this party and the Labour Party, that he will not try to be a Napolean in his own time by thinking that he alone has been given the divine right to achieve Irish unity.  No man singly will ever unite the Irish people.  Unless the Taoiseach can achieve it in this Parliament it is futile to talk about Irish unity to one million people who are not listening. We all share the desire for Irish unity between all our people &mdash; Catholic, Protestant and dissenters.  But between all of us in this House and that one million people there is basic disagreement.  The Taoiseach must realise that Irish unity will be achieved more easily and sooner by agreement with the people in Belfast than between Dublin and London.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to say by way of reply.  I have listened carefully to everything that has been said and I hope I have taken careful note of the constructive contributions of different Deputies.  I might repeat that my thesis in this debate has been simple and consistent. I believe the meeting in Dublin was constructive and significant.  I am satisfied that the process initiated at that meeting and outlined in the communiqué will be of great benefit and importance in the future.</P>
      <P>I do not need to repeat the main elements of the situation as I see them: the need for Deputies and others to look primarily at the communiqué and what it states and the emphasis in it on the need to find a way forward towards peace, reconciliation and stability.  I single out for special mention the reference I made to the role of the political leaders in Northern Ireland, the special, important role I envisaged for them.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, I found Deputy Cluskey's contribution more than usually depressing.  He devoted his remarks not to the constructive aspects of the communiqueacute;, not to the forward-looking elements in it, but to endeavouring to set up some imagined disagreement between the British Prime Minister and me.  Even if such disagreement had existed, which I firmly state does not, would there be any great advantage from the point of view of the situation in emphasising and underlining it?  There would not.  I thought it more reprehensible when Deputy Cluskey devoted a considerable part of his contribution to seeking to create out of the air some disagreement.  I state categorically that no such disagreement exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer Labour Deputies particularly to the firm wording of the communiqué. There could not be anything more definite or straightforward.  The communiqué outlines a clear, positive process.  That process involves studies, not vague indefinite studies but studies on particular subjects of vital importance. The process whereby these studies will be undertaken has been outlined. <Col N="1018" /> Those studies will be followed by special consideration of them at a further meeting.</P>
    <P>That is clear-cut, definite, positive, but above all it is a process, not a final position. It now falls to us, Irish Government, British Government, parliamentarians and officials, to carry that process forward. There is not an obligation on anyone going into the process to agree with anyone else taking part in it.  It is inherent in the whole concept that people would go in with different priorities and with different emphases in their minds on different aspects.  If there was agreement in advance on where the studies would go and what the outcome would be, there would not be any need for the process.</P>
    <P>It is precisely because there is a good deal of complexity and confusion in the situation which exists in the relationships between the peoples of those islands that this process of studies followed by special consideration of their outcome is being embarked upon.  I suggest to all those who are frantically searching for disagreement and discord arising out of one of the most harmonious and constructive meetings ever held in this country between British and Irish Governments, that they should look elsewhere.  I asked at the beginning of this debate that this House would not waste its time seeking out discord but rather concentrate on the constructive elements of the communiqué, as I readily admit the Leader of the main Opposition party has done.</P>
    <P>There is no confusion whatsoever about the wording of the communiqué. It is a clear-cut, positive communiqué with precise and meticulous wording.  Is it suggested that this disagreement, this confusion, arose out of subsequent interpretation of the communiqué by different people?  If so, I reject that.  I want to repeat what I said to Deputy Harte, that I never once used the words &ldquo;confederation&rdquo; or &ldquo;federation&rdquo; nor did I ever use the word &ldquo;constitution&rdquo;.  I have in my press conference and since confined myself to talking about exactly what is in the communiqué.  I want to quote again with full agreement something the British Prime Minister said.  I listened to the <Col N="1019" /> British Prime Minister on television and I am reasonably clear that what she said was &ldquo;that we are exploring the possibility of seeing whether we can give some form of institutional expression to the unique relationship between our two countries so as to achieve both peace and stability and improve relations&rdquo;.  My recollection is that the British Prime Minister used the words &ldquo;exploring the possibility of seeing whether we can give some form of institutional expression to the unique relationship between our two countries&rdquo;. I fully agree with that.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that there is any room for anybody to suggest that there is disagreement between us on what the communiqué said, the process the communiqué initiated or on any other matter arising out of it.  There has been some attempt to correlate &ldquo;institutional&rdquo; and &ldquo;constitutional&rdquo;.  The constitutional position of Northern Ireland is one matter. I do not deny that is a matter of enormous importance and significance to me.  I do not for one moment suggest that I do not avail of every opportunity that offers itself to me to talk to British politicians and anybody else that I have an opportunity of talking to about the constitutional position of Northern Ireland. Every person in these islands in the political arena should be concerned with the constitutional position of Northern Ireland. A number of initiatives have been brought forward by the British Government in regard to the constitutional position of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We are concerned in this particular communiqueacute; with institutional structures and the possibility of creating new institutional structures, which would contribute to the objectives which we have in mind.  I do not believe there is any room for ambiguity about that and I do not believe there is any case for suggesting that there is something indeterminate about it.  Politics is concerned with political institutions and those studies will be concerned with institutions.  That is very important work.  The studies and the subsequent discussion of the outcome of the studies represents an important political process which I am quite certain will be <Col N="1020" /> of great value and importance in the future.</P>
    <P>I do not want to follow Deputy Harte down the various avenues he travelled but one thing he said struck a reminiscent chord in my mind, when he suggested that Fianna Fáil were changing their policy by virtue of what I outlined here this morning.  I recently came across a quotation from the founder of Fianna Fáil, Eamon de Valera, who said in Dáil Éireann on 7 November 1940:</P>
    <P>Now, as I have said, we want friendly relations with the people of Britain, as we want friendly relations with all other peoples, but we naturally want them with Britain because Britain is the nearest country to us on the globe. We have many relations of various kinds which make it desirable that the two peoples should live in friendship.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his offer and I am glad the Minister accepts the spirit in which I am making this contribution.</P>
      <P>The point was made by other speakers that the whole question of BIM should be looked at.  There is no point in setting up a Department of Fisheries that have no teeth to carry out their responsibilities. I know that the Ministry was set up in 1977 but for far too long fisheries has been the cinderella.  The Minister should have experts independent of BIM to advise him instead of that old war horse in Ballsbridge which has slowly ground our fisheries to a halt.  There seems to be a lack of co-operation between the Department of Fisheries and BIM.  The Minister should have the power to challenge proposals put to him backed by independent advisers.  There have always been political appointments to BIM. That nobody can deny, but it is time for a new approach.  Any approach will run into difficulties with sectional interests in the fishing industry, but the Minister should devise some positive restructuring of the whole fishing industry.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Fisheries should acquire some of the powers presently held by the Office of Public Works in relation to building piers and maintaining harbours.  The Minister should not have to wait for a report from another Department. I was privileged to hold a Government position in the Office of Public Works and I know the system is cumbersome. There should be a restructuring of the fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently a number of super trawlers were purchased in this country.  Who were the agents for these boats?  Was it <Col N="1027" /> BIM or a foreign agent and what commission did the agents get?  I am sure the Minister will agree that the agency that purchased these trawlers should have been appointed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In relation to illegal fishing, whether it is salmon or herring fishing, it looks bad for the Government of the day when a Dutch boat is caught and let off without being charged.  If my recollection is right, six Dutch boats have been captured recently and let off.  We are holding the whole patrol business up to ridicule if we cannot finish what we start.  The Minister will say that we have been advocating that these people should be apprehended, but if six Dutch trawlers have been captured and let go without prosecution in the recent past there is something wrong with the system.  Will the Minister say why prosecutions are not brought against these offenders?  The Minister can take it that these incidents are causing grave concern, dissatisfaction and disillusionment among our fishermen&mdash;that the corvette should capture somebody and that there should be no charge against him.  During the summer months the corvette captured Irish fishermen who were illegally fishing for salmon and these fishermen were prosecuted.</P>
    <P>It may be that the Minister is prevented from saying something.  I do not know enough about the Council of Ministers and there may be technicalities.  Certainly it is a crazy situation that six Dutch trawlers should be let off the hook and their captains not prosecuted when, at the same time, Irish fishermen were taken to the courts, prosecuted and their gear confiscated. Also, at the same time, Irish boats were fired on, and an Irish trawler holed, by the Irish Navy for fishing illegally. What kind of selective justice is this?  Is our Navy under specific instructions to fire on Irish boats and let Dutch boats off?  This situation has caused anger among our fishermen.  They are a small lobby, not having the muscle power of other organisations, but that is no reason for selective justice being meted out to them.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that the Leas-Cheann <Col N="1028" /> Comhairle, quoting precedent for it, will not allow me to discuss a grave national scandal.  I shall have no other option but to put down a motion of no confidence in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as far as this issue is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have studied them and see that the administration of BIM will cost £3,760,000, with an additional sum required of £24,000.  Surely, I am entitled to discuss what way BIM spent that £3,760,000 by virtue of the fact that they are short £22,000?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The ruling on this is simple.  The additional amount required is to meet the cost of pay increases, and the Deputy cannot discuss a policy on that item.  That is the ruling of the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Chair establishing a precedent on this Supplementary Estimate, that we can only discuss the £24,000 and not the £3,760,000?  I want a straight answer to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that has always been the rule.  It is not a precedent. This is only a Supplementary Estimate.  The Deputy can only discuss the supplementary amounts in the Estimate, that is all.  He can discuss the full amount on the general Estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely I could be told where their sums went wrong that they needed this money?  Where were they short, or why did they overspend?  There <Col N="1030" /> was a shortage somewhere that they had to get new money under this subhead? Surely, I am entitled to discuss that?  I thank the Minister for the invitation which he has given me to discuss some of the Parliamentary Questions where I feel that I got misleading information, not through the Minister's fault but because of the maladministration of BIM, from whom he got wrong information.</P>

      <P>Mr. Haughey: My information is that the Irish Federation of Marine Industries is the body representing boatbuilders here and they were notified of the availability of the boatyard for sale.</P>
      <P>Mr. Begley: The Minister has not answered my question.</P>
      <P>Mr. Haughey: I have no information about a newspaper advertisement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fishery and Forestry (Mr. Power)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Supplementary <Col N="1035" /> Estimate of almost £1 million needed for the Department.  It is not a supplementary budget, as some people might like to think.  It does not involve extra taxation. It merely involves getting money we need because we spent more in the year than we had hoped to spend.</P>
      <P>Deputy White said he did not agree with the Estimate and that he was disappointed with it.  I did not get any indication as to what he did not agree with. Was it the extra wages that were granted in the national understanding?  Was he disappointed with the national understanding, because he would be one of the very few who could be disappointed about that?</P>
      <P>Extra travelling and subsistence allowances are mentioned.  If the Fisheries, Forestry and Wildlife Department was not involved in travelling, they might as well shut their doors, because to run the Department properly an intense amount of travelling is needed.  I am confident that the travelling involved helped the efficiency of the Department.</P>
      <P>Extra work was done in the fishery harbours.  I am sure nobody is disappointed about that.  I am delighted to bring in this this Estimate.  It is not entirely attributable to additional costs. Much of the £674,000 is being paid for extra works done, particularly in Howth, where considerably more progress was achieved than we originally anticipated. About 20 per cent more work was done, not money spent, but work done in Howth, than we had thought of at the start of the year.  Deputies are entitled to ask what I did.  It is not just on paper, it is not confetti money as some people called it, the works are there to be seen. £3,674,000 was spent on harbour works in progress in 1980.  Considerably more is listed for 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not all has been spent on big harbours. Much has also been done for the small harbours.  There is an idea abroad that money is only spent on the main fishery harbour centres.  Small harbours are not neglected.  I will prove that, if Deputies wish.  I regret that many of the contributors on the opposite side are not here to hear the true facts.  I thank the two Members <Col N="1036" /> who have stayed; one was so anxious that he would have contributed again. Some of the others contributed their inky pellets and got the publicity and they are not here now to hear the facts.</P>
    <P>In any event, last year we anticipated an expenditure of £3,674,000 which was spent in Howth, Castletownbere, Killybegs, Caherciveen, Dromatoor, Fenit, Frenchport, Oileán na gCaorach, on an oysterbed in Sneem, in Skerries, Travarra, Aughrish, Ballycrovane, Bunagee and Trá Bhad.  In the coming year we will be spending money in Killybegs, Green-castle, Cladagh na gCaoireach and other places.</P>

      <P>I will come to Ballycotton when I am dealing with the Deputy's contribution.  He was very hard on me when he asked me to carry out works in Ballycotton to be completed before the bad weather this year.  Nobody could do that.  The impossible we might do immediately, but miracles would take a bit of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fox mentioned the silting in Skerries harbour and complimented us on the work we have done in Howth, and I agree that it is a very good job.  We cannot do everything at once, and I am aware of the particular problems of Skerries and Balbriggan.  Only last week I met a deputation from the Town Commissioners there.  Deputies from the area should be aware that the Dublin Port and Docks Board are responsible for both Skerries and Balbriggan.  I am not at all happy with their attitude.  They cannot wash their hands of these two ports as they might like to do.  It would be comparable to CIE saying that because the city service is paying they will run that and that the rural areas can do without a service.  Unfortunately the interior harbour at Balbriggan has been closed to boats of a certain size as a result of an order by the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  My predecessor, Deputy Lenihan, made a commitment with regard to lights and water and the resurfacing of the pier area.  We will honour that and I will bear in mind what Deputy Fox said <Col N="1037" /> in offering his help in the locality, and the help of anybody who can influence the Dublin Port and Docks Board will be appreciated.</P>
    <P>Deputy White raised the matter of the hiring of boats for the herring studies in the Celtic Sea which cost us £30,000 extra.  Research is the responsibility of member States and not of the EEC directly.  No grants have been paid to us for herring research in the Celtic Sea up to now, but proposals are at present under consideration which would include provisions covering grants to member states for research.  For instance, there was a joint study in the Mourne Sea by the EEC, the northern part of Ireland, Great Britain and Ireland and there was a subsidy for that.  Hopefully the hiring that we now have to undergo every year will not be necessary when we have our own exploratory fishing vessel.  The order was placed with Verolme for this.  We recognise the need for research; we have acted on it and have filled that need and the boat will be in the course of construction during next year.  When it will be delivered I am not sure, but provision will be made for that in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>Deputy White assumed too that the Galway fishery made a loss during the year because it is mentioned in the supplementary. The real reason was that £20,000 more for extra wages and rates was required because we are responsible to the County Council for the payment of the rates.  In 1980 we spent £45,000 on the Galway fishery, and that includes the £20,000 we are now talking about.  The estimated income from it is £65,000 made up mostly of returns from salmon and eels.  It was a very far-sighted move to purchase this fishery for the State, and it is a credit to the Department and the Minister who made the decision to buy it. It is one of our success stories.  Hopefully we will continue to acquire fisheries whenever we can.</P>
    <P>Deputy White seemed to lead the keeners who bemoaned the state of the industry and called this a disastrous period.  I have listened for some time to this litany of woe which has been poured out so piteously by the Opposition spokesmen. Unfortunately I did not hear <Col N="1038" /> any sensible or helpful solutions from them as to what we might do.  We are all very much aware of the difficulties that face the fishing industry, but no member state in the EEC has made greater efforts to assist the industry than we have.  When the price of fish fell this year we were the first country to look for a speedy meeting with Commissioner Gundelach to highlight the problems caused by imports of cheap fish from third countries.  When others were looking for a suspension of the levies ours was the first and loudest voice raised in support of having the levies on our imports brought up to the maximum.  Other member states have now joined us and our efforts have borne fruit.</P>
    <P>We pressed for the retention of export refunds on frozen mackerel, and that is a very big boon to our exporters, particularly to Nigeria.  Our attitude has been to exert pressure to ensure that, when the market is weakened and in need of urgent remedial action, this is taken more quickly than has been the case up to now and that when priority areas for immediate action are identified at Council quickly than has been the case up to now and that when priority areas for immediate action are identified at Council level, when we need increases in withdrawal and reference prices, we should take action immediately to curb third country imports.  We have adopted a very tough line on tariff concessions.  We have pressed for competitive levels on fish withdrawls of up to 90 per cent of the withdrawal prices.  We realise that these are important matters that we must take a serious view of if our market is not to be placed in jeopardy.  I believe that the steps that we have advocated have now been conceded by the Commission and will take effect during the coming year. We believe too, although the Commission does not agree, that there may be a possibility that reference prices could be agreed more than once in the year; they say that the start of the year is the time for doing that, but we say there might be a possibility of having them agreed every six months and that reference prices should be higher than, rather than equal to, withdrawal prices.</P>
    <P>We have, as some members did not seem to understand, a withdrawal price for certain species of fish, including <Col N="1039" /> salmon, but we feel that the list of the more common species is a bit restricted and we want to extend it to include further species.  Those are things that we have pressed for and which the Commission have agreed to.  There is a possibility that there might be a storage premium of up to 50 per cent for the withdrawal price of fish where we would have a 50 per cent subsidy for storage of fish at a certain time.  Some people may say that this would lead to a fish mountain and might distort the market later on when supplies become available, but it is something we should look for.  We need to safeguard ourselves against low cost third country imports.  In particular we need some mechanism at Community level for speedier action than has been evidenced up to now.  What has been gained is the result of pressure that we have brought during the year, and it has borne fruit.</P>
    <P>In regard to the limits, there is no question of us accepting less than the 12 miles agreed in the common fisheries policy. Our aim is to get an exclusive zone. We are not prepared to say how many miles now because this is still the subject of negotiation and the phasing out of traditional rights is involved.  Special arrangements are being sought for our coastal fishermen outside the exclusive zone to be agreed.  Our aim is to get the very best possible deal for Irishmen.  I have consulted with my British colleagues and our interests are complementary. They have agreed that the Hague areas of preference deserves preference. They too would like to become part of this agreement in north Britain.</P>
    <P>Only yesterday I had to speak to a delegation from France and I have arranged to meet them before the next meeting to discuss our attitudes and how we can be helpful to each other before the fishery meeting which takes place on Monday and Tuesday next.  Deputy White said that we should act now, as if we alone had the exclusive right to decide everything inside the 12 mile zone.  We have no right to decide that; no other member state has the right to decide that. But we have succeeded in getting Spain to renounce its traditional rights inside <Col N="1040" /> the 12 mile zone.  Our long-term objective is along these lines and to get preferential fishing plans accepted and preferential treatment in the outside zones.</P>
    <P>Deputy White accused me of not having enough drive and determination and Deputy Treacy in his more pedantic way accused me of inactivity.  I can say without fear of contradiction that as fisheries spokesman for Ireland's cause abroad I have spoken out fearlessly and unequivocally. I have used and will continue to use every method at my disposal to further Ireland's welfare.  I know that my predecessor, Deputy Lenihan, did the same and gained very noteworthy and tangible benefits for the fishing industry. It might be no harm to give to Deputies in the opposite benches a few home truths.  The Parliamentary Secretary who had direct responsibility for the fishing industry during the term of the National Coalition was Deputy M.P. Murphy. This was a time when the fishing industry was regarded as an adjunct to agriculture. When he went abroad to represent Ireland he was completely silent.  Not once was he heard to speak on Ireland's behalf and he may well have felt that he could leave it to the Fine Gael Deputies.  Perhaps he felt he had no mandate, as happened at the Labour Party Conference in Cork on the question of divorce.</P>
    <P>This is the Deputy who suggested that because I was a landlubber I had no business in the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.  I may not represent a maritime constituency but when I go abroad to represent Ireland I am no mute swan. Opposition speakers say that I failed in not securing a 50-mile limit but none of the other nine Ministers has secured a 50-mile limit, so perhaps they have failed too.  I must deal in fact rather than fantasy and I have a fair idea that I am reasonably in accord with fishermen.  They may have their grumbles but they will agree that the things we are both seeking are not poles apart.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have referred to the closure of the Celtic Sea and I must confess that the continued closure is as big a disappointment to me as to the fishermen. I had high hopes that we would get <Col N="1041" /> a limited opening this year.  The early scientific evidence looked good but the recommendation from the scientific and technical committee dealing with fisheries was that the Celtic Sea should continue to be closed.  I made a very big issue of this matter at EEC level and I often feel that scientists do not take social and economic factors into account.  We had the matter raised again but in spite of the examination and the options we sought we did not succeed.  Scientists may say that the best way to get to the magic target of a stock of 40,000 tons is by not allowing any fishing for four years.  We feel that if a limited amount is taken out each year and the target reached in seven years two objectives could be fulfilled by taking social and economic factors into account.  We received support from our Dutch colleagues and from Denmark. We first suggested a limited opening with a small tack and when this was unsuccessful we suggested that the opening be confined to boats under 50 feet.  The final option, on which we have not yet given up, is that we may have a January opening. I believe that there is scope for these openings without nullifying the chances of recruitment and re-generation to the required stock.  The door is not finally closed and we will try again on Monday and Tuesday next for a limited opening of the Celtic Sea for herring fishing.  I agree with those who have made a special case in favour of small boatmen and these are the people who would have first priority on my list because they deserve our co-operation.</P>
    <P>It is pleasing to know that catches of mackerel have never been as good as this year.  This is not confined to bigger boats in Donegal but applies also in Kerry.  I have been told that off Dingle during the past week two 75 feet boats caught 480 cran of mackerel, so much that they had to cut their nets and let half go.</P>
    <P>Deputy White wants greater surveillance and would like a Naval Service vessel to be based permanently in Donegal. The Donegal people did not mention this to me but perhaps Deputy White would pursue the point.  We can solicit the help of naval vessels &mdash; and it has <Col N="1042" /> been given very generously &mdash; but we cannot tell them how they should help us.  We can leave the matter of seamanship to them.  They are active and this is proved by the arrest of a Dutch vessel since Deputy White raised the matter last week.  We have an EEC grant for fishery protection.  Two more Naval Service vessels are now on order and aircraft spotters and helicopters will be used to pinpoint offenders.  Some years ago a court in Yorkshire accepted aerial evidence of poaching and this would be very helpful. It often happens that poachers have moved off before a fishery protection vessel can get to them.</P>
    <P>Many speakers were certain that only foreign boats are poaching.  The personnel of the Naval Service have boarded them and I will give details later.  There is a difficulty in deciding whether frozen blocks of fish are mackerel or herring.  In more than 20 boardings of Dutch boats there has not been one illegal herring on board.</P>
    <P>Deputies raised the matter of allowing foreign fishermen a 5 or 10 per cent bi-catch of herring when fishing for mackerel. Although I am assured that they can differentiate between these on their sonar equipment, before they catch them, many of them wait for the final shot and direct it specifically at herring before heading for home.  We closed that door during the year by doing away with the bi-catch.  If Deputies have evidence of poaching they should let us know.  I compliment the Naval Service on their co-operation and it would be very wrong to say that they have directed their attention solely to Irish boats and have not harassed foreign vessels.</P>

      <P>Deputy White mentioned the possibility of an EEC allowance because of our distance from the markets. It would be very difficult to make such a case because our fishermen are in such close proximity to the fishing grounds, whereas foreign fishermen must possibly travel for a day before reaching the fish and lose another day returning to <Col N="1043" /> base.  It would be difficult to make a case for special consideration at EEC level.</P>

      <P>Deputy White also referred to appointments to regional boards and said his experience was confined to boards in his own area.  He felt that all the appointees were Fianna Fáil supporters.  I did not ask the appointees what their allegiance was.  I can only say that the recent election in Donegal led me to believe that if one added the percentage of the real Fianna Fáil supporters and Independent Fianna Fáil supporters it would come to a total of 73 per cent.  It is only fair and reasonable to assume that this percentage would be reflected in the people on the fishery board.  I am prepared to believe there are Fine Gael people on the board. I am not so sure about the Labour Party because they did not put a candidate forward in Donegal to let us have an idea of the confidence of Donegal people in the Labour Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been much talk about the maximum number of commercial salmon licences issued this year. Much has been made of the fact that it is less than the maximum prescribed in previous years.  The Order was made in 1972-73.  A certain number of licenses <Col N="1045" /> were taken up but in some areas the number of people who applied for them &mdash; Letterkenny is one area and Waterford is another &mdash; was much less than the number available.  In that event we have not offered the number that was previously available but it is greater than the number of licences taken out in 1980.  We have alloved a certain tolerance for hardship cases.  We have cut back in the cause of conservation but I do not think any hardship will be caused.  I share with Deputies opposite a desire for the conservation of salmon.  Licences that were not taken up last year will not be issued in some cases, but there is a tolerance to provide for cases of genuine hardship.</P>
      <P>It has been said that we should devote more of our time to rearing smolts.  The return rate for smolts reared artificially is in the region of 2 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>My scientific experts tell me it is 2 per cent.  Perhaps they return to Donegal to a greater degree.  In Oregon they have a system of release and recapture and their return rate is only .2 of 1 per cent.  The rearing of salmon has not proved to be a great boon.  As a matter of fact, the dumping of caged salmon from Norway may have helped to depress the price.  We should aim for a natural escapement upriver to the natural spawning grounds, because that is the best way of conserving salmon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donnellan raised the matter of the Galway oyster fishery.  The powers of acquisition included in the Fisheries Act relate to inland fisheries.  We could not invoke these powers to acquire private oyster fisheries such as the St. George fishery which was reported recently to have been sold to a French group.  To a certain extent this is private property and the right of establishment maintains here. I hope that an Irishman going to Brittany would get the same treatment as we would afford any member of the Community. Of course we can revoke an order if the oyster fishery is not properly used.  The central board or the regional boards have no function under the Act to <Col N="1046" /> develop oyster fisheries or to acquire them for development.  However, for the purpose of convenience we have given specific powers in the Act to protect oyster fisheries.  We can appoint waterkeepers and so on.</P>
    <P>With regard to acquculture and mariculture, I should like to inform the House that BIM and my Department have liaised with the Fishery Research Centre at Abbotstown and have pursued many new projects during the year.  There are projects under way at Mulroy Bay, Cork, Kerry and Killary for scallops, mussels, the cage rearing of salmon and rainbow trout.  Orders are made by my Department every week designating new areas. However, we must adopt a policy of <i>festina lente</i> in such cases.  We do not want people to rush in with a very large investment. We want them to avoid pitfalls, and there are dangers that we must point out.  To get the maximum price, mussels must be put on the market at a certain time of the year &mdash; especially in France &mdash; and unless they are put on the market at that time one gets a very low price for the product.  We want to help people to avoid their getting into such a situation. If a risk has to be taken we want things done on an experimental scale before it gets to the point where they are truly commercial.</P>

They realise this too.  Deputy Tully asked why Mornington Fish Products Limited closed.  It closed because there was not enough raw material to keep it going.  There was a time when many small herrings were used there.  Some white fish found its way there too but with the closure of the Celtic Sea and the bigger mesh being use for white fish in the Irish Sea, the raw material ran out.  This is a great loss to the area.  I know of a pet food manufacturer in Dublin who used to go to Mornington for fish but he now has to go to Killybegs.  I cannot see much opportunity of Mornington reopening unless the supply position improves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Deasy asked if Bord lascaigh Mhara had outlived their usefulness.  I look on BIM as an important part of the Department doing excellent work.  With regard to training and giving loans, many people have gained great benefits from the activities of BIM.  They put a mobile training unit on the road this year at Greencastle, which hopefully will find its way to all the important, and less important, ports throughout the country.  BIM have been inundated with requests for this mobile unit which can give modern sophisticated training in capsule form to fishermen of all ages.  BIM have been engaged in helping the processing industry in Killybegs and Castletownbere where there is a joint project with a Spanish <Col N="1048" /> firm, which has been in production and will open this year.</P>
    <P>Prices for fish are not as high as we would like, although there have been increases recently.  It can be said that we have made wonderful strides in our fishing industry and BIM have played a very important part in that, and still have a part to play.  When other European countries look to BIM as a model of what they might do with their industries, and countries as far away as Tasmania look for help and guidance from our industry, it would be wrong for us to belittle the efforts of BIM.</P>
    <P>The chairman and chief executive decided to leave BIM at his own wish. When he leaves he can look back on a job very well done.  He will not be looking back after four-and-a-half years in office, like some Deputies opposite who were put out of office when the people decided they did not do their job well.  Anyone who takes the trouble, as Deputy Begley did, to acquire a copy of BIM's report will see that BIM are anxious to help the fishermen on the home market and abroad.</P>

      <P>BIM helped to push up the <i>per capita</i> consumption of fish at home with market information, advertising and publicity, sales promotion, consumer education, training courses and so on. They have also helped in the export market and fisheries development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Deasy asked what we were doing about hake.  BIM have applied themselves specifically to that question and have encouraged fishermen to acquire the equipment to fish for hake. They have also provided investments for promotion at home and abroad and I am very confident that their work at all levels is excellent in every way.  They are not prepared to sit on their oars.  They look around for new worlds to conquer and <Col N="1049" /> new markets that might be open to them. I would like to pay tribute to the work of BIM and in particular to the chairman and chief executive who is leaving with a clean sheet.</P>
    <P>The BIM decision to sell the boatyards in Dingle, Killybegs and Baltimore was very wise.  They were losing £1 million every year.  We have three viable yards there now, and none more so than the yard in Dingle, which I have not visited yet but hope to visit around Christmas.</P>

I would prefer to see these boats built at home, and hopefully this will come about.  At present there is a project in Killybegs where an all-Irish steel hull boat will be fishing this year, manned by an Irish crew.  This may help educate Irish fishermen to the <Col N="1051" /> value of boats built at home.  I should like to assure the House also that, with regard to our attitude to bringing in the Navy to help us in naval and fishing surveillance, we make no distinction between foreign and native boats.</P>

      <P>A rate of surcharge, which is adjusted each month, is imposed in agreement with the National Prices Commission.

      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister indicated that the National Prices Commission monthly report agrees with the imposition of a surcharge to take account of the difference between sterling and the IR£, do I take it that the <Col N="1057" /> surcharge manages now and again to reduce the price of such magazines? When, therefore, did the last reduction happen to take account of the fluctuation in the value of the IR£?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism whether he is aware of the serious problems faced by hotel and guesthouse owners in meeting rate bills and other outgoings after a poor tourist season and if he has any proposals to relieve the situation to enable them to remain in business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the implication in the Deputy's question that the tourist industry is having a bad year.  Preliminary indications at this stage would suggest that total tourism revenue, that is out of State tourism plus home holidays for the year, will be of the order of £540 million &mdash; an increase of 16 per cent over 1979.  Given the depth of the international recession and the other problems the industry is having to cope with, I would regard an outturn of this order as satisfactory in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My information is that while the hotel &mdash; guesthouse sector did better for the <Col N="1058" /> first half of 1980 compared to 1979, occupancy rates for the peak period have declined because of a number of factors. However, neither my Department nor, I am told, Bord Fáilte, have received any particular requests for special relief.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that the wording of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1885 and the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861 are identical in every word with those laws found to be in contravention of European national law by the court in Strasbourg; and, if so, if he accordingly intends to repeal these laws and thereby shorten the inevitable legal process involved in their repeal through the European Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 13 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy appears to be misinformed in regard to the proceedings mentioned in the questions.  No decision such as that referred to has been made by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The European Commission of Human Rights, which is a separate body, have expressed certain opinions in relation to provisions in the legislation referred to in the questions as they apply in the North of Ireland.  The report of the Commission on the case in question has been referred to the European Court and the decision of that court is awaited.</P>
      <P>If and when I have proposals for amendment of the law in this area.  I will announce them in the ordinary way.</P>
      <P>In regard to another part of the questions, I am aware that a particular organisation has put forward such a view in terms that make clear that it was an expression of opinion.  No evidence has been supplied to me in support of the proposition that the present law is a causative factor in suicides.  If such evidence is presented I shall, of course, consider it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that it would not be in the public interest to disclose information about any particular type of firearm carried by the Garda Síochána or to specify its capabilities.  It is not for me, as Minister for Justice, to assess or pronounce on the merits of one type of firearm as against another either in the context of efficiency or safety but I am informed by the Garda authorities that they are satisfied that the firearms carried by members of the force are suitable for use in public places.</P>
      <P>The members of the Garda Síochána who are authorised to carry firearms have detailed instructions as to the circumstances in which the firearms may be used, whether in public places or otherwise, those instructions have always been treated as confidential but I can say that they are intended to ensure that the use of firearms by the Garda will always be restricted to circumstances where the use is lawful and that they are also designed to promote a highly developed awareness of the responsibility, in human terms, attaching even to the lawful use of firearms.</P>
      <P>Neverthless, having regard to the increases in armed crime in recent years which has necessitated an increase in the numbers of members of the force to whom firearms are issued, it is only prudent to have a fresh and very careful look at the instructions to see if any changes would be desirable and that is being done now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister remembers the case of a man who was shot standing waiting for a bus.  I appreciate the difficulties regarding these cases but at the same time there is considerable <Col N="1068" /> public disquiet.  Would the Minister agree that in the North of Ireland the people know the instructions given to the Military there on yellow cars?  Is it not comparable to that?  In those circumstances should the public not know the conditions under which they may be shot by a member of the security forces?</P>

      <P>Execution by hanging is a particularly barbarous practice accepted generally as such by most civilised countries in western Europe and, while it is an issue which divides parties not only in the Dáil, would the Minister agree that the time has come for reconsideration of the desirability of retaining the power to carry out judicial murder by hanging&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The answer is no, I do not propose to change the present law or put any proposals before the Government regarding it.  If changes were to come about I would have to put proposals to the Government.  This I have not done and until such time as any proposals that would have been put to the Government would have been considered there would have been no public utterance on it from me.</P>

      <P>Is it a fact that at the time of the passage of this Act the present Taoiseach, then Deputy Haughey, was opposed to capital punishment?  Would the Minister not find that he had somebody who was sympathetic to the proposal to get rid of this appalling practice in our country, one of the many appalling practices which we seem to retain in spite of changes in the rest of the world?</P>

      <P>As I have indicated in reply to a previous question from the Deputy, the number of gardaí assigned to particular areas is a matter primarily for the Garda authorities and the number is reviewed from time to time to take account of changing needs and circumstances.  I am informed by the Commissioner that two additional gardaí were allocated to Waterford city on 28 November and that another additional garda took up duty there on 10 December.  The current Garda strength allocated to the stations in the county area is the maximum that can be provided at present having regard to overall resources and other demands on Garda services.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that this is the largest quantity of drugs that has been seized in the history of the State?  Is the Minister aware of reports that indicate that heroin is now the cheapest drug on the Irish drugs scene?  What extra facilities does the Minister intend to give to Detective Sergeant Mullins and his force to counteract this detrimental drug pushing effort?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the most common drug seized was cannabis, of which seizures amounting to an estimated value of £1,600,000 were made.  Cannabis resin accounted for an estimated £100,000 worth of seizures and cannabis plants for £80,000 worth.  I understand that in July £40,000 worth of cannabis was seized coming into Dublin airport, and two Irish nationals have been charged and are awaiting trial.  On 11 November at Rosslare cannabis resin to the approximate value of £70,000 was seized and one Irish national is being charged as of now.</P>
      <P>I should like to repeat what I said when replying to the Estimate for the Department of Justice, that I am truly concerned about the drugs situation in this country and will do everything I can to make sure it is arrested.  I have asked the Commissioner to give it top priority and to inquire specifically into statements in newspapers by a person or persons unknown who say that the drug squad is not at the strength it should be.  It is the Commissioner's responsibility to see that whatever strength can or should be given to the drug squad is given.</P>

      <P>The report referred to in the Question consists of an anonymous letter on which I do not think it necessary to comment except to say that I am informed that the assaults which the anonymous writer claims to have witnessed have not been reported to the gardaí.</P>
      <P>However, it is a fact that there has been a recent development whereby rival groups or gangs of young boys and girls have been congregating in the Grafton Street &mdash; St. Stephen's Green area on Sunday afternoons.  Except on one occasion where some bottle-throwing took place, this has not, to the knowledge of the gardaí, led to any significant violence, though there has been unruly behaviour of a kind that would be liable to frighten other passers-by.</P>
      <P>As a result of this development, Garda patrolling in the area has been intensified, with extra foot patrols and mobile patrols by various Garda units being provided.  The Garda operation has been largely succesful, and the numbers of the young people involved have decreased considerably.</P>
      <P>A more recent development has been that some of the same groups have taken to joining up with other demonstrations and to shouting slogans in line with those being used by the other demonstrators. As there are large numbers of people in that area on Sunday afternons, apart from the groups to whom I have referered, the situation requires careful handling. The gardaí will continue to pay close attention to it as long as that is necessary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The gardaí have no knowledge of the incidents alleged in the letter, which is an anonymous one.  The general picture presented by the letter of serious disorder in the area and of no Garda presence is false.  The gardaí say that skinheads, punk rockers, teddy boys and hell's angels have been frequenting the Dandelion Market area of St. Stephen's Green on Sunday afternons.  I understand that gangs of 13 to 15 year olds run up and down Grafton Street for fun.  Also present are members of the religious Hare Krishna sect who play drums, cymbals and so on.  H-Block youth have held meetings at the top of Grafton Street on two recent Sundays and found following there from the group referred to as skinheads.  I understand the youths march from St. Stephen's Green down Grafton Street to O'Connell Street chanting and shouting political slogans. The main Garda objective has been to separate the different factions in order to avoid serious disorder.  Garda patrolling has been intensified with extra foot patrols, mobile patrols by the crime task force, traffic motor cycles and by the dog unit.  The various groups move from place to place when requested and have not shown aggression to the gardaí.  The result of the Garda operations has been a decrease in the number of youths attending in the areas mentioned, and the gardaí hope that when the Dandelion Market closes after Christmas, as is expected, this problem will be discontinued.</P>

They have informed me that, having regard to overall resources and other demands on Garda services, they are not at present in a position to increase the current strength of one garda at Carbury.  While, as stated in reply to previous questions, it is proposed to assign a sergeant to the centre as soon as circumstances permit, I am informed that it has not yet been possible to do so due to more urgent needs elsewhere.

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that during the four months ended 30 November the number of members transferred permanently to the Donegal Division was 29.  During the same period, 407 members were transferred temporarily to the Division for special duties which related almost exclusively to a series of events requiring Garda attention during the month of August. These events included the Fleadh Cheoil in Buncrana, the hotel fire in Bundoran and the murder of a UDR man in Pettigo.</P>
      <P>I understand that the number of permanent transfers represents 33 per cent of the number of such transfers to the Division in the 12 months ended 30 November 1980, and that apart from the temporary transfers which I have mentioned, there were no other temporary transfers to the Division in that 12 month period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the figures which the Minister has given, particularly the 33 per cent, which is very high, and also in view of the fact that the Association of Garda Inspectors and Sergeants have stated that morale is dangerously low in the Garda, does he accept that this extraordinary percentage of transfers, linked in some degree with the by-election in Donegal, could breed cynicism about the reasons why the Department and the Garda Commissioner are transferring gardaí?

      <P>The members of &ldquo;offences against the person&rdquo; in the years 1977, 1978 and 1979 were 2,063, 2,266 and 2,326 respectively.  Although the figures show an upward trend, the percentage increase from year to year has fallen. In 1977 the increase as against the previous year was over 20 per cent, in 1978 it was under 10 per cent and in 1979 it was less than 3 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the crimes in this category <Col N="1080" /> such as assaults, unlawful woundings, manslaughter, murder etc., occur most often within family or other close groupings and, because of their nature, they are not regarded by the Garda as preventable by Garda action.  Because of that, the Garda authorities state that Garda success in this area can be measured only in terms of detection rates, which in fact are very high, varying from over 87 per cent in 1977 to over 91 per cent in 1979.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that, in these circumstances, the introduction of special measures directed towards this particular type of crime would not be warranted or useful at present.</P>

In regard to the other part of the question, the Deputy will agree that I dealt at length with a number of areas in which we are making improvements and hoping to bring about better results when I spoke for one-and-a-half hours on 30 November last.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice when he intends to increase the number of gardaí in north Dublin Garda stations, in view of the fact that, according to figures supplied by him in the Dáil, the number of gardaí stationed in inner city Garda stations between 1976 and 1980 has remained static despite increases in crime and population rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unable to see the connection between, on the one hand, figures relating to Garda strength at stations in the inner city, which, of course, includes stations in both the north and south sides of the city centre and, on the other hand, figures relating to stations in north Dublin, which must be taken to refer to stations throughout the whole of the north city area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At all events, the Deputy is incorrect in his interpretation of the figures which I gave in the Dáil on 22 April last, in relation to Garda strength at inner city stations because, in fact, those figures showed that in all but one case there had been increases in strength between 1 April 1976 and 1 April 1980.  The combined strength of the six stations concerned <Col N="1085" /> showed an increase of 54 or more than 6 per cent over that period.</P>
    <P>Garda strength in north city stations increased by 102, or more than 11 per cent between 31 December 1976 and 30 November 1980.  As regards the question of further increases in strength at these stations, the position is that the deployment of Garda manpower is primarily a matter for the Garda authorities, who keep the situation under regular review in the light of changing needs and circumstances. I am informed that as recently as 28 November the number of members in north Dublin stations was increased by nine and that further increases will be considered according as additional manpower becomes available.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that manpower figures by themselves can be misleading without reference to the additional patrols being performed on an overtime basis and which have resulted in a significant increase in the number of men on the beat in these areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply and the question unanswered which I have in front of me, does he accept the facts as quoted by him on 22 April this year in the house that on 1 April 1975 there were 926 gardaí in six city centres stations and on 1 April 1980 there were 940, an increase of 14, less than 14 per cent?  In view of the increasing crime pattern in the city and in view of the increasing population trend during those years, does he accept that there has not been in real terms any increase in the number of gardaí despite all the wringing of hands there has been about crime in this area?</P>

      <P>The fact is that Garda strength in the north city stations has increased by 102 between 31 December 1976 and 30 November 1980.  I am informed that as recently as 28 November <Col N="1086" /> there was a further increase of nine men there and that further increases will be considered when people are trained.  The Deputy knows full well that a new scheme put into operation by the Garda in Dublin with regard to increased beat tolerance, and which got under way in July, has been exceptionally successful in dealing with vandalism and also exceptionally costly.  We are very thankful to the members of the force who give up their free day to come in and work at awkward hours when they are called on.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for <Col N="1087" /> Justice if he has under consideration the setting up of a separate Garda traffic unit whose function would be to supervise the enforcement of traffic laws and regulations, in view of the concentration of the Garda on the more serious forms of crime and of the serious problem of growing traffic disorder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to a similar question by the Deputy on 8 May 1979 there is already within the Garda Siochána a special Traffic Corps with a unit in every Garda Division, which has special responsibility in relation to the enforcement of the law relating to road traffic.  I do not consider that there would be any advantage to be gained by setting up a completely separate unit in the force to deal solely with the enforcement of the law relating to road traffic.</P>
      <P>As regards the relief of traffic congestion and the enforcement of the parking regulations, the position is that under the Local Authorities (Traffic Wardens) Act, 1975, it is open to any local authority to establish a separate traffic warden service which would release gardaí for other duties.  While 13 local authorities in the larger centres have established such a service, the corporations in Dublin and Cork declined to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year, the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána resumed control of the enforcement of the parking regulation in Dublin, which Dublin Corporation had been operating on an agency basis.  At present, the enforcement of the parking regulations in Dublin is being carried out by a combination of gardaí and traffic wardens.  There are both full-time and part-time traffic wardens and the number of wardens is being increased to bring it up to the equivalent of 100 full-time personnel. At present there are 47 full-time and 48 part-time traffic wardens on duty in Dublin.  It is expected that a further 25 full-time wardens will be operational by 15 December.  This increase in the manpower allocated to the enforcement of the parking regulations should result in a substantial improvement in the flow of traffic through the city and the effectiveness <Col N="1088" /> of the measures being taken in the matter will be kept under review</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedure for the issue of warrants by the Minister for Justice for the monitoring of telephone calls has been outlined to the House on a number of occasions &mdash; warrants are issued only when this is necessary for security purposes or for the prevention or detection of serious crime, information as to which could be got in no other way.  They have been issued by every Minister for Justice with the knowledge and approval of every Government since the foundation of the State.</P>
      <P>As recently as 28 February this year in the course of replying to supplementary questions I indicated to the House that it would not be a matter for me to express views as to what might or might not be in line with the views of the European Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed at the Minister's reply.  Are the criteria referred to in part two of the question in existence and available to the House, that is the criteria on which warrants may be issued on request to him?  Secondly, does he accept that where there is telephone tapping it is undertaken only after warrants have been obtained or does he refute categorically allegations made in the current issue of <i>Magill?</i>  I should be grateful for two clear answers to those questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the first part of the question, I have indicated clearly the criteria that apply in regard to the issuing of warrants by the Minister for Justice.  Warrants are issued only in cases in which there is no other way of getting information that is required for security purposes or for the prevention or detection of serious crime.  In relation to an application from the Garda, there must be a certificate from the Commissioner or from his deputy that both conditions are fulfilled, namely, that the warrant is required for security purposes or for the prevention or detection of serious crime and that the information cannot be obtained in any other way.  If an application were to be made on behalf of Military Intelligence, the certificate as to the need for a warrant would have to be signed by the Director of Military Intelligence and would have to be backed personally by the Minister for Defence before I would issue a warrant.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £982,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1980, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Fisheries and <Col N="1115" /> Forestry, including sundry grants-in-aid.</P>

      <P>In his contribution, Deputy Deasy remarked that the herring survey being conducted in the Celtic Sea should have been undertaken 20 years ago.  Perhaps that is correct, but it is easy to be wise with hindsight and very few people would have made that statement 20 years ago.  It could be said also that in the present situation, when mackerel is in abundance, a survey might be needed now.  This is a situation we are monitoring. We are not talking about mature mackerel that are caught off our coasts but we are very concerned that the small juvenile mackerel off the coast of Cornwall would not be fished out.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deasy said also that the development of the Irish fishing industry has been a successive failure.  He did not entirely blame us for this because he was noble enough to say that the lack of will on the part of every successive Government, none more so than the present, have been the cause of this failure.  The doleful dirge of the Deputy reminds me of Hanrahan who said that we would all be ruined before the year was out, except that Hanrahan was only in the halfpenny place where Deputy Deasy is concerned. It might be well to remember that Disraeli said once that it is easy to be critical at the expense of being correct.  Deputy White, too, might take that lesson to heart.  He claimed that our imports of fish were running as high as our exports of this commodity.  I would remind him that the value of our imports of fish in 1979 was £16.1 million whereas the value of our exports was more than twice that amount at £32.2 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Deasy spoke also of many thousands of disillusioned fishermen.  I doubt if there are thousands of fishermen, not to mention disillusioned fishermen. However, I met fishermen at Dunmore East who had some complaints to make and some disappointment to express, but I did not get any impression of disillusionment <Col N="1116" /> or of despair among them.  I did not find any sign of despair either among the fishermen in Donegal.  Mackerel are now being sold at £100 per ton and up to £120 in some cases.  That is the position not only in Killybegs but elsewhere. Sprat, too, which are to be found all around our coasts, are very lucrative.</P>
    <P>The person who said we have 400 boats on loans on the BIM list and who referred to the colossal failure rate I would refer to a previous Government in which three Ministers were removed not alone from office but from the Dáil.  In regard to money owed on boats, BIM will look at every case individually and will recast the loan up to three times if they feel that there is an opportunity of paying.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy sought an intervention system for fish.  We have such an intervention system which applies to the main species.  We have endeavoured to get the species enlarged and to improve the price paid to fishermen.  Deputy Deasy also referred to scientific information in regard to species of fish being available to us.  The Deputy referred to the Spaniards who fished particularly for hake. One sometimes wonders at the merits of these surveys.  West Germany, East Germany and some of the Communist countries have carried out surveys in regard to the incidence of blue whiting off our coasts.  This is an industrial fish very rich in protein but very hard to process and I am not so sure if we should devote our resources to this when we find it hard enough to sell whiting and cod which we can catch.  Scientific information available to ICES is made available to us.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy also referred to the problem of French illegal fishing and asked me to raise it at EEC level.  I would refer the Deputy to a recent RTE programme which would help to highlight our situation.  We do not have to go to Boulogne to find illegal fishermen.  I would be a bigger fool than Deputy Deasy thinks if I were to talk at EEC level about illegal fishing and what we are doing.</P>
    <P>In relation to our attitude to the arrest of the Dutch vessel recently, on Monday last a Dutch vessel was arrested off Donegal.  The vessel was not observed by the Navy but its illegal fishing was <Col N="1117" /> reported by Killybegs skippers who alleged that the Dutch vessel was fishing inside of 12 miles and had cut their nets. The vessel did not at first stop when the Navy challenged them.  They were charged with illegal entry and obstruction but, following a ruling by the High Court that the skipper and crew should be released, I understand that the charges were not pursued in the District Court and that the boat was being released. Prosecutions are a matter for the Attorney General and I have not yet received a report in the case.  I am concerned to ensure that fishing law is enforced and I will closely examine the circumstances when I get the report.  The Navy have been active in relation to sightings and boardings of fishing vessels in the Celtic Sea.  From May to October of this year 24 Dutch vessels were sighted and 19 were boarded, and 58 French vessels were boarded.  This is great evidence of the work of the Navy but no evidence of illegal fishing or illegal nets was found.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy referred to marketing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure they did.  That is the idea of boarding them.  In relation to marketing, huge landings of mackerel have been made this year and we must give BIM the credit for the fact that we have had no difficulty in selling them to Nigeria, for instance.  I understand that 350 people in Killybegs are engaged in the processing of this fish.  This is of great added value to this country.  I was criticised because of two appointments I made to BIM.  One was a good fisherman and the other was head of a fish processing firm which is a success both at home and abroad and I hope he will help to market our goods at home too.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Deasy asked if the regional boards had been set up, if the old boards had been abolished and if we have a headquarters.  I can only advise the Deputy to read the papers.  When we withdrew drift net licences in the Waterford area I can assure the Deputy that they were reduced but were not taken up last year although we had allowed terms for hardship cases.  I extended the fishing season in the Waterford area by a fortnight when the rest of the country only got an extra week.</P>
      <P>It has been a difficult year and my Department have been as active as any Department could be in helping the fishing industry.  Neither the lack of money or effort has hindered us in our work.  I would defy anyone to point to any delegation that has been more active or vocal than us at EEC level to promote our interests.  We have made the running in highlighting many problems and we will continue to do this as long as we have the responsibility.</P>
      <P>In the first seven months of this year the landings of fish by Irish fishermen amounted to 51,177 tons and the value was £14,909,938.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>During the same period in 1979 the landings were almost 36,000 tonnes and the value was £12.8 million. I assure the House that the value of landings of fish for 1980 will be an all-time record.  If Deputy Deasy feels that his forecast of a pretty miserable reading is correct, I will have a bet with him on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Treacy illustrated in his contribution that he is as anti-EEC now as he was when he purported to join the EEC.  The Deputy should join his Labour colleagues in Britain who are not alone anti-EEC but are also anti-common agricultural policy.  The Deputy mentioned that our policy has been one sell out after another, but I would put it on the record that there was only one sell out here and <Col N="1119" /> Fianna Fáil were not responsible for it. Hopefully this problem will be nearer a solution here after this week's work.</P>
    <P>In relation to unity here, I would appeal for unity in the fishing industry. Uninformed and unfounded criticism like we have had from the opposite benches is no great help.  During the past year we have worked for the good of the industry. We avoided taking any devisive measures and we did not set one group of fishermen against the other.  We have almost got to the stage in a European context where we will know exactly what quota of fish we will have and the species.  We hope in the near future to have our fishing grounds designated.  This will relieve us of much of the uncertainty that has bedeviled any forward planning in the industry.  It would be nice if we could show a united front here with regard to our fishing industry.</P>

      <P>Tairgim:</P>
      <P>Go ndeonófar suim fhorlíontach nach mó ná £10 chun íoctha an mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31ú lá de Nollaig, 1980, le haghaidh tuarastail agus costais Roinn na Gaeltachta, maille le deontais le haghaidh tithe agus ildeontais-i-gcabhair.</P>
      <P>Is é an príomhchuspóir atá leis an Meastachán Forlíontach seo ná £100,000 breise a chur ar fáil do na deontais a íocann mo Roinnse chun tithe a thógáil agus a fheabhsú ar fud na Gaeltachta.  Tá an soláthar £800,000 a rinneadh sa Mheastachán Bunaidh caite cheana féin i mbliana.  Is maith an comhartha é ar an dul chun cinn atá á dhéanamh sa Ghaeltacht nuair a bhíonn glaoch chomh mór sin ar na deontais tithíochta agus, dá réir sin, níl aon leisce ormsa teacht go dtí an Dáil chun tuilleadh airgid a fháil le freastal orthu.  Ar ndóigh, tá na deontais féin go maith freisin ó tháinig an Rialtas seo i gcumhacht.  Téann siad suas go £2,000 chun teach a thógáil, £750 chun teach a fheabhsú, £360 do chóras uisce, £300 do chóras séarachais, £600 do sheomra folctha le huisce te, £170 chun córas uisce nó séarachais a fheabhsú, £810 chun trí sheomra do chuairteoirí a chur le teach, agus £600 chun sealla saoire a thógáil.</P>
      <P>Is é mo thuairimse go bhfuil sárobair déanta faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltacht) le leathchéad bliain anuas agus go bhfuil moladh agus buíochas ag dul do na cigirí tithe agus dá gcúntóirí dá bharr sin.</P>
      <P>Is eol dúinn uile an tábhacht a bhaineann le cúrsaí tithíochta agus an meas a bhíonn ag muintir na tíre seo ar a gcuid tithe.  Ach tá tábhacht ar leith ag baint leis na tithe sa Ghaeltacht sa mhéid gur féidir leis na daoine ansin cur lena dteacht isteach trí chuairteoirí a choimeád i geaitheamh an tsamhraidh agus go háirithe cuairteoirí ar suim leo an Ghaeilge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Gan trácht ar dhaoine fásta, téann líon mór daltaí &mdash; breis agus 18,000 &mdash; chun na Gaeltachta gach bliain d'fhonn feabhas a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge agus teacht <Col N="1121" /> isteach ar bhlas agus líofacht nádúrtha na teanga trína gcaidreamh le cainteoirí dúchais.  Cuirtear cóir mhaith ar na cuairteoirí uile agus ní aon ionadh go mbítear ag maíomh go minic go bhfuil tithe na Gaeltachta inchurtha lena macasamhail i gceantar tuaithe ar bith sa tír.</P>
    <P>O tharla go bhfuil airgead breise ag teastáil do na deontais tithíochta glactar leis an deis chun an soláthar do chúpla cuspóir eile a mhéadú chomh maith.  Tháinig ardú i rith na bliana ar na liúntais taistil agus chothaithe agus, ina theannta sin, aistríodh foireann de chuid na Roinne go dtí oifig nua sna Forbacha i nGaeltacht na Gaillimhe.  Le freastal ar na héilimh éagsúla tá £10,010 á chur lena bhfuil i bhfo-mhírcheann B den Vóta.</P>
    <P>An t-aon mhéadú eile atá le déanamh baineann sé leis an deontas-i-gcabhair d'Údarás na Gaeltachta chun caiteachais riaracháin agus caiteachais i gcoitinne a íoc &mdash; fo-mhírcheann H.1.  Tá £70,000 breise á chur ar fáil d'arduithe pá nach raibh údaraithe i dtús na bliana ach a tháinig i bhfeidhm ó shin.</P>
    <P>Cé go bhfuil méaduithe dar luach £180,000 san iomlán luaite agam is féidir 180,000 a aistriú ó fho-mhírchinn eile. Tagann de sin nach bhfuil ach sium chomharthach £10 le vótáil, agus molaim don Teach é sin a dhéanamh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Níl morán agam le rá i dtaobh an Mheastacháin seo ach cuireann sé díomá orm nach bhfuil san Mheastachán aon ardú i gcóir teach nua a thógáil no córais uisce nó córais séarachais nó chun seallaí saoire a thógáil.  Tá a fhios ag an Aire go bhfuil ardú mór ar na costais chun iad sin a thógáil anois. Dúirt an tAire go bhfuil sí ag fáil bhreis airgid i gcóir Údarás na Gaeltachta.  An bhfuil an tAire sásta leis an tslí ina bhfuil Údarás na Gaeltachta ag dul agus ag obair?  An bhfuil sí sásta go bhfuil dlí nua déanta ag oifigigh an Údaráis nach bhfuil cead ag baill den Údarás bheith i láthair ag cruinniú den Údarás má tá siad ag caint i dtaobh monarchana ina ndúiche féin.  Measaim féin, más é sin an scéal, go mba cheart é a bheith scríofa san Acht nuair a bhí an tAcht ag dul os comhair na Dála.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1122" /> Le cúpla seachtain anuas chuir mé ceist no dhó ar an Aire cén fáth nach raibh tuarascáil Ghaeltarra Éireann nó Údarás na Gaeltachta ag teacht os comhair na Dála.  Tá a fhios ag gach éinne anois gur tháinig an tuarascáil inné agus cuireann sé díomá orm go ndúirt an t Ard-Reachtaire Cúntais agus Ciste in Alt 2 sna cúpla focal atá le rá aige i ndeireadh na tuarascála nach bhfuil sé sásta gur chuir Údaras na Gaeltachta nó Gaeltarra Éireann meas £12,000; 234 ar na monarchana agus a leithéid atá acu; deireann an Reachtaire Cúntais agus Ciste ina thuairim féin an figiúr ceart ná £313,483. Má tá difríocht mar sin idir oifigigh Údarás na Gaeltachta agus an Ard-Reachtaire Cúntais agus Ciste ba cheart don Aire a fháil amach dó féin ciocu acu atá ag labhairt na fírinne.</P>
    <P>Sé seachtain roimh an toghchán i nDún na nGall chuir me ceist ar an Aire cé mhéid airgid a fuaír gach monarcha, ciocu deontas nó scaireanna, le deich mbliana anuas?  Tá mé buíoch den Aire as an freagra a thug sí dom cé nach bhfuil an freagra scríofa isteach i dtuarascáil na Dála, ach ag eirí as an cheist sin, cuireann sé ana-ionadh ar fad orm, mar tá cailliúint 26 mhonarchana dúnta agus tá cailliúint oibre ag 160, ciocu fir nó mná iad, agus, ar an rud céanna, nuair a chuir mé na figiúirí go léile go mór mhór an t-airgead, tá caillte £2,151,823 mar dheontais agus £2,910,586 mar capital advances, níos mó na £5 mhilliún.  Má tá an scéal mar sin tá sé go huafásach ar fad ag Gaeltarra Eireann agus anois ag Udarás na Gaeltachta.  Measaim féin go gcaithfidh an tAire féachaint go géar ar gach rud atá ar siúl ag Údarás na Gaeltachta. Má tá an scéal chun leanúint mar a léas amach ó 1970 go dtí 1980, go bhfuil an oiread sin jobanna caillte agus go bhfuil an oiread sin airgid caite i leataobh, tá dualgas ar an Aire a fháil amach an fhírinne cén fáth go bhfuil an chailliúint chomh mór sin: an raibh an scrúdú ceart déanta sár a dtáinig na monarchana sin isteach sa tir ar dtús?</P>
    <P>Tá ionadh orm nach ndearna an tAire morán tagartha in a ráiteas do mhná tí na Gaeltachta ná na coláistí samhraidh ná an £10 deontas.  Tá a fhios agam féin go bhfuil cluais an Aire ag muintir na Gaeltachta <Col N="1123" /> i gcónaí, mar is cailín Ghaeltachta í agus tá a fhios aici nach mbeidh na mná tí ábalta na páistí a choimead as seo amach mura bhfuil árdú mór ar an deontas.</P>
    <P>Rud eile atá ag cur isteach orm &mdash; agus bhí sé seo á rá agam leis na blianta agus mé san Rialtas chomh maith le bheith san bhFreasúra &mdash;go gcaithfidh sí athbreithnuí a dhéanamh ar an £10 deontas do pháistí scoile.  Tá a fhios ag an Aire go bhfuil na páistí ábalta an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim i bhfad níos tapúla ná na tuismitheoirí. Nuair a bhíonn páistí ar scoil agus páiste amháin ag fáil an deontais agus páiste in aice leis, le Gaeilge níos fearr aige b'fhéidir, gan an £10 á fháil aige toisc nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge go líofa ag na tuismitheoirí, ní cothrom na féinne é sin.  Measaim féin an sórt criteria ba cheart a bheith ag an Aire ná an méid Gaeilge atá ag an páiste.  Mar is eol don Aire mar mhúinteoir scoile, nuair a thagann na páistí abhaile bíonn siad in ann focail nua a thabhairt do na tuismitheoirí nó focal Gaeilge a rá anseo is ansúd. Tá mé cinnte go bhfuil cuid de na tuismitheoirí ag foghlaim Gaeilge os na páistí tar éis teacht ón scoil.</P>
    <P>Tá obair thábhachtach á dhéanamh ag Bord na Gaeilge.  Measaim go bhfuil siad ag déanamh a ndíchill ach is mór an trua nuair a bhí an tAire ag ceapadh daoine do Bhord na Gaeilge nár chuir sí daoine ó gach stratum de society agus gach sórt polaitíochta ar an mbord.  Ní le Fianna Fáil an teanga Ghaeilge ach le muintir na tíre ar fad.  Uaireannta sna ráitis a thagann ó Bhord na Gaeilge tá sórt slant speisialta orthu agus tá me ag rá anois go poiblí le Bord na Gaeilge go gcaithfidh siad deireadh a chur lena leithéid.</P>
    <P>Tá an tAire ag déanamh a dhíchill ach nuair a bhí sí i Dún na nGall chonaic mé bóithre suas go tí amháin agus iad déanta faoi dheontas ó Roinn na Gaeltachta. Chonaic mé ana-chuid acu.  Nuair a chuir mé ceist ar an Aire faoin chás céanna i gCiarraí, is é an freagra a fuair mé ná, toisc nach raibh tí amháin sa mbóthar ní raibh sí ábalta aon deontas a thabhairt. Ba cheart an dlí céanna a bheith ann i <Col N="1124" /> gcóir Dún na Gall, Maigheo, Contae na Gaillimhe, Ciarraí, Port Láirge nó Corcaigh.</P>

      <P>Contae na Mí, agus Gaeilgeoirí Bhaile Átha Cliath is dócha.  Fáiltim arís roimh an Mheastachán Forliontach seo.  Tá mé ag rá leis an Aire go bhfuil job mór le déanamh aici le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta.  Ní fada uainn an t-am nuair a bheidh gá rud éigin a dhéanamh faoin Údarás.  San slí ina bhfuil siad ag obair faoi láthair níl siad ag déanamh aon ní do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>

      <NameTxt>Aire na Gaeltachta (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghlacadh leis an Teachta Begley as ucht labhairt anseo sa Dáil agus an Meastachán Forlíontach á phlé againn.  Glacaim mo bhuíochas leis as ucht an méid a bhí le rá aige, mar sílim i ndairíre go ndearna sé a phíosa cainte ar mhaithe liomsa mar Aire agus ar mhaithe le dul chun chinn na Gaeltachta agus nach raibh sé i gceist aige in aon bhealach a bheith contráilte ina chuid cainte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Chaith sé cuid mhaith dá chuid ama ag caint faoi Údarás na Gaeltachta féin agus an tslí ina raibh sé ag dul agus chuir sé ceist an raibh mé sásta an ceart go dtiocfadh tuarascáil na bliana seo caite amach an t-am seo den bhliain, agus mura raibh mé sásta an mbeadh rud éigin le rá agam faoi.  Tá sé ráite agam cheana go poiblí ar maidin inniu nach raibh mé sásta gur tháinig tuarascáil Ghaeltarra Éireann don bliain 1979 amac inné.  Luaigh mé é sin ag an gcéad chruinniú a bhí agam leis an Údarás nuair a cheapadh iad ag lús na bliana seo.  Dúirt mé ar an ócáid sin go raibh súil agam go mbeadh an tuarascáil ar fáil chomh luath agus ab fhéidir, go mbeadh sé chlóbhuailte agus go mbeadh seans agam é a chur faoi bhráid na Dála. Is féidir leis an Teachta Begley agus na Teachtaí eile glacadh leis go mbeidh mise ag caint leo aris mar gheall air sin, go mbeidh mo chuid díomá á chur in iúl agam dóibh chomh luath agus is féidir agus go bhfuil mé cinnte go mbeidh plé <Col N="1125" /> sonrach faoi ag an gcéad chruinniú eile a bhéas acu fiú amháin an tseachtain seo.</P>
    <P>Tá fadhbanna ar fud na Gaeltachta i gcúrsaí tionsclaíochta díreach mar atá ar fud na tíre ar fad, agus tá mise thar a bheith sásta nach bhfuil an céad chodán de na deacrachtaí atá sa Ghaeltacht níos airde san Ghaeltacht ná mar atá siad san chuid eile den tír.  Sílim gur toradh maith é sin, gur fiú dúinn a fheiceaál go bhfuil an tÚdarás ag déanamh a chuid gnótha maidir le tionsclaíocht agus fostaíocht a chur ar fáil san Ghaeltacht díreach chomh maith is atá an tÚdarás Forbartha Tionsclaíochta.</P>
    <P>Labhair an Teachta Begley faoi gur cheap sé go raibh dlí nua déanta ag an Udarás o tháinig siad i réim nach bhfeadfadh baill den Údaras fanacht ag an gcruinniú agus gnó ina ndúiche féin á phlé.  Sílim go bhfuil beagáinín dul amú ar an Uasal Begley agus ní dóigh liom i ndáiríre go ndearna sé é sin le diobháil a dhéanamh inniu ach tá alt &mdash; alt 8 ins an Acht a chur Udarás na Gaeltachta ar bun &mdash; a deireann &ldquo;má tá aon leas le baint ag comhalta den Údarás in aon chomhlacht a bhfuil beartaithe ag an Údarás conradh a dhéanamh leis nó a bhfuil siad ag déanamh comhaontú eile leis nó a bhfuil aon leas le baint aige i gconradh ná í gcomhaontú eile a bheartaíonn an tÚdarás a dhéanamh go gcaithfidh sé an leas sin a nochtú don Údarás ag an gcruinniú agus go gcaithfidh sé éirí as an gcruinniú agus gan aon bhaint nó aon phlé a bheith aige leis.

Dúirt mé é sin leis an Údarás nuair a cuireadh ar bun é ag tús na bliana seo.  Le fada de bhlianta ceapaim go rabhamar sásta nuair a fheicimís monarchana agus tionscail á dtabhairt isteach san Ghaeltacht agus fostaíocht áithrid á chur ar fáil ach sílim gur ceart dúinn a bheith ag breathnú ar chúrsaí forbartha tionsclaíochta san Ghaeltacht ar bhealach i bfhad níos fad-tearmaí ná mar a bhimís go dtí seo agus nach direach ceist postanna agus an líon postanna is féidir a chur ar fáil taobh istigh de bhliain nó dhá bhliain ach chomh fada agus a leanann na postanna sin ar aghaidh ar feadh go leor blianta agus go gcuireann siad fostaíocht lán aimsire ar fáil.</P>
      <P>Labhair an Teachta Begley faoi cheist na Roinne féin.  Labhair sé faoi na mná tí agus faoin deontas £10.  Nior luaigh mé iad nuair a bhí mé ag caint faoin meastachán forlíontach mar níl aon airgead breise á chur ar fáil san mheastachán seo do na mna tí ná don deontas £10.  Braitheann ardú do na mná tí ar an líon airgid a bhéas ar fáil i Meastachán Roinn na Gaeltachta don bhliain seo chugainn agus beidh plé againn faoi sin nuair a thiocfaidh Mí Eanair le cúnamh Dé.</P>

      <P>Tá mé ag déanamh macnaimh ghéar air.  Luaigh sé athbhreithiú a dhéanamh ar an slí ina reachtáiltear an deontas £10.  Mar atá a fhios ag an Teachta, ní raibh mise ná go leor daoine eile sásta go raibh seans á thabhairt do dhaoine &mdash; cuir i gcás ón nGaeltacht a phós duine as taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, b'fhéidir ó thaobh amuigh den tír nó pairt eile den tír nach raibh Gaeilge ó dhúchas acu &mdash; ní raibh mé sásta leis an gcaoi a raibh an deontas tithíochta á reachtáil acu agus mar sin i lár na bliana seo d'fhógraigh mé scéim nua, scéim ar a dthgtar scéim spreagadh na Gaeilge, agus sin chun labhairt na Gaeilge a chothú, chun chur faoi ndear do mhuintir na Gaeltachta gur fiú dóibh siúd nach bhfuil aon Ghaeilge acu faoi láthair, nó atá pósta san Ghaeltacht agus <Col N="1127" /> ina gconaí ann, an Ghaeilge a labhairt agus feabhas a chur air.  An chaoi a reach-táiltear an scéim ná go bhfaigheann siad an £1,000 ón Roinn Comhshaoil agus go mbíonn deis acu ansin taobh istigh de cheithre bliana cur isteach ar an gcuid eile den deontas a fháil ó Roinn na Gaeltachta. Má tá an cigire sásta go gcomhlíonann siad an choinníoll faoi labhairt na Gaeilge, go bhfuil feabhas tagtha ar an Ghaeilge agus go bhfuil an Ghaeilge go líofa acu anois nuair a chuireann siad isteach air, ansin cuirtear an deontas ar fáil doibh.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar an ócáid seo buíochas a ghlacadh le foireann Roinn na Gaeltachta a d'aistrigh dá ndeon féin gan aon bhrú orthu ó éinne, siar go hoifig nua na Roinne sna Forbacha.  Sílim go bhfuil ár mbuíochas agus ár moladh ag dul dóibh go ndearna siad é sin.  Séard atá beartaithe, ar ndóigh, ná ag deireadh thiar go mbeadh scéimeanna uile na Roinne á reachtáil nó an beartas a bheadh socraithe á chur i bhfeidhm as an ard oifig nua sna Forbacha.  Tá buíochas freisin, sílim, ag dul do mhuintir Chois Fharraige féin a chuir fáilte roimh oifig na Roinne nuair a chuaigh siad go dtí na Forbacha, díreach mar a chuir síad fáilte roimh Ghaeltarra Éireann nuair a d'aistrigh siad sin roinnt blianta o shin freisin.</P>
      <P>Tá Roinn na Gaeltachta anois ar leac an dorais ag muintir na Gaeltachta féin ach sílim nach bhfuil aon amhras ach gur chun tairbhe dóibh féin, do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, agus chun tairbhe d'oifigigh na Roinne a rachas an t-aistriú sin.</P>
      <P>Glacaim buíochas arís leis an Teachta Begley as ucht an méid a bhí le rá aige. Tá súil agam gur chun socair a rachaidh sé sin agus an méid a bhí le rá agam féin ní hé amháin don Údarás agus do Roinn na Gaeltachta ach freisin do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus tríthe sin do mhuintir na tíre ar fad.</P>

    <Title>Supplementary Estimates, 1980. - Vote 42: Industry, Commerce and Tourism.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1128" /> That a supplementary sum not exceeding £13,866,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1980, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain subsidies, grants and grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>The major factors giving rise to this Supplementary Estimate are the additional provision for capital expenditure by the Industrial Development Authority and the impact of the first phase of the agreement on pay policy within the framework of the second national understanding and of other increases on the pay elements of the expenditure by my Department and the many bodies under their aegis &mdash; those pay commitments could not have been foreseen when the Estimates were prepared originally.</P>
    <P>Some adjustments in the amounts provided for a few services operated by my Department are also necessary.  Under subhead A.1 &mdash; Salaries, Wages and Allowances &mdash; the sum of £127,000 sought is required to meet the cost of implementing the terms of the national understanding.  Although some unbudgeted for payments also arose on foot of special or grade awards which have been approved by the Department of the Public Service it was possible to meet those costs from savings within the subhead due to a delay-time factor in filling certain posts which yielded the necessary savings.</P>
    <P>Under subhead A.2 &mdash; Public Service Pensions &mdash; the additional sum is required to meet the cost of higher pensions because of the impact of grade awards on the level of pensions payable to the limited number of pensioners concerned and as provided for under subhead A.2.</P>
    <P>The additional £100,000 sought under subhead A.3 &mdash; Consultancy Services &mdash; is required to meet the cost of some consultancy projects which arose during the year and for which provision had not been made in the original Estimate. <Col N="1129" /> Another factor giving rise to the need for more funds is that there was a degree of carry-over of expenditure from 1979 due to a delay in receipt of claims for payment because of the effects of the postal dispute.</P>
    <P>The extra £160,000 under subhead B.1 &mdash; is required to meet the increased cost of air fares, subsistence rates and mileage allowances which have a significant impact on the expenditure under this Department which has such heavy commitments in relation to travel on EEC and other matters and in relation to prices inspectorate activities on price control.</P>
    <P>Under subhead B.2 &mdash; the additional £15,000 is required because of the need to replace obsolete machinery, the increased cost of machinery supplies and the need for some additional items of equipment.</P>
    <P>In regard to subhead C.1 &mdash; Post Office Services &mdash; due to the postal dispute there was a &ldquo;carry over&rdquo; of some £37,000 from 1979.  The balance of £25,500 is required to meet the increased cost of telephones, telex, telegrams and postage from 1 July 1980.</P>
    <P>In the tourism area, the House will be aware of the many difficulties faced by the industry this year.  Many factors, at home and abroad combined to produce a dampening effect on travel.  The impact of the deepening economic recession and political uncertainty in many of our main markets, was exacerbated by industrial unrest at home which interrupted services by our air and sea carriers with a resultant loss of business.  The industry responded well to the challenges facing it by drawing up a range of initiatives and special offers designed to regain lost bookings and generate new business in the remainder of the season and into 1981.</P>
    <P>This type of positive response was essential if the industry was to capitalise on the late booking pattern trend which was evidenced in many countries this year with holidaymakers not deciding until late in the season where they would go. The Government showed their confidence in the ability of Bord Fáilte with the support of the rest of the industry to win their share of an increasingly competitive <Col N="1130" /> market by providing the funds to finance the additional promotional programme.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that this confidence was not misplaced.  While it is still too early to predict the final outcome for the year, preliminary indications are that total revenue from out-of-State tourism and home holidays will be in the region of £540 million as against £465 million last year.  This represents an increase of 16 per cent in revenue or a drop in real terms of not more than 2 per cent on 1979 which, it must be remembered, was our best year ever for tourism.  An even better outturn might have been expected but for the further setback occasioned by the recent disruption of petrol supplies.  The Government's prompt action in making arrangements for supplies to out-of-State tourists helped offset the worst effects of this and restore confidence as a tourist destination.  Research carried out by Bórd Fáilte during the peak months shows that tourists were happy with their holiday and would like to pay a return visit.  Resistance to price became evident during the year and I am confident that as a result of industry-wide discussions which have taken place under the aegis of Bord Fáilte there will be a determined effort for 1981 to contain price increases as much as possible.  I am sure this will give a positive boost to tourism in 1981.</P>
    <P>The special promotional and marketing programmes necessary to overcome the problems which beset the industry all cost money.  The net cost amounted to an additional provision this year of £300,000 to which must be added the cost of salary increases to which I referred in my opening comments, producing the total sum of £532,000 now required.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £825,500 for administration and general expenses is being provided to the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards under subhead F.1 to meet the cost of the national understanding and other special salary awards.</P>
    <P>On subhead H.1, the original Estimate provided £7,975,000 towards the grant-in-aid for Córas Tráchtála, who now need an additional £87,700.</P>
    <P>Of the £87,700 now being sought, <Col N="1131" /> £64,700 is required to meet increased pay costs following on the recent national understanding and £19,000 is in respect of certain grade pay awards as recommended in the Devlin Review report. The balance of £4,000 is needed to meet increased expenditure caused by the increased cost of employers' pay related social insurance contributions.</P>
    <P>In 1979, Irish exports reached the highest volume and value levels ever recorded.  Total export value rose by 18.1 per cent over 1978.  In the first nine months of 1980 the total value was up 21.6 per cent on the corresponding period in 1979 and the prospects are that the out-turn for 1980 will measure up to Córas Tráchtála's target for the year, that is, £4,200 million.</P>
    <P>The House is well aware of the most vital importance of exports to the national economy.  Our ability to increase the national wealth and to increase and maintain employment opportunities depends to a large extent on a sustained expansion in our exporting activity.  The House is also well informed of the part played by Córas Tráchtála in attaining the present satisfactory state of our export activity.  I have no doubt that Deputies will agree that there can be no diminution in the service which Córas Tráchtála offers to our exporters, particularly at a time of worldwide recession. Likewise, there must be pay levels maintained for the staff of Córas Tráchtála consistent with movements in pay levels generally throughout the public sector.</P>
    <P>On subhead H.2, the Estimate for 1980 provided £549,000 grant-in-aid for Kilkenny Design Workshops Limited.  An additional amount of £65,000 is now required to enable the company to meet their financial commitments for 1980.</P>
    <P>Of this sum, £11,000 is needed to cover wage and salary costs arising from the implementation of the first phase of the 1980 national understanding.</P>
    <P>The remaining £54,000 is needed for general expenditure, the principal item being the cost of the Designer Development and Irish Book Design Award Schemes.  Both schemes are aimed at increasing in a positive way the level of <Col N="1132" /> design and design awareness in Ireland. The Designer Development Award Scheme helps our most promising young designers broaden their experience, while the Irish Book Design Award Scheme creates a greater appreciation among publishers and the public of the need for high design standards.</P>
    <P>On subhead I.1, the original allocation to the Industrial Development Authority for administration and general expenses for 1980 was £10.569 million.  An additional £631,000 is required to meet the Authority's current expenditure needs; £161,000 is to meet the cost this year of the first phase of the recent national understanding and £320,000 is in respect of the cost of special pay increases.  The balance of £150,000 relates to a special promotional programme being undertaken as part of the Government's proposals under the national understanding for the acceleration of job creation.</P>
    <P>On subhead I.2, the original allocation for the IDA capital grant-in-aid for 1980 was £145 million.  An extra £11.7 million is now being provided.  Of this, £4.2 million is to cover the cost of additional job creation and job maintenance measures which are being implemented in line with the Government's commitment under the national understanding.  These measures comprise the intensification of the IDA's advance factory and site acquisition programmes and proposals aimed at the rescue or replacement of firms in difficulty. the balance of £7.5 million is the result of a more rapid investment than expected by industrial promoters in fixed assets, with the consequent rise in claims for the reimbursement of eligible expenditure.</P>
    <P>On subhead J.1, the Estimate for 1980 provided £815,000 grant-in-aid for administration and general expenses for the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited.  An additional £59,500 is required in the current year.</P>
    <P>Of this amount, £34,500 is required to meet wage and salary costs arising from the implementation of the first phase of the 1980 National Understanding and certain special grade awards.</P>
    <P>The remaining £25,000 is being used to intensify industrial promotional activity <Col N="1133" /> as provided for in the national understanding.</P>
    <P>Under subhead K.2, £805,000 was provided in the original Estimate for credit financing of capital goods exports.  This relates to the scheme which provides export credit finance at concessionary interest rates, currently ranging from 7.75 per cent to 8.75 per cent, for exports of goods of a capital nature manufactured in Ireland.  This scheme is operated by the associated banks in conjunction with the export credit insurance scheme and with the aid of an interest relief which is provided out of voted moneys.  The amount of this interest rate compensation depends on the amount of export credit finance drawn down by exporters and on the gap to be bridged between the concessionary interest rates charged to exporters &mdash; 7¾ per cent to 8¾ per cent &mdash; and the cost of funds to the banks. Due to the world-wide increase in market interest rates from mid-1979 to mid-1980, the gap to be bridged by way of subsidy increased from 6-6½ per cent to 10½-11½ per cent, which gives rise to a resultant increase of £232,900 in the subsidy amount paid to the banks.</P>
    <P>Despite the adverse movement in market interest rates over the past few years, my commitment to fostering exports of capital goods is evidenced by the increase in recent years in interest rate compensation paid to the banks under the export credit finance scheme &mdash; from £101,000 in 1978 to over £1 million in the current year.  Since mid-1980 the interest gap to be bridged has narrowed due to (i) a 5 per cent to 0.75 per cent increase in concessionary rates which came into effect on 1 July 1980; (ii) a substantial reduction of 3½ per cent in market rates due to three successive decreases in the bank's lending rates.</P>
    <P>However, as the above changes occurred after 30 June 1980, this welcome development does not affect the subsidy amount being paid to the banks in 1980, as payments are made on the phased basis of six-monthly periods in arrears.</P>
    <P>On subhead O.1, the additional £191.200 is required to enable payment to be made of a further instalment of a <Col N="1134" /> subsidy to Verolme Cork Dockyard in respect of the loss incurred by the yard on the costruction of the B &amp; I carferry <i>Connacht.</i></P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, subsidies have been paid from time to time to the yard in respect of ships on which the company had incurred a loss.</P>
    <P>In regard to subhead P &mdash; Irish Goods Council &mdash; the intensification of the use of domestic products and services formed part of the Government's commitments in the proposals for the second national understanding.  For this reason it is now proposed that an extra £203,000 be made available to the Irish Goods Council for the intensification of the programme for the promotion of Irish goods.  Together with some savings from within the subhead the council will have about £270,000 to devote to an intensive promotion of Irish-made products in the vital buying period up to Christmas.</P>
    <P>The council's main promotional emphasis is in the area of public advertising reaching mass audiences through the media of television, radio, newspapers and a nationwide outdoor poster campaign.</P>
    <P>The second main area of emphasis is in the retail sector where a significantly improved commitment to Irish manufacturers has been secured in recent months.</P>
    <P>The pace of industrial import substitution is also being stepped up considerably. Additional personnel are being recruited to increase the calling rate on industry and three further industrial import exhibitions have been arranged before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>On subhead O &mdash; Miscellaneous Payments &mdash; the original Estimate made provision for expenditure of £19,690 in relation to prepackaged goods average weight inspections.  A further £28,000 is needed now in respect of an activity of a kindred nature, as we were obliged to set up a service for the examination of weighing machines manufactured in this country and intended for export to Germany. Such machines are not acceptable on the German market unless they bear the stamp of EEC initial verification.  It is intended that the service should be selffinancing <Col N="1135" /> by way of a fee charged for the service.</P>
    <P>Subhead R.1 refers to the bread subsidy. The amount already allocated for the bread subsidy for the current year is £14 million.  There had been a gradual increase in the consumption of standard bread by the public.  This, together with the &ldquo;carry forward&rdquo; for payment in 1980 of 1979 claims delayed by the postal dispute, has resulted in an excess estimated to amount to £325,000 in the current year for which provision is now necessary.</P>
    <P>On subhead Y &mdash; Currency Exchange Loss on Certain Industrial Credit Company Foreign Borrowings for Industrial Development &mdash; the supplementary provision of £9,000 under this subhead is to cover the cost to the Exchequer of the exchange loss arising from foreign borrowings by the Industrial Credit Company who on-lend for fixed asset investment by small and medium-sized firms. In any year in which there is a gain on these borrowings the exchange gain is paid to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The total amount of the increased expenditure is £15,356,300 but there is an offset of £1,222,000 in savings mainly made up of £700,000 on subhead E.2 &mdash; Development of Holiday Accommodation &mdash; which arose due to certain difficulties encountered by the grantees, including problems with planning permissions, difficulties in arranging loans and some uncertainty about tourist trade, with the result that the planned developments did not take place to the extent that payments could be claimed this year; £332,000 on subhead O.2 &mdash; Interest subsidy to Shipping Finance Corporation Limited, mainly because a shipbuilding order which was expected to be placed in 1980 did not materialise &mdash; the level of the corporation's financing for shipbuilding and, consequently, the interest subsidy which would arise therefrom was not as high as originally anticipated.  Other savings on the voted provision includes £65,000 on subhead G &mdash; Subscriptions to International Organisations; £75,000 on subhead R.2 &mdash; Flour and Wheatenmeal subsidy and £50,000 on subhead T.2 &mdash; Administration expenses for the Irish <Col N="1136" /> Film Board, which will not be operative this year.</P>
    <P>There will also be a surplus of £268,300 in appropriations-in-aid, mainly arising from increased receipts under the Patents and Trade Marks Acts &mdash; £172,500 &mdash; because of higher fees having been introduced; extra receipts &mdash; £35,000 &mdash; under the Export Guarantee Premiums scheme due to increased volume of business and £36,000 repayment of travel costs of certain EEC journeys.  The net amount needed is, therefore, £13,866,000.</P>
    <P>I have explained in the case of each subhead the reason for the increased expenditure but, if Deputies wish to raise any points in relation to them, I shall deal with them as far as possible in my reply.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate we are discussing represents an increase of approximately 7 per cent on the original Estimate.  I understand that by next week we will have dealt with a sum in excess of £450 million in Supplementary Estimates.</P>
      <P>The device of Supplementary Estimate has always been used in cases of extreme circumstances where unforeseen additional expenses have arisen in the running of a Department during the year in question. However, when one notes the total money involved in Supplementary Estimates now before the House one wonders about the relevance of budgets.  We are witnessing the abuse of a traditional device to validate over-expenditure in Departments.  The amounts being sought now by way of this device should have been foreseen when budgeting for the year.  It is my belief that had these additional sums figured in the debate on the budget that debate would have been much different.  I must express by strong objection to the provisions made in budgets because they are not credible and do not provide adequately for the services the Government consider necessary.  The device of the Supplementary Estimate has been badly abused this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his speech dealt with the subheads that relate to his Department. The additional sums sought are for <Col N="1137" /> laudable reasons.  They are mainly due to extra expenditure incurred under the terms of the national understanding.  In my innocence I assumed that the drafting of the 1980 Budget took into account to some extent the effects of the national understanding on the Exchequer.  However, it appears that the people who attended the series of meetings at Barrettstown House, which are being repeated this year, were far off the mark with regard to the expenditure arising as a result of the national understanding. Now an enormous amount of money is being sought to cover that extra charge. It is mainly because of the national understanding that we are now faced with this extraordinarily large amount.  At the moment money is being passed through this House like confetti.  A device that was to be used in extreme circumstances of unavoidable expenditure is being abused totally.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to subhead A.1 which deals with salaries, wages and allowances.  The sum of £127,000 is required to meet the cost of implementing the terms of the national understanding.</P>
    <P>Under subhead A.2 &mdash; Public Service Pensions &mdash; the additional sum is required to meet the cost of higher pensions. It should have been foreseen to some degree that there would be extra funds needed under this subhead.  Under subhead A.3 &mdash; Consultancy Services &mdash; I would like the Minister to outline the services sought under this subhead, the experts who were consulted and under what headings they sought the consultants' advice.</P>
    <P>Under subhead B.1&mdash;Travelling and Incidental Expenses&mdash;the Minister pointed out, and rightly so in this case, that the personnel in his Department travel substantial mileage because of the nature of the work, apart altogether from EEC membership.  They are expected to travel on promotional work abroad and this seems to be on the increase, together with the actual extra cost involved in the area of fares and so on.  Has the provision of the executive jet diminished the cost involved in travelling for members of the Department or for the Minister? I assume <Col N="1138" /> that the provision of this aeroplane was to reduce the cost of travelling expenses for Government personnel and senior officials and I would like to know if this has happened.</P>
    <P>Under subhead C.1&mdash;Post Office Savings&mdash;there has been a carry over from 1979 because of industrial action.  Under subhead E.1&mdash;Bord Fáilte Éireann&mdash;the Minister referred at length to the difficulties which confronted the tourist industry, something his junior Minister, Deputy Meaney, would not accept earlier today.  I will leave it to my colleague, Deputy Hegarty, to refer to this in his contribution.</P>
    <P>Under subhead F.1&mdash;Institute for Industrial Research and Standards&mdash;I recall looking at the Estimate under this subhead earlier this year and mentioning that the increase was minimal.  I said this was not on and that the Minister would be back seeking more money.  Again I assume this was another effort by the Minister for Finance to show what he could do with figures and we are now paying the price in that the Minister directly involved, Deputy O'Malley, had to come back to this House and seek additional funds for IIRS.</P>
    <P>Under subhead H.1&mdash;Córas Tráchtála&mdash;I, too, would like to compliment Córas Tráchtála on their work and the approach they adopt in helping industrialists here.  A new development which took place was the establishment of regional offices throughout the country and I would impress on the Minister, as I did at the time of the announcement of their establishment, to get them to concentrate on assistance to the smaller industrial unit.  Rightly or wrongly, in the past there has been an idea abroad that the services of Córas Tráchtála were available more to the bigger industries. This may not have been so but this impression went abroad, possibly because the bigger industries, because of the number of personnel they had available for promotional work, were more in touch with the activities of Córas Tráchtála than the smaller units.  For that reason it seems to many people that Córas Tráchtála were leaning more towards the bigger exporting unit than the smaller <Col N="1139" /> unit.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the system as it now operates one sees it is loaded against the smaller unit.  Take a ten-man industrial unit producing a commodity which could be saleable and competitive on the export market.  One person in that industry could be dealing full-time with Córas Tráchtála and other agencies for the promotion and sale of that commodity.  That is 10 per cent of the total staff.  But in a much larger unit a whole section could be dealing full-time with this work and they are budgeted for in the costings of that commodity.</P>
    <P>As things stand the smaller unit in the case of sales, exports, promotions and so on, do not have the same chance to make the impact they ought to be making as the bigger unit.  The same thing applies to Government contracts where there is a great deal of paper work involved. Again, 10 per cent of the staff&mdash;one in ten&mdash;or 20 per cent of the total staff&mdash;one in five&mdash;could be employed full-time on this kind of work.</P>
    <P>Small industries cater for 40 per cent of the total work force, but I wonder if they get 40 per cent of the cake being divided by the Government.  That might be an over-simplification, but the idea must be in people's minds that, as things stand and because of the enormous amount of form filling, dealing with Government Departments and so on that has to be done&mdash;grant applications, tendering and so on&mdash;the small firms do not have the time or the staff to concentrate on that area and they are left out in the cold whan it comes to getting their appropriate share of the cake, which should be roughly 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>Subhead H.2 deals with the Kilkenny Design Workshops Limited.  This company constitutes one of the success stories in this country.  As chairman of the Public Accounts Committee this year I had the privilege of visiting the workshops in Kilkenny along with other members of the Committee.  One could not but be impressed by the enthusiasm with which both management and workers go about their business.  They have a pride in their work, which is creative and of a very high <Col N="1140" /> standard.  As everybody in this House is aware, that agency has become a household name in design, something of which we are very proud.  Indeed, they have done themselves proud in the way in which they have approached the job in hand and have also done this country proud through their contacts internationally.</P>
    <P>I find myself in great difficulty endeavouring, on the one hand, to point out that the beneficiaries of additional moneys are all worthy of that allocation while on the other hand, objecting to the fact that we did not do our sums correctly in this year's budget.  Indeed, I would say without fear of contradiction that this shortfall, which it now transpires is substantial, was put there deliberately to camouflage the shortcomings of the budgetary policies adopted earlier this year.</P>
    <P>Subhead I.1 deals with the Industrial Development Authority's administration and general expenses while subhead 1.2 deals with their capital expenditure. This body goes about their work in a way which leaves many other agencies in other countries very jealous of them.  I heard a representative of the Industrial Development Agency in Scotland say this recently on radio.  The IDA have a long history of success behind them.  Reading Mr. Killeen's statement yesterday the unfortunate thing about the IDA is that, despite their best efforts and the fact that they will fulfil their job creation target for this year, we will still find ourselves in a nett job loss situation at the end of this year.  This is no reflection on the efforts of the IDA.  Rather it is something that has come about through circumstances many of which are within the power of the Government to resolve.  The stock answer given by the Government side concerning any figures raised on this side of the House in relation to falling output, rising unemployment or inflation is that they are caused by the international recession.  This is not an adequate response to our current economic crisis. We now have 116,000 people unemployed in this country, that number seasonally adjusted.</P>
    <P>I was given information in this House <Col N="1141" /> this week about the various IDA regions, the increased job losses region by region. It makes very depressing reading and is something the Government appear to be ignoring at present.  Yesterday in this House I was given a long reply to a parliamentary question about the specific measures taken this year to arrest the decline in employment over the past 11 months.  Despite the provisions made available and the specific measures taken to correct this decline, the fact is that these measures do not seem to have met with any great degree of success.  We find ourselves in a situation now in which job losses occur at the rate of 4,000 per month.  Yet there is no obvious recognition on the part of the Government of this very serious trend.  One wonders how long it must continue before real creative action is taken, action that will be corrective and be seen to be corrective, which will halt this terrible haemorrhage causing such human tragedy around this country.</P>
    <P>We are now approaching Christmas. There are thousands and thousands of families in which the breadwinner has been either made redundant or has been on systematic short time for the past two, three, six or 12 months, and there is no hope of any improvement in that position. This is the serious aspect of this problem.  Even more serious is the fact that it would seem there is no recognition given to this crisis in industry.  Many warnings have been given by the FUE, the CII, exporters and all the agencies involved in industrial output in this country. For example, earlier this year there were pleas for some form of recognition of the difficulties, when the response was an imposition of tax on industry alone, an increase of 40 per cent.  In a situation in which increased production costs are costing us jobs in the export market, in which we become less and less competitive, if that is the kind of response we get from a Government who have given voice to expressions of concern but nothing else it is regrettable and of no help to the industry concerned.</P>
    <P>The IDA will fulfil their target for this year; 35,000 jobs will be created.  I might be permitted to mention one thing in <Col N="1142" /> relation to the figures produced by the IDA.  There is a certain amount of confusion caused in the minds of many people in regard to how this information is presented.  Here I speak of job creation as against jobs on the ground.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Keating has been given permission by the Ceann Comhairle to raise on the adjournment the question of the application for political asylum of a person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me permission to raise this issue.  I do so because it is an urgent and a humanitarian matter relating to a student, a Mr. Rassouli, who is an applicant for political asylum here.  I met this man on two occasions and I was impressed with his presentation of his case. Although I do not profess to have at my fingertips the data and facts, which are perhaps available to the Minister, I see here the need for the most sympathetic decision possible in relation to his application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raise the matter in this form because of the urgency of it.  This young man is a student.  I have had some words with his lecturer, who will endorse my request for sympathetic consideration.  He has been living in Ireland for about three years. During that time he has been a good student and a good worker while he was working.  Unfortunately, the turmoil in his home country and the former relatively high ranking civil service position which his father had prior to the recent regime means that there is a degree of odium attaching to his family at present in Iran.  This means he is extremely concerned about his welfare if he is deported or asked to return to his home country. This is added to because the current Iran-Iraq war has meant the devastation of his home city, Abadan.  The last word this man has heard from his parents is a telegram about three weeks ago from a <Col N="1143" /> point hundreds of miles from his home indicating that the family are refugees.</P>
    <P>This young man has made friends and has settled into the local environment very well.  His knowledge of the English language, his acceptance in the College of Technology and his acceptance by his fellow students, so far as I am able to judge in these matters, indicate that he would integrate very rapidly into the local community.  The urgency is added to by the fact that he did not conform to the necessary regulations in relation to his passport or work permit.  I asked him about this and he told me that the reason for this was that he was afraid to enter into discussions with the relevant embassy based in London, because he felt that, arising from such discussions or involvement with the embassy, the question of deportation could be raised or he might be refused a reissue of his passport and might have to go home.</P>
    <P>This young man is about 20 years of age and is alone in this country as far as relations are concerned.  It was hard enough not to feel sympathy with his cause in the manner in which he presented his case.  I accept that the Minister, in assessing the request for political asylum, must refer to issues other than sympathy and humanitarian concern.  I believe there is, from what I have been told, a reasonable possibility that if this young man is sent back to his home country he will be incarcerated or worse.  I do not believe anybody in this House would wish to be associated with locking the door of welcome in this country, which could result in that situation.  In all the circumstances, I ask the Minister to sympathetically assess this application.</P>
    <P>There is, as the Minister knows, a dimension to this that I am not entitled to go into in the House.  I can only say that the need for a decision is urgent otherwise there will be, at the very least, a gaol sentence involved here for the omissions that I referred to earlier, which could be avoided if the decision is in the affirmative.  I understand that his father was dismissed from the post he held and that the family's property has been confiscated. There is reasonable evidence <Col N="1144" /> because of this and the young man's virtual exile from the city of his birth that his family are <i>persona non grata</i> in his own country.</P>
    <P>He is not merely somebody who has come here in the last few weeks or months.  When I discussed this matter with him last night on the telephone I suggested he should do everything possible to assure the respective Government Departments that he is willing to comply to the letter with every aspect of the immigration requirements.  He has already endeavoured to put his passport situation in order.  This would facilitate a work permit.  Mr. Rassouli is virtually penniless as he has not been able to work. I believe that if he were granted political asylum a job would be available for him. His studies would continue and from the information I have I believe he would be successful.  I believe that in the circumstances an act of humanitarian generosity would have been accomplished.</P>
    <P>Many Irish people have had to leave their country over the centuries and were welcomed by other countries.  Many of them became immersed in the politics, the social life and the commercial life of those countries.  I believe we have a responsibility to our fellow man, regardless of from what part of the world he or she comes, to treat those people likewise. There is a strong likelihood if he is not given political asylum of a most unpleasant fate awaiting this boy.  I do not believe any of us would wish that.  I ask the Minister to be good enough to give this matter top priority and to accept my plea that Mr. Rassouli is granted political asylum and is naturalised.  I have no doubt he would become a most useful and happy member of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The relevant facts are as follows.  The boy, as Deputy Keating refers to him, is a man of 29 years.  He came to this country from Britain in 1977 after he was refused permission to stay there.  He was admitted here for a stay of six months on the basis that he was accepted for a course of study at a college.  He subsequently obtained an extension.  The information available suggests that he did not make <Col N="1145" /> much progress at his studies.  His Iranian passport expired at the end of 1978.  He was told at that stage by my Department that he would have to have his passport renewed and that he should produce evidence that he could support himself here. He has not done either.  He has been prosecuted by the Garda for working here without a permit from the Minister for Labour and for staying here without permission.  He was convicted on both charges in the District Court and sentenced to imprisonment.  He has appealed and the appeal is at hearing.  He called to my Department on 4 December and said that he was seeking political asylum and that application is being considered. In fairness, since the matter in the way it has been raised here would suggest that I or my Department are acting unreasonably&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts as known so far to me do not appear to constitute a case for asylum.  There is no question of his being deported or being otherwise required to leave, at least until the matter is considered thoroughly.  I give that assurance to the Deputy that it will be considered thoroughly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>How long does the Minister reckon that will take?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The judges said on appeal, which was heard on 8 December, that he would confirm the sentences from 19 December unless the defendant got political asylum, so I think the decision will have to be made before 19 December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to parse and analyse everything <Col N="1146" /> said by Deputy Keating about the said Mr. Rassouli but I want to say that probably I would be accused of nit-picking and that would be wrong too.  The man in question did get on a course at the NIHE and the Garda have been told by the people in NIHE that his attendance record was exceptionally bad.  I would like to say further, because the impression was given that he is a very dedicated student&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that he was in Bolton Street now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be crossing the Deputy's t's dotting his i's. That may not be the proper thing to do but it would be wrong to give the impression that he was a very dedicated student, because the NIHE would not have him back to continue his studies there.  Then, of course, he came to the College of Technology in Bolton Street for the year 1979-80 but I am informed by the Garda that he was unsatisfactory in that college, too.  Indeed, it is fair to say also, for fear that the impression would be given that the Department of Justice were going to lay their big, heavy hands on a boy of 29 years of age who is studying well&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>He does not look 29.  It was at one of his own lectures in Bolton Street that he came to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Whoever came to the Deputy, I can only tell what the police advised me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>They would have to have a very intimate knowledge of a situation such as this.  The implication of the Deputy's surprise could be teased out but I do not want to go into that now. <Col N="1147" /> The young man himself in May 1980 gave his reasons for not being a successful student to the Department when he called to see us.  He spent most of his time travelling to and from the UK, he said, to meetings with other Iranians who were involved actively in the Shah's downfall. This is information from the young man himself.</P>
      <P>All the factors will be considered by me when a decision has to be made on the question of political asylum.  He was prosecuted by direction of the Garda who did not consult with me and who would not have to consult with me in the matter. On 22 September he was convicted in the District Court and sentenced to two consecutive terms of three months imprisonment for (1) working without a permit, (2) overstaying his permitted stay in the State.  As I have said, maybe there are many pieces of information that Deputy Keating did not have.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there are areas of south Tipperary where the free travel scheme does not operate either because of the absence of public transport or the unwillingness of private bus operators in those areas to participate in the scheme.  My Department have been in touch with all private operators in the State with a view to ensuring their participation in the scheme.  On a number of occasions in recent years my Department wrote to a private bus operator in south Tipperary inviting him to participate in the scheme but these invitations were not accepted. Nevertheless, I have again instructed my Department to invite all such private bus operators who provide regular scheduled services on a year round basis to reconsider participation in the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to operate the free travel <Col N="1103" /> scheme in areas not catered for by bus and rail services and I cannot, of course, compel any bus operator to provide a service under the free travel scheme.  I should, however, mention that persons in such areas may, if their means are not sufficient to meet their travel needs, qualify for assistance with their special travel costs under the Health or Supplementary Welfare Allowances Acts as appropriate.</P>
    <P>The provision of an estimate of the number of people in south Tipperary who do not at present benefit from the free transport scheme is not, I regret to say, feasible in view of the fact that records are not kept on a geographical basis.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 299 and 300 together.</P>
      <P>With a view to ensuring that candidates have attained a certain standard of education, the qualifications prescribed for certain recruitment grades of offices in the local authority service, including the offices of clerical officer, require candidates to have obtained at least grade D or a pass in a specified number of subjects in the leaving certificate examination or to have passed an examination of equivalent standard.</P>
      <P>In accordance with directions given under article 8 of the Local Government (Appointment of Officers) Regulations, 1974, local authorities may select candidates for appointment as clerical officer by either</P>
      <P>(a)  holding their own competitive examination, or</P>
      <P>(b)  on the basis of the results attained by candidates in the leaving certificate examination.</P>
      <P>In practice most local authorities, including Donegal County Council, favour the latter method of selection.  In the case of selection on the basis of leaving certificate results the names of qualified candidates are placed on a panel in the order of the aggregate points attributable to them in respect of their grades or marks in</P>
      <P>(a)  Mathematics and Irish or English, or</P>
      <P>(b)  Irish, English and Mathematics</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>at that examination and an interview where applicable.  I understand that Donegal County Council have received a large number of applications in a competition, which they are now holding, for <Col N="1107" /> appointment as clerical officer.  Results obtained in examinations other than the leaving certificate may not be taken into consideration in determining a candidate's place on a panel.</P>
    <P>I am reasonably satisfied that the foregoing arrangements offer the best method of selecting the most suitable persons for appointment to offices such as that of clerical officer, recruitment to which is aimed mainly at second level school leavers.  I have no proposals to change the existing arrangements.  These arangements apply to offices under local authorities for which I am the appropriate Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware.</P>
      <P>Donegal County Council, in common with all other local housing authorities, are obliged in accordance with regulations made under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979, to ensure that houses let by them are maintained in good tenantable condition and repair. For the purpose of meeting the maintenance and management costs of their rented estates, the authorities may retain all rental income and a proportion &mdash; 45 per cent in 1980 &mdash; of all proceeds of sales of houses to tenants.  The Exchequer meets in full the loan charges incurred by authorities in the provision of houses for renting which this year amounted to £62 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, therefore, a matter for Donegal County Council to use the moneys available to them to carry out normal repair and maintenance works on their rented dwellings at no extra cost to the tenants <Col N="1108" /> and I consider that the funds at their disposal are sufficient to enable a reasonable programme of repair and maintenance to be carried out on an annual basis.</P>

    <P>It will be appreciated that the area served by the stations in the Dublin County Borough is not coterminous with the borough itself.</P>
    <P>As regards the number of gardaí assigned to traffic duty in Dublin, the position is that there is a special Traffic Department based at Dublin Castle which has primary responsibility for traffic control in the Dublin Metropolitan Area but, in addition, uniformed members of the force at all stations perform traffic duties as and when required. Accordingly, it would be misleading to give figures in relation to the number of gardaí assigned exclusively to traffic duties in the area as these take no account <Col N="1109" /> of the input by other uniformed members of the force.</P>
    <P>Prior to the introduction of traffic signals in O'Connell Street, Dublin, in February 1977, 16 gardaí were required each day for point duty at the traffic intersections in the street.</P>

      <P>Detailed traffic information in connection with Dún Laoghaire Corporation's outline proposals for the Black-rock by-pass, stage II, was received in my Department on 1 September last and a clarificatory communication was received on 26 September.  Following examination of this information, discussions on the project were held at engineering level on 11 November in the course of which it was established that the outline proposals submitted by the corporation might require modification to avoid possible adverse traffic and environmental effect in residential roads within the influence of the by-pass.  Dún Laoghaire Corporation engineers agreed at the meeting to carry out further technical analyses essential to examination of the proposals. Confirmation of the agreement reached at the meeting was sent to the corporation in a letter from my Department dated 25 November.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that there has been no undue delay on the part of my Department in dealing with this matter.</P>
